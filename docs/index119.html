I'm trying to contact Kimono Girl about her LB K9 patch that she sells.  
Can't seem to contact her via AQ, so Ish suggested this group.

                        Hey everyone, looking to see if Chicago could be a possible place for the LB CON 2, and we are looking for helpers and what not.

What are your opinions/suggestions/comments.
thanks
shorty
