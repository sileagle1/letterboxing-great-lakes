Looking through the logbook for the second box we found, I noticed that the finders had listed that day's date.  Then I noticed their note about "found this while in port on our cruise."  I turned to Deedle - there was only one cruise ship in port that day - "There are other letterboxers on our cruise!!!"  Oh, but the agony of how to find them on our ship!  The next day's port was in Bar Harbor, and we had only printed clues to one box since that's all we thought we'd have time to look for.  We were going to leave them a note in that logbook, because we assumed that they would be looking for that box,<br>
 too, but alas, the area was too crowded and if the box was there it was hidden REALLY well and we weren't able to search for it long enough without looking a little suspicious.  And we didn't think we'd have any time to find any boxes in our third port of Halifax.  But once back home I found their profile on AtlasQuest and sent them a message, and sure enough, the confirmed we had been on the same boat.<br>

Lesson learned?  Not sure.  Maybe next time we go on a cruise, we'll put the LbNA logo on our stateroom door to let people know that letterboxers are staying there!<br>

So last week Deedle & I were on a New England cruise. And of course, we had<br>
to see if there were any boxes planted close to where we'd be in our ports.<br>
Our first port was in Portland, Maine, and we found two boxes that were<br>
hidden within a reasonable walking distance from the pier that we had time<br>
to find after the excursion we had gone on that morning. Looking through the<br>
logbook for the second box we found, I noticed that the finders had listed<br>
that day's date. Then I noticed their note about "found this while in port<br>
on our cruise." I turned to Deedle - there was only one cruise ship in port<br>
that day - "There are other letterboxers on our cruise!!!" Oh, but the agony<br>
of how to find them on our ship! The next day's port was in Bar Harbor, and<br>
we had only printed clues to one box since that's all we thought we'd have<br>
time to look for. We were going to leave them a note in that logbook,<br>
because we assumed that they would be looking for that box,<br>
too, but alas, the area was too crowded and if the box was there it was<br>
hidden REALLY well and we weren't able to search for it long enough without<br>
