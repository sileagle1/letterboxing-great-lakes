<br>
 I've been to some of the places in the Cleveland metro parks you photographed as well as the two Columbus Art locations.  Nice memories.  I used to hike the Brandywine Falls trail all the time.  Used to be able to go down to the river level at the bottom of the falls.  There's a tunnel for the river near there that is REALLY cool!  I don't recall it's exact location though or which trail it's on.  If the water's not running high, you can walk though the long tunnel, made long ago by the corps of engineers using bricks, and get to the other side to climb on large boulders and enjoy the peacefulness.  The rough rock bottom of the tunnel was rarely dry and often moss covered, so careful stepping is highly recommended if you find it!  But if I recall correctly, that was past a "no trespassing" sign I ignored.  What can I say, I was young and stupid.  Used to go there alone!  Looking back, if I had fallen and cracked my head... no one would have found me.<br>

They are all from boxing trips around the region. (all expect the last <br>
which is in a private park in Chicago)<br>
<br>
Its fun to see the difference/similarities of pictures from the <br>
region...and amazing how different some of the places look in winter vs <br>
summer!  Many thanks to all those (and you will know who you are) that <br>
planted boxes in such great locations...we would have never been to some <br>
of these spots otherwise.<br>

Nice photos!  I love the Six Feet Under tree.  I saw the picture, <br>
thought "that looks like the Six Feet Under" title screen... then <br>
read your caption.  Too funny!<br>

  Very nice photos...made me want to make my own album of our travels! So <br>
  here you go...<br>

<br>
  They are all from boxing trips around the region. (all expect the last <br>
  which is in a private park in Chicago)<br>
<br>
  Its fun to see the difference/similarities of pictures from the <br>
  region...and amazing how different some of the places look in winter vs <br>
  summer! Many thanks to all those (and you will know who you are) that <br>
  planted boxes in such great locations...we would have never been to some <br>
  of these spots otherwise.<br>

Great pictures!  I love the stairway one!  It should be in a calendar!<br>
<br>
The field of corn is bizarre!  Was that a letterboxing location?  If <br>
it's not a mystery place, will you let me know the name of the <br>
box?    From what I could read on the caption it looks like maybe <br>
it's near Columbus, OH.  I'm going to have to put that on my list of <br>
things to find if we go to the gathering.<br>
<br>

AQ does do a letterboxing calendar each year--each month has a photo <br>
submitted by a letterboxer.  Maybe you should go for it--that picture <br>
is gorgeous.  Spring--where are you!<br>

  I also enjoyed looking at all the photos! Some nice shots of <br>
  waterfalls and sunsets. I recognized the locations of some of <br>
  Atom118's and SpringChick's photos - lots of fun times out on those <br>
  trails!<br>
<br>
  To keep the thread going, I uploaded 15 shots from our LB vacation trip <br>
  to Washington state in late AUG/early SEP last year. Here's a link to <br>
  see them with captions. Just click on the slideshow option or an <br>
  individual photo if you'd like to see a larger view.<br>

I'm out in California on business for the next month or two, so instead of coming home some weekends, we figured a better idea was to have Martini Man come out to California.  We were happy to do some boxing in the Los Angeles area, especially since there was a blizzard in Milwaukee the same weekend!<br>
Martini Man will probably also come out here later in March so we can attend a gathering in San Diego and hopefully do some boxing in the Borego Springs area.  We're also hoping to get rid of all the Cooties we acquired at the SILO event!<br>

P.S.  It should be in the mid-70s to 80 this weekend out here.  Unfortunately I'll be spending much of the time in a warehouse!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great photos!  I have only flown into San Diego, did a presentation at a resort and then flew back out again, so I have not seen CA.  I didn't realize it was so rocky!  Given how large the state is, I'm sure it's not that way all over CA, but it was surprising to me to see terrain that rough and so much rock :-)  <br>
