weeks now!<br/>
  Yikes, it was positively  horrid! <br/>
 I had a wonderful time meeting all of you at the  gathering. The food was <br/>
awesome.  Pehaps, we could make this a monthy  thing??? We could make it a <br/>
progressive meal and hide boxes at each  location.  Maybe I'm just a little too <br/>
excited to have  my pc working again.<br/>
Everyone was so friendly, and it was great to see the kids who  are involved. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Talk about a learning experience.  First of all, how  many of you wished you <br/>
would have brought one of those, I-Zone cameras???   Dumpster Diva and I <br/>
couldn't stay for the whole event because of travel time,  but if I would have <br/>
remembered that, we could have photographed each team and  put one of those tiny <br/>
pictures in our log books next to your personal  stamp.  Oh, I hate it when I <br/>
have a great idea too  late.  It was neat to see how others set up their <br/>
logbooks and  backpacks.  I got some good ideas from you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Dragon, good job!<br/>
