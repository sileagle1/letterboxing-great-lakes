There are others that I don't have the names yet. I also know of some<br>
of the "real" names and phone numbers. I don't know if that should be<br>
sent over the net. As for the publication. It is called the Sunfield<br>
Sentinel.<br>

I've seen a couple of these team names in my boxes (eastern MI).  <br>
They've gotten pretty far afield from Sunfield, but maybe they just <br>
really got into letterboxing.  I haven't had any destruction from <br>
them, as far as I know.  I can guarantee I'm going to keep reading <br>
their blog to make sure they don't give extra hints to any of my <br>
boxes.  That's really cheating!  <br>
