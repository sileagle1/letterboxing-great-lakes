                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
Just recently caught up on the list after several weeks of neglect.  <br>
It was nice to be missed!  We regretted not being able to make it to <br>
the mystery gathering in October, nor to the southeast Michigan <br>
fantasy gathering in September.  Sounds like they were a lot of fun!<br>
<br>
We also missed the round of introductions back in September, so for <br>
those of you that we haven't met yet, we are TJ_Mich, originally from <br>
the Upper Peninsula of Michigan*, recently of the western suburbs of <br>
Detroit, and now relocated to the greater Milwaukee area.  It's been <br>
a busy September and October, but we are now settled into our new <br>
house, are getting to know the area, and are looking forward to <br>
seeing old and new faces at the upcoming gathering in Waukesha in a <br>
few weeks.  Not to mention the *abundance* of boxes in this area: <br>
there must be a couple hundred within a hour's drive!  Wow... we <br>
can't wait!<br>
<br>
We have been letterboxing for almost 4 years, and are somewhere <br>
around P20 F299 X90 E4.  You can see a list of all our adventures at <br>
http://www.geocities.com/tj_mich02  We were lucky enough to attend <br>
the very first Great Lakes Gathering way back in 2003, just a few <br>
months after we got started.  And earlier this spring, we hosted a <br>
small gathering near our old home in Michigan.  By the way, Wisconsin <br>
folks:  we have 8 temporary letterboxes left over from that event and <br>
hope to find new permanent locations for them next year.<br>
<br>
In addition to collecting all kinds of stamp images over the past few <br>
years, we've also formed a veritable posse of junior letterboxers--<br>
er, that is to say, we've had 3 kids!  They are The Nickerboxer, <br>
who's almost 3; Little WoodChuck, 1 1/2; and 4 month old Sam, whose <br>
trail name and stamp will debut in a few weeks.  Our nine-year-old <br>
Sheltie, Maya, also has her own stamp, and we still sometimes bring <br>
her hiking when we are really feeling brave.<br>
<br>
For the record -- but please, not to start any conversations again -- <br>
we did once meet the family from Livingston County out on the trail.  <br>
In fact it was the day after the 3rd Great Lakes Gathering in 2005, <br>
and they were hunting for some of the event boxes, just like we <br>
were.  They were perfectly nice folks and had already been 'boxing <br>
for a year or more at that time, if I recall correctly.  Finally, I <br>
just can't resist responding to the comment that - 'they don't have <br>
trail names, so must not "get it"' - with just 6 words:  Wanda & <br>
Pete.  Don & Gwen.  Mark & Sue.  Enough said.<br>
<br>
Best wishes to everyone for a few more weeks of fall fun, and see you <br>
on the trails!<br>

<br>
Yeah!  I was thinking TJ_Mich might want to at least make a stop in Shawano<br>
county on their next trip up north to visit family...<br>
<br>
Welcome to Wisconsin guys -  Hope to see you at the St. Nick's gather!<br>
