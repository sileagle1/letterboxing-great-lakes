much information as I can. <br>
<br>
How many out there frequent the Starved Rock, Buffalo Rock, and <br>
Mathessien SP areas?   How often do you go?   Once you find all the <br>
boxes, do you ever go back to that location again?  Living and <br>
working not that far from there I like to go after a hard night at <br>
work and  walk trails and look for boxes as a stress reliever. <br>
 <br>
<br>
Does anyone know if any of the boxes for SR, Matheissen or BR were <br>
damaged or lost during the tornado?  I looked for some the other day <br>
and couldn't find them based upon the clues and these were locations <br>
that the tornado went through.  <br>
<br>
How can I get letterbox introduced to my community, I have placed <br>
one letterbox and have only gotten a minimal response to it.  I find <br>
it hard to believe that out of almost 20,000 people only three <br>
people are letterboxers.I am hoping to make it to the get-together <br>
next year.  Who knows, maybe I'll get an itch and put out a get <br>
together at one of our local parks.  <br>
