                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I went to check on my Rouge 2 box in Plover last October during state CC and I found the box location taken over by a geocache(insert typical reaction here).  I went on to hide another rouge stamp on the same trail anyway and modified the clues accordingly.<br>
<br>
So today I get an email informing me that my rouge 2 box is indeed still in place - buried well below the big metal geocache!  First time that happened to me, usually its the other way around!<br>
<br>
So if you are attempting those two rouge boxes soon, be advised you'll have to dig under a geocache (at least until I can get the geocacher to move his cache...)<br>

Perhaps your box is safer under the geocache rather than by itself. If a  <br>
cacher comes along they will get their catch and hopefully not even notice <br>
your  box -- check the clues to my Herbert Hoover box <br>
_http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=104815_ <br>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=104815)  It's  still doing fine after all these years.<br>
 <br>
I will avoid my usual rant and rave too. I hope your box continues to  <br>
thrive in hostile territory.<br>

A geocacher/letterboxer let me know the situation and warned me to get the situation fixed before my stamp disappears, so I'm attempting to fix it.<br>

You must be living in geocacher territory because they are always finding your letterboxes.  I know you are careful to label your boxes too.  People need to READ.  <br>
 <br>
Today, I met up with a railroad worker who accidentally found one of my letterboxes when his crew was working.  He contacted me through AQ and we agreed to meet at McD.  He returned the letterbox to me tonight.  <br>
 <br>
I wish you would have that same type of good luck rather than all the (GRRRRR) situations which keep happening.  <br>

I think that my box was muggled, taken home, written in and returned to anywhere in the park (at least it was the same park!).  It's got a juicy story in the logbook now, too.  (every pun intended)<br>
