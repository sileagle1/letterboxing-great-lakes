Fall Gathering at Yankee Springs Rec Area in Middleville, MI.<br>
<br>
Gathering Web Page: <br>
<br>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/events/051022_main.asp<br>
<br>
This will be a traditional type of gathering at the Yankee Springs <br>
picnic shelter with a potluck at noon -- there is a grill there and <br>
also electricity.  The gathering will get going about 8:00 a.m. with <br>
exchanges, meet/greet old new friends, etc.<br>
<br>
A few other highlights:<br>
<br>
RHYME TYME CLUE EXCHANGE GAME:  We will be playing the Rhyme Tyme Clue <br>
Exchange Game, a variation of the Clue Exchange Game devised by Scarab <br>
of the Doubtful Guests. The premise of the game is similar to the <br>
Clue board game, in which there are a variety of SUSPECTS, WEAPONS <br>
and ROOMS, and the object of the game is to use cards/questions to <br>
determine which suspect killed Mr. Boddy, with which weapon, in which <br>
room. <br>
<br>
Similarly, in our game there will be SUSPECTS, WEAPONS and LOCATIONS, <br>
with the object being to determine which suspect killed Mother Goose, <br>
with which weapon, in which location. Instead of cards/questions, <br>
players will collect stamps and extraneous clues to eliminate the <br>
innocent and pinpoint the guilty. <br>
<br>
(MORE DETAILS IN SEPARATE POST OR AT THE GATHERING WEBSITE)<br>
<br>
<br>
WORKSHOP:  We're trying to keep the schedule loose and flexible and <br>
have decided to have only one workshop -- topic yet to be decided (we <br>
are looking for suggestions for workshop topic and welcome ideas, <br>
particularly topics that have not been covered at previous gatherings).<br>
<br>
<br>
LETTERBOXES:  There are a handful of letterboxes already in this <br>
park.  We think this is an awesome park with a great set of hiking <br>
trails (over 15 miles of trails), not to mention the central location <br>
between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo.  We definitely think this park <br>
could use some more permanently planted letterboxes so we are <br>
encouraging anyone who is able to plant some boxes here between now <br>
and October.<br>
<br>
Alternately (we know it if not feasible for everyone to just hop on <br>
over to Yankee Spring to plant letterboxes), you can create a box for <br>
the gathering and mail it to us to plant and do clues.  There is no <br>
specific theme for gathering boxes, so let your imagination run wild!  <br>
How about Halloween themed boxes, maybe Autumn themed or even playing <br>
off the name/history of the park (do a little research on this).  <br>
Another great theme idea would be fairy tales to coincide with the <br>
Clue Exchange Game theme...  be creative and have fun with these!<br>
<br>

sending letterboxes and how to RSVP), see the gathering web page here:<br>
