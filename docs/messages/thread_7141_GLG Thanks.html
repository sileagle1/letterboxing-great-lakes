This was our favorite park of all the years we've been attending the GLG events.  Lots of great trails and a very nice lodge facility with large kitchen ensured a wonderful weekend - even the weather cooperated.<br/>
<br/>
More thanks to the SpartanFans and pjynx and anyone else that helped plant the boxes or contributed in other ways to make the event a success.  We loved the many challenging clues and creative plaements within the park!  We spent almost the whole day Sunday at the park and still had many boxes that we ran out of time to find.  This park is now a "boxing mecca" for anyone who ventures to it.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed being able to meet people and do exchanges at the lodge on Friday night, before all the hustle and bustle of the big day.  Of course we did more exchanges on Saturday since there were so many people attending this event that we hadn't met before.  We were also glad to see many of our old friends from previous events, but were disappointed several of them couldn't make it this year.  Maybe we'll see them at another event later this year.<br/>

A special thanks to LunaGirl for surprising us with the fantastic wedding anniversary cake, complete with our sig stamp images!!<br/>

I've added a few more photos to the growing collection in the 2011 Great Lakes Gathering - MI Photos folder.  You can find them here:<br/>

"Lady Madonna".  Just like last year's GLG, an animal was the first to visit<br/>
one of our boxes.  Luckily LL &amp; D had spare supplies with them.  They<br/>
removed the damaged logbook and put in a replacement book in a new baggie.<br/>
Luckily the beast did not have an appetite for PZ Kut and the stamp was<br/>
fine!<br/>
