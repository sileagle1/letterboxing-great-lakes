worth in.<br>
<br>
Meeting everyone and putting faces to trail names was the best part for <br>
sure. Putting your stamp on your name tag was a great idea as most of us <br>
can relate to the stamp when we see it then the light bulb goes off!<br>
Second was ALL the boxes! my goodness. Who would have thought that you <br>
could put that many boxes in one park... plus the WoM boxes and all the <br>
other secret boxes that were out there. Thanks for everyone who shared when <br>
we just happened to stumble upon you! :-)<br>
The Circus was huge! and really awesome to go back and look at over <br>
Father's Day. I showed everybody who came to our house on Sunday whether <br>
they wanted to look at them or not!!<br>
Kind of sad that only a couple people picked up on my personal traveler <br>
hint... but maybe you can search back and get it next time we meet.<br>
The Soul Train box was removed and will be placed nearby... I might have to <br>
make it a mystery box after all the inspiration I got from SpringChicks <br>
workshop.<br>
Naughty Dog talked about Dartmoor the whole way home when he wasn't <br>
snoring. We were so tired. I had a school reunion that night and just <br>
couldn't make myself go. Grandbaby was waiting up for me when I got home <br>
though to see who had stamped into his logbook.<br>
Team Rabbit, you guys picked an awesome park to have the gathering in. We <br>
had never been there before and loved it! You desire a big pat on the back <br>
and then some...<br>
As everyone else has stated Dragon's Mo' Mustang box was the bomb! It took <br>
us three time to get it right.. okay we can be a little slow to catch on <br>
sometimes!<br>
Everyone was awesome and was so nice and friendly. I wish those of you who <br>
didn't get to go this time definitely get to attend the next one.. well <br>
worth the time and effort to go.<br>
Still flying high.... and not because of Dragon's Pot Pi :-)<br>

everyone who put so much effort into making the Gathering so<br>
successful?  Good, because Bindle Bum and I would like to echo the<br>
praise that everyone else has posted!<br>
<br>
Great fun to head out and hunt up letterboxes with some of the DogLvrs<br>
family, Jacks and the kids.  Bindle Bum was amazed at how many folks<br>
got his personal traveler and very happy to discover that Cub and he<br>
share a passion for a particular sport! <br>
<br>
The only workshop attended was the Mystery one given by SpringChick<br>
and it was GREAT! (I'll be working on some of those clues with renewed<br>
vigor now ... lol)<br>
<br>
The Circus was fantastic, but I don't think we got all of them in the<br>
time we were able to spend on site.  Thanks Mark and Sue for bringing<br>
it to share. (Speaking of sharing .... you know how it can be when you<br>
travel and drink the water in strange lands. You're both still healthy<br>
... you didn't get sick or catch the cooties or anything while you<br>
were here or anything, I hope)<br>
<br>
Apologies for the short stay, wish I could've spent all day and half<br>
the night with you guys. But I was just coming off twelve 10 hr days<br>
in a row and I promised Bindle Bum ... Gathering until noon and then<br>
we'd go sailing.<br>
<br>
Thanks again to everyone for everything, it was a most successful<br>
Gathering! Bindle Bum even said he'd likely come to another one with<br>
me ... especially since our boat is likely to be out of the water by<br>
then.  Hope all of you who couldn't make it will be at the next one.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have June 3rd on my new calendar.  My ISP was down all day yesterday so I didn't <br>
participate in the discussion.<br>
<br>
I like the set date idea for the GL gathering, wherever it lands each year.  In the earlier <br>
years I am sure it was important to set a time when the largest number of letterboxers <br>
could participate.  It sounds to me that letterboxing is well established in our region and <br>
no matter what date is picked, a good number of letterboxers will show up.  And though I <br>
was unable to attend the Haunted Harvest Gathering, from the discussions and photos I <br>
saw, it sounds like a very big event, what I might have expected from the GL regional <br>
gathering.  The Joy in the Journey gathering in Plymouth, IN last May was highly successful <br>
and many letterboxers attended as well.  Several of us in Indianapolis put together a small <br>
indoor gathering last March and I think about 30 attended.  I had not been to a gathering <br>
before and we didn't want to be overwhelmed by announcing it publicly - space limitations <br>
of the site.<br>
<br>
What I see developing is that within each GL state, there may be at least 2 gatherings per <br>
year (that's already happening in some, right?).  Ohio, Michigan, IN, IL, WI, and don't forget <br>
Minnesota ... a minimum of 13 gatherings to consider annually, or about one every 4 <br>
weeks.  And I am looking to go outside our region, to KY, in January.  While the spirit is <br>
willing, I know it is impossible to attend all of them.  If I miss one, there will be another <br>
opportunity soon.  So I fill the empty weekends with letterboxing on my own, or other life <br>
demands.<br>
<br>
Whether a gathering is designated the "annual GL gathering" or a local gathering, I would <br>
be willing to pitch in for gatherings outside my area and state.  I am putting my desire to <br>
help organize a big Indiana event on hold until I know when I may be relocating, it could <br>
be 3 months, or 9 months, or ???<br>
<br>
So, I guess, the solution to the question, might be ... first come, first served in terms of <br>
securing a particular date for a particular gathering.  We may come to the point where <br>
there may be 2 gatherings in our region on the same date and we will have to make a <br>
choice.  I would just like to repeat something I believe ... we will have fun whether 20 or <br>
200 people are there.<br>
<br>
Just my perspective,<br>

write me a note to stay home from work this week so I can prepare for <br>
the letterboxing extravaganza.  I should reach 300 this weekend!<br>
I am looking forward to meeting everybody!<br>
