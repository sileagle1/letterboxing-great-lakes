Michigan's first letterbox, April Fools, is alive and well (contrary to many reports)!  It was in the exact place it should have been, completely visible (unfortunately), but it has survived for almost 10 years now!<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is that somehow the inside of the 'box was saturated - water in the box, the baggies, and the logbooks :(  <br/>
<br/>
So, April Fools will be out of commission for a couple weeks as we have to dry out and preserve the logbooks.  It will be back in place definitely before its tenth anniversary arrives (which will be during Labor Day weekend). <br/>
<br/>
We will report when April Fools is back in place...<br/>
