Keep the good thoughts and words of encoragment coming. It really makes Robert, Bobby, Tat2Bob or what ever you call him, feel good knowing so many people care about him. We are getting sprung tomorrow and going to spend the week with his parents so I might be able to go back to work and then he will never be alone. And maybe, just maybe, we can get a good night sleep. God blessed us in so many ways. <br>
