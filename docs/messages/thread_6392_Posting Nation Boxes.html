Ok, the carvings We did we would like to be able to plant in the spring. (Too good just to throw them in the drawer and have no one see them again).  So do i make them as a "traditional" and just keep it as unavailable until we plant it? Or should i make it as an event for now, and a seperate listing later?? But those that find it tomorrow, wouldn't want to go find it again to log???<br/>
Just curious what others are planning on doing.<br/>

Well i thought about that, but thought i could just list it as unavailable after tomorrow????<br/>
Would that work??? And Once you see it, you too will agree that it needs to be set free for others to see, and it definately could fit on a trail somewhere:)<br/>
