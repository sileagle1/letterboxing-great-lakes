this flawless event! We had so much fun meeting other letterboxers. <br/>
Everyone was so welcoming and helpful. I should say that this was our <br/>
first event. We scored our 100th find during the day which was very <br/>
exciting! We plan to go back to the park to find the boxes we missed. <br/>
We were exhausted today but it was a GREAT exhaustion! We can't wait <br/>
for the next event!<br/>
