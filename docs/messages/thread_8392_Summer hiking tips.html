<br/>
My name is Walter. I was a member of SARA for over 15 years. At one point, I
was the subject matter expert on Hot Weather Hiking. I did a ton of research
and reading on the subject and we came up with 14 points to remember while
hiking in the Summer:<br/>
<br/>
DRINK BEFORE YOU GO:: We are always below hydration level, unless we've just
eaten. So tank up before you go.<br/>
<br/>
DRINK WATER AND ELECTROLYTE DRINKS: When you drink, don't just drink all water
or all electrolyte drinks. Alternate them as you drink<br/>
<br/>
DO NOT RATION WATER: Drink constantly, every 10-15 minutes out of your
hydration bladder. Think of hydration like a checking account. Put water into
your body before you start getting withdrawl fee notices. <br/>
<br/>
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!: You lose mostiure and water through your mouth. <br/>
<br/>
GET OUT OF THE SUN: In our hot-weather training, we pulled a thermometer and
showed a 20-30 degrees difference in sunny ground to ground in the shade! So
always seek the shade when taking a break or standing around. <br/>
<br/>
SIT ON SOME INSULATION: sit on your pack, or bring a sit pad. No one wants to
sit down on ground that's between 100 to 150 degrees!<br/>
<br/>
GET OUT OF THE WIND: Evaporation is the only way your body cools itself down.
Yes it will feel cooler, but evaporation will become ineffective and you won't
lose the heat as fast.<br/>
<br/>
COVER YOUR SKIN: A man who removes his hat, shirt and trousers increases
his heat gain equal to a 10 degree rise in air temperature. The clothing
keeps the sweat on your skin longer and makes evaporation much more effective.
<br/>
<br/>
WEAR A WIDE BRIMMED HAT: A 3" wide brim hat is mandatory in the desert
(think boonie hats). <br/>
<br/>
DON’T EAT LARGE MEALS: It take more water to digest the meal. And you only have
a finite amount of water in you.<br/>
<br/>
CHECK YOUR URINE: If it's yellow, or lack of urination while out on the trail,
you need to drink more water!<br/>
<br/>
MAXIMIZE PALATABILITY OF YOUR WATER: Would you rather drink cool water, or warm
water?<br/><br/>
HIKE LIKE A CAMEL: Tank up before you go. If you find water out there, drink
all you have in your pack and fill up from the source. Also have cold water and
electrolyte drinks waiting for you back at the trailhead.<br/>
. <br/>
DON’T MOVE AROUND UNLESS YOU HAVE TO: Moving around requires lots of water and
energy. <br/>
<br/>
IF YOU MUST MOVE, MOVE WHEN THE SUN IS LOW: The best time to hike in the
Sonoran desert is between 4 pm and 10 am.<br/>
<br/>
TAKE TIME TO DRINK: Take a rest at least every hour of hiking and take the time
to drink.<br/>
<br/>
REHYDRATE WHEN YOU GET BACK! When you get back, drink a sports drink, eat some
pretzels, Gorp, or a salted bagel. At the end of the day and before going to
bed, drink, drink, drink. <br/>
<br/>
All these factors-when taken together, can reduce your sweat rate by one fourth
the normal rate!<br/>
<br/>
If you want to know more, I'm always available to chat. Keep Safe out there,
and remember, the Sonoran Desert doesn't care who you are. Mother Nature is
always in control and you are small and biodegradable.<br/>

 The info below is something that was posted in a<br/>
 Tucson hiking group message board.  It doesn't get<br/>
 quite as hot as AZ  in the Great Lakes area, but there<br/>
 are still some good tips for summer hiking in our area or<br/>
 while you may be on vacation somewhere.<br/>
