hosts Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man, GREAT JOB!<br/>
everything was wonderful. The location was very nice,<br/>
great trails, nice facility. The food was great (even<br/>
though I didn't eat much, I didn't want to get slowed<br/>
down). Meeting all of you was my favorite though. All<br/>
the time I've been letterboxing you are the only<br/>
people I've met who are boxers as well, and there are<br/>
so many of you! Thank you to SpringChick for carving<br/>
the new Great Lakes Group stamp with MINNESOTA!!! on<br/>
it. It's funny that I didn't even notice that MN. was<br/>
on there until someone said "Hey they added MN." I<br/>
can't wait for next year, this was my first gathering,<br/>
I suspect the wait for next years gathering will be<br/>
even longer. It was very nice to meet all of you, I<br/>
look forward to getting to know all of you better and<br/>
I look forward to seeing everyone next year. Take care<br/>
and box alot this summer, I know I will : )<br/>
