Everyone wants to think they're unique.  A truly creative individual.  Even people who insist they don't have a creative bone in their bodies still, deep down, believe they do.  It's like good taste- everyone thinks they have it.<br>
<br>
So imagine the existential blow that follows the discovery of another letterboxer walking around, bold as brass, with YOUR TRAILNAME!  Your very blood chills at the thought right?  The unspoken bonds of brother and sisterhood are shattered and you want nothing more than to hunt this usurper down and destroy them.<br>
<br>
So, given the amount of new members lately, I thought I'd put together, before things are taken to a homicidal level:<br>
<br>
Delirium's Trailname Checklist for the Insurance of Complete Originality:<br>
<br>
1) Does your name include references to animals?  If so, be careful.  Just a quick look at the listing on the main website reveals a CaT, a catbead, a cat lover, a fat cat, a baby bear, Mama bear, Mama Stork, Mother Hen and Flock, a monkeytoes, monkeyshine, and even our own, beloved Team Rabbit.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying you need to leave the animals out of your trail name (what?  and deprive us the pleasure of someday running across Martian Maggot?), I'm just saying that we sure to love to name ourselves after them.  So, to help ensure your trailname in the halls of fame, read on to number two.<br>
<br>
2) Adjectives are your friends.  Gross adjectives are your BEST friends.<br>
<br>
I know you left seventh grade english class way behind, but let's take a little refresher course.  Adjectives describe nouns, pronouns, and other adjectives.  They give language pep and sparkle.  Pep and sparkle are great things for ensuring the originality of your trailname.  Take a look at our dear Spring Chick.  She started with a domesticated animal, then added a peppy and sparkly adjective- "Spring"  See?  Nice, isn't it?  And Team Rabbit, they've all got nice little adjectives stuck on to their rabbity nouns to give them zing and spice.<br>
<br>
However, don't underestimate the power of gross.  I call on Funguswoman to demonstrate.  "Woman", again, another domesticated animal.  But, like Spring Chick, an adjective was added.  Fungus.  Not the grossest as names go, but not fluffy and cute, anyway.  I'm dang sure there's not going to be a battle of the FungusWomen anytime soon.  Gross is great.  "Funhog" could have just as easily been "Enjoyable Piggie" but no!  Grosser won out, and voila!  A unique name.<br>
<br>
Examples, from list<br>
<br>
Martian Maggot (ok, so gross falls in the animal name, and not the adjective, but cut me some slack here.)<br>
<br>
Indigo Vulture (again, along the same lines as the maggot one)<br>
<br>
Blister sisters (ewwwww....) and Itchy Butt Girls (*ROFL* so sick!)<br>
<br>
Crappiefisher (heehee)<br>
<br>
Wet Scottish Turtle (not really gross, but an excellent example of what adjectives can do for you)<br>
<br>
3) If you don't like gross, and you're not into the whole "naming yourself after your totem animal" thing, there's always hobbies!  I'm willing to bet Banjo-Jim has a knack for music, or that Beadgirlbecky has some nifty home made jewelry.  And it doesn't take Einstein to guess what City Cyclist does with its free time.  Hobbies are a great way to find your trailname.  Just ask Webeboxing.  Unless your hobby has to do with taxidermy, then that's just sick.<br>
<br>
4) Just for heaven's sake, please don't just name yourself after yourself and expect to be unique in that.  I don't know if any of the five Barries or the seven Johns or the million variations of Jennifers cared about an original trailname, but they didn't get one.  If you really want to stick your name in there, just make sure you refer to tip no. two first.  Hangnail Barry is much more creative than plain old Barry.<br>
<br>
5) Finally, sometimes inspiration just strikes you.  Ask Agent Ink.  Or the Unexpected Party.  Or thestarpolisher.  <br>
<br>
6)  If all else fails, open a dictionary to two random pages and make a name like that.  Here are three honest-to-God ones I just came up with:<br>
<br>
a) Enchanting ska<br>
<br>
b) Drop kick stud<br>
<br>
c) Avila syringe<br>
<br>
See?  Easy as pie.  And you can be sure there's not going to be more than one "Drop kick Stud" walking around.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
