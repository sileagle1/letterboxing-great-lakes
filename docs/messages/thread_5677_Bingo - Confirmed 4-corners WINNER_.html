Of course I'm now concerned that SpringChick may not pick "Michigan" as <br/>
a wild card next month especially if the voodoo dolls and such <br/>
reappear.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
As for my own board, we need 6 more squares to get an X... it is very <br/>
far off for Mysterina and me.  A Martini and a Companion would help...  ;-)<br/>

Do you guys know how hard it's been to be quiet? The Merry Men have been<br/>
coming home from school each day checking to see if we got another square-I<br/>
was thrilled to tell them Friday that indeed we got the fourth corner!<br/>
It's fun to be on the winner's list! Good luck to the rest of you!<br/>
