WooHoo!  WTG Robin Hood and the Merry Men!<br>

I really don't think I have a chance in Hell, Michigan of winning any <br>
bingo prizes this year.  Maybe I should move there to improve my chances!?<br>

But, here's to continuing the streak!  Come on, Michiganders!  You can do it!<br>

Of course I'm now concerned that SpringChick may not pick "Michigan" as <br>
a wild card next month especially if the voodoo dolls and such <br>
reappear.  ;-)<br>

As for my own board, we need 6 more squares to get an X... it is very <br>
far off for Mysterina and me.  A Martini and a Companion would help...  ;-)<br>

LMAO TJ-Mich!  Bravo!  I was thinking of doing something like this <br>
when I started my Hell, MI response.  But, I didn't have the patience <br>
or energy to convert that thought into a proper response!  Glad you <br>

Do you guys know how hard it's been to be quiet? The Merry Men have been<br>
coming home from school each day checking to see if we got another square-I<br>
was thrilled to tell them Friday that indeed we got the fourth corner!<br>
It's fun to be on the winner's list! Good luck to the rest of you!<br>
