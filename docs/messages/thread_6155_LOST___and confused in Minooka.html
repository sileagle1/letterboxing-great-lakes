Well, this is what happens when you try to plant 15 boxes in a few hours and then it starts to rain.  We just discovered this situation...don't know how it slipped by us.  We had two more boxes planted at Minooka...one for Charlie, and one for Claire and Aaron.  Unfortunately, no one found either of those.  Not because you all are awful at finding clues or anything....just we were awful at printing off the file that had the clues for those boxes printed off for them. :O  So, the order of boxes planted and clued should be Jack, Kate, Sun, Hurley, Sayid, Desmond, Jin(attacked by the Smoke Monster), Mr. Eko, Locke, Sawyer, Ben Linus, and Faraday. Claire and Charlie were supposed to be in there somewhere.  So, we have pulled the LOST series, and we will be modifying it to be much better than it was with a few more boxes and replanting it in the spring.  Sorry for the confusion!  The 12 Monkeys box can stand alone just fine.  We liked the hiding spot for that<br/>
 one so it will stay put.  When the Lost series is replaced, we will post them as regular boxes on Atlasquest/LBNA.  <br/>
