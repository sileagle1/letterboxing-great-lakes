series...I extend to you the highest praise. I am in awe of you. <br>
This past weekend I dragged my husband (not a letterboxer, he just <br>
goes because he loves me)up to Michigan to finish the 80 days <br>
series. Mind you, this 80 day adventure has now turned into 370 <br>
days. I and 3 other victims I was able to convince to travel with <br>
me  have made 4 trips to MI to get these boxes, and this weekend was <br>
supposed to be THE ONE, the finish line was in sight, the <br>
satisfaction of a job completed was bubbling up in my soul. Yea <br>
right. Let me give you the whole picture...last fall when we first <br>
started this journey we picked up 8 boxes, which was good we were on <br>
a roll until we got to #9 only to find that the place was closed <br>
(locked up tight)we started to climb the fence but a truck pulled <br>
into the area and although I really wanted the box I don't look good <br>
in orange so we moved on. When we hit box #12 it had gone missing. <br>
At box #14 we spent about 2 hours searching but couldn't find it. We <br>
returned home a bit disappointed but undaunted. We figured that 8 <br>
out of 11 was ok considering the circumstances. Next trip up I <br>
picked up #15 and found that # 12 was still missing (or was missing <br>
again). Fast forward, now several months have passed and the area <br>
for box #9 is open again, I convince my son that a 5 hour drive with <br>
mom to go get that one box is a great idea, it will give us some <br>
quality time together and off we go in his car.  (Mind you this is <br>
over 500 miles round trip so now in the scheme of things I have <br>
traveled over 1000 miles for this one box)  We found the park open <br>
and once stamped in he said "Well we're doing good, lets try to get <br>
boxes #3 and #12" and off we went...until his car started acting a <br>
little wierd.  Scratch that idea...we were lucky to get home, his <br>
transmission went out. That brings me to this weekend, 1800 (at <br>
least)miles and one transmission later I was going to get this thing <br>
done. We were doing so well, got boxes 12,13,3 and were sailing <br>
along. And then we get to number 8.  We tried and tried and tried to <br>
figure this one out, we know we were in the right place but somehow <br>
we missed something and after about 2 and a half hours later had to <br>
leave empty handed.  I actually had tears in my eyes, my husband who <br>
does not want to be a letterboxer but only goes because he loves me <br>
doesn't love me anymore.("If you want to come here again you're on <br>
your own sister!")<br>
To finish this sad tale let's add injury to insult, I did find box <br>
#14 this time but also found a swarm of mosquitos, in fact I had to <br>
play tug of war with them to get the letterbox.  I walked out of <br>
there with no less than 28 mosquito bites AND poison ivy. I have <br>
spent the past 36 hours covered in cortizone cream muttering I can't <br>
believe I only have 14...box #8 where could it be?...whose idea was <br>
this stupid hobby anyway?...I can't believe I only have 14. <br>
Just as I was about to throw away my stamps and log books the <br>
postman brought me a surprise, it was from my secret santa and I had <br>
Christmas in July.  Whoever you are...I love my box.  You couldn't <br>
have done a more wonderful job, it's like you know me.  I have a <br>
collection of old Christmas movies but not that one, I love Frank <br>
Perreti, the deer poo was perfect, and a gas card?!!  Thank you, <br>
thank you, thank you!<br>
So now I have to make one last trip up to MI before school starts to <br>
find that elusive box #8 and finish this ridiculous journey...anyone <br>
want to come along?<br>

Where abouts in Michigan are you heading to this time?  I haven't done the <br>
boxes yet, afraid to get out of my own area other than one I found in Grand <br>
Rapids.  I'm planning on doing a couple in Detour Michigan in the upper peninsula <br>
during the second week of August.  Its a long drive up there, I might try to <br>
print out a few and hope my lovely mother will drive me to a few.  :)  <br>
I know how you feel when you are about in tears when I am out there and <br>
really frustrated getting either bitten to death by mosquitos, or things that I <br>
can't see stinging me, when you know you have followed the right directions up to <br>
a certain point and then seem to be at a loss, or when its just so hot out <br>
that my shirt is soaked been out there for over an hour in a certain area, <br>
grrrrrr.   It makes me laugh now thinking about when I get like that.  Maybe we all <br>
feel that way at times.  Sure makes me want to go back though and find the <br>
little booger.  I think I am going to skip those hot days though, nothing <br>
mosquitos like better than a sweaty body.  <br>

Oh my, P. Granola!  We feel your pain!  I cried at Box #8 and <br>
#5..Seriously..I cried!  I think I was like you, exhausted and so darn <br>
mad at myself for not being able to figure the clues out...If it is <br>
any consolation, you've made us feel better that our measly two trips <br>
to Michigan and only 800 miles seem like ...Well, a walk in the park!  <br>
<br>
We spent two nights on two different trips up in a hotel near #8 just <br>
to get it..the local waitress at the outdoor grill near the box thinks <br>
we live in the area!<br>
<br>
I wish we'd known that you were going up this weekend we could have <br>
found #8 together!...And we could've introduced you to the nice <br>
waitress! - We also traveled northward from Chicago last Friday and <br>
Saturday just to finish the journey! We had to lie to friends and <br>
family why we were going back up to Michigan again...they really think <br>
we are nuts! <br>
<br>
WE were determined to get in under the 80 Days...The postcard had to <br>
be mailed by this week!...We braved the heat, the mosquitoes and <br>
stinging nettles and were successful.  BTW, Azobox and Spring Chick if <br>
you are reading this...we were in BOTH of your hometowns and were <br>
tempted to hand deliver the little bugger to you!  Instead, we went <br>
the way of snail mail....<br>
<br>
P. Granola, hang in there - it is such a relief to finish the task - <br>
you will feel soooo good, but let us warn you...those friends and <br>
family will just stare numbly at you as you go on and on about your <br>
adventure.  But, know that here on our little post, there are a whole <br>
lot of us that will rally around you to share in the victory!<br>

never intended for people to become so obsessed...  and it was never our <br>
intention to stump people to the point that they would be coming back 4-5 <br>
times for the same box!  That #8 box, I really have wracked my brain left <br>
and right trying to figure out a better way to word the clues so it does not <br>
cause such problems, but cannot come up with anything better without totally <br>
spelling it out.  I do understand where people are getting confused -- how <br>
was I to know that one little mis-interpretation would bring you to a hiding <br>
place that matched the clues precisely?<br>
<br>
Tiptoe, it is a good thing you didn't try to hand-deliver that card to my <br>
house this weekend, because while you were here in MI, OldShoe and I were <br>
over there in the Chicago suburbs -- at least you were smart enough to head <br>
to the cooler of the two places.<br>
<br>
P. Granola, I really feel for you on the #8 box, but certainly do admire <br>
your perseverance and am glad to hear the others all fell into place.<br>
<br>
Hang in there!  And congrats to the latest finishers (I think the official <br>
announcement staff will be chiming in shortly).<br>

Yup, that would be the reason for our visit -- our annual Cowboy <br>
Junkies fix.  This is the first time we have been to the Morton <br>
Arboretum though -- what an awesome place!  We packed in a little <br>
picnic supper, beverages, a blanket and a lawn chair (yes, I am a wimp <br>
and my back would have been whining by mid-evening without the <br>
chair)... a very nice time!  And of course, the concert was great, as <br>
they always are!<br>
<br>
We did do a little letterboxing while over there, despite the heat.  <br>
We had a few successes, but you will take comfort in knowing that even <br>
I struggle with clues as we failed miserably at the Rodent Gets a Home <br>
Makeover box in Naperville and I thought I was gonna die walking back <br>
in the mid-day sun, drenched with sweat, defeated (we didn't realize <br>
until we headed back that we had gone way further than what the clues <br>
indicated).<br>
<br>
Oh an speaking of stumping SpringChick -- just ask Grandvilla about <br>
that.  She has definitely tested me of late with her Something is <br>
Fishy series at Hemlock Crossings Park.  I went back a second time and <br>
struck out in grand fashion (even worse that I had the day before) and <br>
have had to suppress my urge to go back every day since then, telling <br>
myself that it is just too hot and miserable and I will be able to <br>
think more clearly if I wait for a cooler day --- arrggghhh!<br>
