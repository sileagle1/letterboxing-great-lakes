and Azobox - "Thanks Bunches"!  Another wonderful weekend of LB in <br/>
Michigan!  We made the gathering a weekend long event by finishing more <br/>
of the boxes on Sunday before heading home.  It was nice to see <br/>
familiar faces again and some new ones too.  We are sharing the great <br/>
prizes for coming in First Place in the Clue Game.  That was the most <br/>
fun; but pretty crazy too!  Let's just say it sure did warm everyone up <br/>
fast running from table to table.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for hosting; we look forward to attending more gatherings <br/>
in the future too!<br/>
