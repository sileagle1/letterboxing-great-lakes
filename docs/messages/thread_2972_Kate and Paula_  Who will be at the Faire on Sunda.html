<br>
Kate - Hope you're feeling better.  That bug that was going around usually lasts for 48 hours.  The fever just leaves you exhausted. <br>
<br>
Paula - Sorry we won't meet up this weekend.  But I am planning to attend the faire on closing day.  So much to see and do at the Renaissance Faire that one trip, even three trips, don't allow you to see and experience all the magic around you.  <br>
<br>
Have a great time this weekend. <br>

<br>
  Will you be out and about Saturday, Kate?<br>
  We SO need to get back up there to the Faire - had alot of fun last <br>
  time!!!<br>
<br>
  Will Aim for Sunday - we also have some Boxing to do - theres a few <br>
  in Lindenhurst just calling my name. We also did a little <br>
  geocaching - is fun, but so far lacks that final 'reward' of getting <br>
  that hand carved stamp. Made me appreciate how much I enjoy seeing <br>
  them, and saving them!!!!<br>
<br>
  Its more like, find it, sign in and.. now what. Still fun when Im <br>
  too far from new boxes, but I wish there was just a little more.<br>
<br>
  Paula<br>
