                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  What a great weekend for boxing - sunny, clear blue skies, great<br/>
temperatures for boxing and no bugs - what more could we ask for?  Well, the<br/>
"more" that we got was a box-rich area with lots of good carvers!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We planned our weekend around the Haunted Trails series.  After meeting<br/>
CMoon, Kookaburra and Squeek at the Haunted Harvest Gathering, and seeing<br/>
their cool signature stamps, we figured they probably had some cool stamps<br/>
in the boxes they planted.  We were right!  The Haunted Trails were the<br/>
first boxes we looked for on Saturday morning and we were very pleased to<br/>
find them all and see the interesting stamps.  We also REALLY enjoyed the<br/>
Biker Chick series.  We found one by walking (is there a true story behind<br/>
the "Tandumb" box?!?).  We then found a gas station where we could get air<br/>
put in our bike tires.  We found the other 4 in the series (and the Barn<br/>
Theater) by biking the trail.  It was great to be out on our bikes on such a<br/>
great day and such a pleasant trail.  Another box that we are wondering<br/>
about is the "Little Box on the Prairie".  What WAS this area?  Why are<br/>
there sidewalks here?!?  Two "indoor" boxes we found also provided an excuse<br/>
for treats.  Yes, we were the happy consumers of caramel apples (Happy<br/>
Apple) and pumpkin ice cream (Come Grumpy, Go Happy)!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One amazing thing about Saturday is that we actually found EVERY SINGLE box<br/>
that we looked for.  That doesn't happen to us often.  Another highlight was<br/>
that we hit our F1000 mark.  And last, but not least, is that we had a<br/>
fantastic Chinese meal at Lao Sze Chuan.  Finding this restaurant is also<br/>
due to a letterboxer, but I don't remember who.  In the early days of this<br/>
discussion group, SpringChick asked us all to "introduce ourselves".<br/>
Someone mentioned that they liked food and found the chowhound.com site<br/>
useful.  Well, I'd like to thank whoever that was because ever since then I<br/>
research restaurants for our travel destinations using this site.  It has<br/>
been a source of many good meals for us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Today we got to see another "haunted trail".  The trail that the "Girl with<br/>
a Sword" series (great stamps) is on was the site of a Halloween event<br/>
yesterday. We therefore got to see all the spooky effect this morning as we<br/>
strolled the trail.  We found several other nice boxes but then hit our<br/>
first "couldn't find" in Springdale Park.  We searched every tree for<br/>
"Softball Anyone" with no success.  However as a substitute, what did we<br/>
find?  Prairie Dog!  We had noticed she had stamped into several of the same<br/>
boxes as us with today's date and hoped our paths might cross.  After doing<br/>
an exchange, she showed us the tree she thought she had found the box in<br/>
earlier this year, and confirmed that it looked like it was missing.  Oh<br/>
well, it's probably impossible to have TWO perfect days in a row!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were impressed by how much Forest Preserve land there is in this area.<br/>
Very nice, especially with the trees beginning to change colors.  Two of the<br/>
non-forest boxes that we really enjoyed were the Cemetery Stroll series by<br/>
the Waltzing Pigs.  The clues were very interesting and informative!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll have to plan some more IL trips.  Too bad the daylight is diminishing<br/>
and the weather will soon be changing to something less enjoyable.   Next<br/>
Sunday we're off on a "Boxes, Cheese and Beer" excursion to Monroe &amp; New<br/>
Glarus with a few friends!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That would have been me mentioning chowhound, and possibly also me<br/>
mentioning Lao Sze Chuan.  We actually had my son's wedding luncheon<br/>
at the Chinatown branch just a week ago!  For future reference, most<br/>
of the more interesting Chicago chowhounds are now in a group called<br/>
LTHforum.  Check it out at http://lthforum.com<br/>
<br/>
The Haunted Trails series sounds terrific.  I've got to get back on<br/>
the trail--especially now that the wedding's over.  Thanks for all the<br/>
tantalizing reports!  <br/>
