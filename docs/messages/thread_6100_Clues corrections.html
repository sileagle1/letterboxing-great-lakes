Buckaroo Banzai - as you climb out of the gravity well, you should look for a path to your left, not the right.  ( we even walked that after we planted it and didn't catch that mistake.  ah well )<br>

Shards of Honor& Royal Manticoran Navy/On Basilisk Station  These clues are mostly right but the order is all mixed up right now.  As you leave the Death Star, climb the hill.  At a slight crest follow the clues for Shards of Honor and you should find the Basilisk Station box.  Leave that box and follow the clues for Basilisk Station and you should find the Shards of Honor box.  We put a correction in the Death Star box Sunday morning as well, so hopefully people who had not done that loop yet would be able to get it.  Sorry about that mix up, my notes got backwards when we were adding some more boxes after our first planting sweep.<br>

a path to your left, not the right. ( we even walked that after we planted<br>
it and didn't catch that mistake. ah well )<br>
