                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently found an AWESOME site to hide a LB. It's a round barn near <br>
Kewanee, IL. <br>
<br>
I was going to carve an image of the round barn, which I did tonight. <br>
It turned out SO good (I can't believe it), and so appropriate for the <br>
SILO gathering I decided to bring it with me to show it off.<br>
<br>
Now, here is the question, can I list this stamp as an Event stamp and <br>
share it with everyone there and once I get home change it from an <br>
event stamp to a traditional LB and hide it? <br>
<br>
Or should I just bring it with me and say "na-na-a-boo-boo look what I <br>
have and you don't!!"<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You certainly can do that if you so desire.  You can either change <br>
the setting from event to traditional, or enter it twice, once as an <br>
event and another as traditional, that way you can track who found it <br>
it what way (if that is of interest to you).<br>
