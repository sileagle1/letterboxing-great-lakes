It has been suggested that I report what everyone is bringing for the<br>
pot luck so we aren't "lucky" to have all desserts! So, if you know<br>
what you're bringing, drop me an email. (I suppose the Christmas<br>
Elves are bringing Christmas cookies again? Or is it too early? :-) )<br>
We do have some chocolates coming that I know of...<br>
<br>
       Since we will be coming from IL and starting out early to LB on the <br>
way......we are going to bring a big veggie tray and some dill dip to go with <br>
it.   Christmas cookies sound good...... and chocolate always works!<br>
