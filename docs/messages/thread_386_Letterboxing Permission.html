great role model such as yourself.... You have given me the notion to <br>
request permission from our parks and rec manager because there are a few <br>
places I think would make great places to hide boxes... I was just going to <br>
do it and then see what happened if they found them. I am sure they don't <br>
know what letterboxing is but maybe I will stir some interest and recruit <br>
some new boxers!<br>
Good for you<br>
