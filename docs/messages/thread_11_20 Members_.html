and want to thank each of you for joining.  There are many names I <br/>
recognize from previous meetings, log books and posts at the big <br/>
lists, but there are many others that are new.<br/>
<br/>
Would love to hear from some of you by way of a brief introduction --<br/>
 where you are from, how long you've been letterboxing -- or if you <br/>
are just getting started, what you enjoy most about the hobby, etc.  <br/>
It will help us to get acquainted with one another here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for joining the group and I look forward to sharing <br/>
boxing stories with you!<br/>
