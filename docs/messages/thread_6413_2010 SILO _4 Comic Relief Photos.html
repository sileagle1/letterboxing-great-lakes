It only took me 3 hours to figure out how to do this, but this is proof that you CAN teach a dinosaur new tricks. Thanks to everyone who came to this fun annual event! Spring will be here soon.<br>

Or you were both laughing so hard that your eyes closed to hold back all the tears.  Hey, who among us hasn't gone back and touched up a rubber stamp image?  I'll just add some 'dots' on the photo and create eyes.  What color would you like your eyes to be? Blue?<br>
<br>
Shorty already wants to know what the theme for SILO #5 will be because he wants to start carving stamps.  YES, letterboxing IS an addiction and we can't stop!  <br>
