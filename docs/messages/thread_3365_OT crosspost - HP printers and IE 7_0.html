<br/>
I recently upgraded to the 7.0 IE browser.  Coincidentally I noticed the scanner on my HP four-in-one machine wasn't working right.  The HP Director icon would not respond, and therefore I was unable to scan anything.  I could copy and print, but only by using the actual printer controls.  We were talking around the lunch table at work today when others mentioned the same thing happening.  A coworker called HP tonight and tech support gave her this info:<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is a known incompatibility with IE 7.0 and HP software.  Yes, HP is working on a patch of their own.  In the meantime, if your HP Director (or whatever your particular model calls the application) will not respond when clicked on, here's what you can do as a stop-gap solution:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Double click on the HP icon.  You may see the hour glass for a few seconds, but nothing else will happen.<br/>
2.  Press ALT  and your space bar.  A window will pop up.  Double click on "minimize".  This will move the HP Director (etc) to your task bar.<br/>
4.  Click on the HP Director button on the task bar and you should be able to use the application normally.<br/>
<br/>
Each time you start up your computer you will need to repeat these steps.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
