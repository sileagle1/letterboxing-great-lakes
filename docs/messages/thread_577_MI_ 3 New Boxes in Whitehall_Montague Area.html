to find your three new letterboxes.  We had a lot of fun deciphering <br>
the visual clues, and absolutely loved the books you've created to go <br>
with these stamps.  Of all the years we've lived in the Muskegon <br>
area, my mom and I had never been on the White River Trail, had never <br>
hiked in the vicinity of East Meets West, and had never visited <br>
Meinert Park (and I even worked for the Muskegon County Parks system <br>
for a couple of years!).  We were the first finders for all three <br>
boxes (a thrill for us), and we even found a geocaching box along the <br>
way (stamped before us by Bindle Babe & Bum).  We also found the <br>
Indian Point stamp (that one proved a bit of a challenge) and were <br>
surprised to find ourselves at another Muskegon County location we <br>
had never visited.  That's one of the things I'm loving about <br>
letterboxing - visiting places (sometimes so close to home) that I <br>
hadn't visited or didn't know about.  What fun!<br>

Medbury Park -- was it that one or a different one?<br>

Bindle Bum and I haven't been 100% the last few days. The story on <br>
the front page of the Chronicle Saturday about the Deputy and a <br>
passing motorist pulling a woman from a burning van to safety <br>
involves a member of my family. <br>
<br>
Sunday during her surgeries, we took a break from the situation at <br>
the hospital and drove up here to distract ourselves with a quick <br>
look in search of East Meets West. Even though we were pretty sure <br>
we had the clues down, we saw no box. Unless the two women sitting <br>
on the side of the trail, down the way, were you and your mom and <br>
the box was out of its hiding spot for a few minutes ???? (of course <br>
you all know it took 3 tries for me to get the darn Indian Point <br>
box, so we can't discount that I wasn't looking in exactly the right <br>
place!) <br>
<br>
We were also unsuccessful with the White Trail box. Interesting <br>
thing, here ... one of the 3 boxes I have placed recently; but don't <br>
have the clues posted for; is also in this area. How fun that you <br>
also found the geocache. (BTW, there's another cache near where the <br>
clues start, too.)<br>
<br>
We didn't attempt the little flower box in the park. <br>
<br>
Looking forward to hunting for all these new boxes being placed. I <br>
may not have time to finish up some super stelthy clues, and end up <br>
putting some 'plain old follow the directions' clues up instead.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">PJ - You and Bindle Bum provided a lot of excitement for me and my <br>
mom (we felt like spies!).  We were indeed the two women sitting <br>
alongside of the trail at East Meets West.  We were suspicious that <br>
you and Bindle Bum were out at the same time we were.  We had found <br>
the geocash near the White River Trail Box before finding the actual <br>
letterbox and saw your stamp in that logbook.  At that point we were <br>
sure that you were ahead of us and had gotten to the WRT letterbox <br>
first, and were surprised (and a bit thrilled) that we found it <br>
first.   <br>
<br>
We were at East Meets West with the box in our lap when we noticed a <br>
suspicious couple (you) further down the trail.  I remember walking <br>
past Bindle Bum and saying "Hi" - taking him for a casual stroller.  <br>
At that poilready had the box out and were trying to be discrete.  <br>
When we saw you leave one side of the trail and appear down the road <br>
a bit at the other road crossing we were pretty sure it was you and <br>
we wanted to approach you to exchange stamps, but we didn't have the <br>
box rehidden yet and didn't want to give away its location.  You <br>
know, in my haste to rehide the box I forgot to put the stamp back in <br>
it's baggie.  I figured we'd find you further down the trail waiting <br>
for us to vamoose, and that I'd be able to pass off the baggie to you <br>
to put back in the box!  (Dont' worry, SpringChick, I went back to <br>
put the stamp in its baggie ;)  You were definitely close, but you <br>
didn't pass by the hiding spot while my mom and I had the box in our <br>
possession.  We were actually wondering if you hadn't decided to go <br>
on to Meinert Park to try to be the first finder at Little Flower <br>
Creek, figuring that someone had beaten you as first finders to East <br>
Meets West.  When we got to the park we scoped out the parking lot <br>
trying to find a vehicle similar to the one we saw drive away at EMW <br>
with no luck.  <br>
<br>
Amongst all our excitement, I'm sorry to hear that your visit to <br>
Muskegon was prompted by a family member in the hospital.  We saw the <br>
article in the paper...I hope she's going to be okay.<br>
<br>
Best wishes, and thanks for the excitement.  I'm looking forward to <br>
finding your upcoming boxes as well.<br>
<br>
Peace, <br>
Keltic Kara    <br>
