And...are you implying I'd put one on you? For shame!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yes Bali, that's the one I passed to you... It didn't have a logbook <br/>
&gt; its a stamp in your book and log it online only type. I also tried to <br/>
&gt; pass it to Mrs. Doglvrs but she scooted off way to fast. I had heard <br/>
&gt; she LOVES those little things. I woudl have hit Fo6 but I was to scared <br/>
&gt; to get anywhere near him, who knows what I woudl have ended up with <br/>
&gt; then. :)<br/>
