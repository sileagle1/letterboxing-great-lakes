It seems to me that a GB letterboxer was going to replace or do somethig similar on this trail.<br/>

I've seen many others around the country and concur with WiHi that it is disappointing when some are missing.  (Yes, yes, I know how many of you are saying "When is he going to replance the Estabrook #1 stamp, and others....sorry, just no time.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The boxes with this sort of concept that spring to my mind are ones we found when we first started boxing in 2006 -- The Cottontails had several boxes planted in/around Elgin, IL that were famous paintings and the stamps were layered so that when (for example) all 3 stamps/colors were layered together just right, the final image was of the Van Gogh of "Starry Night" painting. They did this for several paintings -- very fun finds, but it was sad when one layer would be missing from the final masterpiece.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also have a series like this, hidden for the last presidential election in 2008, where all 3 stamps are layered on top of each other and form one of the Obama election posters. All 3 of ours are still active near O'Hare at Catherine Chevalier Woods called "Obamafest: Black, White, Red, and Blue."<br/>

The boxes with this sort of concept that spring to my mind are ones we found when we first started boxing in 2006 -- The Cottontails had several boxes planted in/around Elgin, IL that were famous paintings and the stamps were layered so that when (for example) all 3 stamps/colors were layered together just right, the final image was of the Van Gogh of "Starry Night" painting.  They did this for several paintings -- very fun finds, but it was sad when one layer would be missing from the final masterpiece.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a series like this, hidden for the last presidential election in 2008, where all 3 stamps are layered on top of each other and form one of the Obama election posters.  All 3 of ours are still active near O'Hare at Catherine Chevalier Woods called "Obamafest: Black, White, Red, and Blue."<br/>
