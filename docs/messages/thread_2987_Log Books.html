pads complete with a tiny pen for 50 cents!! I bought about 12 of <br>
them! They are at the front of the store in bargin bins. AH, HA! I <br>
found out your secret Howling Coyote, I thought you made that log book <br>
you sent me for the gathering. I was pretty impressed, then I saw <br>
these at Michael's the other day. What a great way to make a log book <br>
on the fly. Well just thought you all might want to know.<br>
