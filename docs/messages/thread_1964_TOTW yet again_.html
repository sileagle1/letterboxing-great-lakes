logos!  I could sketch a few ideas and see if anyone likes them (not <br>
sure I'd be good enough to carve the actual "official" stamp, <br>
though...)<br>

Ok, so now lets give Papeseed some workable anachronism!  Since <br>
Milwaukee is the SCA capital, we should come up with something good....<br>

WALK - Wisconsin Area Letterboxing Klub (could use "C" as well)<br>
LOW - Letterboxers of Wisconsin<br>
DALB - Dairyland Letterboxers<br>

I know, I know, pretty weak.  Let's hear from you. In fact, let's get <br>
everyone involved.  Everyone - let's have some fun this week and post <br>
some serious and fun anachronisms that might be used for your own <br>
state's of another GL state's group! :-)<br>

LOL .. I'm sure I wouldn't do it well, so here's a copy and paste of<br>
their homepage.<br>
<br>
"The Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc. The SCA is an<br>
international organization dedicated to researching and re-creating<br>
the arts and skills of pre-17th-century Europe. Our "Known World"<br>
consists of 18 kingdoms, with over 30,000 members residing in<br>
countries around the world. Members, dressed in clothing of the Middle<br>
Ages and Renaissance, attend events which may feature tournaments,<br>
arts exhibits, classes, workshops, dancing, feasts, and more. Our<br>
"royalty" hold courts at which they recognize and honor members for<br>
their contributions to the group."<br>
<br>
When Bindle Bum and I lived in Traverse City we hiked into the midst<br>
of a SCA gathering by accident. Some guy wearing tights and big black<br>
boots that looked like they came from the set of a Star Wars movie<br>
told us "Danes" weren't allowed. <br>
<br>
We looked at each other, "Huh?" Bindle Bum is of Italian descent ...<br>
doesn't look Danish at all. <br>
<br>
Then, seeing our puzzled looks, the fellow explained. "Mundanes," he<br>
said, indicating our decidedly non-SCA hiking outfits, "You normal<br>
folks aren't allowed around here this weekend."<br>
 <br>
"Oh" we thought, "sure, right, gotcha". <br>
<br>
And Bindle Bum laughed about 'normal' people like us -- who live on a<br>
sailboat most of the year and occasionally quit our jobs for 6 months<br>
at a time, just because we can and we would rather be sailing -- being<br>
mundane the rest of the day.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

aka Bindle Babe, just another 'dane'<br>
