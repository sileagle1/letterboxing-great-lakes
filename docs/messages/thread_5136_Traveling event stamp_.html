If you haven't already, I would list the stamp in Atlas Quest as an <br>
event stamp, be sure to mark the "travelling" attribute.<br>
<br>
Also post a message on the "event planning" board over there.  You <br>
could also post a message on any of the individual state message <br>
boards on AQ, or even the Letterboxing Chatter board.<br>
