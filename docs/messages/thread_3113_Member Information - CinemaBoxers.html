<br/>
Im Paula - <br/>
<br/>
I letterbox with my Hubby Jim, and son Joel. We started this past <br/>
July, and our count is: P17 F31 X4<br/>
<br/>
We work at home, Im an artist/photographer, and we do Professional Web <br/>
Design. <br/>
<br/>
We LOVE planting!! (And I LOVE carving stamps!) We have had some great <br/>
compliments on our stamps, and I LOVE hearing what people think of <br/>
them!<br/>
<br/>
I have some exciting news about New boxes we will be planting, but Ill <br/>
post that separately!<br/>
<br/>
We got our name from our hobby - we breed and show boxers, so the name <br/>
was fitting, and just stuck. We also Geocache, and really enjoy that <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
Paula, Jim and Joel<br/>
