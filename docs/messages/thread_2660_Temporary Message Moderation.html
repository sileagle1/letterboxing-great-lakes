                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have turned on message moderation for all group members.  A couple <br>
more of the "New Graphics Site" messages have come through and I <br>
suspect this problem is only going to snowball as more people open <br>
the message that have come through.<br>
<br>
Since these messages are coming to the list from senders who we <br>
know, people are opening them without realizing it is a virus.  <br>
Anyone who opens the message and does not have up-to-date virus <br>
definitions on their computer gets infected and the virus e-mails <br>
itself to people in their address book, which often includes this <br>
list, so it just keeps coming back.<br>
<br>
What the message moderation means is that Azobox or I have to <br>
approve each message before it will actually post through to the <br>
list.  As we both have other things we do besides moderate this <br>
group, there may be a bit of a lag at times.  We will try to do our <br>
best to keep up with it.  Hopefully this is only a temporary thing <br>
and Yahoo! will put something in place to filter out these messages.<br>
<br>
In the meantime...  <br>
<br>
1. Don't open any message with the subject line "New Graphics Site" <br>
even if it is from somebody you know.<br>
2. Make sure the anti-virus definitions on your computer are up-to-<br>
date as most of the major anti-virus programs are on top of this and <br>
will stop it before it infects your computer.<br>
3. If you already opened one of these messages, you may have been <br>
infected and should do a virus scan on your computer immediately -- <br>
this is especially true if you are one of the people who has <br>
[unknowingly] propogated the message.<br>
<br>
Thanks for bearing with us!<br>

Can you tell me if a Mac user can propogate this?  It info site I checked<br>
said it is spread through Windows based systems.  The other yahoo groups I<br>
belong to, suggested "no attachments" to emails, which a group I moderate<br>
has done.<br>
<br>
When this dies down, I will repost more info about the Secret Santas.<br>
