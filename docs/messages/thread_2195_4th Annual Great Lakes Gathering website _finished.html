                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
I have completed the basic pages of the website with the 2006 Great <br>
Lakes Gathering information.  You can check to see who is coming, <br>
what boxes are planned, and what food.  As you finalize your plans, <br>
please be sure to send me an email so I can add the info to the <br>
website.<br>
<br>
I've been EXTREMELY impressed by how many of you volunteered to carve <br>
stamps!  If anyone else is thinking about carving a stamp, and want <br>
to do something related to the theme, I've put a link on the Boxes <br>
page to a list of some additional ideas that haven't already been <br>
claimed.  If you'd like to do a stamp unrelated to the theme, that is <br>
fine also.  Just send me an email if you'd like to carve something <br>
and I'll add you to the list.<br>
<br>
As you can tell from looking at the website, we've reserved an <br>
enclosed building just in case the weather is bad.  However it does <br>
also have several outdoor picnic tables where we will hopefully be <br>
enjoying some pleasant weather!<br>
<br>
We'll get a more detailed agenda put together in the upcoming <br>
months.  It sounds like we will have two interesting workshops that <br>
day, in addition to the boxing, exchanging and eating.  <br>
<br>
If you have any comments, suggestions, or additional questions that <br>
aren't addressed on the website, please feel free to send me an email.<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to the big day!<br>
<br>
