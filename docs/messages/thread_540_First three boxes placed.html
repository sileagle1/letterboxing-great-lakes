Fullerton among the lakeside parks (in Chicago), and then over on<br>
Fullerton to the el, and it's only HALF the walking you've done that day,<br>
you have every right to take a little extra time lolling around at home<br>
going 'ugggggh' before typing up the clues and getting them posted. :-><br>
