(Please forward this to the whole signed-up group. I'm at work so can't <br/>
even send to the Yahoo group from here.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to be in town the week BEFORE the BoaF!!! After everyone has <br/>
been so helpful. I am very disappointed as I was really looking forward <br/>
to this. I was verifying the time off at work and I had the wrong <br/>
dates. Grrr.... <br/>
<br/>
I truly apologize and if anyone wants to meet up for an exchange on the <br/>
13th, 14th or 15th, I'd love to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
