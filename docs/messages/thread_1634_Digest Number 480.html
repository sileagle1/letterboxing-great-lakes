people stopping on their bicycles to take a break, it was hard to retried and <br>
re-hide the box without being noticed.  Also enjoyed, Ann's Tablet, it was a <br>
peaceful shady place to sit and relax.  The log book in the Grand Hotel box was <br>
soaking wet so we took it with us to dry out and sent it back to Radio.  We <br>
replaced it with a little notebook. Radio noted that he would try to replace the <br>
book early in August.<br>
