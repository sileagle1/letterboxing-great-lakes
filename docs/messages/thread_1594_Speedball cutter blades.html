&gt; &gt; So, as a fairly new letterboxer (less than a month!), I went <br/>
today to <br/>
&gt; &gt; buy a Speedball cutter at my local art shop. I decided to give it <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; shot, since my practice rabbit stamp, carved with an exact-o <br/>
blade <br/>
&gt; &gt; looked... well... let's just say the rabbit wound up without a <br/>
tail <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; a gaping, gory hole where his eye should have been! Anyway, the <br/>
store <br/>
&gt; &gt; carried Nos. 3, 4, and 6 for the cutter so I bought them all, but <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; wondering: what do most people prefer? The store said they would <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; &gt; willing to place a special order for me, but I would hate to ask <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; &gt; for a No. 1 and then really never use it. Any feedback would be <br/>
&gt; helpful!<br/>
