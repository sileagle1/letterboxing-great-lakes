                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, as a fairly new letterboxer (less than a month!), I went today to <br>
buy a Speedball cutter at my local art shop. I decided to give it a <br>
shot, since my practice rabbit stamp, carved with an exact-o blade <br>
looked... well... let's just say the rabbit wound up without a tail and <br>
a gaping, gory hole where his eye should have been! Anyway, the store <br>
carried Nos. 3, 4, and 6 for the cutter so I bought them all, but I was <br>
wondering: what do most people prefer? The store said they would be <br>
willing to place a special order for me, but I would hate to ask them <br>
for a No. 1 and then really never use it. Any feedback would be helpful!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The two blades I use most often are the no. 1 v-shaped and the no. 4 (?) u-shaped gouge.  I use the no. 1 for most of my carving and the gouge to remove large sections of carving material (usually on the outside edges of the image although occasionally within the image if the space is particularly large).  I think the no. 1 blade would be a valuable addition to your set.  Depending on the amount of detail and your individual carving technique, the no. 3 might be adequate but the no. 1 allows for much greater detail.  The no. 4 might also be useful, but I personally find the no. 6 to be just too big for most of my projects.<br>

I use the #1 almost exclusively, only using the larger ones when I have relatively big chucks of material to get rid of. <br>
 <br>
In the comments I have read from others, people would often like something smaller than a #1 for even finer detail, so I am pretty sure you will find a #1 a good investment.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
