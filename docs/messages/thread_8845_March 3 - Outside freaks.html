However,  I did trim the Ohio boxes back a bit and added a few boxes just outside the region.  I also weighted the boxes to represent the population centers with a bit of geographic variation. (Both of these were meant to increase the likelihood more players had a box.)  Also, in order to increase the likelihood that folks would have the boxes on their cards,  I set a minimum find limit of three finds for the box.  That is with the exception of the newest box planted in each state at the time when I was preparing the list. Lastly, I looked on AQ and LBNA and found a popular box from the past (That seemed to still be active). With all those rules in mind,  I also tried to get boxes by a wide number of boxers. Taken together,  more words got picked..so that's good.. although this year I would have called a wild card instead. 👍</div><div dir="auto"><br/></div><div dir="auto">B - Nature Nuts</div><div dir="auto"><br/></div><div dir="auto"><br/></div></div>
