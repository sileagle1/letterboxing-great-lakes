<br/>
I finally planted my first box (hooray!). It's box #6 in The Dragon's fine Cambridge Parkway <br/>
Series:<br/>
<br/>
http://home.wi.rr.com/dragonlber/cambridge_parkway_letterbox_seri.htm<br/>
<br/>
It's also the first in the series to be in Milwaukee proper, I believe.  Kind of fun to have a <br/>
walkable series that takes you through two communities.<br/>
<br/>
I've sent Tim the clues so he can post them with the others at the LBNA site. It may be a <br/>
little bit before I've got time to get out to box #5 and plant clues in there, so you'll need to <br/>
get the clues beforehand if you're going to do the series or add the new box to the ones <br/>
you've already gotten. (Sorry. Superbusy time of year at work. Letterboxing's been taking a <br/>
back seat lately.)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>
