<br/>
One of the trail boxes at Pokagon put me at 300 finds ... a happy milestone.  While I was gone, a few new Minnesota boxes got planted and I've got a great series of NCAA basketball stamps to plant this summer.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait for the next gathering so that I can get rid of all the cooties that Lunagirl put in my bag.<br/>
