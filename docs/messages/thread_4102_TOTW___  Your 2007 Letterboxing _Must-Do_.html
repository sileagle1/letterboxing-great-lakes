When we travel out west there are three "notorious" letterboxers that we  <br>
would like to exchange with. We will not be getting close enough to Seattle to  <br>
meet with Green Tortuga or Amanda from Seattle. However, we will be driving  <br>
fairly close to Der Mad Stampers stompin' grounds. So we hope to meet up with  <br>
him (he hasn't responded to my Email yet).<br>

Your best bet is to join the Pacific Northwest regional group (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW/) and post the date(s) you will be in the area.  They are a VERY friendly group and will very likely organize a "meet & greet" get-together at a brew pub or pizza place so you can meet DMS and other local boxers.  Did you know that Raqs, a Illinois native, is now living in Portland?  She'd probably also like to meet you when you are there.<br>

Yes, actually we found her "Old Chief" stamp (I saw in the logbook that you  <br>
and Martini Man also found that one). I Emailed her to tell her about finding  <br>
her box and she told me she now lives in Portland and would in fact have a  <br>
gathering for us. Unfortunately, our time will be short and I think we will be  <br>
driving through Portland later at night. She has informed me of how friendly  <br>
everyone is out there and we wished we had more time to spend there.<br>
