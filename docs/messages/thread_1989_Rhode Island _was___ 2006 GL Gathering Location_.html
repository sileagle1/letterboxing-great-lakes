Thanksgiving with my daughter who lives there!  We will be attending <br>
the RI Mystery Gathering while we are there.  I'm really looking <br>
forward to meeting a bunch of East Coast letterboxers (and legends) <br>
and finding some great letterboxes in that area, not only in RI, but <br>
also CT and MA -- so many to choose from!<br>
<br>
Maybe you will get lucky and your trip will coincide with a gathering <br>
being held in that area next summer!  There are a tons of great boxes <br>
over there -- you should have a wonderful time!<br>
