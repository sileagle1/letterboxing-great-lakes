Thanksgiving with my daughter who lives there!  We will be attending <br/>
the RI Mystery Gathering while we are there.  I'm really looking <br/>
forward to meeting a bunch of East Coast letterboxers (and legends) <br/>
and finding some great letterboxes in that area, not only in RI, but <br/>
also CT and MA -- so many to choose from!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you will get lucky and your trip will coincide with a gathering <br/>
being held in that area next summer!  There are a tons of great boxes <br/>
over there -- you should have a wonderful time!<br/>

&gt; We will be there in spirit, but will be Letterboxing in Rhode <br/>
Island by <br/>
&gt; that date (perhaps not ON that date as my children are in a wedding <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; day in RI, LOL - but you never know - I have to check to see if <br/>
there is <br/>
&gt; one in the park....).  We are driving there, so will be getting <br/>
some here <br/>
&gt; and there along the way from WI to RI.  We will be enviously <br/>
thinking of <br/>
&gt; the fun that will be going on back home as well!<br/>

&gt; &gt;How it will work...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Date - Saturday, June 3, 2006<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Location - There have been some suggestions and bids tossed around,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but nobody currently has claim to the 2006 gathering. This is open<br/>
&gt; &gt;for volunteers and is open to anyone - even states that have<br/>
&gt; &gt;previously hosted.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I will give 1 week for interested volunteers to respond.  Even if <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt;have expressed interest before, please e-mail me again as I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;starting fresh now that there is a specific date.  A poll will go <br/>
up<br/>
&gt; &gt;on Friday, Nov. 18, consisting of interested states that have not<br/>
&gt; &gt;previously hosted the Great Lakes Gathering. In the event there is<br/>
&gt; &gt;only a single volunteer from these states, that location will be<br/>
&gt; &gt;chosen and there will not be need for a poll. In the event that <br/>
there<br/>
&gt; &gt;are no volunteers from these states, those that have previously<br/>
&gt; &gt;hosted will then be put into the poll. The poll will remain open<br/>
&gt; &gt;until the end of November, with each person being allowed one vote.<br/>
&gt; &gt;The location with the majority vote will be chosen as the site of <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;2006 gathering.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Once the 2006 location has been established, I will put together a<br/>
&gt; &gt;state rotation for subsequent years, alternating east-west within <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt;Great Lakes region.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;If you are interested in hosting the 2006 GL Gathering, and are <br/>
able<br/>
&gt; &gt;to do so on Saturday, June 3, please contact me via private e-<br/>
mail --<br/>
&gt; &gt;please do not post to the list as I do not want this to erupt into <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt;struggle or for anyone who may be interested to feel intimidated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;When e-mailing me, let me know how many people would be working <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt;you, where you are from and the general vicinity where you would <br/>
plan<br/>
&gt; &gt;to hold the gathering (i.e. NE Indiana, Milwaukee area, SW Ohio,<br/>
&gt; &gt;etc.).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks!<br/>
