                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to both of you for your kind words about the stamp!  I am definitely<br>
a beginner carver - that stamp is only my 4th attempt at carving.  Martini<br>
Man & I certainly saw plenty of excellent examples of detailed carving in<br>
the stamps available at the event and will continue to practice (after my<br>
arm is healed of course!)  I can't wait to get this splint & sling off to<br>
try the letter carving tip SpringChick so graciously shared, even though I<br>
couldn't fully participate in  her great seminar. I was impressed with the<br>
wonderful variety of images she provided as practice images.<br>
<br>
Martini Man & I both wish to give congratulations & thanks to Dragon for<br>
organizing the event and to Acorn for planting so many of the temporary<br>
boxes.<br>
<br>
It was great to meet more LB addicts - we added 20 new exchanges, including<br>
The Travelin' Trouts as their first official exchange.  We were also lucky<br>
to meet the Lucky Charms and their charming niece & nephew (aged 4 & 2).<br>
Skyler eagerly asked her uncle if it was time "to go on the hunt"! We saw<br>
DebRocks' dogs (Jo & Tuck) stamped in to some of the box logbooks and were<br>
really sorry we didn't get their stamps in OUR book as an exchange.  Maybe<br>
next time ...<br>
<br>
It was also interesting to see some of the "famous" traveling stamps.  The<br>
Marilyn stamp was fantastic, as was our very own GLG 2004 event stamp<br>
created by Leapin' Lizards.<br>
<br>
Once we were out searching for boxes in the afternoon we had fun seeing the<br>
creativity and skill of more carvers. We especially enjoyed the Fool's<br>
Errand series - the great images & the thrill of being first finders at the<br>
Moon box and discovering a nice moon pin which I promptly attached to my<br>
sling. Although we didn't find all the boxes available at the Gathering,  we<br>
were pleased to end the day with 18 found plus 2 of the egg hitchhikers.  We<br>
hope to get back another time to do the vampire series.<br>
<br>
Like everyone else, we were besieged by mosquitoes throughout the day and<br>
used up our entire can of bug spray.  We did get a few bites but the major<br>
annoyance was them swarming around us constantly, trying to find a spot that<br>
hadn't been sprayed, or where the spray had worn off due to the heat.  Yes<br>
it was HOT!<br>
<br>
One last note:  the food was delicious and I also would like to ask John of<br>
Leapin Lizards to post or email the recipe for the yummy cheesecake dessert.<br>
I'd like to make it for an upcoming family event later this month.<br>
<br>
Based on the wonderful time we had, we're looking forward to attending more<br>
events in the future!<br>

P.S.  I'll be posting the clues for the "Playing Possum" box on the LBNA<br>
site since it will remain as a "permanent" box.<br>
