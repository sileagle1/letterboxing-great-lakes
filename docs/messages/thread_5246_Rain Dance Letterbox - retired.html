<br>
I rarely post here (and lately, I rarely letterbox - which I'm not thrilled about) but I wanted <br>
to let you all know that I retired my Rain Dance letterbox in St. Charles, IL. The stamp was <br>
carved from a pink eraser and the unfortunate reality is that erasers were made to "erase <br>
away" when they come contact with paper... and so, the stamp is quite worn. The box was <br>
out there for three years and had a lot of activity - thanks so much to everyone who took <br>
the time to visit, stamp, write notes and re-hide so well. I'm impressed it lasted as long as <br>
it did since it's a mere two feet off a fairly well traveled path. It's a great little park so <br>
maybe I'll place something new there, we'll see. <br>
<br>
Happy Boxing! <br>
