Do you know if there will be other kids there?  I haven't really been paying <br/>
attention because I didn't think I could go.  I have a son who is 9 and a <br/>
foreign exchange student from Brazil who is 15 and I'm gonna see if I can persuade <br/>
them to go too.  Do we need to make some name stamps for them as well?  It's <br/>
about time I carve one for my hubby.  I have dragged him to a couple places <br/>
now.  He needs to start leaving his mark.<br/>

You don't have to do anything special or bring anything special.  <br/>
We started out with a junky old mildewey diary and some store bought<br/>
stamps and ink pads.<br/>
If you feel like carving, maybe just carve (1) for the whole family.<br/>
Then you can use it when you all go out together.<br/>
Anyways, what do I know I a"just born" Letterboxer.<br/>
