                    <div class="plaintext-content">Everything has been finalized this morning for the MAJESTIC MINI-MEET.    I spoke with Kyle and Cindy, operators of The Majestic and The Game Plan will be shown at 1:30pm on Sunday.   It will run until about 3:30pm and then we will head across the street to the ice cream parlor.  Both places are excited about having us, please let me know if you plan on attending so I can give them an approximate head count.   Thanks<br>

We all know that a gathering is great fun, but a gathering attended by FW too...well, let's just say it's a whole different level of merriment when you're there.  <br>
<br>
Here's a solution....cough cough cough...call in sick!!!  Play Hooky!  Tell the boss you're sick.  You won't be lying either, because if you can't come to the event, you'll feel sick about it.  <br>
<br>
Of course, the February gathering (TBA) is something you and I co-plan so everyone will get to meet that crazy Dutch Elm Team.  <br>
<br>
Life is short.  Never put off finding those letterboxes. <br>

No, I'm not going to carry you!  <br>
