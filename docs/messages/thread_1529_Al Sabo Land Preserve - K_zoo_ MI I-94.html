the "Big Hole"  on the Borman section and the "invisible oasis" - it <br/>

south end---not sure about an Oasis plant, but could do one close to <br/>
Halsted exit or possibly one of the NW Indiana exits West of I-65.<br/>

&gt; trail through Chicago would be in order.  Your comment in the <br/>
Octagon<br/>
&gt; House book about a nice break from traffic was right on.  Traffic<br/>
&gt; wasn't bad for me late Monday, but a few Chicagoland breaks are <br/>
always<br/>
&gt; nice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would anyone in the Chicagoland area, NW IN area, Milwaukee, <br/>
Madison,<br/>
&gt; SW MI, Lansing, Detroit, and even up into Minneapolis be interested <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; crafting a series.  I drive this route a lot and it'd be a riot to<br/>
&gt; have some boxes close of the interstate.  I know Atlasquest will <br/>
help<br/>
&gt; with this, but a strictly "I-94 Series" could be fun and convenient.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd be willing to help coordinate this.  Let me know if anyone's<br/>
&gt; interested.  Or let a newbie like me know if it's already out there.<br/>

move<br/>

&gt; &gt; Anybody seen this box recently?  I just about died of heat stroke<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to find it, but was unsuccessful.  My color-blindness <br/>
didn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; help.  Trying to decipher orange and green is killer for me.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; noticed on letterboxing.org that the last finder was last year <br/>
and was<br/>
&gt; &gt; wondering if anyone had heard from the box since.<br/>
