Woo hoo!!  MORE boxes to hunt!  :)   I have to look at a map to see <br>
where they are now that I have accessed the secret file behind the <br>
paneling in the study.  Hopefully I can figure out a way to make the trip. <br>

On a side note:  I went hunting boxes yesterday at Malabar Farms in the <br>
north-central area of Ohio yesterday.  There is a box placed INSIDE a <br>
cave there!!!  So much fun!!  I was terrified there might be snakes <br>
hangin' out in the hiding place, but got the box anyway!  What we won't <br>
do for boxes!<br>

They're over on the western side in Ottawa county.  I'll have to venture over there sometime, but they aren't close enough to me to do the day trip I was thinking about.  :(  I don't know why I had it in my head they were in the thumb area, but I can't find anything else that I could have confused them with.<br>

  I'm looking forward to Dragon's mystery, too!  <br>
  Have fun with the Doglvrs boxes, Barb!<br>

  I think Mrs Doglvers boxes were the ones I was thinking about. They look really cool. <br>
  .<br>
<br>
They *are* really cool.  This is a really nice series of letterboxes placed in some beautiful and interesting old cemeteries.  If you have a chance to get over to the west side of the state, I highly recommend them.<br>
