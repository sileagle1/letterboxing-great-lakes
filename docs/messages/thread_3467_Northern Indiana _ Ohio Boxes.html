I'm new to the Great Lakes group and have enjoyed reading your <br/>
messages.  This is my first post, though I've been letterboxing since <br/>
April ... thanks to Trail Rider!<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting ready to make my 3rd trip across the northern tier of <br/>
Indiana and Ohio this fall/winter.  I've stopped at the Maple Wood <br/>
Nature Center (IN) and the RB Hayes home (OH).  I'm wondering what <br/>
other boxes are fairly close to I-90 in case I can talk my husband <br/>
into some letterboxing on the way home (if the weather cooperates!). <br/>
<br/>
The I-90 corridor would be a great series for the Great Lakes group, <br/>
as it is one thing in common with all the States in the group.<br/>

Although this box is labeled I-94, it is actually closer to I-90:<br/>

It is a very nice area and box.<br/>
