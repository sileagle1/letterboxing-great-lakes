even next to another word i already have.....  working on that second <br>
chance for a Bingo now. If nothing else, i'm working toward that full <br>
card. <br>
<br>
Give that bag a shake SpringChick & let those G words come back to the <br>
top. Or quit shaking it if you have been and reach to the bottom.  lol<br>

PS to Wi Hiker:  The pooch (Zelda)is doing fine except being a little <br>
uncomfortable.  She has a drain and some stitches.  apparently she <br>
managed to stab/harpoon herself with a stick. I'm glad i took her in <br>
and didn't wait until our vet was open on Mon. or Tues.  On the surface <br>
it only looked like a tear of the skin, no apparent injury to the <br>
muscle below. It was MUCH larger than that in reality.  <br>
<br>
She'll be able to hit the trails again in a couple weeks. <br>
