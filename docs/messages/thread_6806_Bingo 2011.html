I am honored (okay, lucky) that two of my boxes are on the list.  One of my newest and best carves is on the list, "My Ancestral Homeland" (MI-UP).  And I'm proud of Anne Pickett because of its telling of the story of an early entrepreneur here in SE WI.  The carving is Electric Medic's.  Those two boxes may only have one finder each (as far as I know), so I also feel lucky that I'm one of the few people who can chose them for Bingo!  :)<br/>
