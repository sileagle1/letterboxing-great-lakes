I checked on Norma Jean (IRT) the other day and she is probably most<br/>
definitely dead.<br/>
<br/>
The stump she was in was completely disintegrated and nothing of the box<br/>
could be located.<br/>
<br/>
I found another good image -- different from the first -- and have already<br/>

I found a great new image for Norma Jean and am excited to get it carved.  <br/>
Its not on the back burner, more like the middle burner on my list of  <br/>
priorities.<br/>

As you entered the woods I had you following dead logs that were layed out  <br/>
like a giant circle . . . follow this dead tree to the roots and there's <br/>
another  dead tree . . . follow that one to the roots and there's another dead <br/>
tree --  they were more in the shape of an octagon. Either way, the last <br/>
heading you took  brought you right back to the stump where you first entered <br/>
the woods.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want to say, walk down this trail to the stump. So I had you  <br/>
following all the dead trees through the woods. In my defense, I hid her well  <br/>
before the overgrowth took over the forest. <br/>

we are ever in that area again we'll give the new box another try.<br/>
