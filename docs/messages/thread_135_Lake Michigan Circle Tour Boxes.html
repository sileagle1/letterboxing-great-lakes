to make this a go.  So, if you have a box that meets the criteria <br/>
that you would like included in the Lake Michigan Circle Tour series <br/>
of boxes, please e-mail me (offlist) the following info:<br/>
<br/>
Your name or trail name (this will be listed on the series page)<br/>
Your e-mail (for my use only -- will not be on the series page)<br/>
The name of the box<br/>
Date the box was placed<br/>
URL of the clues<br/>
City &amp; State of box<br/>
Approx. distance this box is from the tour route<br/>
<br/>
Remember, your clues must tell people where to exit the tour route <br/>
and where they will be getting back on.  If you are unsure of the <br/>
criteria for these boxes see the info file in the FILES section.  <br/>
There is also a link there to the LM Circle Tour page which outlines <br/>
the official tour route.<br/>
