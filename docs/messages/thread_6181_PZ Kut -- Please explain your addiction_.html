<br/>
I'm wondering what all the hubbub is about with this shortage of PZ Kut?  Is it just the "Grade A" that is out of stock right now, and how does it compare to other PZ Kut varieties?<br/>
<br/>
I think I have used one type of PZ Kut long ago (someone will have to tell me;) it was orange and fairly hard -- really too hard and crumbly for the kind of carvings I like to do.  I also tried a few other types (the really soft, white thick block of Speedball, various erasers, some off-white stuff that was awful...) but eventually settled on "The Pink Stuff," (Speedy-cut.) Besides the fact that it carves real soft and smooth, it seems to age well too -- as proof by some of my older stamps which have survived a few years in hot/cold temps and have a lot of "miles" on them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... I'd particulary like to hear from carvers who have used the pink stuff and switched to PZ Kut -- which type did you switch to and why -- and is there a price difference (or was that not even an issue?)<br/>
<br/>
I realize that ultimately carving material is really an issue of personal preference and carving style -- but I still think it would be fun to discuss this a little bit in depth again. And since products can come and go -- and even become scarce! -- it seems like the right time to bring this up.<br/>
<br/>
Happy carving, everyone!<br/>

PennyPenny and Atom and all carvers....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's all sorts of carving rubber out there.  Some people use erasers.  But I never understood how some carvers could get those fine lines and tiny details.  The answer: PZ Kut!  I could buy the pink stuff at Michaels or Mastercarve at Hobby Lobby and use a 40% off coupon, but I order the PZ Kut and I gladly pay the price and the shipping and handling costs too.  It's worth it.  Never crumbles or chips.  Like butter!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Santa Claus usually brings me 5 slabs of Grade A White.  Might be a lean Christmas this year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I usually buy the Grade B White; less expensive and only sometime will it have some minor imperfections along the edges, and they can be evened out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will buy the Orange PZ Kut only when there is a special price or the white is not available.<br/>
<br/>
The orange is a bit hard on my eyes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once you use PZ Kut, you won't go back to the others. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WARNING:  That Mystery Grade C stuff is very rubbery.  Not my favorite.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've tried a number of materials and orange grade B is the one for me (including linoleum, shower pan liner, erasers and various other things that looked carvable as I wandered through stores).  I love Orange grade B. The firmness is perfect for my style of carving, which is a combination of gouge, knife and needle.  It allows for great detail even though I don't always take advantage of it.  I like that you can see where you've cut because it changes color slightly.  As far as it crumbling - I've never experienced that, even when carving extremely fine lines.  I have used the white and it is just as good, I just have a difficult time carving on it because of the color.  The pink stuff is too soft for my taste but I'll use it in a pinch.  Mastercarve is wayyyy toooo soft.  It was the first material I tried and quickly moved on from it.  Don't even think about using the grey/tan stuff (speedy cut?) or the mooo carve.  Both crumble if you look at them wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
The PZKut shortage is on all colors and all grades.  Stampeaz had to reformulate it and has been working on getting it close to the original.   From what I've heard the orange is now going to be yellow, but the white is suppose to be better than before.<br/>
<br/>
PZKut is cheaper than the pink stuff at my local Hobby Lobby but apparently prices vary from store to store.  In Green Bay the HL is getting almost $13 for a 4x6 piece for the pink but others report that it's around $6.  Stampeaz is very reasonable for all their material.  OrangeB is 3.75 a slab for 10" X 4.75" piece.  Shipping is flat rate of $5.00 and you can get like 5 pieces in that envelope.<br/>

All I do is color it in with a sharpie marker after I carve it, and then stamp it a few times.  The more it's stamped the better the image becomes and of course you have to carve on the correct side. The marker actually serves two purposes if the stamp is to be in color.  It conditions the stamp and it lets people know what color should go where.<br/>

I started out on Speedy Cut a.k.a. Crumble Block. I then moved on to MasterCarve and then one glorious day PZ Cut walked into my life and I've been a changed man ever since. The detail that you can achieve with PZ Cut surpasses anything else I've tried. Since I started using PZ Cut a couple years ago my carving had improved Immensely. Not only have my skills increased, but I have (had) the tools to realize some finely detailed stamps. I know I wouldn't have got to the point where I'm at without PZ Cut.<br/>

I couldn't have said it any better. I use to waste so much rubber (and time) because I would start carving a stamp and then...OOOPS!  With PZ Kut, I don't feel the rubber is working against me.  I can slowly cut away and not worry.  My carving has improved since I learned to use the right supplies...and PZ Kut is it for me.  <br/>

I can't begin to extol the many virtues of PZ Cut White. There has never been a more perfect carving medium invented. I started out on Speedy Cut a.k.a. Crumble Block. I then moved on to MasterCarve and then one glorious day PZ Cut walked into my life and I've been a changed man ever since. The detail that you can achieve with PZ Cut surpasses anything else I've tried. Since I started using PZ Cut a couple years ago my carving had improved Immensely. Not only have my skills increased, but I have (had) the tools to realize some finely detailed stamps. I know I wouldn't have got to the point where I'm at without PZ Cut. <br/>
PZ, I love you and I miss you, hurry home...sniff...sniff.<br/>

I'll use pink stuff if I have to, but no place around here carries it in any form but the starter kits.<br/>
<br/>
I use inkjet images burnished onto the surface with a fingernail, or pencil for anything freehand.  It works for me with PZ white (HP black ink only; colored ink won't transfer), but doesn't work on Mastercarve (I use pencil on that).<br/>
<br/>
I just carved a set of alphabet stamps for a 5 year old niece using a slab of Mastercarve I had no other use for.  The family all thought they were wonderful...I cringed when I looked at the job I did!<br/>

&gt;   My experience with PZ cut (A?/B?) was not a happy one.  After reading and hearing all the rave reviews, I bought a sheet, used most of a it to carve a two part stamp (E.T.), and tried to print it... with horrible results.  The ink "beaded up".  So, I washed it off with soap same result.  Well, how about a different ink? No. A different kind of water-based pen? No. Then I tried hand cleaner and soap.  Next came Windex, Simple Green, stamp cleaner, ammonia, vinegar, paint thinner, acetone, and benzene.  Still, the ink "beaded up".  So I went down to the shop, put a fine grit disc on the random orbit sander, and "cleaned" the surface.  Tuff stuff that PZ cut, but no improvement.<br/>
&gt;   Next I threw it all in the trash and started over with pink stuff.  And LO the same thing happened.<br/>
&gt;   I'm not sure why I tried it, but I rubbed the stamp with a red, abrasive eraser, and, at last, the ink spread and the image came out clean.<br/>
&gt;   Would the PZ cut have worked if I had thought of the eraser?  Who knows?  Will I try it again?  Maybe, if I can get a test piece somewhere.<br/>
