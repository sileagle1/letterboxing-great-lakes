                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I've had an idea for a series of boxes based on the CLUE board game rolling around in my brain for a few weeks.  I see there is already a series of these out in VA, but my idea is a bit different.  Rather than find all the rooms, then all the suspects, then all the weapons, then a final clue to a box which holds the answer to the mystery...my idea goes something like this:<br/>
<br/>
There would be 9 boxes in this series, each box representing a room from Mr. Boddys mansion in the board game:<br/>
<br/>
Hall<br/>
Lounge<br/>
Dining Room<br/>
Kitchen<br/>
Ball Room<br/>
Conservatory<br/>
Billiard Room<br/>
Library<br/>
Study<br/>
<br/>
In each box, you would find three stamps: one of the room, one of a suspect, and one of a weapon.  There are six of each suspect and weapon:<br/>
<br/>
Suspects<br/>
Col. Mustard<br/>
Prof. Plum<br/>
Mr. Green<br/>
Mrs. Peacock<br/>
Miss Scarlet<br/>
Mrs. White<br/>
<br/>
Weapons<br/>
Knife<br/>
Candlestick<br/>
Revolver<br/>
Rope<br/>
Lead Pipe<br/>
Wrench<br/>
<br/>
Your quest, as in the board game, is to find out these three things:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Who killed Mr. Boddy?<br/>
2)  Where?<br/>
3)  With what weapon?<br/>
<br/>
As in the board game, the suspects and the weapons will move around from room to room (and letterbox to letterbox in this series).  The stamp representing the room should stay in that box.  When you find a letterbox, stamp up as usual.  You can choose to treat it as a regular letterbox and end things there, or if you wish to try to solve the crime, E-mail me your find (I suspect that Mrs. White did it in the Lounge with the Candlestick.) and I will send you a message back, eliminating one of these (It wasnt Mrs. White.).   You are free to take the suspect and/or the weapon stamp to another box (room) to make another suggestion.  As in the board game, you must be in the room you are suggesting the crime happened in.  However, please do not take a suspect or a weapon stamp unless you intend to quickly replace it with another from the series (preferably the same day).  Think of the room boxes like hitchhiker hostels for only suspects and weapons:  dont take one if you don!<br/>
 t intend to come back soon and leave one.  There should be a suspect and a weapon in each room at (most) all times.  If you find a box that is missing a suspect or a weapon (or both) at any given time, you can still e-mail me your find and Ill still give you an answer back (i.e. I found the Hall box, but it only had the Hall stamp in it.  My reply:  The crime did not happen in the Hall.)    <br/>
<br/>
When you think youve got the crime figured out and wish to make an accusation, e-mail me for further instructions.  Each detective who successfully cracks the case will get sent a PLB and a special certificate!  <br/>
**********************************************<br/>
Would anyone be interested in this?<br/>
<br/>
Does this seem like it would work, for both people who are interested in solving the crime and for those who just want to find the boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in carving a stamp??  ;-)  It's a good winter project, but it's 21 stamps and I'm pretty new at carving.  :-p<br/>
<br/>
Appreciative of any feedback...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it is a cool idea!  I was one of the folks who created a stamp for<br/>
the VA Clue Series.  I have never once heard anything about that box!<br/>
<br/>
Couple of observations/comments:<br/>
<br/>
-  It seems like it may be a lot of work for you.  Keeping up with e-mails<br/>
about your boxes can be time-consuming, particularly when the sender is<br/>
waiting for a response as part of the game.<br/>
-  Would people understand what they are supposed to do -- i.e. move the<br/>
suspect and weapon to another box in the series?  I have found that a lot of<br/>
people don't take time to look through the contents of the box and read what<br/>
is there, whether that be instructions or even clues to a bonus box (I<br/>
myself am guilty of missing a few of these in area boxes).  I remember at<br/>
the first GL gathering, the Inn at the Lakeshore HitchHiker Hostel was there<br/>
and despite very clear instruction verbally to those attendance, and<br/>
instructions in the box, and labelling on the stamps and logbooks, the<br/>
permanent box stamp was picked up and moved along as a HH and the HH that<br/>
were in there got their books mixed up -- it was a mess.  On the other hand,<br/>
I have a series where there is a cuckoo clue that gets moved between boxes<br/>
in the series (no stamp, just a clue), and that seems to be working fine.<br/>
One thing that may better the chances of people taking the time to read the<br/>
instructions in the box is to be sure the boxes are planted in areas where<br/>
people can take their time stamping in -- i.e. not in a busy area and<br/>
perhaps a good place to sit when stamping.  If they feel rushed (to avoid<br/>
being seen), they probably will miss the instructions.<br/>
-  When a suspect/weapon gets moved to another box in the series, does the<br/>
seeker then take the suspect/weapon that was in the box and move it?<br/>
Otherwise wouldn't there end up being 2 suspect/weapon combos in a box and<br/>
another box with none?  And how does a person get out of the circle?  Once I<br/>
have picked up a suspect/weapon from box #1, I move it to box #2 and then<br/>
take the suspect/weapon that had been in box #2 and move it to box #3,<br/>
etc...  and so it goes.  At the end of the day, I have suspect/weapon that<br/>
had been in box #4 and box #1 still has no suspect/weapon in it.  I cannot<br/>
go boxing again for a few weeks...  In the meanwhile, a boxer comes to box<br/>
#1 and is disappointed to find no suspect/clue.  Another boxer makes a long<br/>
day of it and finds all the boxes, but does not find suspect/clue that had<br/>
been in box #4 because it is in my bakcpack.  Not sure I am quite<br/>
understanding how that would work...<br/>
-  Is there a final/special box for solving?<br/>
<br/>
If you go through with this idea or something like it, I would love to<br/>
contribute.<br/>

Your idea sounds like fun.  I'd be more than willing to help carve <br/>
some of the stamps for your series.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the responses on my Clue game series idea!  I, too, am struggling with how to make the whole concept work.  It's tricky and thanks especially to SpringChick, who obviously really thought it through.  But you came up with the same concerns I have!  (DANG!  I was hoping for some brilliant idea that would just make it all come together that I hadn't thought of.)<br/>
&gt; -  It seems like it may be a lot of work for you.  Keeping up with e-mails<br/>
&gt; about your boxes can be time-consuming, particularly when the sender is<br/>
&gt; waiting for a response as part of the game.<br/>
<br/>
With the (non) amount of e-mail I have been getting from the 5 boxes I've planted so far, I would welcome lots of emails from people finding my boxes!  But maybe I'm just being naive here. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; -  Would people understand what they are supposed to do -- i.e. move the<br/>
&gt; suspect and weapon to another box in the series?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should only make the clues WOM, to be sure only people who really understand the series go looking for them.  And it would also cut down on the amount of e-mails.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; -  When a suspect/weapon gets moved to another box in the series, does the<br/>
&gt; seeker then take the suspect/weapon that was in the box and move it?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I was thinking this is how it would work.  I'm hoping to have all the boxes in one location, so it would be easy to take a suspect/weapon from, say, the Conservatory and move it to the Kitchen.  Then take the suspect/weapon that WERE in the Kitchen and go put them in the Conservatory that you just left empty.  Or you could take them to a different room, so long as you remember you left the Conservatory empty and need to put something back there before you leave for the day.  I'm just worried this would get confusing and you might not remember which room you left empty by the time you're done!  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; -  Is there a final/special box for solving?<br/>
<br/>
Here's how I thought this would work: anyone thinking they have the solution e-mails me.  Say they think it was Mr. Green with the Knife in the Dining Room.  If they're right, I mail them a special PLB and a certificate that they've successfully cracked the case.  Or I could go to the Dining Room box and make sure they've really stamped in with Mr. Green and the Knife, if I really wanted to make sure they weren't cheating.  It would be really easy to cheat, but what's the fun in THAT??? <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you go through with this idea or something like it, I would love to<br/>
&gt; contribute.<br/>

THANK YOU to all who have offered to help carve!!!!  Wow, you guys are great!  I honestly didn't expect any takers.  What's the protocol on this?  Do I send you the carving medium, or reimburse you for expenses?

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was thinking on this a bit more and wondering if it is necessary to have<br/>
the suspects and weapons move at all?  Perhaps there could be the 9 room<br/>
boxes -- each  would also include a suspect and/or a weapon, either as<br/>
additional stamps right in the room box or as nearby bonus boxes with the<br/>
clues being included in the room box (not all would be full combinations as<br/>
there are more rooms than suspects and weapons).  They would not move around<br/>
from box to box, rather would stay where they are.  One of these<br/>
combinations of room/suspect/weapon is the correct combination.  Perhaps<br/>
each room box could also include a piece of information that would somehow<br/>
fit together -- maybe a clues to a logic puzzle (or perhaps just finding the<br/>
combinations of rooms/suspects/weapons would be the clues to a puzzle).  And<br/>
then once a person has found all of the rooms and collected all of the<br/>
puzzle clues, they would be able to deduce the guilty party, their weapon of<br/>
choice and the room where the crime was committed.  They could then e-mail<br/>
you with their solution and get the PLB/certificate for solving.<br/>
<br/>
If you have not ever read through the clues before, you might want to take a<br/>
look at Mapsurfer's Hatbox Caper (http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box53.html)<br/>
for an idea similar to this -- find all of the characters and based on their<br/>
appearance and location, work through the clues to figure out who the guilty<br/>
guy was.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be less confusing to people as far as knowing what to do<br/>
and it would eliminate the situation where somebody ran out of time and had<br/>
a suspect in their possession when they went home, leaving an empty<br/>
box/missing piece of the puzzle.  The less moving around of stamps there is,<br/>
the less possibility of things getting lost.  Also one thing to consider<br/>
when you have moving stamps and/or clues -- if one box in the series goes<br/>
missing, you aren't really sure if/what might have gone missing with it.<br/>
This way, you would know what other stamps were included with each room.  If<br/>
you make the suspects and weapons bonus boxes and hide the clues inside the<br/>
room boxes, this would be even less of a problem as a room could go missing<br/>
and you wouldn't necessarily lose anything else.<br/>
<br/>
As for protocol on group projects...<br/>
<br/>
It is up to you how you would want to do it, but in all of the other group<br/>
projects in which I have participated, it is just something letterboxers do<br/>
for one another.<br/>
I have never been monetarily reimbursed and would not expect to be.<br/>
<br/>
I have had it where I was asked to do a box -- stamp and log book -- with<br/>
the only thing provided by the project organizer being the theme, and on the<br/>
other end of the spectrum, I did one where the organizer sent a piece of<br/>
carving medium that had the image transfer already on it because they wanted<br/>
all of the stamps to be identical in size and material.  In another case we<br/>
were sent images via e-mail, and in another the organizer just gave a size<br/>
requirement.  Sometimes the organizer wants to make all of the logbooks so<br/>
they have a common look, but other times they request that the person<br/>
carving the stamp include a log book of their choosing.  It is your call -- <br/>
whatever works the best for your project.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck -- it sounds like a lot of fun!<br/>

I wish I could participate, but it looks too far away.  Love the idea, though.  Could it work if <br/>
it were an activity at a gathering?  <br/>
