                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have good and bad news with Shorty's boxes throughout the past 2 weeks!<br/>
<br/>
Laila(recently replanted and was one of my favorites) is not *quite* all there. WIHI and maybe 2 others would know, but her first stop on the journey is missing. It's the essential part and what made it fun. We will see if it ever surfaces, but until then, I will have a plain clue for her so you can still hunt for her.<br/>
WG16(as I was driving N to go on vacation in FL(I know, N then S?)! I noticed atop the hill his wood wall All GONE! The box was nestled in the wall under a large rock. It had Already a new concrete wall put together... I made a big U'y and hauled up the hill. There was 1 worker bulldozing mud and debris. I asked if he found anything, or the big rock, and he said no. I explained everything, ect.. He said the wood was exposed off in the woods far away... He said if he found anything in the mud piles, he would set it on the indian. I had little hope and coped while on my week long trip. Only to find on the way home with my little hope, THAT IS WAS THERE! He found it in the mud and put it back! WOW! It was tattered bad, and the stamp and log all bent out of condition, BUT I was finally able to use one of those college books for good use! =flattening everything out! Once the WG's home put back together it will be put back as well!<br/>
WG50-While visiting FL, I stopped here, and the area around the entire park was like a standing water field. Surrounding the tree the box was in, and the giant! But, the pouch and the contents were bone dry! Only one finder for him, a name of which I saw a lot down south from findings and from them in other books!<br/>
SWH!-MS A okay, with No finders on such a busy interstate! I-10 travelers, W or E bound, check it out! <br/>
SHW-FL Aokay as well! We have a new boxer in Pensacola, carved her own stamp and all! Also a frequent traveler, so youll see her name in the FL boxes now, NC area boxes soon, and IL boxes when she returns home for visits!<br/>
<br/>
I got lots of finds on all my Peoria boxes so looks like they are good! Happy Trails!<br/>
