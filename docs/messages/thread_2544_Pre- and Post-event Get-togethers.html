database that speedsquare created.<br>
<br>
What we're trying to do is find out how many people might be coming <br>
to a get-together at the Delafield Brewhaus on Friday night (Pre-<br>
event) and/or to a get-together Saturday night at Marty's Pizza (Post-<br>
event) so we can try to reserve some space.  Both of these occasions <br>
will allow more time for letterbox chit-chat and exchanges.<br>
<br>
If you might come to either of these, use the database to record what <br>
time you might get there.  These would be evening times.<br>
<br>
There is no need to make an entry if you are just coming to the main <br>
event during the day.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>

P.S.  I'll post maps tonight to both eating/drinking establishments.<br>
