I thought it was odd that she'd post two words on a Saturday! They "words" were names of boxes which isn't all that unusual.  But, I should have realized it wasn't real when one of the box names was supposedly planted at a local mall about 5 miles from me!  I don't think she ever posts the actual city the boxes are planted in.  But, I thought, "Hey, I never heard of that box, maybe I should go find it today!"<br>
<br>
The worst part is (obviously, since they're fake words), they didn't even help me at all with my card!  You'd think that if I was going to dream about bingo, the least I could do was dream about words I acually have!<br>
