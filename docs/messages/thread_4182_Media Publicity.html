flipping through Family Fun magazine I came across a cardstock add for <br/>
GMC that is titled "Learn it. Love it. Letterboxing" It has a full page <br/>
about what Lb'ing is and even provides an image of a GMC truck and <br/>
gives instructions on how to carve and mount the finished stamp! It <br/>
provides a website where you can experience the Chevy Suburban <br/>
interactive letterbox camp (did not try it). It does list LBNA and AQ.<br/>

Don't worry - you're not alone.  Lots of negative comments on other <br/>
boards.  I also was disappointed to hear about the ad.  I think there <br/>
has been an overabundance of publicity which has led to situations like <br/>
this.<br/>
