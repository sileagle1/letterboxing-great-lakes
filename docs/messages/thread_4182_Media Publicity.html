flipping through Family Fun magazine I came across a cardstock add for <br>
GMC that is titled "Learn it. Love it. Letterboxing" It has a full page <br>
about what Lb'ing is and even provides an image of a GMC truck and <br>
gives instructions on how to carve and mount the finished stamp! It <br>
provides a website where you can experience the Chevy Suburban <br>
interactive letterbox camp (did not try it). It does list LBNA and AQ.<br>
<br>
Family fun is how I got started letterboxing and the original article <br>
was pro enviroment and learning experience. <br>
<br>
I was surprised by the big corp. tie-in.  <br>

Did anyone else see this?<br>

Don't worry - you're not alone.  Lots of negative comments on other <br>
boards.  I also was disappointed to hear about the ad.  I think there <br>
has been an overabundance of publicity which has led to situations like <br>
this.<br>
