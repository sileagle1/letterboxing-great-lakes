WiHi, you're beating me!  I just got a straight line yesterday.  No 6 <br>
packs, no corners, no X.<br>
<br>
And Shorty, did I read that right?  You have only 4 words (or less) <br>
left?  Oy.  I'm not even close to that!<br>
<br>
I thought I was close to the BOS game, but if there are only 14 words <br>
left... I guess not! Although I do need less than 50% of the <br>
remainder so that's something.<br>
<br>
Andrew, where are today's pathetic words?!?!<br>
