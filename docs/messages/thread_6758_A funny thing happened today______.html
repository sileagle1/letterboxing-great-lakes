My letterbox, Pick-A-Bird, was missing from its spot due to the tree it was <br/>
in<br/>
being part a removal area at the Wetland Preserve it was in. Walking out <br/>
there<br/>
today with friends, we stumbled across the box w/logbook and stamp pad but <br/>
no<br/>
stamp. It was about a mile from its plant site, in good condition. It was<br/>
under one of the signposts. Apparently several non-letterboxers have found <br/>
it<br/>

I'm so glad to hear that!  We had wanted to find that box, as you know ... and experienced problems due to the moving of the bench!  Now we'll look forward to 2 boxes in that same preserve!!<br/>
<br/>
See you Saturday at Horsin' Around!<br/>
