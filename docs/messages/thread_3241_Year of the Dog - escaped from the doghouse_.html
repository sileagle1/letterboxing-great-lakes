                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received a report today that my Year of the Dog box was found <br>
severely chewed and all contents were strewn about.  Some type of <br>
animal attacked the box, baggies, logbook and stamp.  All were <br>
recovered but due to the damage, only the stamp was deemed <br>
salvagable.  The finder offered to mail it to me.  When I receive it I <br>
will check it over and then replace as soon as possible.<br>
