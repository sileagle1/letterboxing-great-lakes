This really stinks.  My beautiful losing streak was destroyed on the <br>
5th--and I haven't gotten another word since.  <br>

Bird Woman, I'm having a hard time figure out what stinks!  Are you <br>
upset that the losing streak was broken or you haven't had a word <br>
again in a long time?  LOL<br>

This Bingo thing is pure torture, isn't it?<br>

What would we do without Bingo to while away the winter doldrums (or for<br>

Both :~)    I'm competitive--if my words aren't being called then I <br>
want a "winning" losing streak.  But, since my losing streak WAS <br>
interrupted, it would be nice to start raking in the words.  But no--<br>
no more words called.  In the past 32 days, I have had just one word.<br>
<br>
It IS torture.<br>
