missing. You only need this box if you want to get into the third box <br>
chest (the log book is outside the chest as of now). I wont be able to <br>
replace the 2nd box til Feb. or Mar. so if anyone really wants to do <br>
it let me know I will email you the clues for the second box (because <br>
that is what the stamp for the second box is, clues). Well just <br>
thought I would let you know, thanks to all the people who stopped in <br>
at the box over the summer/fall. Seeing all your log notes today made <br>
my day! <br>

Aww man, this one was near the top of my list of boxes to do!   I <br>
loved your "Time Waits For No Man" box, so I know I have to do this <br>
one eventually!  I'll definitely wait until you get it <br>
replaced.  Thanks for the heads-up!<br>
