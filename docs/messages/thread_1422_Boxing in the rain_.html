                    <div class="plaintext-content">Saturday I got to dump Naughty Dog off to work in Monroe MI and headed to <br>
the two boxes in the Hidden Lake Park in Tipton MI.. what a nice park.. <br>
since it costs $3 per person I think we need to add a few more boxes :-)<br>
First was the Hidden Lakes box. Nice easy walk and we had a deer stand <br>
right next to the location I wanted to search but it didn't seem to notice <br>
the 3 dogs I had with me! Eventually I headed over to that direction. <br>
Unfortunately for me the box was sitting out in the open for all to see! I <br>
stamped in and replaced the box in a nice hiding spot just as it started to <br>
rain.. So we hussled off to the car and the next location in the park.<br>
Big Rooster... now this box caused me some issues.... first the map of the <br>
park shows only one parking lot... wrong! But I parked in the first and <br>
checked every tree looking like Lumiere.... Now it says that it is just off <br>
the beaten path. Well this is open to debate as to what this exactly means. <br>
I had wandered down the hill a bit on what seemed like a foot trail or <br>
maybe a deer trail. No luck! Oh left the dogs in the car cause its still <br>
raining. Well shoot! no box.... but nature was calling and I am no sissy <br>
girl plus I thought I was well hidden... well with my pants around my <br>
ankles I look up to see a pickup truck staring over the edge at me! They <br>
politely  moved on and who knows what they saw! I sure hope it wasn't one <br>
of you guys. Has this ever happened to anyone else?<br>
Off to pick up Naughty Dog so we can do the two boxes in Monroe.... Old <br>
Frenchtown and Lake Eerie Creature #1. I loved the history surrounding Old <br>
Frenchtown but the mosquites after the rain were awful! This is a <br>
letterbox/cache hybrid. SquirrelNut contact me please, found something in <br>
your box you might like to have. Didn't think it appropriate to leave <br>
there... Off to Lake Eerie Creature.<br>
We parked in the lot and are headed in the right direction when I notice a <br>
man, woman and three children. The woman is holding a piece of <br>
paper...hmmmmm. How sneaky can you be with three kids, right. So I wander <br>
up next to her and ask..."So, (me being cool) what is your trail name?" She <br>
blinks in amazement but it was Mama Stork, Sleeping Giant and gang here <br>
from OH. What fun! My first trail exchange. Now did I commit a Faux Pas? <br>
Was I supposed to ask or what? Just checking for next time.<br>
Anyway.... four boxes found while working... doesn't get any better than <br>
that! Well no rain would have been better but can't have everything!<br>

carry a small "purse sized" umbrella in our<br>
Letterboxing Bag to aid in those rainy stamp-ins.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the boxing report, though, since these<br>
boxes (Big Rooster & Lake Eerie Creature #1) are on<br>
our list to hit enroute to/from the gathering (we<br>
found Hidden Lake & Frenchtown last summer).  And it<br>
was fun to read :)  We actually passed the actual Big<br>
Rooster last year and I was quite giddy to hear that a<br>
box had been planted in its honor....we loved Hidden<br>
Lake Garden last year when we visited - we spent half<br>
the day there exploring the place.<br>
<br>
And an exchange, how exciting!  I remember our first<br>
(and so far only) trail exchange - it was with another<br>
area boxer (we're kind of spaced out around the<br>
Cleveland area here).  We'd found the box and were<br>
sitting on a bench a decent distance away stamping in,<br>
and waiting for the coast to clear to replant the box,<br>
when a woman with a messanger bag and a sheet of paper<br>
in her hands came into the vicinity.  "She's a<br>
letterboxer!" Deedle hissed, but I made him be quiet. <br>
After watching her for a few minutes, it was quite<br>
clear that she was searching for the box, since she<br>
was staning in all the spots we'd been just a few<br>
minutes earlier.  So, just as she got to the point<br>
where she'd have to leave the trail to find the box<br>
(which was still with us) we went up to her and said,<br>
"Excuse us, are you looking for this?" and showed her<br>
the box.  The boxer's name was Kelmark, and if you<br>
make it to Nothern Ohio, her boxes (planted in Medina<br>
county) are treats to find.  She makes you walk! :)<br>
<br>
Friday morning our 'boxing weekend begins - can't<br>
wait, can't wait....<br>

And if you look in the photos section of this group (just to the left<br>

most amazing story (you'll have to ask D&D)<br>
I love the story and keep returning to the picture....drawn by an<br>
unknown force......Yeeps!<br>
