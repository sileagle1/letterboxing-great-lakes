Again, for those interested....<br/>
<br/>
I began the day by checking my email and I got an email from Moofie<br/>
and Blaze!  They are very busy, but do hope to get boxin' more.  They<br/>
did ask me to adopt their adopted boxes, so...<br/>
<br/>
I first checked out the new location for Boyhood Adventures #1, as<br/>
Merlin and Ardea had rescued the box and had re-hid it.  As soon as<br/>
the webmasters give me control of the clues, I'll update them.<br/>
<br/>
Then I checked on the MCP/Oak Leaf Estabrook boxes and found that #1<br/>
was missing.  I'm gonna replace it in another location as the current<br/>
location is a bit difficult to get to (now more than ever) and seems<br/>
to be a druggie hangout (now more than ever).  I hope to have it<br/>
replaced sometime this week.  (Speedsquare - good thing you didn't do<br/>
that series thise round!)<br/>
<br/>
I then checked on the rest of the Cambridge Parkway series and<br/>
everything is fine.<br/>
<br/>
Now I got to go back to work. :-(<br/>
