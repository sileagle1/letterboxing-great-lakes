Last summer, we stayed at this state park and looked for a letterbox there,<br>
but could not find it. We probably could have looked longer, but it was<br>
starting to get dark and my little one was getting nervous about that. We<br>
are going camping there again very soon, but now I can't find the clue. Does<br>
anyone know whether this box still exists or if it is gone? All I remember<br>
about it is that you went from near one of the overlooks on a hiking trail<br>
and one of the clues was to look for "twisted metal."<br>
