There's at least one cheese factory where they're making curds right out<br>
where the customers are. While customers are waiting, they can dip their<br>
fingers in and have a snack or three and not a body will go "Eeewwwww.....".<br>

When cows no longer produced enough milk for it to be worth keeping them,<br>
they were slaughtered and, being old dairy cows and on the tough side, were<br>
generally turned mostly into hamburger.  Folks made their own bread and<br>
butter and grew their own onions, so one of those sandwiches made for one of<br>
the cheapest "dinners" around.  Kids were often sent to school with those<br>
sandwiches for lunch because there wasn't money for anything else.  I'd hate<br>
to have to be sitting next to them for the rest of the day, with that odor.<br>
<br>
My grandmother also used to give them out to any "hobos" during the<br>
Depression who happened to be riding the rails and stopped at the farm door<br>
asking for a little food.  My father was always proud that my grandmother<br>
never turned anyone away.  A body always at least rec'd a sandwich.<br>

I don't know if that'd be a good thing or not tho.  :-)<br>

made with thick white bread, buttered, raw ground beef, and onion - and he<br>

You may be referring to steak tartar. When I was younger (uh - at least <br>
40 years ago) it was ALWAYS served at wedding receptions, and was on <br>
the menu at many places. I like my meat rare, but that's overdoing it! <br>

At one time, it was actually illegal to sell and buy margarine in Wisconsin.<br>
Wisconsin was, after all, a dairy state.<br>
<br>
When I was little, we used to drive down here to Illinois in the station<br>
wagon to just over the state line, buy a huge load of it, cover it all up,<br>
and bring it back up to northwest Wisconsin to all the family.  Kind of like<br>
all the folks from Illinois who cross over into Indiana just to buy the<br>
BigBang fireworks.<br>
<br>
Dad hated to drive but Mom always insisted that he drive the return trip<br>
home because she was a speeder and was afraid that if her lead foot on the<br>
accelerator got away from her and she didn't realize how fast she was going<br>
and we got stopped...............oops!<br>
<br>
State troopers were often on the lookout for margarine coming across the<br>
border.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep & Yep - I also remember mixing up the yellow food coloring into the<br>
margarine AND my parents getting some from Illinois.  Was it margarine they<br>
got, or margarine that was already colored yellow?  I'll have to ask my mom<br>
to see if she remembers.   Sounds so bizarre now.  I'm sure my nieces &<br>
nephews would find it as strange as trying to figure out the rotary phone up<br>
at my in-laws summer cottage.<br>

===================================================<br>
Does anyone  else remember when WI tried to limit purchasing margarine?<br>
margarine  came in a white block that looked like lard - and it had a little<br>
capsule of yellow coloring included. My sisters and I had to mix the<br>
coloring into the margarine to make it look more palatable.<br>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br>
At one time, it was actually illegal to sell and buy margarine in Wisconsin.<br>
Wisconsin was, after all, a dairy state.<br>
<br>
When I was little, we used to drive down here to Illinois in the station<br>
wagon to just over the state line, buy a huge load of it, cover it all up,<br>
and bring it back up to northwest Wisconsin to all the family.<br>
