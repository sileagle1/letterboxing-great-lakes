Thanks for tucking #3 back into its hiding place!  The woods where that<br/>
series is located is very popular with dog walkers.  When we were placing<br/>
the boxes, we had to wait several times for dogs &amp; owners to move on down<br/>
the path.  <br/>

As far as the vines go, I guess I need to get more acquainted (from a<br/>
distance of course) with poison ivy. You would think--after getting the rash<br/>
numerous times as a kid--that I would know what it looked like.  Or then<br/>
again, maybe that's why I got it numerous <br/>
<br/>
times as a kid :)   I didn't know the vines could get so thick!!  <br/>

Either Ball Magnet is immune or very lucky, because he loves to go swinging<br/>
around on big vines like that.  <br/>
