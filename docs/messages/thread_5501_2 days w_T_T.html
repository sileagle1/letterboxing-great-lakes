Letterboxing in AZ can't be as much fun as in your home state of WI.  Today, I received notice that one of my letterboxes was found in a block of ice, but it's OK.  Finding a letterbox in ice...now that's a challenge!  <br/>

We have added a few photos of our own here on LbGLK in the photo section (last page <br/>
under Tiptoe &amp; Tonto's Excellent Adventures)  They are out of order, but then again so are <br/>
we!  Today was right up there as one of our favorite hikes and day spent <br/>
letterboxing..Even though, Tiptoe lost her water bottle, MM lost his favorite compass, <br/>
Tonto lost the clues in the rushing water and Wisconsin Hiker just lost her mind with all of <br/>
us!  We also revisited a box from 2 years ago where Tonto lost his watch!  Sad to say, it is <br/>
still missing!<br/>
<br/>
Lots of laughs and letterboxes..and today (unlike yesterday!) we didn't get lost ...not even <br/>
once!<br/>
We couldn't have spent a better New Years than traipsing up and down a water and rock <br/>
filled canyon with Wisconsin Hiker, Martini Man and a million other hikers!  Tiptoe has <br/>
found a new calling.  She became very good at greeting hikers on the trail with a hardy <br/>
and loud "Happy New Years!" to distract the boatload of passing hikers, and to alert Tonto, <br/>
MM and WiHi who were hiding behind the trail looking for a letterbox that "woodpeckers" <br/>
(our code for muggles) were close at hand.  Seriously, in less than five minutes at least <br/>
eight to ten GROUPS of hikers passed within feet of us!  It was a lot more effective than <br/>
Tonto shouting repeatedly at rapid fire speed "Woodpecker! Woodpecker! Woodpecker!" as <br/>
hikers were coming upon our letterboxing scene!<br/>
Great fun!<br/>
BTW...We are giving a New Years toast to trekking poles!<br/>
Happy New Years Everyone!<br/>
Tiptoe &amp; Tonto<br/>
