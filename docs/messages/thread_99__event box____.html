The wonderful artwork that adorns our group's page was an event stamp <br>
created by the list owner and the spirit who got us going here, <br>
SpringChick (who, by the way, is inching towards a significant <br>
letterboxing goal). Deb revealed the design a year ago as we <br>
approached the first Great Lakes Gathering.<br>

I'm thinking glow-in-the-dark boxes? Hmmm...<br>
