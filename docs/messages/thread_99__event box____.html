The wonderful artwork that adorns our group's page was an event stamp <br/>
created by the list owner and the spirit who got us going here, <br/>
SpringChick (who, by the way, is inching towards a significant <br/>
letterboxing goal). Deb revealed the design a year ago as we <br/>
approached the first Great Lakes Gathering.<br/>
