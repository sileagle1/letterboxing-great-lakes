No I didn't see the event, but i will look for the info now that you mentioned it.  Thanks for the warm welcome.<br>

Hey Team Armadillo, glad to see you found your way onto the list!  In our area, geocaching is still much more widespread than letterboxing.  Speaking of area boxers, did you see that Katy and I are hosting a gathering in September?  [shameless plug]  We're hoping that some of the phantom letterboxers from around here and maybe some of the Northern Illinois and Indiana boxers will come.  Should be a great chance to meet some local letterboxers.  Anyway, welcome to the list again! <br>
