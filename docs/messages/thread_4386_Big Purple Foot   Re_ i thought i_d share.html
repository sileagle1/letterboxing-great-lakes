                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for sharing your story with us.  That's one of the aspects of letterboxing that I like...sometimes you see a beautiful area that you might never have seen (sitting on the sofa), and sometimes you meet up with someone on the trail who needs your help. And sometimes there is a local gathering and you get to meet all these adventurous letterboxers and realize....we're all crazy!!!  <br>
<br>
Keep putting one big purple foot in front of the other and happy hiking!<br>
