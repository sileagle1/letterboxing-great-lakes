Your DD wasn't that far off asking what a "cheetah" is...Our definition of a "CHEATAH" is when someone has to give us a blatant clue to a box and we willing except!  We would be remiss to count that as a true find...therefore, we call it a "Cheatah letterbox"!<br>
Now if only we could come up with a great trail name for your DD she just might take a break from all that library stuff and become a top notch letterboxer!<br>
Never give up!  Send her our best!<br>

>> I was asked to share this funny story with others. Here goes.....<br>
>> A fellow letterboxer found a small plastic cheetah figurine inside one of<br>
>> my letterboxes. She wasn't sure why it was there, and decided to just<br>
>> leave it in the letterbox, but she emailed me and told her about it.<br>
>> Someone has geocaching and letterboxing a bit confused. Personally, when<br>
>> there are trinkets inside a letterbox, it could confuse others and <br>
>> someone<br>
>> might think they can take the stamp as a prize. So, I prefer that people<br>
>> not leave trinkets in my letterboxes. So tonight, I asked my daughter if<br>
>> she wanted to come along for a drive while I did some letterbox<br>
>> maintenance. I told her I was in search of a cheetah inside one of my<br>
>> letterboxes. She was confused. She asked me - "I know about cooties and<br>
>> flees, but what is a cheetah?" Awh, don't you love letterbox terms? She<br>
>> thought a cheetah was some sort of letterbox. ROFLOL!<br>
