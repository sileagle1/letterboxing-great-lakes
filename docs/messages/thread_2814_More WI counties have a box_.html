box in every WI county thanks to recent placements by the following:<br>
<br>
The Fantastic Five planted "Shannon The Dragonfly" in Vilas county<br>
<br>
Atom 118 planted "Two for Three" in Lincoln county<br>
<br>
Meandering Melee planted "Rainbow Falls" in Menominee county <br>
<br>
48 WI counties now have a box, and 24 counties are waiting for a box.  <br>
I think aimlesst is planning to put one in Grant county in the near <br>
future and we will try to plant some in the middle of the state if <br>
they still need a box when we head up for a hiking weekend in SEP.<br>

Both Martini Man & I have already each had 2 finders for the boxes we <br>
posted earlier this month in formerly "boxless" counties (Waupaca and <br>
Oconto).  We were happy to see that there was quick interest in these <br>
areas, even though we thought it might be quite a while before they <br>
were found.<br>

People will have to remember to check AtlasQuest to see your clue.  Not that<br>
many WI boxes are listed there, so most people tend to check LBNA more<br>
often.  I'd guess the first to find "Martial Arts: Strength"<br>
  http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=15026<br>
<br>
might be Leapin' Lizards since they travel out that way.  However I'm<br>
guessing they are very BUSY getting ready for their wedding this weekend.<br>

Best Wishes to Leapin' Lizards on the big day!<br>

By the way, I wanted to let the MKE area boxers know that the camo tape<br>
season (known to some as the hunting season) has officially arrived at the<br>
New Berlin Wal-Mart on Moorland Road.  I scooped up 3 rolls today ($3.94<br>
for 20 yards) but left some for others.  I'm guessing they'll probably stock<br>
the tape for the next 2-3 months.  Best to plan ahead for the rest of the<br>
year when it will not be as readily available around here!<br>

Grant County does have 2 boxes now. I'll get the clues up on the<br>
Letterboxing North America site, but they are already posted on<br>
Atlasquest.<br>

Fantastic!  Thanks to Aimlesst, there are now boxes in 49 Wisconsin<br>
counties, with only 23 counties still waiting for a box.  If any of you are<br>
traveling through the state, or perhaps live in a border state, please<br>
consider planting a box in one of these counties.  You could be "First<br>
Planter"!  Here's a link showing the counties:<br>
