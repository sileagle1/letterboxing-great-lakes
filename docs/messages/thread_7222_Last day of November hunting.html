                    <div class="plaintext-content">We saw a few gun hunters out today in search of deer, but of course we were in hunt of BOXES!  The temperatures today weren't as balmy as Friday (even had a few snow flurries in the morning), but we were pleased with our adventures.  We found 7 boxes today and 3 of them were boxes we had tried 1 or more times before.  It was VERY satisfying to finally cross them off our list!  One of the boxes we first tried way back in OCT 2008.  There were just too many people around that day so we had to abandon our hunt.  The same thing happened another time or two.  Another box we had tried 3-4 times before - one time we were thwarted by snow and the others by an overabundance of muggles.  Today was the perfect day to visit these locations.  A cold, breezy, gloomy day meant we had the spots all to ourselves!<br/>
<br/>
We hope you all had a pleasant Thanksgiving weekend and will be able to have a relaxing &amp; fun holiday season as we move into December!<br/>
