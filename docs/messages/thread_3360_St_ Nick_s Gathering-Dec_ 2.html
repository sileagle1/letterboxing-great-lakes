<br>
The bottled water is a very good idea.  While there are water <br>
fountains at that shelter (if I remember right from this fall).  The <br>
odds are very good that since they are outside, they will have been <br>
turned off for the season.  I will try to grab some between here and there.<br>
<br>
I just got a Weather Alert from Weather Underground (my favorite <br>
weather site) stating the drastic weather change will be here in <br>
about 48-60 hours.  Our local weather people should consult <br>
Wunderground for the weather, LOL, because more often than not, they <br>
are right on target - go figure!<br>
<br>
Anyway, see you all there!  My husband just finished up carving our <br>
first carved stamp last night.  We had been using a really, really <br>
old stamp that I had owned since the 90's, LOL!  So, we will have <br>
that stamp with us to use for the first time on Saturday - <br>
Hurray!  It is a little bigger than I expected, but pretty fun (I <br>
think). Mr. Cat Herders put all his drawing skills together with some <br>
really old carving skills to do it.  It may get re-carved one more <br>
time on the pink stuff between here and there because he is a <br>
perfectionist, but oh well!  As long as he is not making me handle <br>
the sharp things, we are good, LOL!<br>

Yeah, I realized we didn't check on that when we checked for <br>
electricity!  Maybe Dragon knows...<br>
<br>
However, if you look at the map I posted <br>
(http://letterboxing.homestead.com/StNickmap.html), you'll see the two <br>
nearby shopping centers.  There are restrooms in the grocery stores and <br>
in some of the restaurants (Subway, Panera, coffee shop, etc).  So <br>
worst case you could jump in your car and drive a mile or two for a <br>
flush toilet.<br>

Best wishes for an easy delivery and healthy new "brat"!  Keep us <br>
posted with updates when you can.  I guess we'll have to wait for the <br>
next event to meet the pack.<br>

he says.  This baby was suppose to be here around Christmas, but I <br>
guess he either wanted his own birth month (since I already have 2 <br>
children that have a B-day in December, and one in January) or it's <br>
because he wants his share of goodies from Santa.  =)  Mom and dad <br>
will be trying to hold the fort down with the other 5 munchkins <br>
while I'm in the hospital.   I was so hoping that they would be able <br>
to make it up there, but they decided not to take the chance if I <br>
ended up in the hospital.  We'll be thinking of you all, and wishing <br>
we were there with you all celebrating.  (HUGS)<br>

The Wilson Center?  Sounds like there's a port in the storm should it be windy and cold. <br>
It's good that FW is thinking about everyone's 'needs.'  We're mainly thinking about food and letterboxes because, after all, that's what's important.  The rest we can figure out and deal with later.  But I was laughing too when I read her million dollar question.
