Has anyone boxing in Wisconsin (Milwaukee and Waukesha counties<br/>
specifically) noticed an increased muggling of boxes lately? I've only been<br/>
at this for about a month, but have already come across upwards of 5 boxes<br/>
strewn about the ground. <br/>
<br/>
I've gathered their contents together each time and tried to locate the<br/>

The DNR clearing them away has become a real problem for certain. There is<br/>
one land manager I know of in this area who has been known to troll<br/>
Atlasquest.com and Letterboxing.org searching for boxes to get out of her<br/>
park. <br/>
<br/>
Some people have begun to recommend no longer putting the "muggle cards" in<br/>
the boxes, just explaining "this is a letterbox. Please do not destroy or<br/>
