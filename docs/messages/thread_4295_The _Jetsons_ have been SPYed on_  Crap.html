who has been visiting my Jetsons Series in Haslett near East Lansing, <br>

I'm so bummed and disappointed that we all are put in such a crappy <br>

This is not a group of children running rough shot across the<br>
landscape tearing up boxes, please get information before reacting in<br>
such a manner. There is no crappy position to be put in. I found your<br>
boxes and placed them right back where I found them AND hid them<br>
better than the person there before me. I am the person with the SPY's<br>
logo in my stamp, I defy anyone to show me a box I have left in any<br>
shape worse than the way I found it.<br>
