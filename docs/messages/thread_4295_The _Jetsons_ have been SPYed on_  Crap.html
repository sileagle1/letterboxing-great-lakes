who has been visiting my Jetsons Series in Haslett near East Lansing, <br/>

This is not a group of children running rough shot across the<br/>
landscape tearing up boxes, please get information before reacting in<br/>
such a manner. There is no crappy position to be put in. I found your<br/>
boxes and placed them right back where I found them AND hid them<br/>
better than the person there before me. I am the person with the SPY's<br/>
logo in my stamp, I defy anyone to show me a box I have left in any<br/>
shape worse than the way I found it.<br/>
