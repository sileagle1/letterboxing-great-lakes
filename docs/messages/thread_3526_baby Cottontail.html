What a beautiful work of art and tribute you have made in honor of <br/>
little Joseph Cottontail.  It was such a kind and fitting thing to do <br/>
and you did it with such grace.  I have learned something from you and <br/>
maybe others have as well.  Thank you so much for sharing and making all <br/>
the rest of us feel better as our hearts are heavy for all of The <br/>
Cottontails.<br/>
