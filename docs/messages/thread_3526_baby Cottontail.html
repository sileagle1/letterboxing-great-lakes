What a beautiful work of art and tribute you have made in honor of <br>
little Joseph Cottontail.  It was such a kind and fitting thing to do <br>
and you did it with such grace.  I have learned something from you and <br>
maybe others have as well.  Thank you so much for sharing and making all <br>
