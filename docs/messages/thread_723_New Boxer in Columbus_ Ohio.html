Hi all,<br>
<br>
My name is Amy McIntire and I live in Columbus, Ohio. I am very<br>
interested in getting started with this neat thing called<br>
Letterboxing! I would love to meet some of you at a gathering<br>
sometime. Please e-mail me at amyscrapdiva@yahoo.com, I would love to<br>
get to know all of you and chat about all sorts of newbie stuff. If<br>
any of you live in Ohio, I would love to meet up and go box hunting.<br>
I am really thinking about placing boxes too, but I kind of want to<br>
get me "feet wet first".<br>
<br>
I am a stamp designer and scrapbook/rubber stamp artist...that is how<br>
I found out about Letterboxing! I am looking forward in creating<br>
stamp designs for this and would love to do a stamp swap if anyone is<br>
interested.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, hope all of you have a great day and I look forward into<br>
chatting with everyone soon!<br>
<br>

I saw your introduction on the big list & am glad you found your way to the Great Lakes list.  Being from Columbus, I wasn't sure you'd consider this regional list "for you" :)  I'm always happy to learn there are more Ohio 'boxers out there.<br>
 <br>
We're from Cleveland, we being me, Doodle, aka Diane, who boxes with my boyfriend Deedle, aka Jeff.  Ooh, I've studied all those boxes planted just south of Columbus at letterboxing.org, trying to figure out when in the future we can make it down that way to do some hunting.  Looks like that won't be til springtime, but if you're ever up north let us know!  <br>
