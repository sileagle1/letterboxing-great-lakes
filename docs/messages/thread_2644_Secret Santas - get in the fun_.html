                    <div class="plaintext-content">Christmas in July  Secret Santas 2006<br>
<br>
This event was inspired by the great bingo booty prizes.  We are a very impressive and <br>
generous bunch.  Christmas in July is open to all members of the LbGLK group; in order to <br>
get presents, you have to give presents for this to work.<br>
<br>
My experience with Secret Santas is varied.  In one case, we began giving small gifts on a <br>
daily basis for one week, commencing on St. Nicholas Day.  In another, it was just one BIG <br>
gift, on St. Nicolas Day.<br>
<br>
Deadline for sign-up is June 23rd.<br>
<br>
I don't want this to get out-of-control and prevent some from participating so I am <br>
making a decision to put dollar-limit on the total cost.  After you sign-up, please email me <br>
your mailing address (will be forwarded only to your Secret Santa(s)) and indicate, to me <br>
alone, the total amount you would be willing to spend (don't forget postage costs.)<br>
<br>
I am toying with a few scenarios:<br>
<br>
1. One gift exchange  each boxer receives one package from one other boxer (to be <br>
received in July).<br>
2. Weekly exchange  For weeks ending July 9th, 16th, 23rd, and 30th.  (4 weeks)  <br>
surprise the same boxer with 4 small gifts.<br>
3. Same as option #2, but each week the boxer will send a small gift to a new boxer (4 <br>
separate boxers  could be same gift.)<br>
<br>
I will want to select an option quickly, so that participants have time to plan and create <br>
something special.  (Aside  will someone send me the information to make those velcro- <br>
pockets?  I want to know the extra allowance you have for stamps.)<br>
<br>
The database has been created and I started with myself as an example.  If you are a team <br>
and want to participate individually, please use a separate line for each team member.  (I <br>
think Rainy Day Rabbit would be thrilled to have a bottle of rubber scraps to play with.)<br>
<br>
More details will be posted June 24th.<br>

<br>
The way you have structured the spending is something I've not seen<br>
with a Secret Santa program.  So, if you don't mind, I have some<br>
questions/concerns on your criteria for spending.  <br>
<br>
Were you planning to partner up people according to the amount they're<br>
willing to spend (like to like, so to speak) so everyone is getting<br>
something of equal value to what they're giving? Or were you planning<br>
on really being Santa and having the greater givers providing gifts to<br>
the lesser givers (in the spirit of the giving season)<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter to me, as it more about the thought than the gift. (And<br>
I have my gift ideas all ready planned! ehheehehehheh)<br>
<br>
Sorry for all the questions, but other times I've participated in a<br>
Secret Santa event, there has been a set dollar limit that everyone<br>
tried to stick to (ususally $10-$20) so the giving was fairly equal.<br>
<br>
If we're giving to 4 different people at $10 each, that would be $40<br>
and that's not insignificant for some people to budget. However, it<br>
would only be like $2.50 for the same 4 different gifts if $10 were<br>
the total you're willing to spend. (Don't forget postage while doing<br>
your budgets, folks) <br>
<br>
I just wouldn't want someone to feel bad for spending $2.50 for their<br>
Santa when the list starts having messages about the gifts received<br>
and it becomes obvious that some people have gotten much more<br>
expensive gifts.<br>
<br>
Thanks for listening and letting me voice my concern.<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>

supplies that I need to purchase for the project, I generally do not count <br>
the value of supplies I have on hand (unless they are significant) or my <br>
time.  The finished item generally would not fall within the specified <br>
dollar amount if a person were to go out and purchase it.  As an example --  <br>
a few years ago the crochet eyelash yarn scarves were very popular.  You <br>
could easily whip one of these things up for a few bucks worth of yarn and a <br>
couple evenings of your time.  While the yarn would fall into the set <br>
monetary value, the finished scarf would be significantly more if a person <br>
were to purchase it at a craft fair, etc.  In other situations, items are <br>
found on sale or clearance at significant savings over the original price <br>
and even though it appears to be a more costly item, the actual amount the <br>
giver spent was within the set limit.  To me this is part of the fun of the <br>
Secret Santa thing in the first place (actually any gift-giving venture) --  <br>
matching the gift to the person and getting the most for my money while <br>
doing it.  So you see, you really cannot make comparisons between items <br>
people receive and I think people need to understand that from the outset.<br>

<br>
While I have some time, let me add my thoughts from the comments thus far:<br>
<br>
I am very concerned about the equality issues.  That is why I asked for opinions on a <br>
spending cap. I was thinking, ten to twenty dollars (total activity max), whichever option is <br>
decided.  I entered my name into the database for an example, but I really should not be <br>
participating.  Life is really getting in the way right now, and the last thing I should be <br>
worried about is letterboxing.  I went ahead and removed my name.  I would have <br>
probably made my gift item(s).  I agree with SpringChick about the value of time and <br>
materials on hand.<br>
<br>
The one thing I would like to convey about "equal value."<br>
<br>
Equal value is in the eye of the beholder.  To me, a gift is something you give, or receive, <br>
with no expectation of reciprocity.  I see this all the time, and I wish more people would <br>
challenge it.  I spend a lot of time planning my gift-giving.  Last Christmas Aunt <br>
speedsquare did not go out and spend 30-50 dollars on each nephew and niece.  She <br>
wrapped up the great-looking LbGLK patch and a certificate to each of them.  The <br>
certificate entitled the bearer of one full day of outdoor activity with their aunt.  The older <br>
kids looked it over, said "cool, a patch," then tossed it aside for the next gift to be opened.  <br>
This reaction is no different than the years before when we spent much more money on <br>
them.  The youngest, 5-years old, really loved the gift and the certificate.  Of course, we <br>
still have to spend the day with them (they haven't picked a day yet), and it will probably <br>
cost a lot in gas to visit them this year, but it's the thought that counts.<br>
<br>
If someone is concerned about not getting an item of equal value, then maybe this activity <br>
isn't for them.  Or we rename it the "booty exchange."<br>
<br>
Keeping the dollar value low, say under $5, means that everyone will need to be more <br>
creative.  I was thinking, how cool it would be if someone were to send me a postcard each <br>
week from an area he/she went boxing and the postcard included an image from a <br>
favorite letterbox that day.  Kind of a "wish you were here" type of gift.  Anticipation of <br>
something in the mailbox is the best part for me.  And I would treasure that far more than <br>
a store-bought item costing far more.<br>
<br>
Here's a thought.  Do we really need to tell everyone about the gifts we send/receive?  The <br>
Bingo game was different in that it was a game of friendly competition.  I don't liken this <br>
activity as a game.  I think we need to be considerate with each others' feelings.  So I <br>
would not be in favor of publicly discussing "what we got for Christmas."<br>
<br>
Please continue your comments.  I will be the first to admit I haven't thought of everything <br>
yet.  See that disclaimer.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There sure is a lot of talk about $$$ and the Secret Santa idea.  The best gifts don't cost much at all.  Why is it that we want to regulate the cost of the gifts to assure that it's a fair and even gift exchange?  Life isn't always fair or even.  Some things can't and shouldn't be regulated. <br>
<br>
Some of the best gifts I've received don't have much of a $ value at all.  I don't knit, so I don't have any of those fancy yarns that some letterboxers use to tie their logbook pages together.  So when someone recently sent me an assortment of yarns (a couple yards of each color tied onto pieces of cardboard), it was the best gift in the world in my eyes!!!  If you tried to figure out the cost, I'm sure it wouldn't come to much at all.  It's the thought that counts.  It's about surprises, and sharing, and thinking about the other person, and the real spirit of Christmas and Ho Ho Ho!  A post card says I'm thinking of you, but it only costs less than 50 cents to buy a card and then mail it.  Gifts that are hand made are more personal too.  <br>
<br>
Or, we don't have to do Secret Santas....we can just send out random acts of kindness with no strings attached.  <br>
<br>
Just me thoughts tonight.  I know that everyone has their own opinion of this subject.  <br>

want to do the secret santa thing.<br>
<br>
You have a point that everything in life isn't fair, but that doesn't<br>
mean we can't sometimes try to make parts of it more equitable. In my<br>
opinion, it's unrealistic to have a discussion about gift giving<br>
without including the topic of budgets and expectations.<br>
<br>
And I believe more than one person has already made the comment that<br>
it's not about the gift, but about the thought, so we'll just include<br>
you with the rest of us who feel that way.<br>
<br>
My wife has been talking about the secret santa thing for a couple of<br>
days now and it seems her greatest concern is getting her assignment<br>
so she can start working on learning about her person in order to be<br>
able to pick out a good gift for them. She's been working on a survey<br>
or list of questions based on one they had between her homecare nurses<br>
 and the hospice nurses last year. Her second concern is making sure<br>
we end up in a port with a post office within bike-riding distance<br>
when it comes time to mail the gift package. :-)<br>

The best gifts don't cost much at all.  Why is it that we want to<br>
regulate the cost of the gifts to assure that it's a fair and even<br>
gift exchange?  Life isn't always fair or even.  Some things can't and<br>
shouldn't be regulated. <br>

all.  I don't knit, so I don't have any of those fancy yarns that some<br>
letterboxers use to tie their logbook pages together.  So when someone<br>
recently sent me an assortment of yarns (a couple yards of each color<br>
tied onto pieces of cardboard), it was the best gift in the world in<br>
my eyes!!!  If you tried to figure out the cost, I'm sure it wouldn't<br>
come to much at all.  It's the thought that counts.  It's about<br>
surprises, and sharing, and thinking about the other person, and the<br>
real spirit of Christmas and Ho Ho Ho!  A post card says I'm thinking<br>
of you, but it only costs less than 50 cents to buy a card and then<br>
mail it.  Gifts that are hand made are more personal too.  <br>
