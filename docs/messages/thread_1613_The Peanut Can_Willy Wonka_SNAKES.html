<br>
My weekend consisted of Charlie and the Chocolate<br>
Factory (brilliant, but as I have never seen Willy<br>
Wonka, I only have the book to compare it to....and I<br>
read it in the 3rd grade...those squirrels were<br>
definately demonic, nutty and I couldn't wait to see<br>
Veruca Salt attacked), deciphering my passport (100%<br>
successful, trip around the world now in planning<br>
stages), and having my eye-balls glued to Harry Potter<br>
(which has inspired my co-workers and I to concoct a<br>
crack-pot theory that Harry Potter and the Star Wars<br>
Saga are essentially the same story. Yes, this is what<br>
social workers discuss over lunch.) At 1:00pm Sunday<br>
afternoon, I decided that being holed up in my house<br>
like a hermit reading and sleuthing was vaguely<br>
pathetic....and went letterboxing. As I was getting on<br>
US 31, my mother calls to report that it's raining<br>
torrentially in the general direction I'm heading. It<br>
was beautifully sunny when I left my house!<br>
Undeterred, I went to Berrien County, MI.....where it<br>
had just stopped raining....started at the rest area<br>
and was too freaked out by the speeding cars, muggles,<br>
traffic to think straight about the clue. Went to one<br>
spot and didn't find a clump of stumps. I had an<br>
unusual amount of paranoia about the rest stop,<br>
thought the cops would come after me or something.<br>
Decided to wait until I had company to try again.<br>
Optimistically, I headed to Warren Woods. First off, I<br>
was freaked out again because this loop is very<br>
deserted and I was alone. I gave a half-assed attempt<br>
to find the box, and decided that I would just try<br>
again when I try for the first box (safety in<br>
numbers!). On the way back to the car, in the middle<br>
of the trail was a huge, black SNAKE. Now, i've<br>
encountered snakes before...but this one was BIG and<br>
taking up the entire right side of the trail. It's<br>
head was facing the left side. It's at this point that<br>
I begin swearing and praying simultaneously. It's like<br>
Indiana Jones, I HATE SNAKES! So I stand there,<br>
approximately 100 feet from my car (which is on the<br>
other side of the serpent), and weigh my options. I<br>
can A: attempt to go around the snake, but risk it<br>
strking out at my legs as I go by B: get a running<br>
start and jump over the snake, risking it striking as<br>
well. C: Step back 20 feet and throw sticks with the<br>
hope that it will mosey on across the path. I chose<br>
option C....I threw some small sticks at it. Nothing.<br>
So I just stood there still for a few minutes.....and<br>
then the freaking thing decides that I'M not a threat<br>
and crosses the trail, allowing me to pass. I got back<br>
to the car and decided, NO MORE LETTERBOXES TODAY! So<br>
all of that, and not one letterbox to speak of! But<br>
yet another adventure to write about :)<br>
<br>
Ug, snakes! <br>
