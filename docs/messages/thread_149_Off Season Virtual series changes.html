at the end of April.<br/>
<br/>
It's no longer the "off season" for us sailing types, so I haven't<br/>
the time nor reliable access to the Internet for keeping up the<br/>
Honor Roll additions.<br/>
<br/>
Basically the whole Virtual Letterbox series will go to a simple<br/>
system of "On-Your-Honor"<br/>
<br/>
The HONOR ROLLS will continue to be added to and updated but only<br/>
until the end of April. The Honor Roll files will remain in place<br/>
on our Yahoogroups site though  so if you want a smidgen of fame, <br/>
get your name added before it's too late. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link directly to the message which has further details.  <br/>
(Note: You'll need to be signed it to yahoo for the link to work) <br/>

The clues to all our boxes are listed in the files area, including <br/>
the virtual series.<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>
