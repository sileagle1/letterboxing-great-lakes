&gt; I was thinking someone should call it soon, since usually this interim game<br/>
&gt; is called in February.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only interim game that is left now is the "+" (the entire "N" column and<br/>
&gt; the middle row of the card).  Then it will be the race for a Full Card.<br/>

&gt; P.S.  Martini Man will be disappointed since he had 3 corners and was<br/>
&gt; waiting for "just one more word...".  And amazingly he doesn't have a single<br/>
&gt; word in his "N" column yet!<br/>

&gt; For a while I kept a pen near my chair so that I could mark off my bingo<br/>
&gt; squares. The pen finally wandered away but I probably didn't notice for<br/>
&gt; weeks since I've been going through quite a dry spell. When I read this word<br/>
&gt; I was so busy looking around for my pen that I didn't even notice that I had<br/>
&gt; four corners! Bingo!!<br/>
