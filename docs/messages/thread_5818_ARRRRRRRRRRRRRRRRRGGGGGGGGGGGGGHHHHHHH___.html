 Well, apparently, we've been having our updates on our boxes sent to our Spam folder and then immediately deleted....for probably the last 2-3years...maybe.UGH! Appologies to anyone out there that sent a message that was not returned...I just saw an message pop up about one of our boxes and then when I opened the inbox, NOTHING! So, I checked the spam settings..."Delete immediately" ...Changed that and within a few minutes had an update in the spam box...This will probably make it much easier to keep tabs on some of our boxes now...Appologies again to anyone that we "ignored" without our knowledge.<br>
