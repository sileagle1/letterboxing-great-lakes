But I'm not sure about packages.  It's a shame I didn't realize it was coming from Champaign...we're hoping to get up there on Saturday.  Actually, we *were* planning on it, but Flying Dragon hasn't been feeling well and I just found out today that the person who is supposed to be working for me on Saturday is sick...probably with the same thing that has kept two of my other coworkers home all week.  So maybe it's a good thing it got sent through the USPS after all!<br/>

I like the fact that you had a disclaimer on your Email.<br/>
<br/>
The package did not make it :-(<br/>
<br/>
The person to whom its going will probably be a bit late to the gathering  so <br/>
here's hoping it shows up early!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. IF it does make it to the SILO please think of something meaningful to  <br/>
write to thank my Dad and/or "any" Vietnam Veteran. I don't want any "Thanks <br/>
for  the nice stamp," comments.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
