the Faire....we know nearly every inch of that property! Meeting <br>
Dragon was a delight! in his velvety green pants in 85 degree heat! <br>
Ugh! I don't know how those people did it back then, and only took <br>
baths twice a year?  Ugh again! Do you really think that is true? Saw <br>
everything from soup to nuts when it came to costumes and if you are <br>
a people watcher, it's worth the price of admission to just sit and <br>
watch everyone.  I loved that part as much as the letterboxing!  <br>
There is lots to do and great food and drink. "Here, here!"  We were <br>
cheap and went back to our vehicle for out brown bagged lunch so we <br>
could save a little for the treasures we wanted to take home with us. <br>
 <br>
Learned a lot about clues and interpreting them and sometimes the <br>
obvious was just that....TOO OBVIOUS!  To echo Shutterfly,  "What <br>
bell" "Oh, that bell" DUH! I think this should be an annual thing for <br>
doing at the Faire.  Great fun and the environment is charming! The <br>
wood sprites were my favorite charaters.  Just wish I could do a <br>
British, Scottish or Irish accent well.  The cast of players are <br>
great and always in character....and many of the patrons attending <br>
also dressed up and just flowers in your hair would be fun! <br>
<br>
Enjoyed meeting Jane the Phool too!  She was a stitch.  She plays the <br>
perfect part at the Faire, is a stamper and loves to letterbox! If <br>
you decide to go....wear some flowers in your hair, sunscreen on your <br>
person, comfortable shoes, backpack is great for carrying <br>
supplies,and be sure to have some of the vegetable tempura before you <br>
leave!  Yum.... Dragon, Thanks for putting together those great clues <br>
and keeping that watchful eye on us!  :) <br>

PS:  Are you out there "K" and "Star with an S" in it?  we saw your <br>
stamps but don't know who you are! Reveal yourselves to us.....did <br>
you find all the letterboxes? <br>
