days, it's in our "verbal pre-nup," he will be allowed<br>
to get a beagle dog, but alas, the house we'll be<br>
living in for the meantime is way too small, esp. with<br>
3 cats in it already :)<br>
<br>
My philosophy on naming pets is to use uncommon names<br>
that you couldn't get away with naming your human<br>
offspring unless you wanted them to get picked on<br>
mercilessly and/or you're a movie star.  Hence, the<br>
cats are named Zoelle, Zane and Zander.  As for your<br>
beagle, I think Pandora is a lovely name - actually,<br>
isn't there a letterboxer who uses Pandora as her<br>
trail name?  <br>
<br>
Doodle Bug.<br>

(Can you tell I'm really bored at work today?)<br>
