days, it's in our "verbal pre-nup," he will be allowed<br/>
to get a beagle dog, but alas, the house we'll be<br/>
living in for the meantime is way too small, esp. with<br/>
3 cats in it already :)<br/>
<br/>
My philosophy on naming pets is to use uncommon names<br/>
that you couldn't get away with naming your human<br/>
offspring unless you wanted them to get picked on<br/>
mercilessly and/or you're a movie star.  Hence, the<br/>
cats are named Zoelle, Zane and Zander.  As for your<br/>
beagle, I think Pandora is a lovely name - actually,<br/>
isn't there a letterboxer who uses Pandora as her<br/>
trail name?  <br/>
