You had to have filled out your bingo card and mailed it and the <br>
booty prize to springchick by the end of last year.  If you didn't do <br>
that, you wouldn't be able to play officially.  But, you could always <br>
look up the word list, fill out your sheet and play along with <br>
us.  You wouldn't be able to win any of the prizes, but it'd be fun <br>
anyway.  The info sheets are in the files section, and they're <br>
probably a "words already called" info sheet set up in the database on Yahoo.<br>
