I'd love it if you would adopt my boxes.  How does that work?<br>

What a wonderful opportunity!!!  Tiptoe has two teachers in her building going to Mexico <br>
and Hungary to teach next year...But, we must say, that it is a bit extreme of a move just to <br>
avoid the long winters!  Just kidding!  We will miss you and hope you keep up with all of <br>
the shennanigans on the LbGLK board...We look forward to the window into your world on <br>
your blog!<br>
Our prayers are with you as you begin this great adventure!<br>
