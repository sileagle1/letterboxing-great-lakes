Maybe wait a couple of weeks if anyone is going to go looking for it there,<br>
because I just bought 4 rolls last week and that was all they had out on the<br>
shelf, so unless they had more in the back, they'll have to reorder.  But 90<br>
percent of the time, when I walk in there, they do have it in stock.  I have<br>
no idea who buys the stuff besides me but I'm the only one around here who<br>
seems to buy it in bulk.  :-)<br>

I work just across the street from that Walmart in VH.  I'll check again.  Then, I'll stock up. <br>
I haven't heard from you in a while.  Glad to know that you're still hooked like the rest of us.  You stamps were among my first finds and my first inspirations. I still have the Culver's coin.  We should meet and work on our calcium replacement therapy program.  LOL<br>

American Science and Surplus store in Geneva, Illionis ... cheap! I <br>
don't know if carry it regularly or not, but it's worth checking out if <br>
you're lucky enough to have a store nearby (or make a day out of it and <br>
head to the Geneva store and pick up the Batavia, Geneva, and St. <br>
Charles LBs to boot!). The duct tape was back in the "army gear" area. <br>
Even if they don't have the tape there, it's always a fun store to <br>
browse around ... you never know WHAT you'll find there! <br>
