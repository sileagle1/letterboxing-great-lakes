                    <div class="plaintext-content">So those of you not from Minnesota, I'm not sure if you know how much snow we have gotten recently...<br>
<br>
First, the snow unleashed fury upon Minneapolis and surrounding areas around the second week of December, dropping about 20 inches in some places of snooooow!<br>
<br>
The Metrodome collapsed, a blizzard was called by the national weather service, roads were closed everywhere because it was unsafe for even plows to travel! <br>
<br>
After the storm passed, the snow didn't cease... we have recently gotten around another 6 to 10 inches along with the mess that accumulated from the blizzard... <br>
<br>
Long story short, OLJ and myself have a tradition of going boxing on holidays, no matter what!<br>
<br>
This year was no different, we put on the long underwear, snowpants, boots, gloves, scarves, multiple jackets and loaded in the car to seek out our holiday boxes!<br>
<br>
Lucky for us it wasn't snowing today! However we had to trek through feet upon feet of snow just to get a drive-by! <br>
<br>
We were semi-successful, we sought out winter friendly boxes but I don't think most boxers when placing winter friendly boxes are expecting 2+ feet of snow in most places, so we still had quite the challenge! We attempted 4 and found 2! <br>
<br>
Hope everyone's holidays are filled with hope and the wish that no matter what the circumstances you remain steadfast when seeking out those winter boxes!<br>
<br>
Merry Happy Christmas Holiday!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's dedication!  We still haven't been on the hunt for any boxes this<br>
month, but that will change this coming week.  No big trip planned, but not<br>
much snow around here, so we plan to be out & about a bit here and in<br>
northern IL later in the week.<br>

Hope everyone had a nice day today with family and/or friends!  (but sorry<br>
to hear that the weather caused some you to cancel family plans or caused<br>
you to get  stuck/delayed traveling)<br>

So those of you not from Minnesota, I'm not sure if you know how much snow<br>
we have gotten recently...<br>
<br>
First, the snow unleashed fury upon Minneapolis and surrounding areas around<br>
the second week of December, dropping about 20 inches in some places of<br>
snooooow!<br>
<br>
The Metrodome collapsed, a blizzard was called by the national weather<br>
service, roads were closed everywhere because it was unsafe for even plows<br>
to travel! <br>
<br>
After the storm passed, the snow didn't cease... we have recently gotten<br>
around another 6 to 10 inches along with the mess that accumulated from the<br>
blizzard... <br>
<br>
Long story short, OLJ and myself have a tradition of going boxing on<br>
holidays, no matter what!<br>
<br>
This year was no different, we put on the long underwear, snowpants, boots,<br>
gloves, scarves, multiple jackets and loaded in the car to seek out our<br>
holiday boxes!<br>
<br>
Lucky for us it wasn't snowing today! However we had to trek through feet<br>
upon feet of snow just to get a drive-by! <br>

Hope everyone's holidays are filled with hope and the wish that no matter<br>
