My husband would probably start taking bids for people to take his spot, if he wasn't looking forward so much to getting out of the snow. He doesn't really like Nascar but he's going for my sake because it was hard to pass up the tickets when they were offered to us.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to watch for me in the crowd. I'll be the one wearing a Carl Edwards tshirt ;o)<br/>
