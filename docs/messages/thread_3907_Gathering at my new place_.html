to get settled into my new apartment in Westmont, Illinois (near <br/>
Downer's Grove). But I'm back, and ready to invite everyone over for a <br/>
social house-warming party or two!<br/>
<br/>
Friday, April 20 - from 7pm - 10pm (or so)<br/>
Saturday, April 21 - from 3pm - 6pm <br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP so I know how many people to expect on which day: My new <br/>
apartment is not as big as the Silo, and although I would love to see <br/>
everyone there (and yes there will be a new letterbox involved), I am <br/>
also planning to have small craft day gatherings at my house in the <br/>
future, for chatting and crafting (sewing, stamp carving, etc).<br/>
