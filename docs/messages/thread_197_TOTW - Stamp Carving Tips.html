                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I think like many others, my first stamp (Chinook Pier) read <br>
backward.  I wish now I would have kept it, but at the time I just <br>
was thinking how could I have done that? and quickly carved a new <br>
one.<br>
<br>
When I carve, I do the most difficult parts first -- for me this <br>
usually means the lettering because I hate doing letters.  Then I <br>
move on in order of difficulty...  Since it is more likely to mess <br>
up on the difficult parts, this way I wouldn't have as much time <br>
invested should I need to scrap it and start over.<br>
<br>
Shading is always tricky when hand-carving.  A couple of ways I have <br>
had [moderate] success with shading are using various sized sewing <br>
needles (can also use paperclips and other pointy objects) and <br>
poking many closely-spaced holes into the area to be shaded.  This <br>
usually requires several test stamps to get the effect I am looking <br>
for...  Remember, you can always take more off, but you cannot put <br>
anything back.<br>
<br>
Another way of shading that I learned from Ruthann Zaroff, is cross-<br>
hatching.  Using the #1 Speedball tip (the small "V"), lightly drag <br>
it across the area to be shaded in parallel rows, and then drag <br>
perpendicuarly across these cuts.  The trick is applying the right <br>
amount of pressure -- too little and you don't get anything, too <br>
much and you risk cutting away pieces of the carving material.  But <br>
when done correctly, it gives a very nice effect.  One little trick <br>
with this is to do the cross-hatching BEFORE you carve away the <br>
areas around it.  This gives a more even effect and also eliminates <br>
the chance of hacking off a piece of the outline. <br>
<br>
One last thing -- in regards to not being able to put it back if you <br>
mess up or carve off too much...  I have had some success using <br>
super glue to fix boo-boos.  I dab it onto the rubber with a <br>
toothpick and then put back the cut off piece, being very careful <br>
not to get glue on the surface of the stamp (ink will not adhere to <br>
super glue).  Not ideal, but really beats carving a new stamp if the <br>
error is small and you have a lot of time invested.<br>

   <br>
Yeah, I hate letters, too. And I know that I read someplace to do the <br>
most difficult parts first is wise for another reason. There is apt <br>
to be more carving material surrounding the smaller parts earlier in <br>
the process and thus they have more support alongside the very fine <br>
cuts.<br>
<br>
Another tip I learned from SpringChick at last year's Gathering is <br>
this:  When you think the stamp is finished, it probably is. <br>
It's time to quit. I think we've all taken "one more tiny cut" that <br>
we wished we hadn't.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I cut away from the design when ever possible. I also try to <br>
move/rotate the carving material as much as possible, instead of <br>
moving the carving tool around. Doing it this way I can keep the <br>
carving tool facing away from me (and my other fingers) and control <br>
the design a bit more. I try to raise up the carving material on <br>
something that it will stick to temporarily (like a small acrylic <br>
block). The block can then be rotated around on the table. <br>
<br>
I also use a strong light and magnifying glass. As I get towards the <br>
end of the carving process, I do test prints using a darker ink <br>
(Adirondack) that washes off the stamp when done.<br>

I'm curious about what tools you use? X-acto? Lino block carving <br>
gouges -- which ones? Other custom tools (i.e. SpringChick's shading <br>
tools)?<br>
It seems I'm always trying something different to solve some problem <br>
I've had with a carving. I've even re-ground some discarded dentist <br>
tools to make special knives and scrapers.<br>
And I won't even get into image transfers, sources of art, mounting <br>
the rubber, or preferred sizes.<br>
I eagerly await SpringChick's workshop next month at the "Cooler by <br>
the Lake" Gathering.<br>
