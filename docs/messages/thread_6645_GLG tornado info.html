have gone on either side of Jubilee park if they had kept going.  I guess<br>
it's good that I went back to camp when I did, because sure enough I would<br>
have been headed toward where another tornado had just happened 10 minutes<br>
before. And it looks like I was driving right past the Beason one as it was<br>
happening (but about 10 miles away, near Lincoln).  Phew!  The green arrow<br>
on the map is where I'm guessing I was at somewhere around 11:00 p.m.  The<br>
direction of it does explain the winds going in the opposite direction from<br>
what they had been before.<br>

Look at the last picture, where all the tornados and high winds are shown.  Now mentally draw a map from Peoria up to Chicago, around the bottom of the lake, and all the way across Michigan on I-94.  The two routes overlap!  I can't decide whether to share this with my family or not - they may not ever let me leave the house again...<br>
