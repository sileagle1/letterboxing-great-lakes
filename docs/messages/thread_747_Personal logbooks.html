<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh!  A question about what to do with the images you collect!  Can I<br/>
answer this one?  Can I?  Pleeeeease?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ok, I think there was a topic of the week a while back about personal<br/>
logbooks, how did people arrange theirs and what did they do with those<br/>
images.  If you search the archives, there's answers in messages 304, 300,<br/>
and 287 (although I seem to remember more).  On the "big" letterboxing list<br/>
there will be many, many more ideas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I've personally seen three different ways to archive your found images<br/>
(though I'm sure there's more):<br/>
&gt; - keeping the images in a book reserved just for the purpose, where you<br/>
stamp in, then record as much or as little as you like.  My mother-in-law<br/>
does it this way, and she'll record the name of the box, the placer, the<br/>
date, and a little blurb about the trip.<br/>
&gt; - keeping the images in a scrapbook style, which is what I do.  I stamp in<br/>
on a piece of cardstock (good for me, since it usually takes me a couple of<br/>
tries to get a good image), then when I get home, I mount the image in a<br/>
book that's too big to carry around "in the field".  I'll add pictures, and<br/>
a narrative.<br/>
&gt; - index cards.  The image is stamped on one side, and information about<br/>
the box is recorded on the other side.  The cards are then filed in a card<br/>
box.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Like I said, I'm sure there's more ways out there to record your finds,<br/>
and I think that after a very short time, your personal logbook becomes more<br/>
personal than a 7th grader girl's diary- and in my case, just as cluttered.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>

&gt; &gt;1. What do you do with the collected stamped images.  <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;I mean - it sounds really cool to go on the treasure<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;hunt, but is there anything that anyone does with the<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;images you get??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good question.  Being new to the hobby myself I really haven't thought<br/>
this one through at all.  I suppose I'll be one of those people that just<br/>
has a collection of relatively useless images to look at from time to time<br/>
for some good memories and maybe to help introduce others to the hobby.  At<br/>
the very least, it'll be something to harass my family with at family<br/>
gatherings and holidays.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;2. Stamps...Is it ok to use the pre-made stamps<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;instead of carving my own?<br/><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A lot of people really like to find hand-carved stamps in the boxes they<br/>
find, but I think most would agree that they're always thrilled to just<br/>
succesfully find a box regardless of whether the stamps are hand-made or<br/>
store bought.  Personally I carve my own because I like to carve stamps<br/>
(which I didn't really know until I tried it) and because it's much cheaper<br/>
than buying stamps.  However, if you have neither the time nor inclination<br/>
to carve I see no problem with using a stamp you already have (and aren't<br/>
very likely to use again).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;3. Stamps in a box.  I am seeing on the posts that a<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;lot of the stamps relate to the location of the box. <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;Is that something like, If I place a box in a forest I<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;would use a leaf stamp, if in a garden a flower stamp,<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;if in a cemetary, a headstone stamp?  Or can they be<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;all totally unrelated - like "I placed this box on<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;Halloween I'm using a witch" type of thing?<br/><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing is young in the US and we're kind of making the "rules" up as<br/>
we go.  Even in the UK where it has been fairly well established there<br/>
aren't really hard and fast rules.  Some people think it's important for a<br/>
stamp to relate to it's location somehow while others don't really care.  I<br/>
fall into the later category.  So far, my stamps have very loosely related<br/>
to their location.  My hidden village series is placed where it is because I<br/>
could find all of the elements they represent (sort of).  My Kame Kasuri box<br/>
is placed on a trail where I came across a turtle while scouting for hiding<br/>
spots but it's more coincidence than planning.  And my fish series is being<br/>
placed near water but the more important factor was that I really like the<br/>
park I'll be placing them in...not that any of the species in this series<br/>
live anywhere near the lake they're being placed near anyway.  Some of my<br/>
other stamp ideas (such as Aina's name in Japanese characters) will have<br/>
absolutely nothing to do<br/>
&gt;  with their location.  I think most would agree that you should plant<br/>
boxes where you feel they should go and that the journey is ultimately more<br/>
important than the box's actual content.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;4. Clues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The kinds of clues you write are entirely up to you.  You can make them as<br/>
easy or as difficult as you want to.  If someone doesn't like how your clues<br/>
are written, they don't have to look for your box...and that's ok.  My clues<br/>
(so far) have all been pretty easy and straight-forward because I'm not<br/>
terribly imaginative when I write them.  They are also written that way, in<br/>
part, because the hobby is very new to this area and I feel that it's<br/>
important for new letterboxers to be succesful when they are just starting<br/>
out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;5. Leaving Clues.  Do you leave clues in<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;Letterboxing.org only or are there other places I'd<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;need to post them? Is that where I would mention that<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;you need to bring your own stamp pad and other<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;notations on perhaps where you would park, etc?<br/><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing.org is probably the fastest way to get your clues out there<br/>
for people to see...but there are certainly other places.  Some people have<br/>
their own websites they post clues on, you can post them to any letterboxer<br/>
lists you're on, or you could even make them word of mouth clues that don't<br/>
get posted anywhere.  And yes, I always mention notations in my clues (where<br/>
to park, how to get to the location if it's hard to find, bring your own<br/>
ink, trail hazards [such as steep hills, terrain unsuitable for small<br/>
children or wheels, poision ivy, ticks, road crossings, etc], any rules<br/>
specific to the location [like if dogs aren't allowed], and an approximation<br/>
of trail length and/or how long the hike will take).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope that answers your questions.<br/>

I have to say I find Asylum Lake *waaaaaay* creepier than Blanche Hull.  Too many zombie movies, I guess.  And after dark?  You're a way braver (or dangerously obsessive compulsive) person than I am!<br/>
<br/>
You know, if I were a quilter like my mom is, I'd consider turning my stamp images into a quilt (kind of like the quilt she's making me of old racing shirts).  Any quilters out there?  Care to try that one for all of us and see how it turns out?  It could become quite a little cottage industry for you.  I think THAT would be the most unique logbook I'd ever seen!<br/>

&gt; Aww shucks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to say I find Asylum Lake *waaaaaay* creepier than Blanche Hull.<br/>
Too many zombie movies, I guess.  And after dark?  You're a way braver (or<br/>
dangerously obsessive compulsive) person than I am!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You know, if I were a quilter like my mom is, I'd consider turning my<br/>
stamp images into a quilt (kind of like the quilt she's making me of old<br/>
racing shirts).  Any quilters out there?  Care to try that one for all of us<br/>
and see how it turns out?  It could become quite a little cottage industry<br/>
for you.  I think THAT would be the most unique logbook I'd ever seen!<br/>

&gt; I do mine way #1 -- I use a special little leather log book (am just<br/>
&gt; finishing up #3) and stamp both finds and placements in chronological<br/>
order.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes I will get them a bit out of order if I am doing a series and<br/>
&gt; don't quite finish but know that I will be back soon for the others -- I<br/>
&gt; will leave room to keep them together.  And sometimes I will carve up a<br/>
&gt; bunch of stamps and log them as placements before they are actually<br/>
placed.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes I do 1 stamp per page, sometimes 2, depending on the size of the<br/>
&gt; stamp, if they are related and how much I feel like writing -- I always<br/>
put<br/>
&gt; the box name, the date, the placer and when it was placed and sometimes<br/>
&gt; other notes about the area, the trail, the weather, the clues, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the beginning my intent was to do a scrapbook type journal -- although<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; probably wouldn't have been nearly so coooool as Del's -- but found I much<br/>
&gt; preferred spending my time carving stamps and making boxes than prettying<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; my own log book.  I also tried using blank 4"x6" index cards at one<br/>
time -- <br/>
&gt; when I finished up with log book #1 -- with the intent to slip them into a<br/>
&gt; photo album and make notes on the back of each one.  I did this because<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; perfectionist in me liked the idea of getting a second chance at a stamp<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; also because it doesn't force the chronological thing and I could keep<br/>
&gt; placements in one section and finds in another and keep series together,<br/>
&gt; etc.  But it didn't work for me -- I just ended up with a pile of stamped<br/>
&gt; index cards that somehow didn't appeal to the journal lover in me like<br/>
&gt; paging through my little leather book did.  So I abandoned that method and<br/>
&gt; began little leather journal #2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But...  here is the anal part -- I didn't want my journals to have a gap<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; there were about a dozen boxes I had found and stamped onto index cards<br/>
&gt; between journal #1 and #2.  Fortunately they weren't any further away than<br/>
&gt; Kalamazoo and Saugatuck, so I went back (it was January as I recall) to<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; them stamped into my new journal -- yup, climbed all 200+ stairs at Mt.<br/>
&gt; Baldy again (actually the 3rd time since I didn't find the box until the<br/>
2nd<br/>
&gt; time) and went back down to Kalamazoo at which time I discovered what a<br/>
&gt; creepy place Blanche Hull Nature Preserve is after dark (it's the whole RR<br/>
&gt; track thing -- I have a phobia).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will have to say that Delirium's log book is the nicest I have seen and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; wish I had the discipline to keep such a nice record of my letterboxing<br/>
&gt; experiences.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh!  A question about what to do with the images you collect!  Can I<br/>
&gt; answer this one?  Can I?  Pleeeeease?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, I think there was a topic of the week a while back about personal<br/>
&gt; logbooks, how did people arrange theirs and what did they do with those<br/>
&gt; images.  If you search the archives, there's answers in messages 304, 300,<br/>
&gt; and 287 (although I seem to remember more).  On the "big" letterboxing<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; there will be many, many more ideas.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I've personally seen three different ways to archive your found images<br/>
&gt; (though I'm sure there's more):<br/>
&gt; &gt; - keeping the images in a book reserved just for the purpose, where you<br/>
&gt; stamp in, then record as much or as little as you like.  My mother-in-law<br/>
&gt; does it this way, and she'll record the name of the box, the placer, the<br/>
&gt; date, and a little blurb about the trip.<br/>
&gt; &gt; - keeping the images in a scrapbook style, which is what I do.  I stamp<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; on a piece of cardstock (good for me, since it usually takes me a couple<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; tries to get a good image), then when I get home, I mount the image in a<br/>
&gt; book that's too big to carry around "in the field".  I'll add pictures,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; a narrative.<br/>
&gt; &gt; - index cards.  The image is stamped on one side, and information about<br/>
&gt; the box is recorded on the other side.  The cards are then filed in a card<br/>
&gt; box.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Like I said, I'm sure there's more ways out there to record your finds,<br/>
&gt; and I think that after a very short time, your personal logbook becomes<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; personal than a 7th grader girl's diary- and in my case, just as<br/>
cluttered.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cheers,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;1. What do you do with the collected stamped images.  <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I mean - it sounds really cool to go on the treasure<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;hunt, but is there anything that anyone does with the<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;images you get??<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good question.  Being new to the hobby myself I really haven't thought<br/>
&gt; this one through at all.  I suppose I'll be one of those people that just<br/>
&gt; has a collection of relatively useless images to look at from time to time<br/>
&gt; for some good memories and maybe to help introduce others to the hobby.<br/>
At<br/>
&gt; the very least, it'll be something to harass my family with at family<br/>
&gt; gatherings and holidays.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;2. Stamps...Is it ok to use the pre-made stamps<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;instead of carving my own?<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A lot of people really like to find hand-carved stamps in the boxes they<br/>
&gt; find, but I think most would agree that they're always thrilled to just<br/>
&gt; succesfully find a box regardless of whether the stamps are hand-made or<br/>
&gt; store bought.  Personally I carve my own because I like to carve stamps<br/>
&gt; (which I didn't really know until I tried it) and because it's much<br/>
cheaper<br/>
&gt; than buying stamps.  However, if you have neither the time nor inclination<br/>
&gt; to carve I see no problem with using a stamp you already have (and aren't<br/>
&gt; very likely to use again).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;3. Stamps in a box.  I am seeing on the posts that a<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;lot of the stamps relate to the location of the box. <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Is that something like, If I place a box in a forest I<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;would use a leaf stamp, if in a garden a flower stamp,<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;if in a cemetary, a headstone stamp?  Or can they be<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;all totally unrelated - like "I placed this box on<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Halloween I'm using a witch" type of thing?<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing is young in the US and we're kind of making the "rules" up<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; we go.  Even in the UK where it has been fairly well established there<br/>
&gt; aren't really hard and fast rules.  Some people think it's important for a<br/>
&gt; stamp to relate to it's location somehow while others don't really care.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; fall into the later category.  So far, my stamps have very loosely related<br/>
&gt; to their location.  My hidden village series is placed where it is because<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; could find all of the elements they represent (sort of).  My Kame Kasuri<br/>
box<br/>
&gt; is placed on a trail where I came across a turtle while scouting for<br/>
hiding<br/>
&gt; spots but it's more coincidence than planning.  And my fish series is<br/>
being<br/>
&gt; placed near water but the more important factor was that I really like the<br/>
&gt; park I'll be placing them in...not that any of the species in this series<br/>
&gt; live anywhere near the lake they're being placed near anyway.  Some of my<br/>
&gt; other stamp ideas (such as Aina's name in Japanese characters) will have<br/>
&gt; absolutely nothing to do<br/>
&gt; &gt;  with their location.  I think most would agree that you should plant<br/>
&gt; boxes where you feel they should go and that the journey is ultimately<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; important than the box's actual content.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;4. Clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The kinds of clues you write are entirely up to you.  You can make them<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; easy or as difficult as you want to.  If someone doesn't like how your<br/>
clues<br/>
&gt; are written, they don't have to look for your box...and that's ok.  My<br/>
clues<br/>
&gt; (so far) have all been pretty easy and straight-forward because I'm not<br/>
&gt; terribly imaginative when I write them.  They are also written that way,<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; part, because the hobby is very new to this area and I feel that it's<br/>
&gt; important for new letterboxers to be succesful when they are just starting<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;5. Leaving Clues.  Do you leave clues in<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Letterboxing.org only or are there other places I'd<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;need to post them? Is that where I would mention that<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;you need to bring your own stamp pad and other<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;notations on perhaps where you would park, etc?<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing.org is probably the fastest way to get your clues out there<br/>
&gt; for people to see...but there are certainly other places.  Some people<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; their own websites they post clues on, you can post them to any<br/>
letterboxer<br/>
&gt; lists you're on, or you could even make them word of mouth clues that<br/>
don't<br/>
&gt; get posted anywhere.  And yes, I always mention notations in my clues<br/>
(where<br/>
&gt; to park, how to get to the location if it's hard to find, bring your own<br/>
&gt; ink, trail hazards [such as steep hills, terrain unsuitable for small<br/>
&gt; children or wheels, poision ivy, ticks, road crossings, etc], any rules<br/>
&gt; specific to the location [like if dogs aren't allowed], and an<br/>
approximation<br/>
&gt; of trail length and/or how long the hike will take).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope that answers your questions.<br/>

Isn't there some product that allows you to photocopy onto fabric?  <br/>
If so, you could color-photocopy right from your logbook onto fabric <br/>
and voila - instant quilt squares!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh!  A question about what to do with the images you collect! <br/>
&gt; Can I<br/>
&gt; answer this one?  Can I?  Pleeeeease?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, I think there was a topic of the week a while back about<br/>
&gt; personal<br/>
&gt; logbooks, how did people arrange theirs and what did they do with<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; images.  If you search the archives, there's answers in messages<br/>
&gt; 304, 300,<br/>
&gt; and 287 (although I seem to remember more).  On the "big"<br/>
&gt; letterboxing list<br/>
&gt; there will be many, many more ideas.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I've personally seen three different ways to archive your found<br/>
&gt; images<br/>
&gt; (though I'm sure there's more):<br/>
&gt; &gt; - keeping the images in a book reserved just for the purpose,<br/>
&gt; where you<br/>
&gt; stamp in, then record as much or as little as you like.  My<br/>
&gt; mother-in-law<br/>
&gt; does it this way, and she'll record the name of the box, the<br/>
&gt; placer, the<br/>
&gt; date, and a little blurb about the trip.<br/>
&gt; &gt; - keeping the images in a scrapbook style, which is what I do.  I<br/>
&gt; stamp in<br/>
&gt; on a piece of cardstock (good for me, since it usually takes me a<br/>
&gt; couple of<br/>
&gt; tries to get a good image), then when I get home, I mount the image<br/>
&gt; in a<br/>
&gt; book that's too big to carry around "in the field".  I'll add<br/>
&gt; pictures, and<br/>
&gt; a narrative.<br/>
&gt; &gt; - index cards.  The image is stamped on one side, and information<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; the box is recorded on the other side.  The cards are then filed in<br/>
&gt; a card<br/>
&gt; box.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Like I said, I'm sure there's more ways out there to record your<br/>
&gt; finds,<br/>
&gt; and I think that after a very short time, your personal logbook<br/>
&gt; becomes more<br/>
&gt; personal than a 7th grader girl's diary- and in my case, just as<br/>
&gt; cluttered.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I mean - it sounds really cool to go on the treasure<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;hunt, but is there anything that anyone does with the<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;images you get??<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good question.  Being new to the hobby myself I really haven't<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; this one through at all.  I suppose I'll be one of those people<br/>
&gt; that just<br/>
&gt; has a collection of relatively useless images to look at from time<br/>
&gt; to time<br/>
&gt; for some good memories and maybe to help introduce others to the<br/>
&gt; hobby.  At<br/>
&gt; the very least, it'll be something to harass my family with at<br/>
&gt; family<br/>
&gt; gatherings and holidays.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;2. Stamps...Is it ok to use the pre-made stamps<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;instead of carving my own?<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A lot of people really like to find hand-carved stamps in the<br/>
&gt; boxes they<br/>
&gt; find, but I think most would agree that they're always thrilled to<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; succesfully find a box regardless of whether the stamps are<br/>
&gt; hand-made or<br/>
&gt; store bought.  Personally I carve my own because I like to carve<br/>
&gt; stamps<br/>
&gt; (which I didn't really know until I tried it) and because it's much<br/>
&gt; cheaper<br/>
&gt; than buying stamps.  However, if you have neither the time nor<br/>
&gt; inclination<br/>
&gt; to carve I see no problem with using a stamp you already have (and<br/>
&gt; aren't<br/>
&gt; very likely to use again).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;3. Stamps in a box.  I am seeing on the posts that a<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;lot of the stamps relate to the location of the box. <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Is that something like, If I place a box in a forest I<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;would use a leaf stamp, if in a garden a flower stamp,<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;if in a cemetary, a headstone stamp?  Or can they be<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;all totally unrelated - like "I placed this box on<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Halloween I'm using a witch" type of thing?<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing is young in the US and we're kind of making the<br/>
&gt; "rules" up as<br/>
&gt; we go.  Even in the UK where it has been fairly well established<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; aren't really hard and fast rules.  Some people think it's<br/>
&gt; important for a<br/>
&gt; stamp to relate to it's location somehow while others don't really<br/>
&gt; care.  I<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Over the past years, several people have commented on our Oberon leather<br/>
logbooks/journals.  They are refillable with many standard hardbound books,<br/>
including some available at Michael's (w/40% off coupon!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for a special present for yourself or another<br/>
letterboxer, one place to buy these journals is from another letterboxer.<br/>
RaqsEnigma (from IL but now living in Portland, OR) sells these via an<br/>
on-line business called the MonkeyHouse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Here's a link to see the large selection available:<br/>

<br/>
I just thought I'd pass the info along since we generally get<br/>
questions/compliments on our books.<br/>
