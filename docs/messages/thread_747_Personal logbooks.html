finishing up #3) and stamp both finds and placements in chronological order.<br>
Sometimes I will get them a bit out of order if I am doing a series and<br>
don't quite finish but know that I will be back soon for the others -- I<br>
will leave room to keep them together.  And sometimes I will carve up a<br>
bunch of stamps and log them as placements before they are actually placed.<br>
Sometimes I do 1 stamp per page, sometimes 2, depending on the size of the<br>
stamp, if they are related and how much I feel like writing -- I always put<br>
the box name, the date, the placer and when it was placed and sometimes<br>
other notes about the area, the trail, the weather, the clues, etc.<br>
<br>
In the beginning my intent was to do a scrapbook type journal -- although it<br>
probably wouldn't have been nearly so coooool as Del's -- but found I much<br>
preferred spending my time carving stamps and making boxes than prettying up<br>
my own log book.  I also tried using blank 4"x6" index cards at one time -- <br>
when I finished up with log book #1 -- with the intent to slip them into a<br>
photo album and make notes on the back of each one.  I did this because the<br>
perfectionist in me liked the idea of getting a second chance at a stamp and<br>
also because it doesn't force the chronological thing and I could keep<br>
placements in one section and finds in another and keep series together,<br>
etc.  But it didn't work for me -- I just ended up with a pile of stamped<br>
index cards that somehow didn't appeal to the journal lover in me like<br>
paging through my little leather book did.  So I abandoned that method and<br>
began little leather journal #2.<br>
<br>
But...  here is the anal part -- I didn't want my journals to have a gap and<br>
there were about a dozen boxes I had found and stamped onto index cards<br>
between journal #1 and #2.  Fortunately they weren't any further away than<br>
Kalamazoo and Saugatuck, so I went back (it was January as I recall) to get<br>
them stamped into my new journal -- yup, climbed all 200+ stairs at Mt.<br>
Baldy again (actually the 3rd time since I didn't find the box until the 2nd<br>
time) and went back down to Kalamazoo at which time I discovered what a<br>
creepy place Blanche Hull Nature Preserve is after dark (it's the whole RR<br>
track thing -- I have a phobia).<br>
<br>
I will have to say that Delirium's log book is the nicest I have seen and I<br>
wish I had the discipline to keep such a nice record of my letterboxing<br>
experiences.<br>

live anywhere near the lake they're being placed near anyway.  Some of my<br>

I have to say I find Asylum Lake *waaaaaay* creepier than Blanche Hull.  Too many zombie movies, I guess.  And after dark?  You're a way braver (or dangerously obsessive compulsive) person than I am!<br>
 <br>
You know, if I were a quilter like my mom is, I'd consider turning my stamp images into a quilt (kind of like the quilt she's making me of old racing shirts).  Any quilters out there?  Care to try that one for all of us and see how it turns out?  It could become quite a little cottage industry for you.  I think THAT would be the most unique logbook I'd ever seen!<br>

Isn't there some product that allows you to photocopy onto fabric?  <br>
If so, you could color-photocopy right from your logbook onto fabric <br>
and voila - instant quilt squares!<br>

logbooks/journals.  They are refillable with many standard hardbound books,<br>
including some available at Michael's (w/40% off coupon!).<br>

 <br>
<br>
If you are looking for a special present for yourself or another<br>
letterboxer, one place to buy these journals is from another letterboxer.<br>
RaqsEnigma (from IL but now living in Portland, OR) sells these via an<br>
on-line business called the MonkeyHouse.<br>

<br>
Here's a link to see the large selection available:<br>

I just thought I'd pass the info along since we generally get<br>
questions/compliments on our books.<br>
