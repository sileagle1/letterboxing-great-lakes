natural antidote to poison ivy, and is often growing nearby (or at <br>
least in wetter areas).  Also known as spotted touch-me-not, if you <br>
rub the leaves of jewel weed on skin that has been exposed to poison <br>
ivy, you improve your chances of avoiding a rash (or so I've heard - <br>
I don't think I'm allergic to poison ivy, and I've definitely hiked <br>
my way through it often enough).  Jewel weed is a shrubby-type of <br>
plant with lovely, small orange flowers (which bear some spots). <br>

Can you toss the clothing in the washing machine, or would that then <br>
