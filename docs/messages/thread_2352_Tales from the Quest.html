                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last Saturday we set off on a quest for the Bring Out Your Dead box <br/>
to acquire the image and another piece of the Holy Grail code.   <br/>
During our visit to the area, unlike the mighty Dragon, we were not <br/>
aware of anything "pushing on our chest", but something obviously <br/>
bewitched us.  Was it the spirits or the groups of gamboling maidens <br/>
who appeared to be on some type of historical quest themselves?  <br/>
Whatever the cause, when we departed the dead we had brought forth, <br/>
we unknowingly left our personal marks behind  yes, our signature <br/>
stamps!   <br/>
<br/>
We continued on throughput the weekend, shopping at markets, tidying <br/>
the hovel and feasting with friends, none the wiser about our tragic <br/>
loss.  However we were made aware of it Sunday evening when a missive <br/>
arrived via our magical mailbox. The gallant band of knights from the <br/>
north, Papeseed, Triclops &amp; Escher, had discovered our stamps and <br/>
took them with them for safekeeping. Knowing their importance, they <br/>
wasted no time in dispatching them southward again and we gratefully <br/>
had them in our inky hands by Wednesday.  Blessings upon them!<br/>
<br/>
So beware on your quest, there may be unexpected dangers along the <br/>
way  However there may also be unexpected luck and kindness!<br/>
