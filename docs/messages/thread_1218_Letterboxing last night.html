                    <div class="plaintext-content">Naughty dog and I decided it was much too nice to go home and work in the <br>
yard. So we packed a picnic supper and the dogs backpacks and set off for <br>
Ft. Custer in Augusta.<br>
The first set of boxes that we coveted were the Breakfast Elves. Since we <br>
had all three dogs with us I decided it would  not be prudent for both of <br>
us to tromps into the woods after Snap! dragging or being dragged by the <br>
dogs. So let's take turns I thought. Being the nice girl that I am, I let <br>
Naughty dog go after Snap! Unfortunately the last people there, in early <br>
April, did not rehide the box but merely laid it on the ground beside its <br>
hiding spot. The box was wet inside but the logbook and stamp are fine. <br>
This box did not have an outer bag to help protect it, FYI Azobox. As we <br>
are sitting there reading the logbook the Posse alerts us to someone trying <br>
to sneak up on us. I tell Naughty dog to stash the box and head over to the <br>
dogs to keep them from tangling the biker up as he descends down the path <br>
with his Brittany off leash! Geesh, Naughty dog is about as covert as a <br>
child trying to hide the fact that he has been eating chocolate!<br>
Delighted in our find we ambled off to find Crackle. When we came upon the <br>
location, forgot to tell you Naughty dog is reading the clues and I am <br>
reading the compass, he sends me off in a different direction then the <br>
clues state. He had this "funny" idea that he would send me off on a wild <br>
goose chase as he ran over to the other side of the trail and snatched the <br>
box. Well, he didn't think very far ahead because he was holding the dogs <br>
and trying to take them to the hiding spot. When I head back to the trail <br>
frustrated for not finding the box I see him and the dogs tangled in bushes <br>
and prickers and they all can't move. He confessed his sin and I could have <br>
beaten him to death if he didn't look so dang funny hog tied there in the <br>
woods. So I untangle them and set off in the right direction. Still I can't <br>
find the box. So I go back and let Naughty dog try. As I read the clues I <br>
discover that he left out an important piece of information!! He is really <br>
dead now!! He finds Crackle in his hiding place which seems to have eluded <br>
many a boxer I am soon to discover.<br>
Off to find Pop! Down the trail we head when we come to a crossroad. As we <br>
discuss which way to go a couple is walking down the path. I head off to <br>
one side of the trail to keep them contained while Naughty dog is hollering <br>
Brenda this way! I shhh! him and tell him we aren't supposed to show them <br>
where we are going!!! He knows better at this point to locate Pop! himself <br>
so he waits for the rest of us to arrive. I hear an awful sound and we must <br>
have disturbed a crane because he sounded mad. But we located Pop! and I <br>
could do my happy dance without anyone seeing..... Both Crackle and Pop <br>
were okay but only Pop had an outer bag to protect it.  Finish the trail <br>
and stop at a picnic table to have dinner and bevie of choice :-)<br>
Still light out... can't we try for Kazoo Dog's box, we still have time? <br>
Naughty dog agrees as he knows he needs some brownie points. We get to the <br>
location and spend about 10 minutes arguing about where we should start! I <br>
give up and let him lead. Dang if he wasn't right, I hate when that happens.<br>
We find box #1 and head off for #2. Now it is about 9 pm and it is getting <br>
dark. No problem we can do this, keeping in the back of my mind that the <br>
park closes at 10 pm. We struggled but could not find #2. I am sure because <br>
it was too dark to see. So we abandon the search and head off in what <br>
Naughty dog thinks is the way back. After walking and checking compass for <br>
about a half an hour and me begging to turn around and just back track to <br>
the car, we manage to find a sign that says main trail head and we make it <br>
back with a few minutes to spare.... Wow! what a time we had... but would <br>
do it again in a heartbeat. Made a great ending to the day!<br>
Oh and in box #1 the last people to stamp in were from Colorado.. which I <br>
thought was great, some interstate action!<br>

Hey Posse!<br>
Thanks for the entertaining report on the Breakfast Elves. I'm happy<br>
you were successful. And thanks for rescuing "Snap". As you noticed,<br>
not everyone who seeks those boxes finds them all. I suppose I should<br>
note in the clues to be wary of very fast bicyclers on those trails.<br>
We (Artistamp and I) also tried to find the KazooDog #2 over there but<br>
were not successful. I believe the Kammalot gang from Battle Creek did<br>
find it but not by following the clues as written. (hmmmm)<br>
<br>
If/when you go back, check out "Flutterby" also at Fort Custer.<br>
