                    <div class="plaintext-content">Remember, there aren't any hard and fast rules for letterboxing (other than being considerate of others)...do whatever YOU feel is appropriate.  When I recarved my signature stamp, I went for a totally different image.  My original stamp was based off of a picture of my dog Aina wearing her kimono.  My current signature stamp is based off of a picture of me wearing a kimono (with a lot of artistic license taken with the kimono itself and the addition of some maple leaves).  The stamp I mostly use to stamp into log books is a "min" version of my signature stamp and uses a motif from Aina's sig. stamp (a geometric shape...that also happens to be in my kimono but got cut off entirely when I "miniaturized" my image).  For me, this motif is important...so all of my signature stamps from now on will incorporate it somehow.  But beyond that one motif, I can't say that anything else will stay the same next time I decide I need a new signature stamp.<br>

<br>
It's so funny that I saw this post.  I just carved my new signature <br>
stamp this month.  I had decided that after I hit 100 finds I would <br>
a.) stop counting and b.) give myself a new sig. stamp.  I decided to <br>
make it MUCH more detailed that my old one, but still have it so I can <br>
incorporate my old sig. stamp.  That's just something I decided to do, <br>
if you like the current stamp you have then go ahead and use that same <br>
image!  I say go for it.  Move in whatever direction the spirit takes <br>
you.<br>
