I like the stuff from WalMart too.  It is more expensive than buying it by the roll, but I did find it less shiny, and stronger with the fabric fibers in it (does that really make a difference for our purposes??).  I like the fact that it is a flat "roll" - takes up less space when toting it around in the field.  I think they only carry it during hunting season - at least that's what I was told once.  <br/>

I buy mine right at Walmart. Sometimes it seems to be a popular item<br/>
(hopefully for the right reason -- that there are lots of letterboxers out<br/>
there hiding boxes), and they're out of it. They always get s'more within a<br/>
couple of weeks.<br/>

the paint section and is a roll just like all the other duck/duct tapes that<br/>
painters use.  It's carried the entire year (except when they run out and I<br/>
might have to wait and week or two til the new supply comes in).  I've never<br/>
checked their "guns" or "hunting" section for the stuff so I had no idea<br/>
there was more than one style of the stuff.<br/>
