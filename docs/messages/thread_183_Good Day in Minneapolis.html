her pilgrimage, I'm just chauffeur) to MOA.<br/>

Speaking of carving, I finally picked up one of those Speedball carving sets<br/>
(40% off Michaels coupon), so I have a "real" tool, not just a scalpel!<br/>
Hopefully my carving will move up from the "pathetic" category.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to tell you guys my idea for one of my GS camp boxes, since you<br/>
can't come looking for them (Sorry!!!).  I don't know if anyone's done this,<br/>
but I'm going to make an altered book (my other passion) with a niche inside<br/>
it to hide the stamp.  The book itself will then become the journal that the<br/>
girls record their stamps in.  (Obviously it will be "hidden" on a shelf<br/>
inside a lodge, not outdoors.) Okay, so that's like #587 on my list of<br/>
things to do.  I'll show you how it comes out in about 3 years when I finish<br/>
it!<br/>

Subject: Good Day in Minneapolis<br/>
<br/>
I was a misplaced easterner with a few hours to kill in Minneapolis<br/>
Having done some research prior to my trip, I knew where I wanted to go.<br/>
I managed to find 3 boxes at the Bass Ponds. All great finds by the way.<br/>
<br/>
Then I went in search of The Four Elements.<br/>
Got 'em all. Great set of clues.<br/>
Awesome stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Deb Rocks gets my vote for carver of the year.<br/>
I was thinking of doing the Dan Brown ambigrams too, but after seeing how<br/>
well yours came out, I don't want to attempt it.<br/>
Great work!<br/>
<br/>
I did not see a stamp in the first book, but I may have missed it because I<br/>
was #2 in all the rest.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
