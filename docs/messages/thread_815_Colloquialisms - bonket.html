Bonket? Silly me! I thought it was pronounced: bl - long A - ket!! <br/>
ROFL ... no wonder the guy at the Dutch bakery looked at me so funny <br/>
when I asked for some for the office Christmas party last year.<br/>
<br/>
I bought four of those fantastic almond pastry treats for our party <br/>
and they were gone almost instantly.  Later that night, one of the <br/>
locum tenens Doc's was "caught" in the kitchen wolfing down a whole <br/>
one of the 'logs' and drinking milk straight out of the carton.  <br/>
<br/>
His confession, "I haven't had this since I left home for Med <br/>
School." (We forgave him, and he personally made Olie Bollen for <br/>
those of us working the Urgent Care Center on New Years Eve.)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
