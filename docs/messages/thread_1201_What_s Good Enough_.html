Pigment inks seem to leave the stamp messier than dyes.  I usually use dye inks and water-based markers just because they dry faster and there is less chance of smearing in my log book.  But I've heard of people who prefer to use pigments because they tend to be more fade-resistent.  I have found that stamps that are wrapped either in a cardboard stamp wrapper or a piece of felt or even just a piece of paper toweling, tend to stay the cleanest.  The ones just placed in the baggie are often messy and gooey with ink.  You just have to trust that people are going to take care of it and wipe it after use, etc.  I have to say that most of the boxes I have been to here in West Michigan have been very well taken care of by the finders.<br>
<br>
Don't worry about your stamp.  Some of my favorite stamps have been carved by kids or are somebody's first carving, etc.  I tend to be a deep carver -- this makes the details more pronounced, but it also leaves the stamp a bit weaker and more prone to pieces breaking off.  As you carve more, you will develop a feel for what works and is comfortable for you -- just takes time and practice.  Until then -- anything you carve is good enough!<br>

I've run across some pretty gunked up stamps that still make a good<br>
impression, even with detail.  Pigment inks seem to leave the stamp messier<br>
than dyes.  I usually use dye inks and water-based markers just because they<br>
dry faster and there is less chance of smearing in my log book.  But I've<br>
heard of people who prefer to use pigments because they tend to be more<br>
