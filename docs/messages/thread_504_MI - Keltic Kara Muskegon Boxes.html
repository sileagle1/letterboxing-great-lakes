in the past couple of weeks placed by Keltic Kara.  I found 4 of her <br/>
new boxes on Friday afternoon and went back out for another <br/>
yesterday afternoon with Old Shoe, only to come home to see that <br/>
additional clues had been posted.  So this afternoon I went out for <br/>
a couple of hours and nabbed 2 more.  Have a couple left to do to <br/>
finish off the Lumbertown Series.<br/>
<br/>
Since those first boxes on Friday afternoon, I have been selfishly <br/>
keeping this little secret to myself -- well, okay I spilled to two <br/>
other MI 'boxers...<br/>
<br/>
Of course it is exciting for me because theses are the first boxes <br/>
placed in Muskegon by somebody other than me with the exception of 1-<br/>
2 placed by vacationers.  Yup that's right folks -- after 2 years <br/>
of 'boxing, I am finally able to look for a letterbox in my own <br/>
city!  It is true...  if you plant them, they will come (it just may <br/>
take a while).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you are at all near Muskegon or your travel plans can be <br/>
modified to include a stop here, you should check out these boxes.  <br/>
I thoroughly enjoyed the ones I have found -- all with very nice <br/>
stamps and logbooks and a thoughtful variety of clues with some nice <br/>
bits of area history thrown in for good measure.  Of course, I want <br/>
you to look for my boxes while you are in town also, but I am <br/>
resilient -- if your time is limited, at least go for a few of <br/>
these.  You won't be disappointed and hopefully seeing some stamps <br/>
in the logbooks will encourage her to plant more!<br/>
<br/>
A big thanks to Keltic Kara (whom I don't believe is a member of <br/>
this group...  yet?)<br/>

Thanks for your generous endorsement for my newly planted <br/>
letterboxes.  I truly think I'm getting addicted to this hobby, and <br/>
it has certainly helped to have so many of your boxes to search for <br/>
so close to home.  Carving stamps and creating clues has definitely <br/>
tapped into my visual/creative side, and I have ideas brewing for <br/>
more boxes.  Stay tuned!  Keltic Kara<br/>
