                    <div class="plaintext-content">You may have noticed the proliferation of new Muskegon letterboxes <br>
in the past couple of weeks placed by Keltic Kara.  I found 4 of her <br>
new boxes on Friday afternoon and went back out for another <br>
yesterday afternoon with Old Shoe, only to come home to see that <br>
additional clues had been posted.  So this afternoon I went out for <br>
a couple of hours and nabbed 2 more.  Have a couple left to do to <br>
finish off the Lumbertown Series.<br>
<br>
Since those first boxes on Friday afternoon, I have been selfishly <br>
keeping this little secret to myself -- well, okay I spilled to two <br>
other MI 'boxers...<br>
<br>
Of course it is exciting for me because theses are the first boxes <br>
placed in Muskegon by somebody other than me with the exception of 1-<br>
2 placed by vacationers.  Yup that's right folks -- after 2 years <br>
of 'boxing, I am finally able to look for a letterbox in my own <br>
city!  It is true...  if you plant them, they will come (it just may <br>
take a while).<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you are at all near Muskegon or your travel plans can be <br>
modified to include a stop here, you should check out these boxes.  <br>
I thoroughly enjoyed the ones I have found -- all with very nice <br>
stamps and logbooks and a thoughtful variety of clues with some nice <br>
bits of area history thrown in for good measure.  Of course, I want <br>
you to look for my boxes while you are in town also, but I am <br>
resilient -- if your time is limited, at least go for a few of <br>
these.  You won't be disappointed and hopefully seeing some stamps <br>
in the logbooks will encourage her to plant more!<br>
<br>
A big thanks to Keltic Kara (whom I don't believe is a member of <br>
this group...  yet?)<br>

Thanks for your generous endorsement for my newly planted <br>
letterboxes.  I truly think I'm getting addicted to this hobby, and <br>
it has certainly helped to have so many of your boxes to search for <br>
so close to home.  Carving stamps and creating clues has definitely <br>
tapped into my visual/creative side, and I have ideas brewing for <br>
more boxes.  Stay tuned!  Keltic Kara<br>
