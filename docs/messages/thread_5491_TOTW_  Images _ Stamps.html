Do you have a pile of boxes sitting there all made up waiting to be<br/>
planted?  Do you have planted boxes waiting to be clued and listed? <br/>

'definite' plan.  I find that the piles of 'To Be Planted' gets me all <br/>
fidgety and overanxious to go boxing (which sometimes isn't appreciated <br/>
by Coffee Beans or the extended family).  So, right now, I only have two <br/>
stamps carved and waiting to be planted.  Fortunately, we've been on a <br/>
planting binge for the last few months, and we've planted several [I <br/>
won't say how many since a few might include undisclosed bonus boxes] <br/>
that had piled up.   Those didn't bother me so much, because we had a <br/>
master plan in the works...just needed to find time to plant them.  Of <br/>
the two, I have only vague ideas about where to plant them...those are <br/>
the ones that get me fidgety.<br/>
<br/>
As for boxes planted but not clued, I don't know how anyone can do <br/>
that!  I know that I try to get my boxes clued and posted ASAP after <br/>
planting.  (hopefully not at the expense of the quality of our clues)  <br/>
I'm learning to patiently wait for finders...but they can't be found if <br/>
they aren't clued!<br/>
<br/>
I know its not the same...but I have found an outlet by doing a few <br/>
postals and LTCs....<br/>
<br/>
As for the artwork...most of ours we find online...or from a scrap from <br/>
a restaurant  or tourist brochure we've found.  I like to plug the <br/>
drawings into a site that someone here mentioned <br/>
(http://www.dumpr.net/sketch.php) to convert them to nice black and <br/>
white line drawings. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do have a pile of stamps that I fear may never be planted. Some were carved for purposes other than letterboxing. I did a series of stamps as a final project for my human sexuality class...it's not that the images are inappropriate, they're all PG13 at worst and most are G, I just can't come up with anywhere decent. Then there are my Chinese New Year stamps that I could plant if I were motivated enough to scout out locations, I've even thought about making it a single letterbox where the stamp rotates as the years change. Some were carved for an event and the event is either over or I missed the deadline. Some were planted but have been pulled due to various circumstances (such as Coal Miner's Daughter and Aina's series which will go back out in the spring now that they're not closing the park anymore or my DNAngel series which I pulled after over a year with no visitors and the third box kept going missing anyway...not to mention I only ever<br/>
 planted half of that series to begin with). I have quite a few containers ready to go too, but with a lack of good hiding places scouted out they're probably going to sit there for a while. <br/>
<br/>
And I have two more images floating around in my head (sort of). One is a box that I have been meaning to make for over a year now, I have a location scouted out and picked an image already I just need to sit down and carve it. The other is a little foggy...I have lots of reference pictures but I've forgotten what my original idea was, although I think I may have remembered the general plan this morning while walking the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
As for images, many of mine I have found online and modified slightly to suit my design ideas. My absolute favorite source is to find several images (usually photographs) and use trace paper to take bits and pieces of two or more images to make my own. I especially like to use photos that I have taken myself when possible. I have also drawn my own if I just can't find what I like anywhere else.<br/>

Actual boxes ready to go, I guess about 15 ready to go.<br/>

I've brought 3 boxes with me to work everyday for over a month in hopes of  <br/>
getting a route to the area I hope to plant the box . . . with no luck yet  :-(<br/>

I had one magnetic one that I DID get to the spot only to find the metal I  <br/>
was going to stick it to was covered in some kind of spray that didn't allow my <br/>
 magnets to stick :-(<br/>
<br/>
I get all of my images from Google Image search and about 85% being actual  <br/>
photographs.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the # of ideas I have of new images/boxes but I know they are  in<br/>
 the hundreds . . . every time I pass a park I think, "oh yeah, still have to <br/>
 carve a stamp to put there."<br/>

I will second that - I get a real thrill finding older boxes!<br/>
<br/>
My hats off to those of you who can carve letters and portraits!  I <br/>
just "finished" a stamp of part of some playing cards ("Mary's Mugs: <br/>
Four Queens" LB), I am distinctly not thrilled with the results.  But <br/>
just like my first attempt at carving ("Parade of Books: Magic School <br/>
Bus Hops Home"), I will bless the letterboxing world with my efforts, <br/>
if for no other reason to show improvement.  Now, I can do a decent job <br/>
with shapes - I am rather happy with how my "Yes, Ute, they RACE <br/>
sausages in Milwaukee!" letterbox turned out.<br/>
<br/>
I too am accumulating a bit of a stash of boxes ready to plant...<br/>

Here's one method to cut down on To Be Planted boxes - First find a unique hiding spot then carve the stamp to match the location.  Just a thought that has been working for me.  But I still have To Be Planted boxes too.   It just means that we like to carve more than we like to hike.  <br/>

A118 - I feel your pain when it comes to family members who simply don't understand why we want to go outside to 'place' or 'find' those plastic containers that are lurking 'here, there, and everywhere.'  Today, I was having lunch with my husband, daughter, and a life long girlfriend who is visiting over the holidays.  Naturally, when she asked if I was still looking for hidden boxes outside, I replied, "Absolutely....."   And then, there was a three way rapid eye rolling display.  They just don't get it.  <br/>

  I try not to have too many boxes/stamps ready to go that don't have some <br/>
  'definite' plan. I find that the piles of 'To Be Planted' gets me all <br/>
  fidgety and overanxious to go boxing (which sometimes isn't appreciated <br/>
  by Coffee Beans or the extended family). So, right now, I only have two <br/>
  stamps carved and waiting to be planted. Fortunately, we've been on a <br/>
  planting binge for the last few months, and we've planted several [I <br/>
  won't say how many since a few might include undisclosed bonus boxes] <br/>
  that had piled up. Those didn't bother me so much, because we had a <br/>
  master plan in the works...just needed to find time to plant them. Of <br/>
  the two, I have only vague ideas about where to plant them...those are <br/>
  the ones that get me fidgety.<br/>
<br/>
  As for boxes planted but not clued, I don't know how anyone can do <br/>
  that! I know that I try to get my boxes clued and posted ASAP after <br/>
  planting. (hopefully not at the expense of the quality of our clues) <br/>
  I'm learning to patiently wait for finders...but they can't be found if <br/>
  they aren't clued!<br/>
<br/>
  I know its not the same...but I have found an outlet by doing a few <br/>
  postals and LTCs....<br/>
<br/>
  As for the artwork...most of ours we find online...or from a scrap from <br/>
  a restaurant or tourist brochure we've found. I like to plug the <br/>
  drawings into a site that someone here mentioned <br/>
  (http://www.dumpr.net/sketch.php<http: sketch.php="" www.dumpr.net="">) to convert them to nice black and <br/>
  white line drawings. <br/>

  &gt; Talking about images and stamps got me to wondering a few things... I<br/>
  &gt; know I've seen this discussed before, maybe here, maybe on one of the<br/>
  &gt; other LB lists, but it's been a while and there are many new folks<br/>
  &gt; since then.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Do you have a pile of boxes sitting there all made up waiting to be<br/>
  &gt; planted? Do you have planted boxes waiting to be clued and listed?<br/>
  &gt; Do you have stamps carved and waiting for a new lock 'n lock to call<br/>
  &gt; home? How many (I know this is nigh unto a 12-step program confession<br/>
  &gt; for some of us)?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; And while we're on the topic... where are some of your favorite places<br/>
  &gt; to find images -- online or otherwise? Or do you draw your own?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>

 ...  Then of course I have alot of unboxed stamps, although most of those<br/>
are for my stamp in every state project.  Do people plant even in the<br/>
winter??? Maybe I'll be brave and plant  some inside boxes.<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey pugnasties!  Speaking of those far-traveling pugs, Tiptoe &amp; Tonto and<br/>
ourselves were the first to find your Arizona pug.  Hopefully he stays clear<br/>
of the cactus...<br/>
<br/>
And yes, we DO plant in winter.  We probably plant more of our local boxes<br/>
in winter than in any other season, and they are outdoor boxes.  If you can<br/>
find a good hiding spot in the winter, it usually will be very well<br/>
protected in the other seasons. Sometimes it can be hard to find winter<br/>
plants in the summer, because there is much more growth to get through.  We<br/>
always keep in mind what season a box was planted when we're looking for<br/>
one.  It helps to try to picture the environment at the time of the planting<br/>
when you are hunting for something.<br/>
<br/>
Since I never replied to the initial post, I'll also add that like Hartx6, I<br/>
use Google Image a lot for ideas.  I simply go to Google search and type in<br/>
something like "Arizona Image" and I'll get clipart, photos, and a variety<br/>
of things that I can either use directly or that will at least give me<br/>
ideas.  I've also used the site Atom118 mentioned to transform images (and<br/>
have also used photo programs or simply MS Word to turn photos to black &amp;<br/>
white carvable images).  I also rip pages out of magazines, theater<br/>
programs, stuff that comes in the mail, or whatever.  I really should get<br/>
all of those things organized!  Sometimes I use things just as they are, but<br/>
other times I'll modify or combine various clipart to create what I'm<br/>
looking for.  I don't think I've ever really drawn anything "from scratch".<br/>
<br/>
Like Atom118, I don't like to have too many ready-to-plant boxes hanging<br/>
around.  I usually carve for a specific place/purpose, then plant fairly<br/>
soon afterwards.  It's therefore bothering me that I have 5 of the boxes<br/>
donated for the WI 10th Anniversary gathering still in the house.  However I<br/>
want them to go to the part of the state that they "belong" based on their<br/>
image. We did manage to get 6 of them planted so far.  I also have 2 boxes<br/>
ready for whenever we head further south in IL.  We had hoped to do this in<br/>
July, but after all the flooding we postponed the trip.  Then we<br/>
optimistically hoped it would be "nice enough" to go down there between<br/>
Christmas and New Years, but obviously scrapped that.  (Does anyone else<br/>
remember how NICE it was 2 years ago over the holidays??  We keep hoping for<br/>
that again!)<br/>
<br/>
I do have some EMPTY LnL and assorted containers in a big basket, but I<br/>
regard these a staple supply, just like having a pile of PZKut and paper.<br/>
<br/>
Now it's time to get writing the clues for those 2 boxes we planted in<br/>
Arizona...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, TJ Mich!  She's a very recent addition to the team and no, you<br/>
didn't miss it.  The only clue was Wisconsin Hiker's teaser last month<br/>
mentioning that some WI letterboxers have a new little one.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to Leapin' Lizards, Tiptoe &amp; Tonto, hx6, SpringChick, and<br/>
any other well-wishers we might have missed.  We've already sent<br/>
off-list requests for tips for letterboxing with really little ones to<br/>
a few of the experienced folks in the crowd.  If anyone else would<br/>
like to share, please feel free.  Off-list is fine with us, especially<br/>
if you want to keep the group chatter focused on essentials like BINGO<br/>
and upcoming events.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
