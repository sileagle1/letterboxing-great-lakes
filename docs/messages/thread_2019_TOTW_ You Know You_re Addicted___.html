&gt; You know you're addicted when...<br/>
<br/>
 You find yourself sitting in a cafe you've never been to with a person<br/>
you've never met, and he says that it's going to drive you nuts that there<br/>
are two letterboxes within 100 yards of where you are sitting ...<br/>
 ... and he's right.<br/>

&gt; You know you're addicted when...<br/>
* You plan one of your yearly vacations around new places to letterbox - like this past June's trip to Michigan - and you change the week to coincide with the gathering! And plan to visit Oregon next June to - that's right - letterbox!<br/>
* You convince your friends that letterboxing is the best hobby ever so when we get together with them we can letterbox instead of all those stupid things like playing cards or going to the movies  - what a waste of daylight!<br/>
* You spend every free moment from work reading (and responding!) to the talklists!<br/>
* You are constantly thinking of new and innovative ways to hide, carve and clue boxes.<br/>
* Everyone is work knows about your hobby and refer to it as "that cult that walks in the woods."<br/>
* You become a ringmaster for a traveling stamp circus and change your name to Marco Peperini as well!<br/>

LOL I love that.  I keep telling my son that when I die, I want  a letter box <br/>
hid at my head stone.  He keeps telling me he'll just  retire all my boxes <br/>
"with me" and the one gutsy letter boxer that goes for  the gets the grand <br/>
prize.  I would have no problem with my family  going letterboxing after my <br/>
funeral. It would thrill me that they  celebrated life and one of the things i loved <br/>
in it.  :-)  <br/>

&gt; LOL I love that.  I keep telling my son that when I die, I want  a <br/>
letter box <br/>
&gt; hid at my head stone.  He keeps telling me he'll just  retire all <br/>
my boxes <br/>
&gt; "with me" and the one gutsy letter boxer that goes for  the gets <br/>
the grand <br/>
&gt; prize.  I would have no problem with my family  going letterboxing <br/>
after my <br/>
&gt; funeral. It would thrill me that they  celebrated life and one of <br/>
the things i loved <br/>
&gt; in it.  :-)  <br/>

&gt;Oh, so true! Or... you're addicted to LBing if you go out in the<br/>
&gt;freezing cold with snow on the ground (not a lot, but snow...) and<br/>
&gt;you find LBs. Tell me, what do we do in the winter? I'll miss this<br/>
&gt;new hobby!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On another note... our son is being married on Maui next week! Woe is<br/>
&gt;me! So, the whole family MUST travel to Hawaii. There are LBs there!<br/>
&gt;Since Gramma, Grampa, aunts, uncles, and cousins are into this new<br/>
&gt;hobby, we'll be looking for the LBs there. (and it'll be nice and<br/>
&gt;warm!) Kiddy Writer<br/>
