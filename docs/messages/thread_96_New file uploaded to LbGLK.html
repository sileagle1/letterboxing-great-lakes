<br>
Just to let you all know, "Sit...Sip...Stay...Box" is an indoors<br>
letterbox, and only available certain hours.  Unfortunately, they will<br>
be closed for the holiday weekend and not be open until Tuesday<br>
morning.  Sorry to tease and torment you like this....<br>
<br>
This one's very near my house.  Let me know if you're going to go look<br>
for it, and we may be able to set up an exchange!<br>

Hi TrailTroll! Nope, they never contact me. I would have never known <br>
about the article if it wasn't for my Dad. I guess they figure if you <br>
leave it out in the woods they don't need to consider ownership?!<br>
<br>
It's a little like letterboxing. If I contact the "library staff" (<---<br>
insert authority here) they might not let me plant. I'll just plant <br>
anyway. Been guilty of this so I guess it's letterboxing karma! :o)<br>

Tom made it very clear that ther are no goats! I'm sure there is a good story behind that rule. I created a GLG 2010 folder under Files - Gatherings. I also posted the site map. Heading to bed...Have a good weekend!!<br>

<br>
We returned to the park on Sunday to find the rest of the boxes and had a<br>
great time hiking the trails.  The weather was just fabulous again -<br>
although the temperatures reached into the upper 80s, the humidity was low<br>
and the nice breeze kept things very pleasant.  SO many great boxes in the<br>
park and we realized that there are still several trails available for<br>
future planting.  The hosts picked a GREAT park for the event!<br>
<br>
Just before we left the park at about 3:30 pm on Sunday, we noticed a round<br>
Sterlite container was still sitting on a picnic table in the shelter.  It<br>
had contained melon.  We're hoping we can figure out who it belongs to and<br>
perhaps get it returned to them sometime.  Anyone know who it belongs to?<br>

Theee stats make me feel much better about my progress.  I don't have a straight-line or a 6-pack or a 10-spot yet - but I do have 13 words!  I guess I picked good words and then arranged them badly.  My bingo card has poor feng shui. <br>
