<br>
It looks like there will be about 15 of us at the Delafield Brewhaus <br>
for a "Pre-event" get-together tomorrow night.  Chatting & exchanges <br>
will be the main focus, with food and a variety of beverages <br>
available.  We'll get there around 8 pm, assuming some of you will be <br>
using the daylight hours to hunt down a few local boxes.  When you <br>
get <br>
there, ask to be seated with the hiking group in the balcony. <br>
<br>
It also looks like there will be at least 15 of us at Marty's Pizza <br>
on <br>
Saturday night.  You might want to print the coupon from their <br>
website, they said they would honor it on June 3, even though it says <br>
it expires June 1.<br>
<br>
Here is a link for more info on the Pre- and Post-event get-togethers:<br>

<br>
If you plan to attend the get-togethers Friday and/or Saturday night, <br>
you can register here: <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows&tbl=21<br>
<br>
<br>
Some of you haven't attended an event before, so here is what you can <br>
expect when you first arrive:<br>
<br>
We'll be at a table with the event poster.<br>
<br>
Have your sig stamp ready to stamp the event poster and to stamp a <br>
nametag for yourself.  [Hint: if there is a line, you might just want <br>
to take the opportunity to do an exchange with someone near you in <br>
line.  However please be ready to stamp the poster when you get to <br>
the <br>
front of the line.  I'm only mentioning this because we are expecting <br>
such a LARGE group - almost 140 attendees as of tonight!]<br>
<br>
After stamping onto the poster, your group will receive a clue <br>
booklet <br>
and one raffle entry per person.<br>
<br>
Have your journal ready to stamp the event stamp into your book.  You <br>
may do this at anytime during the day, so if there is a line in the <br>
morning, you can do it later.<br>
<br>
You may want to do a last minute review of the website for any other <br>
info re: the actual event (attendees, food, maps, etc).<br>
