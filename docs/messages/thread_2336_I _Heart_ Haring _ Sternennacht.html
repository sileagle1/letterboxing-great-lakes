<br>
We have decided to not only replace box 2 of Sternennacht, but to <br>
pull the whole series from its current park and replace all 3 boxes <br>
in a new park.  We have learned from some people who frequent this <br>
park that the work they're doing will be extensive and on-going and <br>
don't want to keep losing our boxes.  So we're pulling them this <br>
weekend and we're going to find a "safer" place soon.  We'll let you <br>
all know when they are all intact again.<br>
<br>
We also learned today that the park where our Haring boxes are is <br>
under going some improvements as well (Just our luck!).  The boxes <br>
seem to still be intact(so far), but the landmarks to box 2 are <br>
missing.  It seems as though they're burying all of the power lines <br>
and so the electrical poles that we reference in our clues are all <br>
AWOL.  We'll have to get out there this weekend to investigate <br>
things a little further and rewrite our clues a bit.  <br>
<br>
Elgin, they just keep improving things.  It's great in a way because <br>
we live in Elgin and they have really improved the city a lot since <br>
we moved here, but can't they leave the parks alone?!!  What a <br>
nightmare for some letterboxers who are just trying to keep their <br>
boxes close so that they can maintain them more easily.<br>
<br>
We'll keep you all posted!!<br>

PS... only 33 more egg-hunting days remain.  (#4 has been replaced)<br>
