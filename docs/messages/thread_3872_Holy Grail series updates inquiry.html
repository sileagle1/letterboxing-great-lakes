                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi :)<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to be pushy or anything, but I've searched the posts<br/>
and can't find if there was any conclusive information on when the<br/>
series would be fully planted. From what I can tell at the moment<br/>
there are two left never planted:<br/>
<br/>
Camelot (It's only a model)<br/>
The Old Man From Scene 24<br/>
<br/>
Is this a taboo subject to talk about? I seem to recall a few people<br/>
saying they've volunteered to carve/plant and been turned down...<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm not sure about the politics here or whose toes I may be<br/>
stepping on, but I'm dying to finish this series and find the Holy<br/>
Grail! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info! :)<br/>

Catapuled Cow - was reported missing but verified in place<br/>

Camelot - in the hands of the placer, but between weather and hiding<br/>
