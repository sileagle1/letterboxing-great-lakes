                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to all of you so far who've responded to Christmas With the Kranks!<br/>
I've got a few Michigan addresses lined up.  If any of you can get together<br/>
to save mail time, that would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Czeltic Girl will be the person who will bring it to the Wisconsin gathering<br/>
(not sure yet if I can make it or not).  So whoever has it on or near<br/>
November 8th, please skip any other Michganders on the list and send it to<br/>
her.  We'll resume circulation after the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
This morning Acorn and I met at the Cyberdog where I was able to witness her<br/>
finding its First Finder Certificate.  While I was glad she received it, I<br/>
was kind of disappointed that it took so long to have been claimed.  Oh,<br/>
well, I know the hours of availability do put a cramp on things.  She also<br/>
stamped into Christmas with the Kranks, as well as a new Letterbox Crawl<br/>
box, Happy Apple, which we later placed at Lilett Candies down the tracks a<br/>
bit.  (clues in the files section)  We swapped out a few hitchhikers before<br/>
heading over to the Chicago Portage to find Matt  the Rat's replaced box<br/>
there.  We got off track at first...same thing I earlier described,<br/>
obliterated trails due to leaves and such.  Spooked quite a few deer in the<br/>
area.  We found it on the way back, so I was happy!  She went on to go<br/>
searching for History Tower and Little Box on the Prairie.  I'm sure she was<br/>
successful in finding both.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, congrats out to Acorn for achieving F200+!!!<br/>
