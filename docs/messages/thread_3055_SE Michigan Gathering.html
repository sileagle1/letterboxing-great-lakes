                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you so much to double dragon for putting on such a wonderful, <br/>
well thought out letterboxing adventure.  So many boxes - So little <br/>
time!  And in spite of the rain, we all finished.  Although my team <br/>
finished first we double faulted and couldn't take first prize.  <br/>
Seems we suffered a slight direction impairment, but did find the <br/>
hidden treasure and the flag!  Sorry, TrailTroll - but maybe that was <br/>
part of the directions that the rain washed away.<br/>
<br/>
We also had the fun of meeting Miles and His Tiki Party - hmmmm this <br/>
might be an idea for a postal series - interesting behavior at a <br/>
park.  The stamps were beautiful and some people (rabbits) have just <br/>
awesome carving skills - I'm just glad letterboxing includes other <br/>
skills, too like walking and talking at the same time - that I can do.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed meeting new people and familiar friends and soooo glad I <br/>
could get ride of that cootie that had been pestering me since my RI <br/>
daughter dropped it in my bag.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again DD for a great day.  Oh, yes - even though I was a Girl <br/>
Scout (always prepared) I didn't read the weather report and it did <br/>
rain a lot - so I was the one in the stylish trash bag - next time <br/>
I'll remember the day glo duct tape and then I'll truly be styling.  <br/>
<br/>
Have a great boxing fall!<br/>

Excellent job of planning and executing a fabulous twist on a <br/>
letterbox gathering!  DoubleDragon - I can't say it enough - you <br/>
guys are AWESOME!!!  All that work you put into this day.  It was SO <br/>
much fun!<br/>
<br/>
Mr. and I had a fantastic time with the other 1/2 of our team the <br/>
Duca Family.  And - although we were the second team to arrive - <br/>
without the treasure - we ultimately took the prize!  Which we <br/>
shared with everyone else.  <br/>
<br/>
It rained, it poured, it sprinkled, and the sun came out!  It was <br/>
great!!!  Just goes to show that there are a few die hard LB <br/>
fanatics out there - whom I affectionately call "image-a-holics".  <br/>
Our only regret is that we could not have possibly dragged ourselves <br/>
out 2 more times to get all the fantastic stamps!  Everyone did a <br/>
spectacular job of carving!  If you stayed home - I'm sorry to <br/>
say...you really missed out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!  And looking forward to seeing you all again real soon!<br/>
<br/>

We loved every bit of it. You have even changed his mind about <br/>
attending future gatherings woo hoo!!<br/>
<br/>
Mr. &amp; Mrs. Doglovers thank you so much for your patience with the kids <br/>
you are so cool. Not sure when Nick will stop talking about you.lol<br/>
<br/>
We got cootied !! It was our first encounter with a cootie too !! No <br/>
choice now but to attend another gathering and pass it on. Now lets <br/>
see if Jeff can put all that security/stealth training into action and <br/>
pass it on without getting caught.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
