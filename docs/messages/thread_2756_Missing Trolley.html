                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tonight, I received an email notice that "Trolley Days," my first Lb, <br>
might be missing. The clue is simple and the letterboxer explained the <br>
location in detail.  If it wasn't so late and raining, I'd probably be <br>
out the door checking on that box.  I'll look in the morning, but I'm <br>
doubtful that I will find it. I don't like to replace a logbook <br>
annually because I like to see the history in a logbook.  But it's <br>
such a shame when a box goes missing after 2 years or more with the <br>
original logbook still inside the box.  Oh well....   Beetle<br>
