Well, they don't actually advertise it that way, but for those of you <br/>
who use artist sketchpads for logbooks, they're on sale at Hobby <br/>
Lobby.  All sizes are 40% off making the smallest size pretty <br/>
affordable.  I like the 100-page 3"x5" size because they fit well in <br/>
the boxes I use (don't look for any at the Round Lake, IL store <br/>
because I just bought them out).  The sale is good through Saturday, <br/>
November 13.<br/>
<br/>
On my way to the store I thought of a fun idea - I bought my 9-year-<br/>
old son a compass for Christmas and I'm going to put it in his <br/>
stocking along with a clue sheet.  I'll hide another small present <br/>
somewhere in the house for him to find using his new compass.  He <br/>
still believes, so I'll have to tell him I stuck it in his stocking <br/>
early in the morning.  Ahhh, childhood!<br/>

something suspiciously like it at our house (clues in a small wrapped box <br/>
