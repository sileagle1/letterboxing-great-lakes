northern IL, so I figured I'd also post it here in case anyone knew <br/>
anything about it....<br/>

Does anyone recognize the Garden Club Bridge Letterbox? The webmasters<br/>
at LbNA received the following e-mail:<br/>
<br/>
Hi! I love the concept of what you all are doing. Is it like<br/>
geocaching? Anyway, one of our restoration ecologists brought one of<br/>
your boxes in to me here at our office for Lake Forest Open Lands<br/>
Association. We protect rare and threatened species of plants and<br/>
animals by preserving habitat. The ecologist brought it in because it<br/>
had been left off-trail, in an area where we are trying to protect<br/>
fragile plants. It is labeled "Garden Club Bridge Letterbox". I am<br/>
sorry we had to remove it, but we cannot risk the trample of many feet<br/>
into our fragile areas. If the box had actually been left under the<br/>
Garden Club Bridge, that would probably be OK, though we don't<br/>
encourage it. But somehow it made its way off-trail.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is the only contact address, I'm writing to you. Could you<br/>
pass this on to the appropriate person? Thanks much, and have fun with<br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
