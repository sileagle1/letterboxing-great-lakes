                    <div class="plaintext-content">It will be based on the date that the winning WORD was CALLED for the person claiming the Bingo.  It won't be based on the date that they called Bingo.  But someone has to CLAIM the Bingo to have it be effective.<br/>

I sure hope someone calls it SOON so we won't have a 12-way tie!  Besides, isn't this supposed to be a winter game?  I heard it was getting pretty nice up in the Great Lakes regions now (I'm still in FL helping my mom).<br/>

&gt;  Hypothetical: Someone has the last winning full BINGO card but doesn't check it for several days. Yet in the meantime, additional words are called that catapult me out of contention for Biggest Loser. When the winner finally calls BINGO, which is the official winning date - the date the winning word was called, or the date the winner called BINGO?
