though we've dragged Dad along on a search or two.  They think <br/>
it's "nice" but not their cup of tea.  Bless their souls, though, <br/>
because they went out looking for our missing letterboxes in Florida.  <br/>
They're down in Ft. Myers for a few weeks and headed out to Lakes Park <br/>
this morning.  They were along when we placed one box and poked around <br/>
in every pile of rocks looking for it--but no box.  They went to the <br/>
site of the other one--couldn't quite figure out what a "rock that <br/>
looks like a castle" was but poked around in that area without luck.  <br/>
So, it's a bummer that both of these boxes are missing, but it's nice <br/>
to know my folks will go out of their way to indulge us in our/my <br/>
obsession.  Guess you never outgrow that parenting thing.<br/>
