us rolled down their window to say "It's not there"!  Much laughter ensued<br/>

It was downright chilly today and I feel like we are being gypped out of<br/>
summer!  It is short enough normally, but this is ridiculous!<br/>

For anyone who may have been waiting, the final 2 boxes in the "May Days<br/>
Near Mayfield" series have finally been planted. Sorry they couldn't be<br/>
available back in May with the other 6 boxes... but this location, with<br/>
newly-completed trails, is well worth a visit any time of year.<br/>

So WiHi - It's been a half hour since you posted, have you found the boxes yet?  JK!<br/>

Oh, I think I've snagged us some new letterboxers this weekend - see, it pays to bring LB stuff along when going out of town to a wedding!  Dave's cousin saw me carving a stamp at the hotel, which lead to me telling her about boxing!  So you may see stamps from a new Stevens Point boxing family.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I DO have a box planted near Steven's Point.  Perhaps they'll be able to<br/>
find it.  We planted several boxes in northwestern WI when we were trying to<br/>
get a box planted in every county so the whole state would be "green" on<br/>
LBNA.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately we probably won't be able to look for the last MAY DAY boxes<br/>
for a while.  Martini Man is totally swamped at work and needs to be in to<br/>
the office tomorrow and next weekend we will be out of state.  Boxing!<br/>

<br/>
What are the chances!  Due to all sorts of situations we haven't been able to go letterboxing since July 11th when we left WiHi and MM in Wisconsin!  We finally had a free day today and decided to try for a few boxes.  By noon we hadn't decided what direction we were heading.  But eventually nixed Indiana, Michigan and Central Illinois (all in the running) We finally decided on a few clues up by the IL/WI border.  What, are there almost 700 listed boxes in Northern IL?   <br/>
<br/>
We had looked for quite some time for one of the 9 boxes planned.  It seemed to not be there, but we figured we'd return to the car, fire up the laptop and check when it was last found.  All of a sudden a van backed in RIGHT next to us where we were unable to see the occupants.  We were annoyed that we now couldn't go back out and look without being obvious.  Tiptoe asked Tonto "What in the world is that idiot doing parking RIGHT next to us and not getting out of his car?"  Soon a man got out and Tonto was looking through his rearview mirror to see what he was up to.<br/>
<br/>
"He looks like Martini Man!" he exclaimed.<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough it was none other!   Ohhh, repentance for calling them idiots will be in order, but maybe some of you have been in that situation while letterboxing!   Tiptoe turned to see MM's other half happily sitting in the passenger seat!  What fun to run into them...just what we needed to lift our spirits!  Tonto kept saying "Of all the gin joints in the world, and they had to pick this letterbox!"<br/>
<br/>
On top of that, they had also picked the same set of boxes to visit this afternoon...and of course beat us to 3 first finders!  But all is forgiven because they WERE the perfect find!<br/>
<br/>
The day turned out 8 of 9 boxes found...nice walks in the great outdoors and a perfect French meal with a glass of great wine...AHHH the perfect letterboxing day!<br/>
