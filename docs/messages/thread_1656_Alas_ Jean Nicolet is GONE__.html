later one of your planted letterbox babies will go<br/>
missing, but why THIS one, which was the box we<br/>
received for the Great Lakes Hometown Landmarks<br/>
exchange.  *sigh*  Last week someone emailed that they<br/>
found our Kumbaya box, but couldn't locate Jean<br/>
Nicolet (which was planted nearby), even though they<br/>
were pretty sure they had the right log.  So last<br/>
night Deedle &amp; I headed out to check on things, and<br/>
sure enough - no more, not even a trace!  The log<br/>
where we had placed him no longer had a nice hole in<br/>
the top as we describe in the clues.  Instead, that<br/>
whole entire end of the log is now missing.  We're<br/>
wondering if a scent was left on the box that an<br/>
animal picked up on (lots of deer in those woods) and<br/>
that in their effort to retrieve the "food" they<br/>
crumbled the end of the decaying log and made off with<br/>
the box, which of course was in a plastic baggie.  <br/>
<br/>
We're especially dismayed because it wasn't one of our<br/>
carvings but another letterboxer's.  How should we<br/>
proceed?  Papeseed, as the original creator of this<br/>
box, if you want to carve a new stamp and send it to<br/>
us, we'll take care of creating the logbook &amp; a new<br/>
container &amp; a new hiding spot.  <br/>
<br/>
