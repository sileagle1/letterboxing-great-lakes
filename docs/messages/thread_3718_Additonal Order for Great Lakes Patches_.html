As regular readers of this board know, our current stock of Great <br/>
Lakes regional patches is almost depleted.  I'm thinking I should <br/>
order some more before the gathering in June.  Most regular readers of <br/>
the board have already ordered patches.  However it seems that there <br/>
are a lot of Ohio boxers that don't really participate much in this <br/>
message board, so I'm not sure if they would be interested in the <br/>
patch or not.<br/>
<br/>
Can any of you Ohioans that DO read this board tell me if there would <br/>
be any/much interest?  I'd probably order a smaller quantity, so price <br/>
would be a bit higher (maybe $2 or $2.50 per patch instead of $1.50).  <br/>
However this is still cheaper than most other letterboxing patches.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for feedback...<br/>

I do think Ohioans would buy the patches too.  If it would help, I'd be <br/>
glad to take some to events and sell them there.  I am really trying to <br/>
get others to get signed up for this board....and hop on the Ohio board <br/>
too by sending personal emails to them as soon as I get a message they <br/>
visited any of my plants.<br/>
<br/>
SpringChick...is there any way I can get the trailnames of those who are <br/>
Ohio members??  Hmmmmm, that might not be so easy to determine if it's <br/>
not listed that way on someone's survey. <br/>
<br/>
We'll get there, I'm sure!!<br/>

Since it doesn't look like anyone did it yet on the<br/>
Ohio AtlasQuest board, I'm going to repost your<br/>
message there so we can get an idea of how many more<br/>
Great Lakes patches you may want to order for June. <br/>
Cat's Meow had mentioned here how they were talking<br/>
over there about an Ohio Letterboxing t-shirt, so I'm<br/>
sure there are lots of people who would be interested<br/>
in the patch.<br/>

I'll definitely be ordering more patches, just trying to figure out a <br/>
good quantity that will satisfy demand for 4-6 months.<br/>
