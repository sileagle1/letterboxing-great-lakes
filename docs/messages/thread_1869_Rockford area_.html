Hmmm, that's a good question!  Have you tried ALL of the hotels?  <br>
There's a few off the beaten path (the beaten path being the cluster <br>
of hotels right off the I-90 Business 20 exit) that might still have <br>
openings, They may be a bit older & run down, but I'm sure they're <br>
still perfectly functional.  Here's a few that are still in a <br>
respectable area that are very easy to get to:<br>
<br>
Travelodge: 4850 E State St, 815-398-5050 (just had friends stay here <br>
last weekend)<br>
<br>
Sweden House Lodge: 4605 E State St, 815-398-4130<br>
<br>
Villager Lodge: 4404 E State St, 815-399-1890<br>
<br>
hope that helps!  Maybe the Rockfordians can have an impromptu mini-<br>
gathering in celebration of your visit?  I don't know if any of us <br>
were able to make Haunted Harvest (maybe Shutterfly?) so we'd be <br>
happy to see you!  <br>

I did find a hotel in Beloit, so we'll drive down to Rockford in the <br>
morning.  Not sure if getting together is a possibility - we don't have <br>

the group photo at the Haunted Harvest last Saturday.)<br>

I know most people probably have plans for Saturday night, but that <br>
would probably be the best time to meet any local boxers.  We could <br>
possibly meet for dinner somewhere in the Beloit/Rockford area around <br>
6:30ish.  However if there are that many hotel rooms booked, all the <br>
restaurants will probably be full also!<br>

Noon whistle or rumbling stomachs?  I figured it would be a good idea <br>
to use lunch as a bribe to get a good turnout for the photo.  It seems <br>
to have worked!  <br>
