Tat2bob and I are very lucky to have never lost anything of real value.  We flooded here 6 times in one year.  Now everything in the garage lives up off the ground, either on the flloor on 12 inch high blocks, on a shelf or in a plastic bin with a cover.  Good Luck with the clean up.  <br>

Thanks to all for their kind words.  Drying out the logbooks has not brought about a dramatic improvement.  I think I will go with the idea of making color copies from my or my daughter's logbook and try to recreate things.  But not for a while--still trying to dry things out.  Our yard looks like a tornado went through--there's so much stuff spread out to dry!  This hot weather is good for something.<br>

<br>
Remember "The best things in life aren't THINGS!"<br>
<br>
It totally sucks having lost all of that. But how much fun to look back and try to figure out what those ink blots are.......<br>
<br>
Nowing that you will be able to go out and create more memories and laugh about how you had to do the whole thing again just to collect a STAMPED image!!<br>
<br>
Those are memories worth a life time.<br>
