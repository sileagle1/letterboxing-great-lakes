Thanks to the IL state parks NOT closing I was finally able to get out and<br>
re-plant this box today.  It has now been un-archived at LBNA.  Fortunately,<br>
the trails have not changed since the clues were written and the park did<br>
replace the missing boards on the bridge that hides the box.  Plus there's a<br>
bonus for the "first" finder.<br>
