Martini Man before it gets too late.<br>
<br>
I was overwhelmed by everything.  I thought I came prepared to take advantage of every <br>
aspect of the event.  I won't whine that I missed getting all the planted boxes, missed the <br>
opportunity to solve the WOM clues, not finding the time to log into the TESS boxes and <br>
other strategically located boxes, meeting and exchanging with Every Boxer, not carrying <br>
enough water to finish the last leg of the day for another box.  And not placing some <br>
boxes to increase my Out-of-State p-count.<br>
<br>
I will rejoice in the the fact that I was finally able to get to my first Great Lakes gathering.  I <br>
pushed myself to find and bring the lovely coconuts.  My heart was pounding as I walked <br>
alone along the unfamiliar trail at 7:30AM (I wasn't supposed to break that rule.)  The <br>
evening mini-meets felt like family reunions and I didn't feel like an outsider as I thought I <br>
might.  It felt great to be goofy and know that everyone else understands.<br>
<br>
And speaking of love languages, thanks to everyone who complimented me for the Rose <br>
Gardeners.  You have no idea how that makes me feel.<br>
<br>
I saw a few new tricks and products I can't wait to try (ex. smaller ink pads and the felt <br>
envelopes!)<br>
<br>
Sorry Gooble Gobble, but I'll never be connordinated enough to get your personal <br>
traveller(s).  Your Alice Through The Looking Glass was my favorite, and my silent boxing <br>
partner was ROTHFLHAO when I showed him.  He agreed to return to the park to find more <br>
boxes with me.  Thank You!<br>
<br>
I was so pleased to meet my "friends" in person on Saturday, and only wished we had more <br>
time to visit.  I plan to return once our regular life gets back on track.  And I would love to <br>
see a gathering come to Indiana or Ohio next year.  I am not making any plans to organize <br>
one yet, but I will keep it in the back of my mind.  I will see who I can recruit around here <br>
to help.  I'll keep you posted.<br>
<br>
I did manage to take 1 photo (and I carried that camera on me all day!).  Check the photo <br>
album.<br>
<br>
Well, I must get some sleep.<br>
