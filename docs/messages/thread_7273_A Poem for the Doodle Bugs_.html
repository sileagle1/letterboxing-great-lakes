Watch out for her skills. She's kind of a spiker!<br>

Yet, I wonder about Atom 118...<br>

YAWN...."What?  where are we?  What time is it?  What's the date...wake up Tonto.  It seems we've fallen asleep from boredom waiting for our words to be called.  Bingo Man is trying to contact us pronto ...whatever that means.  I can't imagine what he wants because NOTHING happens pronto in Bingo time!"<br>
<br>
"Tiptoe, did we actually fill in a card?"<br>
<br>
"I thought so.  Remember, I gave you grief for claiming to have exchanged with yourself!"<br>
<br>
"Oh yeah...Have we had any words called?"<br>
<br>
"Hmmm, let's see...you have exactly one measly spot crossed off, and I have two.  That's all the action we've seen in near 20 days!<br>
<br>
"I wonder why that is?"<br>
<br>
"Could be because we aren't Yoopers.....let's go back to sleep and maybe he'll go away and let us hibernate a bit more.  Come Spring, maybe he'll start calling our words..that Bingo Man, he's such a little..."  YAWN.....<br>

      Very good poem, Bingo Man!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But for this boxing clan<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You need a better calling plan.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We KNOW you can!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Don't look so dour,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
No need to glower.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you just show more calling power,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We'll invite you again for happy hour!<br>

Dear Doodle,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Two words a week is plenty enough....<br>
<br>
but it appears that this week is nothing but fluff.<br>
<br>
There's still Friday and Saturday, my dear Doodle....<br>
<br>
so the chance is still there for you, so don't strain your noodle.<br>
<br>
Think of poor Bali, who's less than half way...<br>
<br>
from the 10 spot game, and yet, she will play.<br>
<br>
However, dear Trail Troll is really quite happy...<br>
<br>
you see, her card isn't so crappy.<br>
<br>
But....can we believe her? Is it a trick?<br>
<br>
Will her bingo magic actually stick?<br>
<br>
And what about that Wisconsin Hiker?<br>
<br>
Watch out for her skills. She's kind of a spiker!<br>
<br>
Plus, we haven't heard much from Tiptoe and Tonto!<br>
<br>
We should contact them..like pronto!<br>
<br>
Yet, I wonder about Atom 118...<br>
<br>
maybe his card is also real mean?<br>
<br>
And so many others, like Trail Mark and MichKathy<br>
<br>
and yet, we don't hear them being so catty.<br>
<br>
So, the moral of this tale, my dear boxing bug...<br>
<br>
is to hang tough...you'll get your hug!<br>
<br>
Even though your chances seem thin....<br>
<br>
There is ALWAYS a very good chance for a win! <br>

What is the deal?<br>

You pull out a word,<br>

But few of then mine.<br>

I thought it was great,<br>

I had a word (or two),<br>
One close to my heart.<br>

Now I check my mail,<br>
