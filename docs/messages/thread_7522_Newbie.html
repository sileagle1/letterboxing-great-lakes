                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi! My name is Kathy and I was just recently introduced to letterboxing by a friend near Chicago. I thought there wouldn't be any letterboxes where I live because it's so remote, but thankfully I was wrong I found my first one a few days ago, and have one of my own made and ready to go except the note for the outside of the box. <br/>
<br/>
Question: Is it acceptable to have a box where it can be seen? I was going to put one on my sister's grave stone. It's our plot, so the groundskeeper wont move it, and people around here are respectful enough to leave it alone. People put all kinds of things on graves up here, so it won't be an odd ting to see. I have even seen a Christams tree and decorations inthe middle of winter. What do you think? <br/>
<br/>
I am not tallented enough to make my own stamps, but I am making my own stamp books out of parchment paper. Are store boughten srtamps looked upon badly? I just think that if I tried to carve something, it would look pretty bad. The box I found had the most beautiful hand made stamp of a Belted Kingfisher, and there is no way I could do something like that. <br/>
<br/>
Hope to find others in my area, is anyone from Upper Michigan, or Northern Wisconsin? Thanks for having me, Kathy<br/>

You can make a simple one with a cuticle trimmer and a flat eraser, but you<br/>

don't feel up to the task; we were all there at one point.  On Atlas Quest<br/>
you designate whether it's hand-carved or not.  On LBNA, you can put it in<br/>
the clues if you wish.<br/>

<br/>
I would also recommend that you wait a bit on planting your box until you<br/>
find some more yourself; you will learn a lot about which containers hold up<br/>

different book styles as well as other ideas for making it special. <br/>
<br/>

It sounds like you have a wonderful idea. I was really eager to make some<br/>

If you are anxious to get this particular box planted and want to include a<br/>
store-bought stamp before you start carving, I suggest that you choose a<br/>
stamp image that has something to do with the person you are honoring and<br/>
explain in the clues the significance of the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Carving is much easier than you would think.  I was a little overwhelmed by<br/>
the concept at first, so ordered custom made stamps for the first 3 boxes I<br/>
planted.  However when I started carving some basic images, I discovered it<br/>
wasn't so hard and then progressed to more difficult images.  I started out<br/>
using a gouge, but now almost always just use an exacto knife.  I usually<br/>
print my images on a laser printer, then use acetone to transfer the image<br/>
to the carving material.   If you'd like to see another tutorial about<br/>
carving, here's a link:<br/>

My mother loved butterflies, and these adorned her picture board at her memorial service. I can't keep them, they make me sad to look at. I am going to put an explanation of what the box is onthe outside so there aren't any problems. Also,, I am going to look for a place to hide it, if not I will leave it in frint of the grave stone and it should be fairly safe there.<br/>

My mom loved butterflies and whenever I saw something that I thought she would like with them on it, I would get it for her. I have been a rubber stamper for about 20 years now, and have a large collection. But I have some I no longer use, and that wasone of them. I buy them at yard sales too, so I have extra ones. To be honest, I haven't stamped cards in a while. So, some of my stamps have emotional meaning to me, like the one I am using for my signature. <br/>
<br/>
Ok, I have another queston. I know it isnt cool to hide a box near someone elses. But, how close is too close? What I am gettin at, is say someone hides one at a State Park, is it ok to hideone on the same Park if it's far away? Thanks again! Kathy<br/>
