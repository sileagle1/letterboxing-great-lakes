If you've ever watched any wheelchair games, you know how absolutely amazing and inspiring they can be.  The flyer that came attached to this memo from work is a .pdf and not supported here in yahoo, but if interested, email me offlist and I'll forward it to you.<br>

VISN 12 Employees:<br>
Planning ahead! The National Veterans Wheelchair Games are slated for Milwaukee in 2007. The event is expected to attract over 500 athletes to the Great Games on a Great Lake June 19-23, 2007. <br>
Preparation for the Great Games has begun with local fund raisers, and in late November, it is expected volunteers will be able to register on line. Many of the venues will be held throughout the Milwaukee metroplex with most of the activity at the downtown Midwest Center. <br>
The first regional fund raiser is the Ride for the 2007 Wheelchair Games on October 15. It is a great time of the year to see the colorful Wisconsin countryside and help support the Great Games. <br>
For further information, see attached. <br>
