Here's to a great year of letterboxing. On another note, I could use everyone's prayers and well wishes. As of today, I am being forced to resign from my job as of June 30th (no fault of my own) as my school board will not renew my contract. So, unless there is some intervention, I will be without a job as of July 1st. So...if you know of a school principal job somewhere, I am interested.<br>
