                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sorry to have to tease you guys this way, but I'll be placing a new box<br>
on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe line -- but not until Monday.  It is<br>
already listed in the database for the Metra Letterbox Crawl, and the clues<br>
will be in my FungusWoman clues folder in the files (I do take a chance and<br>
post these clues on LbNA in their entirety).<br>
<br>
Also take a look in the files if you are new and aren't familiar with what<br>
I'm talking about.  The Crawl is a series of boxes being placed in the<br>
Chicago area along the various Metra commuter railroad lines.  (I started,<br>
but am not sole "proprietor" of the concept...everyone is welcome to place<br>
boxes in the series.)  I've modified the original concept ( and updated the<br>
file) of only "password-protected" indoor boxes, since not every station has<br>
a suitable indoor facility.  So conventional "clue-driven" boxes are also<br>
welcome to be considered part of the series.  If you have  one that fits the<br>
bill (ie, CMoon's "History Tower" or my "Hurray for Hollywood"), you might<br>
want to list it in the database.<br>
<br>
To view or download a train schedule, go to<br>
http://metrarail.com/schedule.html.  Metra offers an unlimited weekend pass<br>
good for all the boxing you can do on Saturday and Sunday for $5.00 (well,<br>
they dont really market it as a boxing pass.).  With the cost of gas these<br>
days, that's a pretty good deal.  Even you Wisconsinians can pick up the<br>
train in Kenosha and come on down.<br>
<br>
(I have no affiliation with Metra, BTW, except that I live right along the<br>
tracks!)<br>

I've been dragging my feet about finishing up my two Metra boxes - <br>
Kenosha, WI and Antioch, IL, but I'll try to finish them up shortly!  <br>
