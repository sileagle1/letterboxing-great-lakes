on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe line -- but not until Monday.  It is<br/>
already listed in the database for the Metra Letterbox Crawl, and the clues<br/>
will be in my FungusWoman clues folder in the files (I do take a chance and<br/>
post these clues on LbNA in their entirety).<br/>
<br/>
Also take a look in the files if you are new and aren't familiar with what<br/>
I'm talking about.  The Crawl is a series of boxes being placed in the<br/>
Chicago area along the various Metra commuter railroad lines.  (I started,<br/>
but am not sole "proprietor" of the concept...everyone is welcome to place<br/>
boxes in the series.)  I've modified the original concept ( and updated the<br/>
file) of only "password-protected" indoor boxes, since not every station has<br/>
a suitable indoor facility.  So conventional "clue-driven" boxes are also<br/>
welcome to be considered part of the series.  If you have  one that fits the<br/>
bill (ie, CMoon's "History Tower" or my "Hurray for Hollywood"), you might<br/>
want to list it in the database.<br/>
<br/>
To view or download a train schedule, go to<br/>
http://metrarail.com/schedule.html.  Metra offers an unlimited weekend pass<br/>
good for all the boxing you can do on Saturday and Sunday for $5.00 (well,<br/>
they dont really market it as a boxing pass.).  With the cost of gas these<br/>
days, that's a pretty good deal.  Even you Wisconsinians can pick up the<br/>
train in Kenosha and come on down.<br/>
<br/>
(I have no affiliation with Metra, BTW, except that I live right along the<br/>
tracks!)<br/>

I've been dragging my feet about finishing up my two Metra boxes - <br/>
Kenosha, WI and Antioch, IL, but I'll try to finish them up shortly!  <br/>
