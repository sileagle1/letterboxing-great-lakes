I yield to your memory, Fungus Woman.  I recall attending the last gathering at The Paw in Brookfield,IL (known as Hollywood in those early days).  Then it closed.  Time passed and we co-planned SILO #1.  So to me, it seemed like a progression from those earlier days at The Paw and your encouragement and co-planning that brought about SILO #1.  I didn't remember all the other details about the zoo till you just mentioned it.  And Boxer-In-Training .... awh, I remember him well.   Your dad was the best!  He was one handsome guy and I've seen the photos!  <br>

Subject: [LbGLK] cooties, etc<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
None of the three cooties by Orion at Emerson had logbooks with them, but they are listed on AQ.  From what is recorded there, the carver is from Cambridge, MA , and she attended the "ElectricMedic Meet and Greet" December 30th in Los Altos where she released them.  Many of the attendees at that event also attended the "Fungal Infestation" and they in turn infested this fungus.  I brought back with me from San Jose. <br>
<br>
To clarify what Beetle said, there really was no connection between the five Hollywood Micro-Meets (held at The Paw between Jan '05 and Jul '06) and SILO.  Those were just random local meetups.  My real plan was to hold that event at the Zoo, but with my Dad passing in the fall of '06, I didn't have my heart in it.  The first SILO came (obviously) several months later.   As to the date of this year's SILO, part of the date change was due to V-Day falling on Saturday.<br>
<br>
(Dottie...I hear you about working Sundays...kind of the busy day for you and the Rev Mr Pastor's Wife, eh?  Once I was talking to my Pastor, complaining that I couldn't come to church because of working the weekend, playing the "poor me" sob story and all, and then I realized I was "preaching to the choir" so to speak...not going to get a lot of sympathy about that from a clergyman!)<br>
