Hostel in South Eastern Michigan. The box shoould be up in about 3 <br>
months when I move back to Michigan from Pennsylvania. Lets hope <br>
there is no snow at that time! LOL I am currently carving all kinds <br>
of stamps to plant in the SE part of the state as well. Currently I <br>
have 12 stamps waiting to be planted. Also look for a box <br>
titled "Hoppy Frog" coming soon. I mailed it to Michigan this week. <br>
Team Rabbit and T-Bird Girl are going to be planting it for me. Have <br>
a great night and happy letterboxing.<br>
