                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
I'm looking for some opinions on an issue. Last year, I had a couple <br>
temporary boxes placed in great hiding spots.<br>
<br>
Now, I'd like to plant permanent boxes in the same spots. They would <br>
be completely different clues, stamps, etc. But, anyone who found the <br>
temp box may experience deja vu.<br>
<br>
I love both of these spots and there were limited hiding spaces, so <br>
I'm thinking I may have to reuse the spot if I wish to plant there again.<br>
<br>
What do you think? If you were the finder would you be disappointed? <br>
Any thoughts would be appreciated!<br>

It would be the same situation of a box disappeared, either intentionally or due to animals/muggles, and someone else planted a box in the same spot.<br>
<br>
Searchers may recognize the general area from the new clues, and they can then decide if they'd like to revisit the spot.  We're going to be in Pennsylvania for a few days of hiking and noticed that there are several new boxes on some trails we've hiked before.  Since we enjoyed the hike to Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle, we'll be heading up again to hunt for the boxes.  (But we probably won't remember if any of them are in the SAME spot as a box we found a few years ago.)<br>

LOL, Nope.  Jerome's summer home, to be sure!  You never found that <br>
one, so it'd be new to you.  It's kind of far south for you, though!<br>

The winter home requires permits and whatever else now since it's in <br>

Thanks dsgmi!<br>
You're exactly the "demographic" that I wanted to hear from, since <br>
you found the original box!  Not many did!  I figure if you don't <br>
mind, no one else should, right?  I planted the new box this <br>
weekend.  It's not in the exact spot, but close enough.<br>
