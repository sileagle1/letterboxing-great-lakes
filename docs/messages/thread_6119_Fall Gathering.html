                    <div class="plaintext-content">Agreed! What an amazing day, and so much fun to get together! It was such a fun, social gathering-every trail head had a mini meet-up! Special thanks to new friends Atomic Beans-you guys made the day so much fun! It was great getting to know you both! And many, many thank yous go to the organizers SpringChick and crew. You made the day special and memorable.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks to Spring Chick, azobox, Grandvilla, Mobiusklein and Mrs. Doglovers for such a well-conceived gathering.  <br>

As a history buff, it was wonderful to see and to stamp the retired images.  I spent a lot of time at the display table--the attention to detail is one of the elements that originally attracted me to letterboxing.<br>
<br>
It was great to see so many old and new friends on Saturday.  I spent the day in the shelter connecting and re-connecting. By Sunday, Golden Boy and our niece had joined me, so we set out together.  What a wonderful lot of devious planters you all are!<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the fun; with all the new ideas I encountered, I have a lot of planning and carving to do this winter.<br>
