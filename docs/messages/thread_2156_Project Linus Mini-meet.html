<br>
If you're a letterboxer who also crochets, this mini-meet is for you!<br>
<br>
Back at the end of September I placed the Project Linus Postal <br>
Letterbox.  Project Linus is a national organization that collects <br>
hand made blankets for children in hospitals and otherwise in need.  <br>
I invited letterboxers who crocheted to make me a granny square to <br>
receive the box. I thought piecing together granny squares from <br>
around the country would be a fun way to create a crocheted blanket <br>
for this wonderful cause.  I was hoping to receive enough squares <br>
(around 36) to make one blanket.  As of last count, 222 squares have <br>
been received!<br>
<br>
Mrs. Doglvrs, being the fabulous person she is, offered to meet me <br>
one afternoon, half way between our homes for some company and <br>
blanket making.  After some discussion on the postal board this has <br>
officially turned into a mini gathering.  A room has been booked at <br>
the Michigan City Public Library in Michigan City Indiana for <br>
the `Project Linus Mini-meet'.<br>
<br>
We have four of us already attending and only have room for 15 so we <br>
do need you to let us know if you plan on attending.  There will be <br>
stamp exchanges, an event stamp, and at least one letterbox to <br>
find.  The Project Linus PLB will also be there to be stamped into, <br>
but the main emphasis will be on joining the donated granny squares <br>
into blankets.<br>
<br>
The details are listed below as well as in the events list on Atlas <br>
Quest.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact Mrs. Doglvrs <br>
or myself.<br>
<br>
Hope to see some of you there!<br>

I never knew how to either before now, but I wanted to help (and to learn, and to receive this box  :-) ) so 3 weeks ago, I went through some on-line tutorials, and I have since completed 6 granny squares for this project!!!!!

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

I will learn this skill soon, but I need to tend to something really big. <br>
Tomorrow we are looking a house.  The thought of relocating for the<br>
umpteenth time has been in the back of my mind for about a year and now<br>
it's getting serious.  If this is THE house, I hope it will be ours.  From<br>
the outside, it is totally ME.  We could use all the good karma and<br>
prayers you might want to send our way, for getting the "perfect" house<br>
and selling the one in which we currently live, which isn't too shabby.<br>

Leukemia, I have begin raising funds for the Leukemia and Lymphoma <br>

Training.  I am challanging myself to run a 26.2 mile marathon this <br>
summer in her honor and in return raise donations for the LLS.  I <br>
believe this run will be more difficult than hiking for boxes. If <br>
anyone cares to donate, you can visit my site at <br>
