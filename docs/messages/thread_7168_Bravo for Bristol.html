                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday shorty, Pitties and I headed for the Faire -- all of our first exeriences in Bristol (I think I remember going once as a kid... don't remember much other than all 5 of my senses were working on overload - the smell of the food and pigs roasting on spits (did they used to do that?), the sounds of music, the sights of everything).<br>
<br>
We got a bit later of a start than we had hoped to.... and got to the Faire just 5 minutes after the gates opened for business. We had been planning this since last December when we bought our tickets at 1/2 price before Christmas.<br>
<br>
We walked into the gate and there was Jane the Phoole!! From our research she seems to be a 'big name' 'round the Faire. After she was done talking with others we got the stamp she had in her pocket and then headed for the Wishing Well. While there we met up with Red Barn Hunter and Happy Baker - we split up after this box, met up at the next box and split up again. It was nice catching glimpses of them throughout the day. We also met Sister Power and Veronica (from Ft Collins, CO) at our 3rd box of the day and kept crossing paths throughout the day.<br>
<br>
Also at the Wishing Well, Skeeter my 9 y/o looked around and proclaimed, "This is better than I ever imagined!" :-)<br>
<br>
We had beautiful weather up until lunch time then the skies opened up and it downpoured for about 45 minutes or so, we had already gotten all the indoor boxes and ended up just huddling in the entry of a shop with many others. Fortunatly the skies let up and the clouds broke so the rest of the day was really nice . . . though the rain seemed to wake up all the mosquitos!! <br>
<br>
I'll let the details trail off here, though I would like to report a couple quick things;<br>
<br>
1) ALL the boxes are there and in place -- the Knight of Swords was esp. tickled that we found him and he hopes to have more visitors.<br>
<br>
2) There are some boxes listed as "unknown" and I can confirm the following to be there alive and well;<br>
<br>
-- The Knight of Swords & The Dirty Gossip Box<br>
<br>
We're already thinking of next year and how we can get all our families up to the Faire to grab more boxes and enjoy the sensory overload!!<br>
<br>
Thanks Dragon, Gibson Girl & all the people who put on the Faire for hosting these boxes and making our day so enjoyable!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I enjoyed the phone call from Hartx6 asking to confirm which conflicting rumor was true of if I was present or not.  I was sad to miss you but happy you had a great time.<br>
<br>
Apparently, my clue of my large feather hat was very helpful to the lovely family I met on Sunday while waiting for a college friend and her family to arrive at the Faire.<br>
<br>
I'll be there both days this weekend.  Still a chance of showers, but there are plenty of shops to hang out it, stay dry, and do a little shopping.  Saturday, I will be wearing my "wench" outfit of moss green and rose red skirts and a green/brown bodice.  Depending on the rain, I may or may not be wearing a garland of large natural colored feathers.  Sunday I hope to break out my noble gown which is a lovely light blue with a matching hat.<br>
<br>
Hope to meet more boxers this weekend!<br>
