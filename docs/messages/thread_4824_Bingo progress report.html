I'm Maid Marion, scribe for RobinHoodandMerryMen, reporting progress on <br/>
the cute game we call bingo.  Apparently I should have let Friar Tuck <br/>
pick the words (he may have been able to use Divine Intervention!) as <br/>
we have done lousy so far! Of the games still in play, We're 4 away <br/>
from the X, 6 away from the frame, and 11 away from a full sheet.  We <br/>
only have 2 of our 4 corners (and one of them is my free square-still <br/>
not called!) and I still do not have a simple line bingo!  But this all <br/>
said, my family is having a ball and can't wait to defrost so we can <br/>
get out and start searching again!  Thanks Spring Chick for setting <br/>
this all up.  I maintain a quiet presence here on LbGLK, but I have <br/>
really enjoyed reading and getting to know you all!<br/>
