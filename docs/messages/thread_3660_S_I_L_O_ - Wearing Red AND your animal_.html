Tiptoe & Tonto got back from a quick trip to Florida and saw that yet <br>
another "local" gathering was being planned...Unfortunately we <br>
are "red" hot mad about the S.I.L.O. being a no-go...We have a baby <br>
shower in Rockford at the same time and out-of-town guests coming for <br>
the weekend....I think Tonto was happy because he would have probably <br>
been the one that had to 'fess up to being the oldest and doesn't own a <br>
lick of red... other than the sunburn he got on the beach!  Tiptoe <br>
would be a dragon and the old guy...a rat!<br>
Have a wonderful time...<br>

I'll be wearing my ROOSTER pin and Martini Man (aka Hairy Ape)is <br>
looking for a suitable MONKEY symbol that he can use.<br>
<br>
Many of those Chinese animals are a natural for a barnyard (Ox, <br>
Horse, Sheep, Pig, Rooster, Rabbit, Dog and yes, even Rat and perhaps <br>
Snake).  However a couple will have obviously gotten lost on their <br>
way to the jungle (Monkey & Tiger) and who knows where the magical <br>
beast (Dragon) belongs....<br>
<br>

<br>
P.S.  All I did was simply mention that the original date was Chinese <br>
New Year and therefore probably a good day for a party!  Not that we <br>
ever need an excuse for a get-together.<br>

I'm not even sure if I have any red clothes.  It's not a color I tend to buy.  My favorite color is blue.  But I'll be decked out in RED on Feb. 17th at the SILO.  I still think the staff will wonder why everyone is showing up in the same color.  It's not one of those red hat society groups, we're just wearing red and discussing Chinese animals.  What a day this is going to be.  See you there!  <br>
