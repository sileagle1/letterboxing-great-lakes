If anyone has found any of my boxes, you have seen one of these rubber<br/>

Yep, doubtless this might have been what they were referring to as regards <br/>
"commercial" stamps.  I literally read close to 60 or 70 websites giving the <br/>
history of letterboxing, and I'm not going to spend the time looking thru them <br/>
all again to find exactly what site I read it on. IIRC, it was a UK site where I <br/>
read that commercial stamps had been preferred to hand-made ones -- a <br/>
relatively plain site with a font size that my eyes could just barely read.  <br/>
<br/>
But what you're talking about is still a commercial stamp in my opinion, and <br/>
I can't see any difference between having one of those made and buying an <br/>
already-made one that a person really likes at a store.  There *is* the artistry <br/>
involved I guess in that the person did make their own drawing, but then that's <br/>
not even necessary either.  There are so many amateur software programs for <br/>
working with photos and images done by others to reduce things down to what can <br/>
be done to commercially produce a stamp, that it basically can come down to <br/>
having a simple printshop type software program that will combine a drawing, a <br/>
desired font, and a design.  The individual is doing none of the "sculpture" <br/>
work that would be required to produce that stamp.    <br/>
<br/>
But I think to me it would be more desirable just because, even tho it's <br/>
commercial, at least it can be individualized to the person, if a personal stamp, <br/>
or it can be made to securely relate to the scene, if it's a stamp going into <br/>
a letterbox.  So it would follow more the traditional "I was here &amp; I can <br/>
prove it" line of thinking.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In addition to Matt's great advice, let me add that there are places <br/>
that will provide you with a whole sheet (7"x9") full of your images <br/>
*in rubber* which leaves you to just cut them apart and mount them. <br/>
They're just like store-bought, only it's your image.<br/>
This is just an option if carving is not your deal.<br/>
You can still design your signature stamp or box images and send them <br/>
off for reproduction.<br/>
We have used these sources for 'art stamps' but not for letterbox <br/>
stamps, so far.<br/>
Although as Matt can probably attest, replacing a commercially <br/>
produced stamp for a missing box would be a whole lot easier than <br/>
recarving an image.<br/>
