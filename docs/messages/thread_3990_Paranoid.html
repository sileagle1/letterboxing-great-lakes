box out that makes me paranoid. When I was doing that gathering I had <br/>
to place 32 boxes in one day. I had no look out with me so everytime I <br/>
went off trail to plant a box my heart started to pound, and I thought <br/>
at any moment some park ranger was going to pop out behind a mushroom <br/>
to arrest me. Or some axe murderer, it was a 50/50 toss up. I get so <br/>
nervous when I plant a box I almost dread doing it.<br/>
