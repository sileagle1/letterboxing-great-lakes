was that they were made like a sandwich...a clear band in the middle with<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is called "eraser carving" because long before Speedball made the pink<br>
stuff or Staedler made Mastercarve, people were carving on Staedler and pink<br>
pearl erasers.  Eraser carving is actually derived from other, more<br>
historical forms of block carving -- namely wood carving and linoleum<br>
carving.  When people began using erasers, they called it "soft-block"<br>
carving.  Many people still use erasers for their carving medium, and<br>
anything will work with varying degrees of success.  I have actually had<br>
pretty good results with those cheap 8 for $1.00 white rectangular erasers<br>
from the dollar store.  The biggest problem with erasers is that the size is<br>
limited.  Staedler used to make what they called a "grand" erasers -- about<br>
2 1/4" x 1 1/2".  The consistency was somewhere between Mastercarve and the<br>
pink stuff.  I loved them and several of my first letterboxing stamp were<br>
done on these (i.e. Chinook Pier).  But they stopped distributing them at<br>
some point last year.  They still make a smaller eraser that has this same<br>
consistency but I find the size limiting and they are rather expensive.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that is the scoop with "eraser carving."  Use whatever works for you<br>
and is cheap!<br>

Adding onto what SpringChick notes,<br>
you may also read about carvers using rubber plumber's gasket <br>
material. I haven't tried it myself, but I've seen wonderful results.<br>
Check out Ruthann's carvings at:<br>
<br>
http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/carving/<br>
<br>
which is also available via Deb's site along with other good carving <br>
stuff:<br>
<br>
http://www.confessionsofdecember.com/lbna/lbcarve.asp<br>
<br>
My very first stamp was carved from a squareish green rubber eraser <br>
about 25 years ago. I've still got it.<br>
<br>
I've tried those tiny, round, plasticky ones, but did not have much <br>
success.<br>
<br>
It seems that one's choice of material is a pretty personal thing.<br>
I love PZKut.<br>

chance they might be useful for a microbox or a hitchhiker one <br>

almost 5 pounds by now!!!  :)  <br>

art, rubber stamping in general), another idea for use of the small <br>
scraps is to use them for alphabet stamps.  I've carved a couple sets <br>
of fancy font letters from my little scrap pieces and love them!<br>

My Irish self hoards any and all scraps of Mastercarve on the off <br>
chance they might be useful for a microbox or a hitchhiker one <br>
day!!! The tin lunchbox in which I keep my "stash" must weigh <br>
almost 5 pounds by now!!! :) <br>

theme to showcase and commemorate some memorable "scraps" in <br>
American pop culture: Ali vs. Foreman, Billie Jean King vs. Bobby <br>
Rigg (I think that's his name) King Kong vs. Godzilla, Ohio State <br>
vs. Michigan, Tonya Harding vs. Nancy Kerrigan, Maggie Simpson <br>
vs. "the baby with the one eyebrow", George W. vs. the English <br>
language.... ;)<br>
<br>
I don't know how well this idea would play out with your scrap <br>
collection.... I have 5 lbs worth I can lend ya, if that's any <br>
help! :)<br>
