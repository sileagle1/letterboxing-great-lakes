Forest Park is presenting the first ever "Forest Park Flapper Ghost Coffin Races" (Stroll #3: Forest Park Flapper) on October 27th.  There isn't much info yet, but I gather that teams build a coffin from provided specs, decorate the coffin (and themselves), and then race them down the street.  Should be interesting to watch.<br>
