                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found a personal stamp in the Run Around the Island box on Mackinac Island, MI in August. The date the family stamped in was July 14, 2011. They had no trail name, but signed Molly, Chloe and Margaret Lynch.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if anyone knows them? I would like to send their stamp back to them, but need help finding the family. The box was too small to keep the stamp inside.<br/>

Many boxes on the island. Lots missing. Mackinac Island is my all time favorite place to be. It's my 'happy place'.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Happy Boxing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I replaced the book earlier this month and double-checked the names and dates. Chloe, Molly and Margaret Lynch are definitely from July 14. Not sure why their stamp would be there so much later. Unles it was outside the box and people in-between their visit and your visit didn't see it until the last person before you? Maybe they found it on the ground nearby and put it in the box? What does the personal stamp look like? On the page they signed, it was 2 simple store-bought tiny stamps. One star and one flower.<br/>
