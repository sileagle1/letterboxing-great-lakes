 <br>
Things were going along just fine as I kept my distance and watched him ask children if they’ve been keeping their room clean, minding their parents, etc, etc.  The kids could barely contain their excitement as they touched his beard and told him what they wanted for Christmas.  Things were going well.  <br>
 <br>
After the crowd dissipated and Santa was ready to call it a day, I got to speak to him.  At first I was having fun, asking him about his friendships with the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and others.  I learned his favorite cookie (chocolate-chocolate chip) and his preference of homemade eggnog.  <br>
 <br>
As conversation grew on a more personal level however, things started going down-hill, rapidly.  Come to find out, this Santa had been growing his beard since high school and was proud of its authenticity, as he should be.  I was truly happy for him, especially since this was his first year fulfilling his roll as the jolly man from the North Pole.<br>
 <br>
I tried to hide my goose bumps as he invited me to touch his beard to confirm that it was genuine.  I politely refused but thanked him for the offer.  He must have thought I didn’t believe him, however, since he moved a bit closer and actually held the white beard out closer to me to touch.  <br>
 <br>
At this point I started to shiver as I again refused.  I think I may have offended him, because it was then that he actually pulled a piece of hair out of his chin and held it out to me to prove that it was real.  <br>
 <br>
Now my stomach is doing some serious churning.  I backed away so rapidly that I bump into a counter behind me and nearly dropped my things.  I know that I had better quickly admit my total major phobia of hair before the vomit started coming up and I couldn’t speak at all.  <br>
 <br>
So my question is, am I going to get a lump of coal for being disrespectful to the big man in red? <br>

Ho, ho, horror!  Anybody know a good therapist?<br>

Subject: [LbGLK] my interview with Santa<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
In all my years as a news correspondent, I’ve interviewed a wide variety of individuals.  My most recent interview, however, definitely topped them all.  For the first and hopefully last time, I had a behind-the-scenes visit with the one and only, Santa Clause.  <br>
 <br>
Things were going along just fine as I kept my distance and watched him ask children if they’ve been keeping their room clean, minding their parents, etc, etc.  The kids could barely contain their excitement as they touched his beard and told him what they wanted for Christmas.  Things were going well.  <br>
 <br>
After the crowd dissipated and Santa was ready to call it a day, I got to speak to him.  At first I was having fun, asking him about his friendships with the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and others.  I learned his favorite cookie (chocolate-chocolate chip) and his preference of homemade eggnog.  <br>
 <br>
As conversation grew on a more personal level however, things started going down-hill, rapidly.  Come to find out, this Santa had been growing his beard since high school and was proud of its authenticity, as he should be.  I was truly happy for him, especially since this was his first year fulfilling his roll as the jolly man from the North Pole.<br>
 <br>
I tried to hide my goose bumps as he invited me to touch his beard to confirm that it was genuine.  I politely refused but thanked him for the offer.  He must have thought I didn’t believe him, however, since he moved a bit closer and actually held the white beard out closer to me to touch.  <br>
 <br>
At this point I started to shiver as I again refused.  I think I may have offended him, because it was then that he actually pulled a piece of hair out of his chin and held it out to me to prove that it was real.  <br>
