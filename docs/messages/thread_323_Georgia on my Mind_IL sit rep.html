<br>
Our weekend didn't go much better than yours (from a letterboxing <br>
standpoint).  For one thing, we didn't even make it up to MI at all!<br>
The traffic was so horrendous that after a 2 hour crawl from <br>
Chicagoland to the very edge of IN, Kate turned the car around and <br>
we headed back home.  No Delirium boxes for T.T.  Sigh.<br>
<br>
The next day, we thought we'd find some local boxes that we hadn't <br>
yet gotten around to seeking...  Guess what? We couldn't find either<br>
(Indian Caves and Saved by Music #1)!<br>
<br>
We're still kicking ourselves, especially since Kate had worked so <br>
hard to decipher your clues.<br>
<br>
Oh, well--  It's probably all karma anyway-- a wealth of boxes one <br>
weekend (the gathering) and a famine the next.<br>
<br>
A few more good things about Georgia: REM, Indigo Girls, and B-52's.<br>
<br>
Melinda, TT<br>

I am officially done with my familial duties and back from Georgia.  <br>
And for all my dutiful doings what did I get?  One stinking <br>
(literally), water logged box in the middle of a campground that <br>
seemed to contain more confederate flags than I've ever seen in one <br>
place (interesting side note:  my beloved brother-in-law, a <br>
narcotics officer and good-old boy if I've ever seen one, tells me <br>
that displaying a confederate flag in your car is deemed obscene and <br>
therefore illegal by the state of Georgia and is often the pretense <br>
under which he pulls people he suspects possessing illegal <br>
drugs....) so SpringChick, your HH did NOT get sent out into the <br>
wilds of Georgia, simply because the poor box was in no condition to <br>
hold its original stamp, let alone yours.<br>

infested pine straw than I've ever seen her have in her short life.<br>

accept my apologies if you were in any way offended by the above <br>
write-up of my experience in Georgia.  I really do like Georgia.  I <br>
really LOVE those Waffle Houses and sweet tea.  <br>
