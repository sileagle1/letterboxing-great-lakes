                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I am thinking of planting a box in a game area near my house. My<br>
family and I have trekked through the mud on several occasions and I<br>
have carried all 4 children atop my shoulders to get to an old ruin<br>
just to see the naturalized narcissus and muscari gone wild. However,<br>
my wife has nothing to do with the mud or water (she just waits). My<br>
kids and I like the extreme (BUT we keep it safe)and they LOVE the<br>
mud. Get ready, I have a doozy of a plan set forth for Mid-Michigan<br>
letterboxers.<br>
