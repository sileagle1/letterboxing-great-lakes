I put the photos in a new album on my picture trail website.  Click on the photos on the left side after you open the album and you can read the descriptions.  I couldn't believe the ice was thick enough to hold up the vehicle!!  It didn't even leave a mark on some of the ice in our driveway.  Mike got the vehicle out, but had a heck of a time getting it back up the driveway :-) He did say the road ours connects with is mostly clear and the main roads are fine.  Our road is still a snow covered sheet of ice, but the thin layer of snow gives some traction.<br>
