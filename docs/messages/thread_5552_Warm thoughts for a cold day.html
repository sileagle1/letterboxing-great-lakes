the Boxacon 2009 gathering October 3rd at Minooka Park in Waukesha, <br/>

done this before, so it will take me awhile to get anything actually up <br/>

I know it isn't terribly far, and one could possibly make it there and back  <br/>
in one day -- leave at 7am there by 10 leave there by 8 and home by 11. <br/>
<br/>
Right now its more the finances I'm thinking about . . . couple tanks of  gas <br/>
plus a couple of meals and we can hit the $100 mark pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
We'll see where we're sitting closer to time.<br/>

Ave, about 15 years ago.  I haven't been back since.  So this is going to be<br/>
a real trip down memory lane for me.  My hubby and I used to take walks<br/>
along the Fox River downtown where the beautiful dragonfly sculptures are. <br/>
(Worth seeing, for those planning on being there.)  I can't wait!  Also, I<br/>
ve been wanting to visit the Lang Folk Art studios in Delafield for ages. <br/>
That's the place that makes all those wonderful calendars and greeting cards<br/>
and such.  Anyone want to make a side trip there with me?<br/>
