trying to wrack my brains trying to come up with a good hiding spot since I<br>
joined this exchange, and I still haven't decided yet.  I'd like to try to<br>
find something that ties into your landmark at a local level..  Hmmmm.<br>
Going to have to think more about this.<br>

Back to the camo tape.  I like the stuff I bought at WalMart, even though it<br>
probably is a little more expensive (around $2/pkg)  in the long run.  I<br>
came on a flattened roll, which made it nice and compact to carry with me.<br>
It is also reinforced with fibers, so it is sturdier.  My husband bought me<br>
a big roll of camo tape (I think from Gander Mountain??  Maybe Bass Pro,<br>
come to think of it), and it works fine, but I noticed it is a lot shiner<br>
than the WalMart stuff.  I suppose that could be a disadvantage if the<br>
sunlight or a flashlight caught it (but then again, "naked plastic" would do<br>
the same thing.).   <br>

The AQ posting of the micro-meet.from the AQ home page, look for the chicken<br>
leg icon to find the blerb about the event planner.  There's a hyperlink to<br>
take you there.  We're #5 on the list.<br>
