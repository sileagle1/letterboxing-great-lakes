from a friend who heard it from a friend...  That was earlier this <br>
summer.  We have found many boxes, been to a gathering, planted some, <br>
and even found our first HH today.  We would still consider <br>
ourselves "newbies".  However, even as new boxers, we have treated <br>
the boxes as our own.  We carry an emergency box repair kit to help <br>
out others... During our recent hunting, we have noticed boxes in the <br>
open, some with bags not zipped up, and some have been wet.   <br>
<br>
What we are saying is that we should expect some mis-treatment of <br>
boxes with the new publicity.  We think that the folks that don't <br>
take care of the boxes will not last long.  The true boxers will <br>
probably end up carring a repair kit, like we have!  We have to ask <br>
ourselves, do we want more boxes to find?  If we do, there needs to <br>
be at least some publicity- and as we now know, this may have some <br>
pitfalls. <br>

Well, from here you sound like "experienced" letterboxers.<br>
Let's not even talk about "old" boxers, okay? <grins><br>
