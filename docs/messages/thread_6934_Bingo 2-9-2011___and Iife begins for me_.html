We hate to say it Mr. OldManFamofMany, but Bali hit the nail on the head regarding your bingo calling skills...LOTS of room for improvement!<br/>
We wish you a very Happy 40th...with both of us being close to 122, we can say that if you make it through the day...it's all great after that.  Forty was our "tough one" and trust us...we've seen a few in our time!  <br/>
