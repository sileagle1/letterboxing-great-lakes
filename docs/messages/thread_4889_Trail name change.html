                    <div class="plaintext-content">As some of you know me by Guys and Dolls, yet none of you have met me<br>
face to face :) (only 27 days until you do!) Then you also know that I<br>
was part of the Letterboxing competition based in Sunfield MI last<br>
summer. Well, Guys and Dolls was really the name of the "team" I was<br>
on and will be retired unless I go out with the group of people from<br>
that "team".<br>
<br>
So! I will hereby be known as DERBY DUDE! I love driving in demolition<br>
derby's of sorts. What I do is more of a full contact race with lots<br>
of pushing and shoving! Almost a figure 8 but not quite, also<br>
containing jumps! <br>
<br>
Also I carved a new signature stamp and have registered at both sites<br>
with my new trail name, so I think I am all set. If you can think of<br>
anything I missed let me know.<br>
<br>
So there you go.<br>

Lulu (usually stamping in on the same page as me), has decided that "Louie" sounds more grown-up than "Lulu". Ahhhhh, the tween years ;o)<br>
<br>
So you'll start seeing the name change in logbooks soon. That's what all her friends & coaches call her anyway, so she thought it would make sense to start using that name. Her siggy stamp will stay the same since her name was not part of the stamp.<br>
