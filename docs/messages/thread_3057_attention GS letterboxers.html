A reminder to all GS-affiliated letterboxers (leaders, volunteers, or even girl members), we have a separate yahoo group specifically for our little niche of the boxing world.  Drop an off-list note to me, JACKS, or Jabber (of Jabber and JoBob fame) and we'll send you an invitation to join (we keep it a private group because of Safety-Wise considerations....).<br>
 <br>
Sorry Boy/Cub Scouts - you have to start your own group!<br>

Thanks again DD for a great day.  Oh, yes - even though I was a Girl <br>
Scout (always prepared) I didn't read the weather report and it did <br>
rain a lot - so I was the one in the stylish trash bag - next time <br>
I'll remember the day glo duct tape and then I'll truly be styling.  <br>
<br>
Have a great boxing fall!<br>
