with comfortable walking shoes and your letterboxing logbook, sig stamps, <br/>
and markers!  (And a potluck dish if you so desire.)  All the cluesheets <br/>
will be available at the event.  There will be some tabletop stamps but most <br/>
will be planted out in forest preserve for you to find.  And there will be <br/>
LOTS of other boxers to meet and do exchanges with.  And tons of food!<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can think of right now, email me if you have any questions!<br/>

<br/>
Once you sign up for the event, on the event page above the event description, will be a button that says "personal travelers". Click on that to see all the PT's that will be there (the list is based on the people signed up to attend).<br/>
<br/>
Hope you guys have fun!<br/>
