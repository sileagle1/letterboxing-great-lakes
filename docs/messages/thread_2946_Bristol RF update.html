briefly!  <br/>

After taking nearly 2 weeks to get William Shakespeare replaced, I <br/>

I'm considering an addition to my costume to make me a little more <br/>
obvious to visiting boxers.  I was thinking of making a sash with a <br/>
6" or 7"-square LB NA logo on each end, either quilted or <br/>
embroidered.  This might be easier to spot me at the Faire, since I'm <br/>
not as obvious to spot as the other letterpeople, I'm not usually at <br/>

Hope to see more boxers this season!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI!! I was looking EVERYWHERE for you Kate.  LOL  I must've kept missing you.  Also, I was running late to meet Beetle, and when I got to the town square, I wasn't sure who I was looking for!  =) But, we met the Cottontails, and the Bikercats at the faire while looking for the same letterboxes.  Jezzibel had both hubby and me in tears laughing so hard especially with her banana!!!  AlLso, it was funny trying to find Barefoot Ahnk...his partner didn't even know he worked for him!! LOL  We found all the letterboxes, Jane the Phoole, and the Charitable mistress, but had trouble in finding the guy who runs a game, the picture perfect letter person, and then I couldn't find the one shop for Sylvia Rose.  But all in all I had a WONDERFUL time and met alot of nice people, I wish I met more though. =)   I enjoyed myself so much, that I was so exhausted on Sunday.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One thing I've learned about looking for people at Faire. You can <br/>
chase someone around the entire Faire (which covers ~40 acres) and <br/>
never find them.  It's better to sit in one place and wait for them to <br/>
go by again!  Sorry I missed you!<br/>
<br/>
Unlike me, Barefoot Ankh only uses that name for boxing, but if he's <br/>
working at the shop (usually only Saturdays), his doublet is either <br/>
red or blue.  Sylvie-Rose seems to have made the decision to work in <br/>
the "normal" world for most weekends, but has announced she will be at <br/>
Faire for closing weekend (Sept 2-4).  The best chance to find me near <br/>
Royal Exchange (I don't work there and usually am wandering about) is <br/>
between 12:30 and 2:00.  That's when the wenches gather for our Faire <br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
THREE more weekends to find Dragon's great series!  Hope to meet more <br/>
LBers soon!<br/>
