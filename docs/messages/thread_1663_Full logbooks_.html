What do you do with your FULL logbooks?<br/>
<br/>
I've recently done some maintenance and had to replace a number of<br/>
logbooks which were full of wonderful signature stamps. With new books<br/>
in place, I've settled in the living room with the full books. I've<br/>
pored over them, studied the stamps, wondered at the various<br/>
conditions described by the finders.....now what?<br/>
Do you cut out the pages and make a collage? Just put them on the<br/>
shelf with all of the other important stuff of your life? Box them up?<br/>
Or, horrors, Do you pitch 'em out?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just curious,<br/>

places, too.<br/>

Hey Azobox,<br/>
<br/>
Put them up on e-bay, add a high reserve price and let the bidding begin! <br/>
<br/>
Do I hear $175, $200, $225, hey, that crazy red head in the back wants<br/>
to bid $500. . .  <br/>
<br/>
As for myself, it will be years before mine fill up, due to the fact<br/>
that I just planted them and they have like a thousand pages.<br/>
<br/>
But, when they do fill up, I plan to place them in a treasure chest<br/>
and hold them very tightly when I sleep at night.<br/>
<br/>
Goodluck!<br/>

boxes I have retired.  I haven't really done anything with them -- <br/>
they're just in a drawer in my art room right now.  Every once in a <br/>
while I sit down with them and browse the pages.  Funny how a stamp <br/>
will catch my attention the second or third time around that didn't <br/>
get a second glance on a previous look...  sometimes because the <br/>
name is now familiar or even the design one I've seen recently, etc.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite one are the two full books from the Bridges of Lancaster <br/>
letterbox in PA.  Thanks to the kindness of [previously] unknown <br/>
letterboxers, I've been able to put new books into this box twice <br/>
now and they've sent me the old ones.  So neat to look through a <br/>
book from a far away letterbox.  Not many stamps I recognize from <br/>
boxes around here, but many names I recognize from various talk <br/>
list, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I kind of like your idea of making a collage of them, except that a <br/>
lot of the pages are stamped on the back... hmmm, have to think <br/>
about that a bit.<br/>

<br/>
Second, I know of two ideas: 1) Leave the log in the box along with <br/>
a new 2nd log so everyone can see who has ever been there, and 2) <br/>
scrapbook or otherwise nicely retire the logbook at home.<br/>
