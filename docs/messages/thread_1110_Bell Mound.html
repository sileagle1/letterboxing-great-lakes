Greetings from Minnesota!<br>
<br>
We got a late start to the day, so didn't get to hit many boxes.  The road to Echo Rock was closed, so not knowing how much further a walk it would be to hoof it from the roadblock, we turned back.  And since I wanted to get to Bell Mound before dark, we didn't do Mirror Lake either.  Bell Mound was really cool.  What a view for stamping!  I was a nervous wreck that the box would tumble over the edge.  Papillon wanted me to point out that SHE found it!<br>
<br>
We hope to find a few in the Twin Cities area, as well as finding a hiding spot for FOOW8.<br>
<br>
I just found a brochure for the Spam Museum and want to stop there on the way home.  I bought some MasterCarve at the NIU bookstore this morning.  Maybe I'll have time to carve a stamp to leave there!  All I have are some new #1 tips (no handle).  I'll have to find a store to buy a container.  Darn, I knew I should have brought more supplies with me.<br>
