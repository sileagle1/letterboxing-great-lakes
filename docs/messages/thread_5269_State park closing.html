                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not just those two parks. I just got the paper and the story is on the front page. Eleven state parks and 13 historical sites are going to be closed. Kickapoo, on of my favorite places to go is on the list. This means some of the best hiking trails in the area and the nearest canoe rental are disappearing. Wolf Creek State Park, where my Holy Grail boxes are planted and the park near the Goat Tower, is also on the list. And it doesn't sound like the state has plans to reopen them anytime soon either.<br>
<br>
I had already pulled my boxes when we went on Tuesday. I came around the bend on my way to Coal Miner's Daughter and was shocked and heartbroken to see half of the bridge (including the board the box was hidden under) had been pulled up. Thankfully the box was exactly where it was supposed to be and very well camouflaged. Then I pulled Aina's series because it has been a year since anyone visited and I wanted to do a little maintenance. I had fully intended to replant the boxes either in the same location or nearby on the same trails. But now it looks like I won't be able to. Aina's series will probably be replanted in a new location, but Coal Miner's Daughter, while one of my favorite stamps that I am very proud of, was kind of linked to the fact that Kickapoo was once a strip mine and I can't really think of anywhere else that would fit the theme very well.<br>

I was out near Lowden 2 weeks ago and found a flyer with this website<br>
on it.  Click on "our petition" for a letter to the Gov.  It also has<br>
a link to the State's site so you can write the gov as well.  <br>
<br>
Lowden is one of our favorite State Parks.  <br>
