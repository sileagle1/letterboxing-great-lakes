                    <div class="plaintext-content">Beautiful letterboxing weather!  My in-laws picked me up at the airport <br/>
and took me to Duke Gardens to find Grey Matters (first finder!) as a <br/>
means of introducing them to letterboxing.  Sad to say, I don't think <br/>
they "got it".  Oh, well.  Can't convert everyone - and we wouldn't <br/>
want to anyway!<br/>
<br/>
I believe the Tarheel box is not too far from my hotel.  I hope they <br/>
let us out of our training sessions early enough (ie, still daylight) <br/>
that I can snag it before I leave Thursday.<br/>
