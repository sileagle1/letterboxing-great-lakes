<br>
I had a box I planted for one day only at the GL event a couple weeks <br>
ago.  I'm planning on planting it in a permanent location in MI this weekend.<br>
<br>
If it were you, would you just use the same info on LbNA and AQ and <br>
change the location?  Or should I archive those listings and start it <br>
as a new listing in case anyone who found it before wants to find it <br>
in it's new home?   A very few people logged into it in OH, and they <br>
probably wouldn't be finding it here anyway.  But, if they did, I <br>
think it wouldn't log as a new find if I left it as it is now.<br>
<br>
For those of you that have done this, how'd you handle it?<br>
<br>

box, once it's finally replanted - put a note that it<br>

Cluez-In and has now been re-planted closer to home. <br>
The only reason I actually listed it on AtlasQuest<br>
already is because I know so many people like to log<br>
their finds, and aren't like me waiting almost 6<br>
months before finally logging stuff in....<br>
