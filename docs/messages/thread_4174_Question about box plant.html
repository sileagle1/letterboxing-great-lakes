<br/>
I had a box I planted for one day only at the GL event a couple weeks <br/>
ago.  I'm planning on planting it in a permanent location in MI this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
If it were you, would you just use the same info on LbNA and AQ and <br/>
change the location?  Or should I archive those listings and start it <br/>
as a new listing in case anyone who found it before wants to find it <br/>
in it's new home?   A very few people logged into it in OH, and they <br/>
probably wouldn't be finding it here anyway.  But, if they did, I <br/>
think it wouldn't log as a new find if I left it as it is now.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you that have done this, how'd you handle it?<br/>
<br/>

their finds, and aren't like me waiting almost 6<br/>
months before finally logging stuff in....<br/>
