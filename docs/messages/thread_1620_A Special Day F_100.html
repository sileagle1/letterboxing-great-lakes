                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations!!  That's a significant milestone here AND in Dartmoor, the<br>
birthplace of letterboxing.  You'd now be eligible for the "one hundred<br>
club" since they do keep counts in England.   Here's an excerpt from a<br>
Dartmoor related website:  "The one hundred club is specifically for those<br>
people who have found over 100 of the boxes. You get a cloth badge and a car<br>
sticker, and are able to attend the bi-annual meeting at the Dartmoor Prison<br>
Officers Social Club in Princetown, where a special letterbox makes an<br>
appearance!"  This same website includes a lot of interesting statistics<br>
related to box counts and other aspects of letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Did anyone else listen to the BBC broadcast about letterboxing that was<br>
on-line earlier this month?  I thought it was hilarious!<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well hubby and I are leaving for a 3-day weekend in St. Louis tomorrow morning, and I had thought that would be an excellent opportunity to find some boxes in that area.  But unless I am not reading the LBNA website correctly, there are NO boxes in the St. Louis area???  Looks like I am out of luck unless I check the Illinois counties we will be driving through to get there and back.  I'm in northern Illinois, BTW.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
