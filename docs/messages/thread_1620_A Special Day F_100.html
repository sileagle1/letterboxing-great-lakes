                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations!!  That's a significant milestone here AND in Dartmoor, the<br/>
birthplace of letterboxing.  You'd now be eligible for the "one hundred<br/>
club" since they do keep counts in England.   Here's an excerpt from a<br/>
Dartmoor related website:  "The one hundred club is specifically for those<br/>
people who have found over 100 of the boxes. You get a cloth badge and a car<br/>
sticker, and are able to attend the bi-annual meeting at the Dartmoor Prison<br/>
Officers Social Club in Princetown, where a special letterbox makes an<br/>
appearance!"  This same website includes a lot of interesting statistics<br/>
related to box counts and other aspects of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone else listen to the BBC broadcast about letterboxing that was<br/>
on-line earlier this month?  I thought it was hilarious!<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

But unless I am not reading the LBNA website correctly, there are NO boxes in the St. Louis area???  Looks like I am out of luck unless I check the Illinois counties we will be driving through to get there and back.  I'm in northern Illinois, BTW.<br/>

&gt; &gt; A few weeks back Kookaburra and I counted up our<br/>

&gt; &gt; 100 ever since.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Today we made it! We choose the GL 2005 Exchange<br/>
&gt; Box - Barn Theater <br/>
&gt; to be our 100th <br/>
&gt; &gt; box. Carved by Pale Puppy Posse and Naughty Dog<br/>
&gt; and placed by our <br/>
&gt; local letterboxing <br/>
&gt; &gt; friend Funguswoman. <br/>
&gt; &gt; We made it between the only raindrops we have had<br/>
&gt; in weeks but were <br/>
&gt; determined for this <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be the day. Buccaneer was with us enjoying his<br/>
&gt; 70-something find <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; Kookaburra's pup, Doodle the Burr Ball, enjoyed<br/>
&gt; his 20-something find.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks to all of you who make this activity so<br/>
&gt; great.<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
