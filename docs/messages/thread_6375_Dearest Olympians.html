We were able to leave the comfort of our sauna a few weeks ago and plant the boxes - we haven't just been rolling around in the snow - we've actually learned a lot about our adoptive homeland while training!  Please note that Tonto got his slippers pretty wet while hiking around - even thought there was snow pack it was wet out there.  Boots would be in order for snow or mud...<br/>
We posted the clue on LBNA tonight - "A Little Bit of Sweden"...5 boxes...<br/>
