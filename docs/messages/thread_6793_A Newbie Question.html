                    <div class="plaintext-content">That means although not necessarily "supposed to", that it would be NICE if someone could bring a new logbook along if they were looking for the box, since the old one is either full or damaged.  We've added/replaced numerous logbooks in other people's boxes and others have done the same for us.  We almost always have spare blank logbooks along with us, and also extra baggies and even an extra box so we can do any repairs necessary when we find a box.<br/>
