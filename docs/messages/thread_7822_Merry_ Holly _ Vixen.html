                    <html><body><p>A few years back, we placed three holiday-themed pin-up boxes in local 
shops in Libertyville, IL.  As planned, we pulled them after the new 
year, and we've been holding them until now.<br/><br/>Earlier today, 
Merry, Holly and Vixen were given permanent homes in Moraine Hills State
 Park, just around the bend from Holiday Hills, IL.<br/><br/>Because it's 
an update to an existing box series, I don't think the update will make 
its way onto any notification lists from Atlasquest or 
Letterboxing.org.  So if you were interested in these back in December 
of 2010, but didn't get to them, we wanted to let you know that they 
have new locations and new clues.<br/><br/>Best Regards,<br/><br/>LSB</p></body></html>
