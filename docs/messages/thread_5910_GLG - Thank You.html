 It was so great to see everyone again we had met previously and to meet so many new people wow what a great bunch. Dartmoor Dreamer thank you so much for hanging out with us today we hope you had half as much fun as we did. <br/>
<br/>
 We keep our fingers crossed that we will be able to join in more gatherings as the year progresses. This has rekindled our love for the hobby and hopefully given us a kick start to not just find boxes but to plant a few of our own. Now to just get carving well enough to have a presentable stamp ... you really keep setting the bar higher and higher. The stamps today were AMAZING!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep, yep!  Definitely another great gathering.  Thanks Speedsquare and PPP for organizing everything Saturday and to the AB for Friday night (would have gotten there sooner if I hadn't gotten lost in the campground).<br/>
<br/>
Mr. FW had a great time too...he thoroughly enjoyed his nap in the truck while I boxed the day away with the Doglvrs and Cereal City Boxers.  He said thank you for the patch he won (okay, actually he said "What???  I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't win anything.", so *I* am saying thank you for the patch "he" won!).<br/>
<br/>
I don't know why everyone was so surprised that we camped!  (-:  I love camping...I'm usually just to lazy to get all the gear together for weekend trips, but have been camping through GS for years.<br/>
<br/>
(BTW:  Who was I talking to about GS camp??  Sorry, my brain is on overload and I can't remember who it was.  Please contact me offlist.)<br/>
<br/>
Did everyone who wanted a medallion get one at the camp store or Inn's gift shop?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the carvers for contributing wonderful stamps!  <br/>
