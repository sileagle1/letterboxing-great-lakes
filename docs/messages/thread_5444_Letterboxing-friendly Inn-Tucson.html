It was a very family friendly great place to have lived when our kids were little. We had a few "rules" to follow though, living in the desert that visitors might want to know if they are not familiar with desert critters:<br>
Never reach where you cannot see;<br>
Turn a light on before getting up in the dark for the bathroom, etc;<br>
Place shoes on a shelf at night;<br>
If you are lifting a rock, tilt it out away from you, not facing you.<br>
<br>
We followed these guidelines and never had any serious issues with scorpions or snakes--always respect the native wildlife. We had a great adventure following a rattler along its path one trip to the Chiricahau's (our favorite place). Every now and again it let us know we were too close, but never showed any agression, just "advice".<br>
<br>
Enjoy the beauty!!!!! I am really homesick right now.<br>

<br>
<br>
We just got a response back from a B&B in Tucson that we've stayed at before where we were <br>
checking on a future availability for a conference we are attending. We had to chuckle <br>
because in our inquiry for reservations we never mentioned that we were coming out to <br>
letterbox, but in the return subject line they had written "Jeremiah Inn Welcomes <br>
Letterboxers. " <br>
When we first stayed there we told them about letterboxing, but we thought it funny that they <br>
recognize us by our hobby. We could only imagine their conversation probably went <br>
something like ... "those crazy letterboxers are coming to stay with us again!"<br>
If you are going to Tucson they are a great B&B and the area has some wonderful letterboxing <br>
opportunities!<br>
Tiptoe & Tonto<br>
BTW..We just bought our 24 and 27 year old "kids" their chocolate advent calendars... couldn't <br>
miss a year! We found them at Sam's Club!<br>
