Thank you for signing the Save Our State Parks petition. Your action will help send a loud and clear message to Governor Blagojevich that it is not acceptable to close 11 state parks and 13 historic sites. <br/>
With the passage of Senate Bill 1103 on Tuesday, September 23, funding is nearly restored to keep the parks open. The last step is for Governor Blagojevich to sign the bill. <br/>
While we have over 14,000 signatures so far on the petition drive, we need to spread the word and make even a stronger statement that our parks are important to our citizens, our health and our economy. <br/>
PLEASE SHARE THIS WEBSITE AND EMAIL WITH YOUR FRIENDS! <br/>
www.SaveOurStateParks.org <br/>
Background: Lt. Governor Pat Quinn has launched the Save Our State Parks online petition drive to prevent Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich from permanently closing 11 Illinois state parks and laying off 39 employees.<br/>
On August 28, Gov. Blagojevich announced the closure of 11 state parks as part of his effort to slash $ 14 mil lion from the budget of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. <br/>
State parks which will be closed on November 30 include: Castle Rock State Park and Lowden State Park in Oregon; Hennepin Canal Parkway State Park in Sheffield; Illini State Park in Marseilles; Channahon Parkway State Park in Morris; Hidden Springs State Forest in Strasburg; Kickapoo State Park in Oakwood; Moraine State Park in Leroy; Weldon Springs State Park in Clinton; and Wolf Creek State Park in Windsor.<br/>
In the most recent year, there were more than 44 million visitors to Illinois state parks and recreation areas. Wildlife watching, hunting, and fishing contribute $2.4 billion to the Illinois economy each year, according to a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Survey.<br/>
