                    <div class="plaintext-content">FYI:<br>
"Zoo Two" is missing and presumed gone. No plans to replace at this time. <br>
For those contemplating Kalamazoo visits, clues for <br>
"Woods in the City II" have been revised due to obvious party-place<br>
activity at the former site.<br>
(I was sure the box had fallen prey to the partiers following a futile<br>
search at its location, especially since it was in the center of<br>
cans/bottles/wastepaper concentration. BUT, the camoulage apparently<br>
was its salvation! It was just hiding.)<br>
<br>
Stay tuned.<br>
