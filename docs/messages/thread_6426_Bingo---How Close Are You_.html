  I've been wondering how close people are to grabbing the "prize". I've got 10 spots left, anyone else care to divulge where they're at? Or do you think that will "jinx" you? ;) C'mon everyone, how many spots do you have left?<br/>

Beetle is so far behind in the BINGO game this year. I need to fill 13 (lucky number) spaces for a full card.  Impossible!  At one point very early on in the game, I had a double bingo game running.  I only needed one word to complete both a straight line and a verticle line. Never happened.  Can't jinx myself anymore than I'm already feeling.  Oh well, it was still fun playing all winter with the chance of winning.  Maybe my luck will improve next year.   <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've been wondering how close people are to grabbing the "prize". I've<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; got 10 spots left, anyone else care to divulge where they're at? Or do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you think that will "jinx" you? ;) C'mon everyone, how many spots do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have left?<br/>

I need an even dozen spaces to fill my card--and no wildcard to help me.  The only "bingo" I have is the 10-spot.  I fear that once again, it is not my year.  I keep telling myself this is good for my (overly) competitive streak--you can still have fun even if you don't win!<br/>
