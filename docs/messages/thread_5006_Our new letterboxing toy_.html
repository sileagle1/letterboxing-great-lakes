                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do that -- load clues as text docs onto my iPod.  I haven't completely abandoned paper clues though -- I usually take paper clues for the boxes I *know* I am going to and rely on the iPod clues more for boxes that I happen to be near that I hadn't anticipated and to keep my own box clues available at any time (as I often need help finding my own boxes).  I've been looking around for an iPod application that would let me assign tags or keywords to text files so it would be easier to find/search the clues I have on there, but have not found anything like that so far.  In the meanwhile, I have one document that is like an index that provides state, city, county and box name, which makes it easier to find things.  Works great!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those interested, here is how Deedle told me he uploaded the clues to his Nano:<br>
<br>
1. Copy & paste text from Letterbox clues into Notepad (Under Windows 'Accessories' tab), and save as .txt file [Doodle note - if you have a Mac, you can also save as a .txt file; if you don't know how email me for directions].<br>
<br>
2. Connect Ipod to computer and access it as a flash drive via My Computer [Doodle note - on a Mac, the icon should appear right on your desktop].<br>
<br>
3. Double-click the drive letter and it will open up the folder list [Doodle note - on a Mac, just double-click the icon on your desktop].<br>
<br>
4. Copy the .txt files into the "Notes" folder.<br>
<br>
Now you can access the files on your Ipod under the 'extras' screen.<br>
<br>
(In case it's not obvious, Deedle has a PC and I have a Mac at home :)<br>
<br>
Like SpringChick wrote about still keeping paper copies, I don't think this is going to make us go completely paperless, but it might help us be more stealthy on the trails when we do use the Nano for our clues.  Except for when we're fighting over the Nano in order to read the clues... :)<br>
