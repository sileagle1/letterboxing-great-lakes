                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
Well we were out today to find 3 boxes in a new series and to do some <br>
box maintenance.<br>
<br>
The bad news first:  Martini Man's "Figure Eights" box is indeed <br>
missing. His first lost box!  He plans to replace it later this fall.<br>
<br>
The good news: Two of my boxes had again been logged as "Attempted".  <br>
As expected, both were actually still in place.  The mystery <br>
box "Milwaukee Neighborhood" is right where it should be and I've now <br>
added a note to the clues asking people to email me to find out if <br>
they were in the right spot before they log it as "Attempted".  <br>
<br>
As my clues state in "Brookfield Junction", the box blends in VERY <br>
well and some people miss it.  I've added a note to my clues that a <br>
flashlight may be helpful.<br>
<br>
The REALLY good news:  A box I had checked on in the winter and <br>
thought missing, was in fact in place today!!!  When I last checked <br>
on it there was snow on the ground, so I thought there was a slight <br>
possibility that it was still in the area, but not where it should <br>
be.  We stopped today to confirm that it really was missing, but <br>
HOORAY!, it was there.  A group found it on the ground at the end of <br>
March , but returned it to its proper spot in the fallen tree.  <br>
So "Winter Fun #4  Ice Fishing" is now an active box again.  However <br>
I recommend you wait until fall or winter to look for it.  As is the <br>
case for many of the boxes we place, it is MUCH more difficult to <br>
find with all the summer growth.<br>
