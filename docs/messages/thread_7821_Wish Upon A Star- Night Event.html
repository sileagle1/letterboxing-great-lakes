In case you don't already have plans for next Saturday (NOV 16), you might want to attend the event in Wisconsin hosted by Seermesh.  It will be held in a suburb north of Milwaukee and should be a lot of fun.  She has listed it on AtlasQuest and sent out this info today:</p><p><span lang="EN"><var id="yui-ie-cursor"></var><br/>
*Most of the boxes are relatively easy because of the night aspect. Some will
be moved after 2 weeks. There are roughly 30-40 hidden boxes on 4 loops plus
bonus hidden boxes and several nearby boxes.<br/>
*There will be a drawing. You get a free entry per person at sign in, any
additional entries are $1 to help cover the cost of the rental of the building.
<br/>
Because of the parks rules, all boxers must be back to the beach house by no
later than 10:30pm. We have the building a little later so anyone wanting to
chill afterwards for a bit are welcome to, but they don't want people wandering
trails. They think we are going on a family scavenger hunt party, so as long as
we are respectful, we should be fine.</span></p><p>
