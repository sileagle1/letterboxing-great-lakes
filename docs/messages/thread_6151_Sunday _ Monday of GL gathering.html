Dogs at your niece's wedding:  probably not welcome, unless they agree not to eat from the buffet ;-)<br/>

I knew that the 2010 gathering was going to be out of reach for me this year. I'd love to get to one of these some year. My niece is getting married in Kansas that Saturday.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Most people do tend to make a weekend out of it, so a lot of people will come in Friday and stay until Sunday afternoon.  By Sunday evening though, most people will have gone home (although there are always one or two who seem to schedule their vacations around the gathering and stay in the area longer).<br/>
<br/>
As for dogs, that depends mostly on the location.  In my experience, dogs are welcomed at events by this group, although sometimes the gathering is at a park that does not allow dogs at the shelter area and there are some parks that just don't allow dogs.  2010 will probably be the first year that our two dogs don't join us at the gathering simply because we can't cram two large dogs and a baby comfortably into the back of a taurus (although if Katy and her two stay with us we might be able to talk her into transporting the dogs for us, it remains to be seen if we feel up to the challenge of two dogs and a baby on the trail).<br/>
