year old who now enjoys a good hike, I am willing to take them on all <br/>

younger ones eye surgery, his coordination and depth perception has <br/>
perked up considerably, so the later may be reappraised in the coming <br/>
weeks.  He just whines if the hike is too long/boring, LOL!  Tough is <br/>
the general response he gets, heehee.  I have found he does better if <br/>
we remember to take the garbage collecting bags with us on the trail <br/>
- gives him something on the side to watch for besides moss, unusual <br/>
fungus and wildlike (like that is not enough!).<br/>

So who was more surprised - you all or the deer??<br/>

&gt;I have to second WH on this. We love Letterboxing and take our<br/>
&gt;children along with us. That said, they understand the rules and we<br/>
&gt;remind them frequently of stealth, etc.(I have one that loves to<br/>
&gt;forget - sigh. Getting the 6 yr old to be quiet in the woods is a<br/>
&gt;true challenge - and he wonders why we do not see many<br/>
&gt;critters....). If a hiding place is easy to get to and no one is<br/>
&gt;around, we will let the children "re-hide" the box and we ALWAYS<br/>
&gt;double check them on it. I know the oldest one gets it (she is a<br/>
&gt;better rehider than I am at times - helps to be closer to the ground<br/>
&gt;at times, I guess, LOL!). The other one, well, he is 6 and is<br/>
&gt;learning. Therefore, we are extra diligent with him. We do all this<br/>
&gt;simply for the fact that we do NOT want to ruin it for others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, when dh and I get the chance, we do go without them. It<br/>
&gt;only happens a couple of times a year (like this last Sat.), but we<br/>
&gt;take advantage of that time. We go for the more difficult ones then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, this is sort of a rehash of prior thoughts on Letterboxing<br/>
&gt;with children.<br/>
