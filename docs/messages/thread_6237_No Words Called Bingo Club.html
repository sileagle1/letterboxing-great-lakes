I believe this is your moment to respond so the new folks understand how BAD<br/>
this can be (although Birdwowman got close last year as I recall). Also I<br/>
also recall a very fitting portrait of the queen of the empty Bingo card<br/>
that was also published last year.<br/>

Ah yes, I can attest to the LONG wait between words!  In matter of fact, I am STILL waiting for some words to be called from Bingo 2009 edition! Familyof6 and Birdwoman can all join me in telling all of you sitting there with empty cards..this is nothing...9 days without a word - no biggie...now in a month...then we can talk!<br/>
Tiptoe is more upset as she is watching you Badgers whipping her unbeaten Boilers! <br/>
Tiptoe...<br/>
who btw is 0 for 9 - still on her way to claiming her Bingo Queen status!  Hopefully a new Royal portrait will be in order!<br/>

&gt;Oh don't be so sure we haven't been "training" today...just ask Fam of Many...even to the point that I was romantically warring in an Elmer Fudd hat!
