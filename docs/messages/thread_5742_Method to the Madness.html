It's really not very scientific...  As pointed out, there are 45 boxes, with the distribution being even between the 6 states in the GL Region, and the extra 3 boxes from the Upper Peninsula.  The U.P. gets a few of its own boxes because it is geographically removed from the lower peninsula and we have had at least one Bingo player from the U.P.<br/>
<br/>
As for choosing the specific boxes... I try to distribute the boxes over the entire geographic area of the state, using the regional breakdowns in LbNA, leaning on areas where population is concentrated for extra boxes.  For instance, LbNA breaks IL into 3 regions.  So there is at least one box from each region, with more coming from the areas surrounding Chicago.  The criteria for the boxes is that they must be listed at LbNA and show as active (I have no way of knowing if they actually are active) and they must have been planted in the previous year or last couple months of the year before that (so for 2009 Bingo, boxes were planted approximately November 2007 - November 2008).  Beyond that, I just randomly choose, trying to include boxes from a variety of planters.  I admit I am often drawn to unique and interesting box names.<br/>
<br/>
People are chosen by skimming posts at the GL list and regional event rosters, trying to not repeat people that were on the list in the past couple of years.  I usually try to include a handful of well-known letterboxers who are outside our region with the vast majority being from within the region (I do try to distribute them fairly evenly among the 6 states in the region, but am not precise about it as I don't always know what state somebody is from).<br/>
<br/>
Events aren't usually too tough as there aren't that many -- events that occurred within the region in the previous year with at least 10-12 attendees (as listed at AQ event planner), although one year I did include an event that had been held in IA because quite a few people from the GL region attended, and also have included very large continental events (i.e. Live and Breathe).  Again, I try to choose events evenly from the entire region, but it doesn't always work out that way -- OH seems to have lots of events and WI usually has few.<br/>
