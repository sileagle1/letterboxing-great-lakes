<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span>To celebrate the 13th

Lowden-Miller State Parks).  Oregon is nearly halfway between Rockford and
Peoria and ~100 miles west of Chicago, which should make it relatively
accessible to many in the region. Lowden State Park has tent and RV camping
(and a few more rustic, walk-up sites) and Oregon is centrally located to
Rockford, Rochelle, and Dixon (~20-30mins in the different directions) for
those who hotel camp. </p>

                    <html><body><div dir="ltr">Although it is cold outside, we know many of you are thinking of 
warmer times.  We are too.  This is the first, of perhaps several emails
 leading up to 2015 Great lakes gathering on <span class="" tabindex="0"><span class="">June 13</span></span>. 
 We want YOU to carve a stamp for the event. This year's dual themes are
 "rites of passage" and "superstitions," both of which are related to 
this being the GLG's thirteenth event.     <br/>
       <br/>
While we want a stamp from you, we only want 1 or 2 so we can get a nice variety of stamps by not be overwhelmed.  (If the initial 
response is low, we may accept more from those of you who love to 
carve.)     If you are newer to events, feel free to interpret the theme
 however you want.  In fact, creativity and originality usually make for 
wonderful stamps!   Even if you are still new to carving, don't 
worry, we'd still love a stamp.<br/><br/>
If you want to "reserve" your idea, we have started a database section on the GLK Yahoo board.  If you don't know the exact idea, we still encourage you to 
sign up as "TBD" so we can estimate numbers. If you don't have access to
 the board, and don't want to join, we can add you box if you email us 
the info. 
<p dir="ltr">In accordance with the park's director, these boxes will 
not be permanent.   However, if you would like to have your box 
replanted someplace else in Illinois after the gathering, you can note 
that, and we will work with the state's boxers to do that. (IL boxers, 
let us know if you are interested.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">We have posted a 'submission' form in the yahoo group in the files section in the gatherings folder under 2015 (<a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LBGLK/files/Gatherings/2015%20Great%20Lakes%20Gathering/">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LBGLK/files/Gatherings/2015%20Great%20Lakes%20Gathering/</a>).  It is so we can keep track of stamps, but also we'd also like to plant some of your boxes as mystery clues
 and bonus boxe at the event. If planted this way, your box might not be
 posted, directly, in the clue packet.  If you are ok with that, please 
indicate that on the submission form posted in the GLG 
files.  We have included our address at the top of this form. <br/></p><p>We will post all the boxes to both LbNA and AQ just prior to the event.  Please do not post them directly if you are sending them to us.<br/>
</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we ask that you send us your box by <span class="" tabindex="0"><span class="">May 1</span></span> (earlier is better!).</p><p>We will post this message on AQ and FB, but we intend to post most of our communications on the Yahoo group.  More information concerning suggested accommodations, maps, and other shenanigans will follow over the next while. <br/></p><p>Atomic Beans  <br/></p></div>
