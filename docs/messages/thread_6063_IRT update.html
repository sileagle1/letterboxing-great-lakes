Pinus Strobus, is still snug in its place and dry as a bell. I was able to check on this Wisconsin Hiker beauty last week at work. I got to the location and there was a group of people there (I think they may have been Geocachers) they kept running into the woods and giggling. High school kids you could expect, but these were middle aged people not in the best of shape. <br/>

I waited them out for about 10 minutes -- I was beginning to wonder if I would get to it or not.... I don't have the longest of lunch breaks -- they finally went their way and I was able to grab it.<br/>

Its ready to go for the next finders.<br/>

Too bad about your I-80 Welcome to IL ... we were going to pick that one up on our way home from CO!  We've found some great boxes along I-80 through Iowa, Nebraska and Wyoming and now in Colorado.  Very few familiar log-in stamps from LbGLK, though!<br/>

Another one you have to get is "A Corny Letterbox" in NE -- just watch out  <br/>
for rattle snakes!<br/>
