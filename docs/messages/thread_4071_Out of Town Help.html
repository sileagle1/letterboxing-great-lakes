letterboxing how do you prepare?<br>
<br>
Our method is very similar to others mentioned.  Mapquest and Google<br>
usually help us reach locations that arent detailed on state maps or<br>
are outside the scope of big city maps.  Also, we have county maps<br>
for taking long weekend trips closer to home. <br>
<br>
For the June gathering, were using AAAs trip planner.  It only<br>
allows 21 stops per trip, so we broke the big trip into a few<br>
sub-trips.  We moved the stops around for the most effective order. <br>
We'll print text directions, which use only a few pages.  We wont<br>
use the turn by turn maps, but well use the zoom to print maps for<br>
each stop at one or two detail levels - depending on what we need for<br>
each stop.  Regularly congested areas and construction are noted in<br>
the text directions and construction is also marked on the maps.<br>
<br>
Our spreadsheet is very similar to Wisconsin Hikers.  We add columns<br>
for:<br>
- location details (the name of a park, address, etc.), which we use<br>
mostly as a quick reference while planning the route.  <br>
- status, which is often added or updated just prior to our trip with<br>
the date found, attempted, etc.  An attempt doesnt discourage us<br>
since - often it encourages us to look since we have had reasonable<br>
success with boxes that have been listed as attempted.  We use this<br>
column to decide whether to send an alls well report.  We send<br>
status reports on our finds when: maintenance is needed; the last<br>
hunter logged an attempt; its been a while since someone else logged<br>
a find (because we dont log ours); or theres a specific request for<br>
status in the clue.  That leaves some of the element of surprise when<br>
the planter visits.<br>

I was going to Email you to let you know that we found the The Black Angel  <br>
LB today. It's in fine shape -- took a while, but we found it!! Actually a  <br>
co-worker of mine was there visiting the angel (an hour fifteen minute drive  <br>
from where we live and work), "oh, what are you doing here?" She asked. I told  <br>
her about LBing at the angel -- no where near where the box was.<br>
