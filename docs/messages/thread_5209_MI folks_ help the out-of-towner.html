                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
we're heading to Ann Arbor for a wedding in a few weeks.  Here's our<br>
general schedule--<br>
<br>
Arrive Friday, box some Friday afternoon before the rehearsal dinner.<br>
Saturday, all day is free until 5:00 when the wedding starts<br>
Sunday, head over towards Lake Michigan, we'll be spending the night<br>
in Holland (New Holland Brewery).<br>
Monday, meander back closer to the airport.<br>
Tuesday, home<br>
<br>
So, unlike traveling vast areas of Texas that it sometimes takes to<br>
get from box to box (or the SW like on our recent vacation), you guys<br>
have oodles of boxes!  I'm looking for some suggestions of boxes that<br>
you just adored.  I realize that that's a subjective assessment, and a<br>
lot has to do with your experience of the day, but if you were making<br>
some suggestions that would really show off your state, what would you<br>
pick?<br>
<br>
We like boxes that are in interesting and unique areas.  I enjoy<br>
puzzles and mysteries and you guys are strong in that respect<br>
(decoding hat on).  I like hand-carved stamps, but as long as the<br>
carver has put in some effort, the stamp doesn't have to be a *wow*<br>
(although who would turn that down?).  We like to walk, but clearly<br>
every box probably can't be a 3 mile or more hike or we'll never make<br>
it out of Ann Arbor.  We'd rather find fewer boxes and really enjoy<br>
those experiences than a ton and speed from box to box...so I'm<br>
looking for some suggestions of some true highlights.  Most<br>
importantly, though, there will be NO CHILDREN on this trip, so I<br>
don't have to worry about whiny, hungry, thirsty little hikers and<br>
their needs.<br>
<br>
If you don't mind, email me off-list so that I don't take up too much<br>
of your space (and you can perhaps be free in your suggestions) If you<br>
want to include brew pub suggestions, Mr. Dewberry would be ever so<br>
grateful.  It's my little carrot for the letterboxing adventures.<br>

Some of my favorite boxes are by SpringChick.  I don't think you can go <br>
wrong with any of her boxes since they often include puzzles and are <br>
fabulous stamps.  However, I haven't been to any of her boxes in the <br>
Holland area so I can't recommend any specific boxes.<br>
<br>
For the Ann Arbor area, here are some of my favorites although I don't <br>
think any include puzzles:<br>
* "A Rose by Any Other Name" at Gallup Park in Ann Arbor (I'm biased <br>
since this was our first find).<br>
* "What A Face! - Midwest Reprise" in the Barton Nature Area (hike over <br>
1 mile I think; not hand-carved).<br>
* "Tranquil Moment" at Hudson Mills Metropark near Dexter (hike over 1 <br>
mile I think; one of the oldest, active boxes in Michigan)<br>
* "Mo' Mustangs!" at Hudson Mills Metropark near Dexter (hike over 1 <br>
mile I think; one of the oldest, active boxes in Michigan)<br>
* "Owl Be Waiting" north and east of Ann Arbor (I liked this one for the <br>
references to other area boxes as well as the stamp)<br>
* "Dixboro Merry-go-round" on the northeast side of Ann Arbor (drive-by).<br>
* "Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?" at Wilderness Park in <br>
Saline (a little over 1 mile hike).<br>
* "Tommy's Caboose" at the Saline Depot Museum is also fun but my <br>
daughter planted it so I may be a bit biased.  ;-)<br>
* "The Secret of 12965" is a good one if you are in the area of Depot <br>
Town, Ypsilanti.<br>
<br>
The mosquitoes are particularly bad this year.  Be prepared.<br>
I'm finding poison ivy in many places so be on the lookout for that too.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you (and anyone else) would be interested in a mini-meet <br>
/ exchange Friday afternoon.<br>

<br>
I would love to point you in the direction of one of my boxes, but they are pretty sparse down that way, as most of them are on the West side of the state and in the north.  I have nothing in the Ann Arbor area and have not even been boxing there recently.<br>
<br>
You should most certainly go for the April Fool's box in Dexter (just outside of Ann Arbor) as it was the first letterbox in Michigan.   I cannot tell how recently it was found, but it does appear to still be active.  Silent Doug is the keeper so you may want to e-mail him and inquire as to status.  It is not a long hike and would be a nice diversion as you travel westward from Ann Arbor.<br>
<br>
If anyone knows if any of the Mirkwood boxes are still alive, one of these would be a definite score as she is one of the original Michigan boxers and carves fabulous stamps.  She has been inactive for quite some time but the boxes were still around, however now I see that she has taken down her web site and clues.  The Tulip Tree stamp remains one of my favorites to this day (I believe it was the Jabberwocky box).  Does anyone know anything regarding the status of her boxes?<br>
<br>
I do have a couple of boxes in the Saugatuck area, including a mystery box.  The two  listed boxes at the State Park (Old Man Winter and Spring Fling) are not puzzles but have nice stamps.  They are not long hikes, but may require more time than you have.<br>
<br>
All of my Holland area boxes are perpetually missing, to the point that I have lost the impetus to replace them.  They just keep things way too clean in that neck of the woods!<br>
<br>
No matter, there are lots of great boxes in the areas you will be visiting and I am sure you will have a wonderful time.  It is not a common thing for us here in Michigan to get a lot of visitors from other areas of the country because Michigan isn't really on the way to anywhere, rather a person has to make an intentional swing northward to visit us.<br>
<br>
Welcome and enjoy!<br>
<br>
SpringChick<br>

removed but a few great ones remain.  I whole heartily second the<br>

Tell Paul (Mr. Dewberry) he has strict orders from me to order a Bells<br>
Oberon while in Michigan.  Don't forget. <br>
<br>
So, my question is:  Is Cancan psychic?  I'll have that Oberon and<br>
Paul will have the porter so we can try both.<br>

Thanks to everyone.  You all have been sending me wonderful<br>

You also may run into Erik from last season's Survivor, if you watch that! <br>

  If you get up *early* Saturday morning I would suggest going to Hell (MI)<br>

  Huron River Drive is a beautiful drive any time of year, but in a good fall<br>
