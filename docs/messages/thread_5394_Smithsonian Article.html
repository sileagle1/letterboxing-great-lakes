Wisconsin Letterboxing event, but am finally remembering!<br>
<br>
For those of you who stamped all the BABE (Birth of American Boxing <br>
Event) stamps to create the cover of the Smithsonian magazine that <br>
contained the 1998 article about letterboxing, you may be interested <br>
in pairing up that stamp image with the actual text of the article.  <br>
You can find it here:<br>

<br>
(And I can't think about that cover without remembering Cherokee Rose <br>
2's version!  Yup, that guy broke his leg!  So funny, I wish I had <br>
taken a photo of YOUR magazine cover image!!)<br>

P.S.  I've enjoyed reading the recent posts of letterboxing <br>
adventures by FungusWoman (you brought that girl up right and she has <br>
good taste in boyfriends!), Tiptoe (always a hoot to read your <br>
stories!) and Hartx6 (international intrigue!)<br>
