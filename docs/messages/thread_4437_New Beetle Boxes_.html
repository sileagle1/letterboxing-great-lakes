outside and start to place some of these new letterboxes I've been <br>
working on these past few months.  <br>
<br>
"Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" in Mundelein<br>
<br>
"The Lake Bluff Furnace Death Mystery-Series of 3) 2 in Lake Bluff and <br>
one in Deerfield. I had no idea how to split the city locations for <br>
this series except to list each box separately. But the clue explains <br>
the locations.  Any recommendations?  <br>
<br>
Oh, the challenge for this series of 3 is....reading the entire clue! <br>
<br>
My next box to be placed, tommorrow, will have a much much much <br>
shorter clue!!!  Promise.<br>
