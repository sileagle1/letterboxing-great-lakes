    I would like to introduce myself to the group. I am a Texas <br>
Letterboxer and have been boxing for about 18 months. My daughter and <br>
grandsons box together quite a bit. I have lived in Texas over 20 <br>
years, but lived in Indiana for 7. My LSS is from Marion, Indiana. We <br>
have family and friends there. Hopefully one day I will get to attend <br>
a gathering and meet you all. Thanks for letting me be a part of your <br>
group. <br>
