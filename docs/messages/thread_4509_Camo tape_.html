We like camo duck tape.  Around here we can only find it at Wal-Mart <br>
during the hunting season, so we stock up then.  I never cut it, <br>
because it just tears very easily.  It's very "soft" and flexible, same <br>
as regular duck tape.   Some people say they find the tape in the paint <br>
department, but I've only found it in the hunting department (seasonal).<br>
<br>
Good luck finding something you like!<br>

We found the same thing at Wal-Mart ... it's available only during hunting season, and in the hunting dept.  However, since I needed some camo tape when they didn't have it, I ordered it from L.L. Bean and it was just as good as Wal-Mart's!  (2 rolls for $9.50 ... sometimes w/o shipping costs.)<br>

The best we we've used we got at Gander Mtn, but they don't seem to<br>
carry it any more.<br>
It was cloth/fabric and was *not* shiny. It was available in several<br>
'designs' -- i.e. hardwood forest, evergreens, and some kind of mixed<br>
woods. Each was a bit different in its color. The main benefits were<br>
that  it was non-relective and was flexible around box contours. The<br>
fabric allowed it to conform to box curves.<br>
<br>
I've searched for something similar but without success. The best<br>
substitute I've found was also at Gander Mtn and it's a duct-type<br>
tape: cloth backed and 'tearable' but still reflective.<br>

There is a variety of tape sold in the hunting department.  The Duck <br>
brand tape works very well based on our experience.<br>
<br>
Here's a link to see what it looks like.  <br>

hardware store, etc.)<br>

Thanks so much for the advice everyone!<br>

To think, a year ago, I never knew camo tape existed, much less that <br>
there were so many textures, colors, patterns, varieties of tackiness, etc!<br>
<br>
I like the cloth-type ones I've seen in use, because they seem like <br>
the mold to the boxes better and blend in better.  I'll be on the <br>
hunt for these!<br>
<br>
My only real concern with the clothy type tapes is wether they absorb <br>
water and get moldy or anything like that.  Has anyone had a problem<br>
with that?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love the tape from Walmart too.  It sticks really well.  At my Walmart,<br>
it's in the paint section with the other duck tapes.  It's available all<br>
year round but every so often someone (like me) will go in and buy them out,<br>
so there won't be anymore there until they get in a new shipment.<br>
<br>
After taping the box and before releasing it into the wild, I grind some dry<br>
dirt into the tape on the sides & top of the box.  That's because the stuff<br>
at my Walmart does have a little bit of a shine to it, not much tho, and<br>
rubbing some dry dirt or sand into it takes away that bit of shine.<br>

I agree - I love the tape from Wal-Mart! You may have seen it on some<br>
of my boxes.  It sticks really well.  In our area, the Wal-Marts<br>
carry it with the regular tape, and not just in hunting season.  I<br>
believe Gander Mountain and some army-navy stores also have camo<br>
tape, and that may be where the clothlike stuff comes from.<br>
