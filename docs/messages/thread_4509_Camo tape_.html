We like camo duck tape.  Around here we can only find it at Wal-Mart <br/>
during the hunting season, so we stock up then.  I never cut it, <br/>
because it just tears very easily.  It's very "soft" and flexible, same <br/>
as regular duck tape.   Some people say they find the tape in the paint <br/>
department, but I've only found it in the hunting department (seasonal).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck finding something you like!<br/>

We found the same thing at Wal-Mart ... it's available only during hunting season, and in the hunting dept.  However, since I needed some camo tape when they didn't have it, I ordered it from L.L. Bean and it was just as good as Wal-Mart's!  (2 rolls for $9.50 ... sometimes w/o shipping costs.)<br/>

The best we we've used we got at Gander Mtn, but they don't seem to<br/>
carry it any more.<br/>
It was cloth/fabric and was *not* shiny. It was available in several<br/>
'designs' -- i.e. hardwood forest, evergreens, and some kind of mixed<br/>
woods. Each was a bit different in its color. The main benefits were<br/>
that  it was non-relective and was flexible around box contours. The<br/>
fabric allowed it to conform to box curves.<br/>
<br/>
I've searched for something similar but without success. The best<br/>
substitute I've found was also at Gander Mtn and it's a duct-type<br/>
tape: cloth backed and 'tearable' but still reflective.<br/>

There is a variety of tape sold in the hunting department.  The Duck <br/>
brand tape works very well based on our experience.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a link to see what it looks like.  <br/>

(Prices vary depending on where you buy it - Wal-Mart, Cabela's, <br/>
hardware store, etc.)<br/>

Thanks so much for the advice everyone!<br/>

To think, a year ago, I never knew camo tape existed, much less that <br/>
there were so many textures, colors, patterns, varieties of tackiness, etc!<br/>
<br/>
I like the cloth-type ones I've seen in use, because they seem like <br/>
the mold to the boxes better and blend in better.  I'll be on the <br/>
hunt for these!<br/>
<br/>
My only real concern with the clothy type tapes is wether they absorb <br/>
water and get moldy or anything like that.  Has anyone had a problem<br/>
with that?<br/>

&gt; WOW!  I never expected to have as many or as varied of responses on <br/>
&gt; this topic!  I think I will stop by the army store tomorrow and<br/>
maybe wal-mart.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks so much for the advice everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To think, a year ago, I never knew camo tape existed, much less that <br/>
&gt; there were so many textures, colors, patterns, varieties of<br/>
tackiness, etc!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I like the cloth-type ones I've seen in use, because they seem like <br/>
&gt; the mold to the boxes better and blend in better.  I'll be on the <br/>
&gt; hunt for these!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My only real concern with the clothy type tapes is wether they absorb <br/>
&gt; water and get moldy or anything like that.  Has anyone had a problem<br/>
&gt; with that?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love the tape from Walmart too.  It sticks really well.  At my Walmart,<br/>
it's in the paint section with the other duck tapes.  It's available all<br/>
year round but every so often someone (like me) will go in and buy them out,<br/>
so there won't be anymore there until they get in a new shipment.<br/>
<br/>
After taping the box and before releasing it into the wild, I grind some dry<br/>
dirt into the tape on the sides &amp; top of the box.  That's because the stuff<br/>
at my Walmart does have a little bit of a shine to it, not much tho, and<br/>
rubbing some dry dirt or sand into it takes away that bit of shine.<br/>

I agree - I love the tape from Wal-Mart! You may have seen it on some<br/>
of my boxes.  It sticks really well.  In our area, the Wal-Marts<br/>
carry it with the regular tape, and not just in hunting season.  I<br/>
believe Gander Mountain and some army-navy stores also have camo<br/>
tape, and that may be where the clothlike stuff comes from.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Or, if you have some good camo tape that sticks well and cuts<br/>
&gt; &gt; easily, where did you get it?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>

&gt; We like camo duck tape.  Around here we can only find it at Wal-<br/>
&gt; Mart during the hunting season, so we stock up then.  I never cut<br/>
&gt; it, because it just tears very easily.  It's very "soft" and<br/>
&gt; flexible, same as regular duck tape.   Some people say they find<br/>
&gt; the tape in the paint department, but I've only found it in the<br/>
&gt; hunting department (seasonal).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck finding something you like!<br/>
