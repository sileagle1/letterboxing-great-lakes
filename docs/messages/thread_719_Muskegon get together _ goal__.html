Hey, how great!  Looks like a Muskegon area get-together could <br/>
really happen for 10/16 .... yippie!!<br/>
<br/>
I just did a quick scan of the boxes listed on the letterboxing.org <br/>
site and found out there are 41 boxes in the Muskegon / White Lake <br/>
area!!   <br/>
<br/>
I'm getting familiar enough with the area, I could probably lay out <br/>
a rough South to North route but don't get the idea that all 41 <br/>
could be found in a single afternoon!  Some clues indicate that a <br/>
significant hike would be involved.  Not to mention the usual trying-<br/>
to-figure-it-out hokey pokey that takes up its own amount of time. <br/>
(grin -- with me along, that could be a significant amount of time!)<br/>
<br/>
So what kind of boxing trip is everyone looking for? Let's plan the <br/>
get-together around that. I'll chime in after I hear what some of <br/>
the rest of you are hoping to get out of meeting up.  <br/>
<br/>
Besides being able to meet other boxers, learn a little about each <br/>
other and have some fun  what would you like the main goal of our <br/>
get-together to be?  <br/>
<br/>
Increasing the "F" counts significantly?  (That would mean we should <br/>
search the clues and rule out those that involve a significant time <br/>
investment, and try to `route plan' an efficient way to collect as <br/>
many boxes as possible in the time we have available.)<br/>
<br/>
Solving some really toughie type clues to get a box that's been <br/>
elusive?  (There are some very tricky clues among the boxes listed <br/>
for this area!)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just take one or two nice long hikes with plenty of time to <br/>
talk along the way and find just a couple, or a few boxes?  <br/>
<br/>
Should we compare which boxes we already have (if any) and rule <br/>
those out first? (Let's be careful not to be spoilers. Maybe we <br/>
should do that sort of thing off the list, via email)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Woops!  Count me out.  Forgot that the 16th was the "Zoo Boo" at the Detroit Zoo.  My 2 year old would rise up and take part in her very fist bloody coup if I deprived her of costume wearing, candy, and animals.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you all have a great time!<br/>

Although I won't be able to join in the boxing part of the day, as <br/>
the owner of many of those 41 boxes, I would like to give some input.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I appreciate the comments about being careful not to <br/>
give spoilers.  There are some mystery boxes in the bunch, and there <br/>
are others where bits and pieces of information are missing or need <br/>
to be fit together to arrive at the location.  For somebody familiar <br/>
with the area or somebody who has previously been to the park or box, <br/>
this may seem obvious, however to another person, these would be <br/>
things that need to be figured out.  Although I certainly cannot stop <br/>
people from collaborating to solve clues, mystery boxes are not <br/>
really meant to be group projects.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I am concerned about a group boxing activity.  Several of <br/>
the boxes in this area are in Muskegon State Park.  As many of you <br/>
know, the Michigan DNR recently implemented a "pay to place" policy <br/>
for geocaches and letterboxes.  Fortunately the staff at Muskegon <br/>
State Park have taken a lenient stance on this policy and rather than <br/>
pull the boxes or charge for their placement, they are monitoring the <br/>
boxes, watching for social trails and other environmental impact.  I <br/>
have worked very hard to establish a relationship with them and to <br/>
show them the positve side of letterboxing.  A handful of boxers <br/>
coming through every couple of weeks or so isn't a problem; 25 people <br/>
descending on a box at one time is a whole other game.  In addition <br/>
to the environmental aspect of many people boxing together, I have <br/>
concerns about the discretionary aspect.  How inconspicuous can a <br/>
group of letterboxers really be?  It is hard enough to keep a low <br/>
profile when there are 2or 3 of you and a dog, let alone an entire <br/>
group.  I would hate to see any of the area boxes -- mine or <br/>
otherwise -- be compromised because a flurry of activity raises the <br/>
curiosity of other hikers or nearby observers.<br/>
<br/>
So in short, I am wondering if it is not better to provide a <br/>
specified period of time for people to do some boxing in the area -- <br/>
individually or as small teams, rather than as a large group, and <br/>
then meet up with each other after that?  That way those who are <br/>
interested in jacking up the "F" count can head off to the drive-bys, <br/>
those looking for a hike can head another direction and those looking <br/>
for some awesome scenery can head yet another way.  This will also <br/>
allow those who want to take the time to work through some of the <br/>
mystery clues the opportunity to head off to those boxes without fear <br/>
of giving anything away to others in the group.  Everyone has the <br/>
same access to the clues at letterboxing.org and should be able to <br/>
decide what works best for them without having to create a group <br/>
itinerary.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has specific questions about any of my Muskegon/White <br/>
Lake/Montague area boxes, or may be wondering which would provide the <br/>
easiest/toughest/most scenic hike, please feel free to write me off <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am interested in what may transpire for later in the day -- <br/>
would love to meet up with the group for an evening meal or bonfire <br/>
if there are folks who will be staying around that long.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
