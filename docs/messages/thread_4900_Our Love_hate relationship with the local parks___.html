                    <div class="plaintext-content">It seems like it is that time of year again...time to do maintenance!  <br>
When we first joined this group (about two years ago), Spring Chick had <br>
posted some database where you could record all your boxes you had <br>
performed maintenance on during that month (I think it was March or <br>
April).  At the time, I really didn't think much of it.  We had only <br>
planted 2 or 3 boxes...and those were only about a month old.  Now...we <br>
have closer to 50...many of which are in the nearby parks and forest <br>
preserves, which gets me to the subject line of this post. <br>
<br>
We have great parks and forest preserves in the NE corner of the <br>
state....they are large, have decent trails, and some are very close to <br>
the city.  HOWEVER, a few of them are near rivers that tend to <br>
overflow...or have old trees that tend to fall down...or have ardent <br>
supports who are constantly doing upkeep.  Additionally, we live in a <br>
damp climate with wide temperature fluctuations.  All these points (and <br>
I'm sure others) seem to conspire against our letterboxes.  This past <br>
weekend, we found one of my boxes out of place as it fell from the <br>
decomposing stump it was in....also, we got some reports about some of <br>
our clues not necessarily matching the current condition of the trails <br>
(likely due to flooding and trail maintenance).  But now, it is  finally <br>
warm (ish) and the snow seems to have disappeared....so time to do some <br>
maintenance!<br>
<br>
I'm curious...how do many of you do you maintenance?  Its is ongoing?  <br>
Do you routinely take time to do it or do you do it just once a year?  <br>
I'm curious for both those that have a few boxes, as well as, those that <br>
have a bunch.  Also, and maybe more importantly....how do you balance <br>
the time between doing maintenance and finding new boxes?!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Most of my boxes are planted in the same parks and forest preserves where I regularly walk the dogs, so it's easy for me to keep tabs on them.  There are also a couple I check while horseback riding.  I'd say the status and well-being of most of my boxes are checked at least 2-3 times each season.  However, due to this lingering cold weather (and snow, etc.) I haven't gotten out yet and done the first post-winter inspection.  Soon, I hope!<br>
<br>
As for the 2nd part of your question - I have already found all the boxes that are close to home.  So, whenever I want to go out boxing, it requires planning, an entire day, and a drive of at least an hour or more one way.  So the maintenance can be done during the evening walks during the week, and the weekends are saved for trail riding or boxing.<br>

did just check on 4 of our boxes this past week. <br>
We're thinking that two of them are under water...or<br>

when it dries up we have to check those again and see<br>
the damage.  We had one that had been moved out of<br>

As far as maintenance vs. searching...that gets<br>
tough...we have planted right around 100 boxes or so. <br>
In the last couple of years, some have vanished others<br>
have had to be removed due to park maintenance..ie<br>

<br>
We have planted over 100 boxes.  We don't have a regular maintenance schedule and since some of the boxes are VERY far away we probably will never check on them.  However for those "far away" boxes we duly note this fact in the clues and rely on reports from finders to update our clues.  So far this has worked well.  We adopted a box in Hawaii 4 years ago and regularly got reports on it.  About a year or so ago someone reported that the box was cracked.  I then put a note in the clues asking potential finders if they might be able to bring a replacement box.  Sure enough someone said they could and asked what size it needed to be.  I responded and the Green Tortugua & Amanda from Seattle were kind enough to not only replace the box, but add another logbook!  If /when we get reports of potential problems with our boxes out east, out west, and in NZ & Mexico we'll do the same thing, or contact local boxers to see if they can check on them for us.<br>
<br>
For our boxes closer to home:  If we are in an area with our hiking club or because we're on the hunt for a new box, or planting a new box, we'll check on our boxes (and those of other planters) that may be nearby.  We'll send a note to the other planters to let them know if things were OK or not.<br>
<br>
Otherwise we tend to only go check on our boxes if A) we get a report of a problem or B) we haven't had ANY reports in a long time (6 months to a year).  <br>
<br>
We really appreciate all of you that take the time to send us a note after you find our boxes!  As a matter of fact, Martini Man just got one today about his "Field Survey" series, that said "I completed this 2 hour course today successfully.  The boxes were all in great shape, considering the winter we've had."  <br>
<br>
We do need to get out to check a few that we got reports on, but were waiting for snow & ice to disappear so we can actually look for/retrieve some that were frozen.  I'm hoping none are flooded, but we will be checking those that are at risk.<br>

<br>
I'm hoping the beautiful weather we had today holds out for the weekend.  If so, I will be giving some TLC to my boxes at Hoffmaster SP.  I'm in the process of trying to decide which boxes to retire and which to leave, but these at Hoffmaster were the first boxes I placed.  They continue to get a lot of traffic and have very little problems, so they are staying.  I am however replacing their original store-bought stamps with new hand carved stamps.<br>
<br>
In answer to your question, I try to check everything in the spring to see how it came through the winter and then I only check when I am in the area or when I get a couple of "could not find" reports.  It's nice when people e-mail or do "contact the placer" to say they've found the box because it helps with maintenance.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you Dragon, for the suggestion and the annual reminder.  As a box placer, I worry about my boxes all winter.  The midwest weather can be hard on boxes.  There was a strong wind in January and all I could think about was the possibility of boxes being blown out of their hiding places into local streams and being sent down the river.  OH NO!  <br>
<br>
Likewise, if we find a box that is in need of some TLC, it would be a good idea to carry a few freeze bags (not those zipper slider bags) and replace them if necessary.  <br>
<br>
Here's hoping that all the boxes survived this winter.  <br>
