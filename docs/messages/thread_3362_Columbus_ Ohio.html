The Columbus Zoo Wildlights is simply gorgeous!  Also, one of Safari <br/>
Man's boxes in his Pride of Columbus Series is right by the Columbus <br/>
Zoo!  All his stamps are great!  You will be somewhat close to a box in <br/>
Dublin, Ohio (Columbus area) that Walkabout carved and placed.  It is <br/>
super quick and very well worth going to find as this is at a waterfall <br/>
well hidden from traffic just yards away!  This box is called the Blue <br/>
Bird Letterbox <boxview.php?boxnum=26556&boxname=blue_bird_letterbox>.  <br/>
Also there is a brand new box posted right in the same area--Dublin.  It <br/>
is called Hayden Falls.  Leatherlips and the Watchhouse are both part of <br/>
the series that go with Field of Corn and they are in Dublin as well.  I <br/>
thought these locations were exceptional.  If I recall, you have to do a <br/>
tiny bit of research before going to those two boxes.  These last two <br/>
are relatively quick finds---20 minutes tops including stamping and <br/>
getting back to your car.<br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to suggest more boxes not knowing how much time you will <br/>
actually have to go hunting, but the boxes in Delaware might be a good <br/>
option as well.  There are quite a few.<br/>
<br/>
We are all glad you are both coming down our way!!! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are a number of boxes that are in Dublin, very near to the zoo.  We <br/>
have enjoyed Watch Tower, Leatherlips, Field of Corn, Hayden Falls, and <br/>
Blue Bird Letterbox.  There is one in the Powell area, also near the zoo, <br/>
called Connecticut State Bird Nest in Ohio.  It is a gorgeous stamp - and <br/>
not a real long hike.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to do Ace of Aces in Greenlawn Cemetary, be sure to check out The <br/>
President's Men which is also there.  They are not real close to the zoo, <br/>
however, so it may be out of the way - up to a half hour depending on traffic.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy the Wildlights - we were just there this weekend and it <br/>
was great.  :)<br/>
