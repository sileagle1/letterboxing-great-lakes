Carving materials, cool wool gloves, lock n locks, insect repellent, trail mix, a survival kit, tiny flashlight, and stamp pads.  Thanks so much to SpringChick and all the bingo participants - it was a highlight of my day!  (And to Tom's day also - he was equally excited to go through the loot when he got home.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also got a package from SpringChick yesterday.  Sadly it was <br>
addressed to TrailMark and Mysteryas so I wasn't allowed to open it when <br>
it arrived.  Mysteryas opened the box right before dinner.  Pictures to <br>
come some day on our web site.<br>
<br>
The booty included:<br>
* lock 'n lock<br>
* tube container<br>
* orange carving material<br>
* ziplock baggie<br>
* small logbook (the same size that Mysteryas uses)<br>
* camo tape<br>
* 4 ink dots<br>
* small first aid kit<br>
* felt<br>
* keychain<br>
* whistle<br>
* chapstick<br>
<br>
TrailMark and Mysteryas send their thanks to SpringChick and everyone <br>
who participated!<br>
