I'm pulling some strings as we speak. <br/>
<br/>
One of those signed up for the SILO is also on my list of recipients for  the <br/>
postal. Currently my postal is in West Virginia and it would have just over  <br/>
a week to get back to Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep you posted on that one.<br/>

We were going to go to Hell, but Mark had a flare-up.  We were going to come to the museum last week to help (parents live in Holland), but my 3 yr old had his tonsils out last Wed.  SILO is too far and we cannot afford the gas, but we are hoping to make it to the MI one (live in Ann Arbor area).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, we are the ones whose husband got really sick and he needed a wheelchair.  Guess what?!?!?!!?  His new med is working great, he can walk almost normal, he went back to work today (just 3 days/week but he hasn't worked since Aug 9, so yeah!!!), and we cannot wait to go boxing!!!!  We are all chomping at the bit for a nice enough weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
And even though I rarely talk to the group, I read your e-mails daily and live vicariously through you!  So, thank you!  You don't know me, but I cannot wait to meet you all.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun at SILO and I cannot wait to hear all about it!<br/>
