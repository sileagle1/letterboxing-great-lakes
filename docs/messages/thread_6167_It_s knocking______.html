I was just in a store yesterday--saw something--and thought "that would be good for Bingo booty".  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes!  There will be another round of Letterbox BINGO this year!  I'm mulling over some ideas, trying to think of a way to change things up a little...  but the basic premise will remain the same...  entry will be an item for the Bingo booty and a dollar toward postage.  It will be due some time near the end of December, but it doesn't hurt to start looking now if you plan to play -- if you're out shopping on Black Friday perhaps you'll find a deal!<br/>
<br/>
For those who have not played before, check out the info in the files section from last year's game to get an idea of how it works.  It will be similar this year, perhaps a change or two, but it is close enough to give you a good idea.  Booty items can be anything you feel would be useful for a letterboxer.  The booty items are divided up among the winners of the various Bingo games.  There is no minimum or maximum limit of what your booty item must be worth -- whatever level you are able to contribute is acceptable.  Some of the things people have contributed in the past (these are only ideas from past years -- you do not have to choose something from this list -- be creative!):<br/>
<br/>
-  carving material<br/>
-  carving tools and/or replacement nibs<br/>
-  ink pads or markers<br/>
-  journals -- purchased or handmade<br/>
-  containers suitable for letterboxes<br/>
-  camo tape<br/>
-  compass<br/>
-  flashlight / headlight<br/>
-  packaged trail snacks<br/>
-  first aid items / bug bite products<br/>
-  gift cards for fast food, craft supplies or gas<br/>
-  hand warmers<br/>
-  rain poncho / head bug net<br/>
-  caribiners<br/>
-  water bottles<br/>
-  misc. craft supplies for making logbooks<br/>
-  books on letterboxing, hiking<br/>
-  wonderful hand knit items (socks, hats)<br/>
<br/>
I will be out of town for the rest of the month, but shortly after the 1st of December I'll post the rules, card and words.  Looking forward to another great season of BINGO!<br/>

Will we see Tiptoe as a pretender to the crown?  Birdwoman doing a voodoo dance?  Who know what the next season will have in store?!?<br/>

Yes! There will be another round of Letterbox BINGO this year! I'm mulling over some ideas, trying to think of a way to change things up a little... but the basic premise will remain the same... entry will be an item for the Bingo booty and a dollar toward postage. It will be due some time near the end of December, but it doesn't hurt to start looking now if you plan to play -- if you're out shopping on Black Friday perhaps you'll find a deal!<br/>
<br/>
For those who have not played before, check out the info in the files section from last year's game to get an idea of how it works. It will be similar this year, perhaps a change or two, but it is close enough to give you a good idea. Booty items can be anything you feel would be useful for a letterboxer. The booty items are divided up among the winners of the various Bingo games. There is no minimum or maximum limit of what your booty item must be worth -- whatever level you are able to contribute is acceptable. Some of the things people have contributed in the past (these are only ideas from past years -- you do not have to choose something from this list -- be creative!):<br/>
<br/>
- carving material<br/>
- carving tools and/or replacement nibs<br/>
- ink pads or markers<br/>
- journals -- purchased or handmade<br/>
- containers suitable for letterboxes<br/>
- camo tape<br/>
- compass<br/>
- flashlight / headlight<br/>
- packaged trail snacks<br/>
- first aid items / bug bite products<br/>
- gift cards for fast food, craft supplies or gas<br/>
- hand warmers<br/>
- rain poncho / head bug net<br/>
- caribiners<br/>
- water bottles<br/>
- misc. craft supplies for making logbooks<br/>
- books on letterboxing, hiking<br/>
- wonderful hand knit items (socks, hats)<br/>
<br/>
I will be out of town for the rest of the month, but shortly after the 1st of December I'll post the rules, card and words. Looking forward to another great season of BINGO!<br/>

P.S. I see that the rules don't describe the "booty". Check out the 2009<br/>
<http: 910483067="" album="" group="" groups.="" lbglk="" list?="" mode="tn&lt;br" photos="" pic="" yahoo.com="">
â„´=ordinal&amp; start=1&amp;dir= asc&gt; Bingo Booty photos to see some examples.<br/>
Spring Chick will probably give a better description when she announces the<br/>
game (we are HOPING she runs it again!). Generally speaking it can be any<br/>
item a letterboxer would like (carving material, ink, markers compass, gas<br/>
cards, gift cards to hobby stores, or more creative things such as handknit<br/>
socks).<br/>

If you look in the Files section of the message board, you'll find a folder<br/>
with files related to the famous Great Lakes Letterbosing BINGO game that<br/>
gets us through the winter. It was invented by SpringChick and she has run<br/>
the game for 4 years. It's a lot of fun and shows that we are all really<br/>
nuts! It is probably the slowest BINGO game in the world, but it keeps us<br/>
amused from January through April (or May?).<br/>
<br/>
Here's a link to the rules from last year:<br/>

Ok, exactly what is this BINGO you speak of. I am a virgin LBer and have<br/>
heard things. How do I get involved...and what is the booty we have to get<br/>
to SC?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
