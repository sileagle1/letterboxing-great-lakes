managed to schedule our return flight yesterday so we could do a little <br>
hiking and boxing on our way back to the airport. :)  We went to the <br>
Bull Run Mountain Conservancy and found all of the boxes hidden in that <br>
park.  If anyone gets a chance to get out there, we recommend it.  I'm <br>
guessing Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man would agree, since it turned <br>
out they were the last people logged into the boxes we found! :)  <br>
Imagine that -- hundreds of miles away from home, and *still* they've <br>
already logged in right before us... except we did manage to find one <br>
that they missed.  But anyway, it was definitely a different hiking <br>
experience than we're used to here in the midwest -- incredibly rocky <br>
terrain and an 1000 ft elevation gain!  But we managed, and the view <br>
from the top was incredible!  Thanks to BullDawg for planting one of the <br>
boxes near the top!<br>
