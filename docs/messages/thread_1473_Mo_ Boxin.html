awesome time at the Gathering yesterday! With this being our very <br>
first official Gathering (both hosting and attending) we didn't know <br>
quite what to expect, but we were so glad to hear from so many of you <br>
that you had a wonderful time! We just loved getting to meet <br>
everyone....you all were so nice!<br>
Thanks so much to everyone who took the time to contribute such <br>
wonderful and creative boxes, stamps, and clues! <br>
Thanks to Mrs. Doglvrs for putting on the logbook workshop!! I wish <br>
that I could have made it to that one!<br>
Thanks to SpringChick for the Mystery workshop! We're working on 'em!<br>
;-)<br>
Thanks to Mark Pepe for his most interesting presentation about <br>
Dartmoor. Between the two of us taking care of Rainy Day Rabbit, I <br>
think that Brown Rabbit and I managed to hear the whole thing! :-) We <br>
would definitely love to make it out there one day if we get the <br>
chance! It sounds amazing! Thanks also for bringing the circus to <br>
town!<br>
Wanted to say a special thank you to Pale Puppy Posse for the very <br>
cool T-shirts! They turned out great!!! Thanks for organizing all of <br>
that madness! :-) <br>
I think that the thing that I loved most was just getting the chance <br>
to talk to so many fellow 'boxers, and hearing stories about each <br>
person's adventures on the trails! And everyone had so many great <br>
ideas and ways of doing things....from stamps, to backpacks, to first-<br>
aid kits to logbooks....I have honestly been inspired from each and <br>
every one of you in some way. What a wonderful hobby we all share!<br>
Thank you everyone for everything!<br>
Ok....I'm done....although there is so much more I could say.....I've <br>
got to end this sometime! (Especially before Rainy Day decides that <br>
she needs her Mommy ;-)<br>
Have a wonderful day!<br>
-Gray Rabbit of Team Rabbit<br>
By the way....I'm glad that so many of you figured out that west <br>
meant east...Oops! ;-) <br>
Oh, and Wulfes....great job on the newly hand-carved stamp! Loved it!<br>
