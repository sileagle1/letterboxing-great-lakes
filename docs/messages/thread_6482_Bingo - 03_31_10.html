I'd be interested in that, too!  I was thinking a lot of MN boxes and <br>
stuff have been called!<br>

state! Red Cat must have some cool connections!<br>

At any rate, for those of you who (like us) did not make the actual Harvest<br>

Grove. It will really amp up your logbook. Well... it did for us anyway. ;)<br>

Too bad we couldn't have gotten this bingo!<br>

Are card feel so bare it's not even funny. :( But we are clinging to a small<br>
ray of hope that maybe sheer luck will come our way and we will get a string<br>
of BINGO days!<br>

Well, things are fairly well balanced...  As of today exactly 2/3 (67%) of<br>
the words have been called.  Unfortunately my card and Martini Man's cards<br>
are right in line w/that, since that's roughly the % of our cards that are<br>
filled.  That means we probably wouldn't get a Bingo until every single word<br>
was called!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Here's the current letter breakdown on calls:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
B - 22%<br>
<br>
I - 19%<br>
<br>
N - 20%<br>
<br>
G - 21%<br>
<br>
O - 18%<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
And here's the category calls to date (% called of category):<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
67% - Letterboxes<br>
<br>
80% - Trail Names (higher than average)<br>
<br>
73% - Events<br>
<br>
58% - General Terms (lower than average)<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We also hope SpringChick enjoys her trip, but she doesn't need to worry<br>
about checking her email for US - there is absolutely NO chance that could<br>
call a Bingo by Easter.<br>

<br>
I'll bet that Minnesota's own Midnight Marauder has more words covered on his card than I do.<br>
<br>
Here's the skinny on the 7 MN letterboxes on the word list this year.  I planted one of those boxes and it has been found by only one non-BINGO-playing person.  Two of the boxes are way-the-heck up north.  One box was planted by a prolific geocache/letterbox team in south-central MN.  Two of the boxes were planted by the same newbie that planted more than one of the dreaded, store-bought, compass stamp (that LBer seems to be out of the game now). And one of my un-called boxes is a Whirly Girl Wanna Be box ... she's now moved away from our loony state.<br>
<br>
There were no MN letterboxer trail names on this year's word list :(  Although part of my trail name made it in the General Terms list!<br>
