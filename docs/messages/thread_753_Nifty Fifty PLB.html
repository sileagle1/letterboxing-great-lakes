IL boxers - <br>
<br>
If you haven't heard, there's a PLB going around to one person in <br>
each state.  I am the lucky receiver of the box for IL.  Since there <br>
seems to be a bunch of people in IL, I am proposing to hold a small <br>
get-together when this box arrives.  This will allow as many people <br>
who want to, to stamp into this PLB. <br>
Please email me off-list, if you'd like to be contacted when it <br>
arrives.  I live in Chicago but have no problems heading to <br>
the 'burbs.  We can arrange for a place that is good for all of us.<br>
