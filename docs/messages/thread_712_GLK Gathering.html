As a letterbox newbie, the idea of a gathering sounds great.  <br>
But .... because I'm a newbie, I have to ask, what goes on at a <br>
gathering??  Did I hear classes?  I'm sure I could use those.  (I <br>
just bought my first Speedball carving kit)  Is it a one day affair, <br>
or over a weekend??  Has the location been decided yet.  And <br>
ofcourse, that brings me to ask about food and lodging.  I would love <br>
to meet other boxers.  Usually it is a group of us that go out boxing <br>
together and we call ourselves "The WonderBroads."  Mostly, we wonder <br>
how we don't get seriously lost in the woods and actually have <br>
figured out how to read the compass !!!  My guess is the others would <br>
be very interested in attending also.  So if you could fill me in, <br>
that would be great. <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

Carol,<br>
I'll start and hope others chime in with more.<br>
Generally, a Gathering is an opportunity to meet other letterboxers, <br>
to exchange stamp images, to search for specially placed event-boxes, <br>
and to share some skills, interests and stories about letterboxing.<br>
There can be classes -- stamp carving, logbook binding, etc, -- and <br>
often potluck meal(s).<br>
Accomodations are sometimes scoped out by the locals for travellers <br>
though the events are most often just one day (a verrry long day in <br>
some cases!)<br>
As noted in earlier posts, the date for the next Great Lakes <br>
Gathering has been set and it will be in the greater Detroit area.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned as details emerge from the planners in the months ahead.<br>
