As a letterbox newbie, the idea of a gathering sounds great.  <br/>
But .... because I'm a newbie, I have to ask, what goes on at a <br/>
gathering??  Did I hear classes?  I'm sure I could use those.  (I <br/>
just bought my first Speedball carving kit)  Is it a one day affair, <br/>
or over a weekend??  Has the location been decided yet.  And <br/>
ofcourse, that brings me to ask about food and lodging.  I would love <br/>
to meet other boxers.  Usually it is a group of us that go out boxing <br/>
together and we call ourselves "The WonderBroads."  Mostly, we wonder <br/>
how we don't get seriously lost in the woods and actually have <br/>
figured out how to read the compass !!!  My guess is the others would <br/>
be very interested in attending also.  So if you could fill me in, <br/>
that would be great. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I'll start and hope others chime in with more.<br/>
Generally, a Gathering is an opportunity to meet other letterboxers, <br/>
to exchange stamp images, to search for specially placed event-boxes, <br/>
and to share some skills, interests and stories about letterboxing.<br/>
There can be classes -- stamp carving, logbook binding, etc, -- and <br/>
often potluck meal(s).<br/>
Accomodations are sometimes scoped out by the locals for travellers <br/>
though the events are most often just one day (a verrry long day in <br/>
some cases!)<br/>
As noted in earlier posts, the date for the next Great Lakes <br/>
Gathering has been set and it will be in the greater Detroit area.<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned as details emerge from the planners in the months ahead.<br/>
