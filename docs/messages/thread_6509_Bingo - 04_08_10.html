I think SC should focus more on planning a meet 'n greet to pick up a <br>

Boxacon to find some tricky coded boxes now that there are no social <br>
trails leading to them.<br>

PS. We agree with your plan for SC but would like her to take us with<br>
her and a copy of the Letterboxer's Companion, too! ;)<br>
