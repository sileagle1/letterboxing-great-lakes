                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, all - <br>
I've posted a new mystery box of sorts in Ottawa Co, Michigan.  It's <br>
going to be my last Michigan box for a while.  I've gotten a job in <br>
Maine, and am moving in a week.<br>
<br>
I wanted to invite anyone who's interested, and has time, to come <br>
find the box on Wednesday (9/15) and to stop in to <br>
the "Establishment" mentioned in the clues for some live <br>
entertainment and to exchange stamps.  The activity usually gets <br>
going around 7 pm and goes till 10 pm or so.  They've got food (not a <br>
huge menu), refreshments and free, live music.  As an added <br>
incentive, I'm going to try to carve a special hitchhiker for my move <br>
to Maine.  I can't promise I'll have it done (with packing and all), <br>
but if I do I'll have it with me and will give it to the first person <br>
who asks me for it.  How will you know me, you ask?  I  should have <br>
an instrument to my mouth.  Look for one of the younger musicians <br>
playing one of the smallest instruments sitting next to my mom <br>
(fellow boxer Sisu Sue - she'll have her stamp too).  We both wear <br>
glasses, and would love to meet any fellow boxers who might be able <br>
to come out before I head out to Maine.<br>
<br>
I've had lots of fun searching for everyone's boxes, and hope that my <br>
trips back to Michigan to visit family include visits to everyone's <br>
wonderful letterboxes.<br>
<br>
Peace, <br>
Keltic Kara<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kara, congratulations on your new job and the move to Maine!  How exciting<br>
for you!  We are surely going to miss you around here though -- I rather<br>
enjoyed having another boxer locally for a change.<br>
<br>
OldShoe and I are planning to make it out to see you on Wednesday evening -- <br>
not sure though...  which Wednesday?  Your subject said 9/22 and the message<br>
says 9/15.  I am thinking it is this week -- 9/15 since you said you will be<br>
going in a week.<br>
<br>
Hoping we may see some others there also!<br>
