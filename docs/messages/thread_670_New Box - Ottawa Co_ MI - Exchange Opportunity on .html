                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, all - <br/>
I've posted a new mystery box of sorts in Ottawa Co, Michigan.  It's <br/>
going to be my last Michigan box for a while.  I've gotten a job in <br/>
Maine, and am moving in a week.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to invite anyone who's interested, and has time, to come <br/>
find the box on Wednesday (9/15) and to stop in to <br/>
the "Establishment" mentioned in the clues for some live <br/>
entertainment and to exchange stamps.  The activity usually gets <br/>
going around 7 pm and goes till 10 pm or so.  They've got food (not a <br/>
huge menu), refreshments and free, live music.  As an added <br/>
incentive, I'm going to try to carve a special hitchhiker for my move <br/>
to Maine.  I can't promise I'll have it done (with packing and all), <br/>
but if I do I'll have it with me and will give it to the first person <br/>
who asks me for it.  How will you know me, you ask?  I  should have <br/>
an instrument to my mouth.  Look for one of the younger musicians <br/>
playing one of the smallest instruments sitting next to my mom <br/>
(fellow boxer Sisu Sue - she'll have her stamp too).  We both wear <br/>
glasses, and would love to meet any fellow boxers who might be able <br/>
to come out before I head out to Maine.<br/>
<br/>
I've had lots of fun searching for everyone's boxes, and hope that my <br/>
trips back to Michigan to visit family include visits to everyone's <br/>
wonderful letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, <br/>
Keltic Kara<br/>
