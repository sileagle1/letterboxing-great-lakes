It was a pleasant hike in spite of the chilly weather and we saw a lot of deer signs (scat, well-used muddy paths, tree scrapings) but no deer while on our hike.  I am glad to report that the remaining four villages are exactly where they're supposed to be and in excellent condition.  And I promise to re-carve that fifth stamp soon so I can replace the last box in the series!<br>
