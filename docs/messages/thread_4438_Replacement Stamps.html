                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't think there's any real "protocol" to consider -- it's basically what<br/>
you're comfortable with doing and want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, since the original is a store-bought stamp and the new one is<br/>
hand-carved, I would just replace it in the box.  Plus, I would make a note<br/>
in the clues so that anyone who had been there already and wanted to go back<br/>
for the hand-carved image could do so.  Not that they would be likely to<br/>
read the clues again, since they've already found the box, but who knows?<br/>
You could make a little post about it on the list in case folks who have<br/>
already found the box read the list.<br/>
<br/>
If your original stamp was a hand-carved stamp and then you had carved what<br/>
you thought was a *better* stamp, that would be different -- in my opinion.<br/>
In that case, if it was me, I would leave the original stamp in the box<br/>
because many times finders really like to see the beginning carvings of<br/>
placers.<br/>
<br/>
But, in the end, it's all up to you how you want to do it.<br/>
