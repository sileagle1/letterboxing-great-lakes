<br/>
Just have to be more and more careful.  I've got a good strong gut instinct.<br/>
I've had a couple of serious close calls when letterboxing alone (once in<br/>
DeKalb County and once in Kane County) but my gut kicked in and told me to<br/>
move on outta there while there was still time to do so and I ALWAYS do what<br/>
my gut tells me.  ALWAYS.  My sister had one close call in Kane County but<br/>
her gut instinct kicked in too and she got outta there.<br/>
<br/>
I carry boxcutters so that might help me in some way (they're also illegal<br/>
to carry in some jurisdictions tho), I carry spray, I never go out boxing<br/>
alone with small children, I carry a good strong whistle, and frankly, I<br/>
think my voice is even stronger than any whistle when I want it to be.  Just<br/>
ask Caveman.  :-)  And I've taken some self-defense lessons.  I carry the<br/>
boxcutters and spray right in my bluejeans pocket so that I can reach for<br/>
them immediately.  The whistle is in my other pocket.  The guy who gave me<br/>
self-defense lessons told me never to put the whistle on a lanyard around my<br/>
neck because the person could overpower me and then easily use the lanyard<br/>
to strangle me.  OKaaaaaaaaaaaay, so I keep it in my pocket, attached to the<br/>
lanyard, and the lanyard attached to my belt.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if those taser things are legal in IL or not.  I know folks can<br/>
buy them over the internet.  Knowing me, I'd probably end up tasering<br/>
myself.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, my cell phone is always with me, but Murphy's Law says there will be<br/>
no reception in that area at any given time that I need it.  Been there done<br/>
that.  And it's gonna take too long to get help to a remote area anyway.<br/>
But I always have it turned on so the GPS thingee is working and can maybe<br/>
trace me if I'm abducted.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if Caveman would pay any ransom on me or not if the idea was to<br/>
abduct me for money instead of murder.  Probably not.  :-)  It's not like we<br/>
have any money anyway tho, so it's not like that would be a possible<br/>
consideration.<br/>

BullyGirl and I were just talking about you last weekend, TT, <br/>
wondering how you go to a lot of those places alone.  We were in a <br/>
couple places that were freakin' us out with all three of us there, <br/>
much less alone!  Where'd you get the whistle?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A little off-topic, but when I was taking field biology courses in<br/>
California, way back when I was a Master's student, we took a lot of field<br/>
trips into remote canyons and forests to look at plant diversity.  At the<br/>
beginning of the semester, the professor gave us the following guidelines<br/>
for field trips:<br/>
1. always be in groups of at least three people<br/>
2. stay within shouting distance of another group<br/>
3. make sure some one in the group has good navigational sense and can find<br/>
their way back to the van<br/>
and<br/>
4. "walk quietly away from any dead bodies you might find and don't ever<br/>
tell any one about it."  Apparently had been a problem in previous years and<br/>
he was tired of explaining to the tiny little local police force why he was<br/>
in such a remote location, so his solution was to pretend the dead bodies<br/>
weren't there.  Personally, I would found a different canyon to take my<br/>
class to.<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy to say we did not find any bodies during my semester in the class<br/>
(or at least, if there was a body found, the person did as instructed).  And<br/>
I don't think I've ever planted a box anywhere near any dead bodies...<br/>

&gt; about the only places left to "safely" dump murdered bodies or <br/>
to "safely"<br/>
&gt; mug people are going to be the forest preserves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just have to be more and more careful.  I've got a good strong gut <br/>
instinct.<br/>
&gt; I've had a couple of serious close calls when letterboxing alone <br/>
(once in<br/>
&gt; DeKalb County and once in Kane County) but my gut kicked in and <br/>
told me to<br/>
&gt; move on outta there while there was still time to do so and I <br/>
ALWAYS do what<br/>
&gt; my gut tells me.  ALWAYS.  My sister had one close call in Kane <br/>
County but<br/>
&gt; her gut instinct kicked in too and she got outta there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I carry boxcutters so that might help me in some way (they're also <br/>
illegal<br/>
&gt; to carry in some jurisdictions tho), I carry spray, I never go out <br/>
boxing<br/>
&gt; alone with small children, I carry a good strong whistle, and <br/>
frankly, I<br/>
&gt; think my voice is even stronger than any whistle when I want it to <br/>
be.  Just<br/>
&gt; ask Caveman.  :-)  And I've taken some self-defense lessons.  I <br/>
carry the<br/>
&gt; boxcutters and spray right in my bluejeans pocket so that I can <br/>
reach for<br/>
&gt; them immediately.  The whistle is in my other pocket.  The guy who <br/>
gave me<br/>
&gt; self-defense lessons told me never to put the whistle on a lanyard <br/>
around my<br/>
&gt; neck because the person could overpower me and then easily use the <br/>
lanyard<br/>
&gt; to strangle me.  OKaaaaaaaaaaaay, so I keep it in my pocket, <br/>
attached to the<br/>
&gt; lanyard, and the lanyard attached to my belt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't know if those taser things are legal in IL or not.  I know <br/>
folks can<br/>
&gt; buy them over the internet.  Knowing me, I'd probably end up <br/>
tasering<br/>
&gt; myself.  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yeah, my cell phone is always with me, but Murphy's Law says there <br/>
will be<br/>
&gt; no reception in that area at any given time that I need it.  Been <br/>
there done<br/>
&gt; that.  And it's gonna take too long to get help to a remote area <br/>
anyway.<br/>
&gt; But I always have it turned on so the GPS thingee is working and <br/>
can maybe<br/>
&gt; trace me if I'm abducted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't know if Caveman would pay any ransom on me or not if the <br/>
idea was to<br/>
&gt; abduct me for money instead of murder.  Probably not.  :-)  It's <br/>
not like we<br/>
&gt; have any money anyway tho, so it's not like that would be a possible<br/>
&gt; consideration.<br/>

&gt; I often letterbox alone, and I carry  pepper spray in my pack.  It<br/>
&gt; doesn't offer perfect protection, but nothing could.  I also have a<br/>
&gt; super-loud whistle, which could be used to scare off coyotes or <br/>
bears<br/>
&gt; (as well as creepy people), but also, if I should need help in a<br/>
&gt; remote area, it can be heard for quite a distance - even when my <br/>
cell<br/>
&gt; phone doesn't get reception.  My advice to be prepared, stay aware <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; your surroundings, but don't let fear keep you from what you enjoy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A man lit himself on fire near one of my plants last year - but<br/>
&gt; fortunately they found the body before anybody could go looking for<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; box!<br/>
