Just have to be more and more careful.  I've got a good strong gut instinct.<br>
I've had a couple of serious close calls when letterboxing alone (once in<br>
DeKalb County and once in Kane County) but my gut kicked in and told me to<br>
move on outta there while there was still time to do so and I ALWAYS do what<br>
my gut tells me.  ALWAYS.  My sister had one close call in Kane County but<br>
her gut instinct kicked in too and she got outta there.<br>
<br>
I carry boxcutters so that might help me in some way (they're also illegal<br>
to carry in some jurisdictions tho), I carry spray, I never go out boxing<br>
alone with small children, I carry a good strong whistle, and frankly, I<br>
think my voice is even stronger than any whistle when I want it to be.  Just<br>
ask Caveman.  :-)  And I've taken some self-defense lessons.  I carry the<br>
boxcutters and spray right in my bluejeans pocket so that I can reach for<br>
them immediately.  The whistle is in my other pocket.  The guy who gave me<br>
self-defense lessons told me never to put the whistle on a lanyard around my<br>
neck because the person could overpower me and then easily use the lanyard<br>
to strangle me.  OKaaaaaaaaaaaay, so I keep it in my pocket, attached to the<br>
lanyard, and the lanyard attached to my belt.<br>
<br>
I don't know if those taser things are legal in IL or not.  I know folks can<br>
buy them over the internet.  Knowing me, I'd probably end up tasering<br>
myself.  :-)<br>
<br>
Yeah, my cell phone is always with me, but Murphy's Law says there will be<br>
no reception in that area at any given time that I need it.  Been there done<br>
that.  And it's gonna take too long to get help to a remote area anyway.<br>
But I always have it turned on so the GPS thingee is working and can maybe<br>
trace me if I'm abducted.<br>
<br>
I don't know if Caveman would pay any ransom on me or not if the idea was to<br>
abduct me for money instead of murder.  Probably not.  :-)  It's not like we<br>
have any money anyway tho, so it's not like that would be a possible<br>
consideration.<br>

What?!  Which box was that?  I never heard about that!  Freaky!<br>
<br>
BullyGirl and I were just talking about you last weekend, TT, <br>
wondering how you go to a lot of those places alone.  We were in a <br>
couple places that were freakin' us out with all three of us there, <br>
much less alone!  Where'd you get the whistle?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A little off-topic, but when I was taking field biology courses in<br>
California, way back when I was a Master's student, we took a lot of field<br>
trips into remote canyons and forests to look at plant diversity.  At the<br>
beginning of the semester, the professor gave us the following guidelines<br>
for field trips:<br>
1. always be in groups of at least three people<br>
2. stay within shouting distance of another group<br>
3. make sure some one in the group has good navigational sense and can find<br>
their way back to the van<br>
and<br>
4. "walk quietly away from any dead bodies you might find and don't ever<br>
tell any one about it."  Apparently had been a problem in previous years and<br>
he was tired of explaining to the tiny little local police force why he was<br>
in such a remote location, so his solution was to pretend the dead bodies<br>
weren't there.  Personally, I would found a different canyon to take my<br>
class to.<br>
<br>
I'm happy to say we did not find any bodies during my semester in the class<br>
(or at least, if there was a body found, the person did as instructed).  And<br>
I don't think I've ever planted a box anywhere near any dead bodies...<br>

protection is attached ;)<br>
