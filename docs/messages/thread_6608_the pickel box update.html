<br>
  as some of you know or may have found we have a box called "the pickel box"<br>
  and if you read the clue youll find out he was a co worker of mine and the<br>
  other day I got a email that shows just what a great hobby this is and youll<br>
  never know where or whats gonna happen but I just had to share this everyone<br>
  this is the email from lbna:<br>
  and thank you who ever threw away the clues<br>
  Hello,<br>
<br>
  Pickels was married to my cousin Bonnie, who passed away many years ago. One<br>
  of my friends works at the Citgo station in McHenry, and while he was<br>
  cleaning out the trash bins, he came across a printed copy of clues for The<br>
  Pickel Box. Terri also knew George from driving gravel trucks. He saved the<br>
  paper to show me. After I read it he said do you want to go and check this<br>
  out. <br>
<br>
  So this evening about 6:30, we went over to St. Mary's Cemetary for an<br>
  adventure. We got to say hello to George and Bonnie. We checked the<br>
  evergreen bushes, but did not find a box. <br>
<br>
  I thank you so much for doing a tribute to George. He was a great guy and<br>
  left us much too soon.<br>
<br>
  Sincerely,<br>
<br>
  Debbie xx xxxxxxx<br>

Ugh... We searched all over for that box! I even had two ticks crawling on me after being in the evergreens. Well, we'll get to visit Pickle again. :D<br>
