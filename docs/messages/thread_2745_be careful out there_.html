I checked out a couple web sites on brown recluse spider bites too.  I can't get those images out of my head.  I had no idea how horrific these bites can be.  The doctor must try to get all the venom out or it spreads, and it spreads quickly in fatty tissue areas especially the butt.  Not to say that FW has a fat butt, it's just that area tends to have more fleshiness.  The tissue in the area dies and those sores open up and look so bloody and sometimes the doctor needs to do skin grafts.  <br>
<br>
Of course, FW is at camp this weekend.  You certainly can't expect to keep that green-blooded camper at home when there's a GS event planned....AND she's the event planner too. <br>
But I know she will use her best judgment if the redness in the 'circled area' starts to spread.  <br>
<br>
CMoon is on vacation.  She's worried about our friend FW too.  <br>

(not far down the road from "I'm not dead yet" - I'm trying to create a route of letterboxes on 52 and IL 71 for those enroute to the Starved Rock-Matthiessen area)  Watch for the clues shortly for "Duane's Motel" (as usual, they will be posted in the Files here in their entirety for my GLK friends!)<br>
 <br>
 Anyway, without the spider of course nothing can be proven, so it's still a guess.  Either way I'm not ignoring the situation.  My cultures are growing out MRSA (the bad one - very resistant), but I'm on "big gun" antibiotics so I think all will be well.  Thanks for all your thoughts, and still be careful!<br>
