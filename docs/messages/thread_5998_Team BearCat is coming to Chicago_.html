I just posted a mini meet on Atlas Quest. Team BearCat will be here on<br>
business but they decided to stay through the weekend in hopes of meeting<br>
some local boxers. We'll meet at Gino's East on Higgins as it is a rather<br>
central location. http://www.ginosonh <http://www.ginosonhiggins.com/><br>

Check out the website for menu and directions. We'll meet from 5-8 on<br>
Sunday, August 9. Please sign up on AQ if you plan to attend so I can make<br>
reservations. Hope to see you there!<br>
