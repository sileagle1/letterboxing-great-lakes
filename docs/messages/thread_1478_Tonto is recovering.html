                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks a lot...I haven't slept in 2 nights - dreaming of letterboxes, <br/>
stamp exchanges, circus', trail names connected to wonderful faces, <br/>
stamps and more stamps....To say we enjoyed every minute with all of <br/>
you at the Gathering is an understatement.  You are a bunch of <br/>
wonderful, fun-loving, very special people - I can't believe I was <br/>
even slightly worried I'd find a pavillion full of kooks!  On second <br/>
thought, that's exactly what we found, but I couldn't have spent a <br/>
better day than with fellow kooks like ourselves!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all involved with the organization...if I named you all I'm <br/>
certain I would forget someone..so safer to say thanks to EVERYONE <br/>
for welcoming us, informing us, indulging us and planning this <br/>
wonderful day.  <br/>
<br/>
I do have to say a special "Thank you" to Dragon - first off thanks <br/>
for the garlic mushrooms!  But, more so for the awesome inspiration <br/>
you gave with the Mustang box(es)!  You truely are a great teacher <br/>
(I'll overlook the awful Math part!) - you set a standard in carving <br/>
and in ingenuity that makes all of strive to be better.  Thanks again <br/>
anad again!<br/>
<br/>
We were so inspired that we actually hid our first box in Indiana on <br/>
Father's Day in route to the lake to visit my dear Ol' Dad.  We <br/>
didn't get back to Chicago until after midnight and I stayed up past <br/>
2 AM writing the clues for one of them and trying to post them on the <br/>
LBNA site - I haven't seen any evidence of it being recorded - I must <br/>
have done something wrong(typical) or does it take some time for the <br/>
clues to come up?  I wasn't sure what I was supposed to put in the <br/>
line that said "link"...any suggestions?<br/>
Ohhhhhh you guys are terrific!<br/>
