                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm very close to having the patch finalized (they are taking one <br>
more pass to get the colors closer to last year's patch).<br>
<br>
As I indicated before, I was thinking of only ordering 100 patches <br>
this time, because I'm assuming that some people that purchased <br>
patches last year wouldn't necessarily purchase another one.  With a <br>
smaller order quantity and a slightly larger patch size, the price <br>
will probably be about $2.50 per patch.<br>
<br>
Before I put the final order in, I thought I'd try to find out how <br>
many people might want to order them.  I therefore created a simple <br>
database within this Yahoo group.  Simply go to the database section, <br>
then click on the New 2006 Patch Requests database (near the bottom <br>
of the database list).  After you open the database, near the top & <br>
center will be the words "Add Record".  Click on this then enter your <br>
Trailname and the number of patches you might want.  This isn't a <br>
binding obligation, but helps me determine an initial order quantity.<br>
<br>
Please put your request in ASAP, since I'll need to finalize this <br>
order in the next day or two.<br>
<br>
Here's a link that will hopefully take you directly to the database:<br>
