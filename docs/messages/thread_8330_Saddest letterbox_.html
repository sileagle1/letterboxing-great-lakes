<br/>
I was out yesterday to search for a box that was last logged in 2013. I usually don't hold out much hope for ones sitting alone that long but I still had some. I found it! The box had been chewed through in so many places I was surprised it was even box-shaped. Was excited to find the logbook was only damp but when I picked out the baggie with the stamp...it was ... squishy. It had sucked in so much water it waa spongy and layers flaked off when I touched it. I brought the sad remains home to recarve, rebox and replant.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm thinking the saddest letterbox will be a great series to carve and plant! <br/>
<br/>
So now I need more ideas. What was the saddest letterbox you have found?</div>
