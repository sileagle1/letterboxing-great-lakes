                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just want to add my thanks to WI Hiker and Martini Man for a <br/>
fabulously organized and orchestrated event!  The location was <br/>
beautiful and whomever ordered the weather was certainly on top of <br/>
things!  Although it was a whirlwind trip in and out of WI for me, I <br/>
had a great time both at the Friday evening pre-gather party and the <br/>
gathering itself.  <br/>
<br/>
It was exciting to meet and chat with so many new people from all <br/>
across the region (and even further away), and to catch up with folks <br/>
that I've not seen in a couple of years.  As the masses gathered for <br/>
the group photo, I couldn't help but feel a little lump in the back of <br/>
my throat, remembering our cozy little group (all of us relative <br/>
newbies) at the first GL gathering 4 years ago, and seeing how the <br/>
hobby has blossomed since then.  It is very exciting to be a part of <br/>
the hobby here in the Great Lakes region.  <br/>
<br/>
I was sad when it was time for me to head back to Milwaukee for the <br/>
ferry back to Michigan, knowing it will be at least a year before I <br/>
will see some of these wonderful friends again, and disappointed that <br/>
I didn't ever get out on the trails to find any of the Wonderland <br/>
boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who contributed -- ideas, boxes, food, smiles -- to <br/>
make this year's event such a great success!<br/>
