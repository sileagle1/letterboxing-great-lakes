also didn't see any mosquitoes or ticks - hope that will be true a few weeks<br>

<br>
Even though we will be staying at a hotel, we drove through the campgrounds<br>
to see what the sites were like.  They were all in nicely wooded areas and<br>
very private, not jammed together.<br>

Remember, if it is hot the weekend of the GLG, Blue Mound is the only state<br>
park in WI that has a swimming pool.  Fee is $1 for kids and $2 for teens &<br>
adults, so don't forget to bring your suits if you might want to cool off<br>
during the day.  http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/bluemound/pool.html <br>

Only 20 days until JUNE 9!<br>

We were out planting boxes both Saturday and Sunday morning. It was 85<br>
degrees both days by the time we were in from the trails. I wonder what<br>
another few weeks will bring. I think it will be a hot one folks!<br>
<br>

Yea, I hope so...I hear it might be a bad tick season due to the mild <br>
winter.  We had to do a quick tick check in a parking lot yesterday <br>
after being out on the trails and suddenly seeing a few in the car.  We <br>
managed to find ~1/2 dozen of what might have been 'lone star ticks' <br>
(though I didn't really look very closely as I shook them off).  Ugh, I <br>
hate ticks...but I love boxes...so I guess I'll suck it up and go into <br>
the woods.<br>
<br>
  SO, 19days you say? ;-)<br>
<br>
....but whose counting?!<br>
