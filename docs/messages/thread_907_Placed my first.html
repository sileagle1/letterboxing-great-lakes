Hi Great Lakers.<br>
I've been lurking (reading and listening) since September.  I got <br>
started doing letterboxing in July when I wanted something to do with <br>
my Great Niece who is 11 and I only see once a year on average.  So, <br>
I'd heard about letterboxing on NPR, went to the site and found one <br>
in the community where her grandma is.  It was a success and she has <br>
since Placed 4 (to in CA where she lives and one in Hilton Head where <br>
another grandma lives and 1 in NY where her Dad lives) and found 27.  <br>
We email lots and she and her Dad came to my house in Maumee for <br>
Thanksgiving.  We found 2 letterboxes and placed one.  She has <br>
challenged me to have as many as she does by June when she will be <br>
back.  She did say I could add mine and my daughters together - <br>
daughter lives in RI - so that is what I'll be doing at Christmas.<br>
<br>
My box is at:  http://letterboxing.org/BoxByRegion.asp?region=North%<br>
20Western%20Ohio and it is very near the intersection of I475 and I75 <br>
near Toledo OH.<br>
<br>
Thanks for being around.<br>
