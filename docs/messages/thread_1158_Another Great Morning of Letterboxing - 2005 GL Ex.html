This morning I found Fungus Woman's Hoffman Tower, placed by Artdog.  Surprised to be <br>
the First Finder.  Clues were excellent and it is definitely not a drive-by hike.  Wonderful <br>
stamp.  I can imagine the location will be a little tougher to navigate when the summer <br>
foliage is at its fullest.  Can't wait to get my GL letterbox to place!<br>

Thanks for the compliment!  I had told SpringChick originally I was <br>
having a hard time parting with that stamp, so she suggested I carve a <br>
sister stamp.   I did, and just this morning I found a hiding place <br>
for it.  So if you're ever in the vicinity of Lyons, IL, there will be <br>
another box to find, with a virtually identical stamp.  ("Collect them <br>
all!")<br>
<br>
--klk/FW, who can't wait to receive her exchange box!<br>

I will likely come back to Chicagoland this summer.  I was there briefly last Friday night, no <br>
time to box, however I have a list of must-haves.  I'm sure in the 12 years of living in <br>
Chicagoland I surely passed that landmark on a couple of occasions ... my first home was <br>
in Berkeley, a half block from the Prairie Path backing up to the Tri-State.<br>

PS - I think this is the first box listed for the exchange.  Am I right?  Am I the First First <br>
Finder of this series?<br>

Shortly after the 15th of April I will put a list in the Files section listing all of the participants and boxes and then fill in the information as to location of plant as it comes in.  I am hoping to plant the box I received this weekend and my box was mailed out today.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I believe you are the first first finder of the exchange boxes.  Some of us are still patiently(?) waiting for our boxes.  OK, so I'm getting a little antsy...patience was never my strongest virtue.  It's like waiting for Christmas but not knowing exactly when that is.  But I'm sure it will be worth the wait and in the meantime I can think a little longer about possible locations to plant the box!  <br>
