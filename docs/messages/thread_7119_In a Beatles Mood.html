"In a Beatles Mood...." story of my life.   The music just brings a smile to my face.  <br>
 <br>
This week, a first time Beatles experience for me.  Finally, I obtained a video rental copy of "How I Won The War' featuring John Lennon.  The part when he is hit with a grenade and injuried was unsettling.  "I knew this was gonna happen and you knew it was gonna happen to, didn't you?"  <br>
 <br>
Peace and Love, Peace and Love<br>

Just got back from the spring concert at the kids' high school. Lots of Beatles stuff. The women's choir sang Blackbird; the men's choir sang "I've Just Seen a Face". DD is in the Christian Minstrels and they had alot of fun with a Beatles medley (she's been listening to Beatles on her iPod all month). DS is in Jazz Band--they didn't do any Beatles music--but they did do a jazz rendition of a song by Styx. <br>
