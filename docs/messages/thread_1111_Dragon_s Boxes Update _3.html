Again, for those interested...<br>
<br>
Mathman 6 (Remember the Veterans) is now active!  The snow finally<br>
gave way today!<br>
<br>
Mathman 7 (Luther's Love) is no longer frozen in place and is fulley<br>
active!<br>
<br>
Mathman 2 (Dead Fish) checked out just fine and remains active!<br>
<br>
I scouted out the new clues for this year's version of the Triangles,<br>
Triangles, Everywhere Boxes and they should be up and running by the<br>
weekend, if not tomorrow (Wed).  Due to popular request, I kept them<br>
close together this year to save on gas.  They are all located in West<br>
Bend, WI.  You could even bike from park to park if you wanted to!<br>
<br>
(I think I even spotted the first dragon of spring while scouting out<br>
the TTE clues!)<br>
<br>
MCP/Oak Leaf Trail - Currie Park box should be replaced Wednesday<br>
morning assuming the poly and the glue dries overnight!  I also made<br>
replacements for the rest of the series in case any of the others come<br>
up missing.<br>
<br>
Get out and box!<br>
<br>
