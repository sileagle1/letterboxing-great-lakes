                    <div class="plaintext-content">Two days ago I posted clues to some of my "Signs of the Zodiac" boxes that have recently been planted.  Apparently checking two different sources to confirm dates was not sufficient; I have been notified of two errors in my clues.  I re-checked SIX different sources and have now corrected the clues.  My apologies.  I have 4 more boxes to plant to complete the series and I will be sure to be extra careful in checking data before posting the clues.  Hopefully I will be able to brave the heat and bugs and get the last 4 boxes placed soon.<br>
