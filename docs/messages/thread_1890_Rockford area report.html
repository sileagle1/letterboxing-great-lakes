Just wondering - Deer Run #1 is very close to Oak Ridge #1, did you think <br>
about going after it?<br>

P.S.  We're looking forward to some IL boxing in Cook & Lake counties <br>
this weekend.  The Haunted Trails is definitely on our list.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well that stinks. I'm hoping to make it out to check on these. I've <br>
been neglecting my poor letterboxing habit lately. I hate to say it, <br>
but I'm burned out at the moment. I really want to get back out there <br>
and find some, but I'm the scaredy cat type who won't box alone. :) I <br>
know that once I go out searching again, I will be back to normal. <br>
I'd love to place some more too (I have a HUGE sheet of carving <br>
material from Dick Blick that's waiting to be broken in), but I need <br>
to scout out a good area to place more.<br>
<br>
I will (hopefully) get out to check on these this weekend. If I do, <br>
I'll let you know about the status. More than likely, if I do find <br>
them, I will either replace them somewhere else or just pull them for <br>
a while. The only one I'm worried about it Creatures of Blackhawk #3 <br>
because that is my favorite stamp so far. :)<br>
