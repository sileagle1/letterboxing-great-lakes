feet from it's original spot so the clues have been revised a little.<br/>
<br/>
Its been out since St. Patricks Day and I've been checking the level of <br/>
the Mississippi every week since and I can just now make it back to the <br/>
spot.<br/>
<br/>
I will have to keep a close eye on the river level in the future, but <br/>
for now please come and enjoy.<br/>

P.S. I now have only one box out of service and that is "Archie's <br/>
Chair" -- I accidentially hid under the same rock as a Geocache. I had <br/>
no idea there was a cache under the rock when I shoved my box under <br/>
there and now that I know of my mistake I pulled the box and will <br/>
rehide in a different spot soon.<br/>
