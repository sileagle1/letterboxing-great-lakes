I'd ask about as to preferences.  I could go the easy route and buy <br>
chips and some sodas, or bake cookies for a desert.  Which would be <br>
better, I ask those of you going?  The cookies I've been baking <br>
recently are somewhat spice cookies, called applesauce cookies, having <br>
cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg in them, or I could do a more common <br>
cookie such as chocolate chip, which I could spice up a bit with <br>
different types of chocolate chips.  What are your thoughts?<br>

MMMM Chocolate chip spiced up with *more* chocolate chips . . . . can't get  <br>
much better than that.<br>
