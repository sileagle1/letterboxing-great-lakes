<br>
I'm sure a few of you have visited the SW a time or two, and I think a pair of you just got back, or are still there? Hmm... Any way, Ive never been, so this January Im going!  Here is a post I posted on the SW group, but I am hoping to collect all the info I can, so what do you recommend, seeing, boxing, hiking, eating, ect?<br>
--Hello SW Group!I am taking 12 days driving from Central Illinois and making my SW loop in early January. Plans are as goes:<br>
<br>
Jan 2 IL-Omaha-Lincoln, NE-Sterling, CO.<br>
3 Sterling- Loveland- Denver- Glenwood Springs.<br>
4 Glenwood Springs- Arches NP, UT<br>
5 Arches- 4 Corners- Winslow, AZ- Flagstaff<br>
6 Flagstaff- Grand Canyon<br>
7 Grand Canyon- Phoenix- Palm Springs/Desert Hot Springs<br>
8 Palm Springs- LA/Hollywood/Santa Monica<br>
9 Santa Monica- La Jolla- San Diego(Staying night) and Tijuana MEX(Any extra info on this would be great!)<br>
10 San Diego- Tucson- Towards Las Cruces, NM<br>
11 Las Cruces- Albuquerque- Amarillo- OKCity<br>
12 OkCity- Kansas-<br>
13 KS City area-Home<br>
<br>
So of coarse, boxes? I have a lot of research to do, and Im hoping someone can help!<br>
I like the boxes that remind me of where I was, so like something from the Grand Canyon, HOLLYWOOD, or Denver. I have over 16 boxes that I am planting of my own. I am trying to 'Hostel' my way through, or even camp in the NP(weather permitting) to keep costs down. And places to eat? What are your favorites? Im sure there's boxers in the specific areas, who are you, where are ya?! And what other sites besides the 'tourist' ones are a must see that many don't think about? Tours, or do it yourself(with boxing!) Any help, guidence, and tips would be AWESOME!--<br>

taking I-80 out.<br>
<br>
            Of course Hartx6 has a couple boxes in LeClaire, IA if you're<br>
coming through there.<br>
<br>
            There are a lot of boxes in the Council Bluffs/Omaha area . we<br>
mainly boxed in Council Bluffs.<br>
<br>
                        Memorial Day Letterbox, Bloomer Box (very hard to<br>
find), Photo Op, Tractor Trails.<br>
<br>
            On I-80: Rose Garden (Giltner, NE), The Huskies Husker<br>
(westbound I-80 Cozad, NE), Huskers (Emerald, NE), Big Truck (Brady, NE<br>
westbound), BL Stomps & Stamps in NE (Sutherland, NE), several in Sidney,<br>
NE: A Royal Challenge (at the Cabela store), & 4 boxes in Fun at Grandma's.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I just used the trip planner guide in AQ to plan our boxes as we went to<br>
Estes Park a couple of times.  It sounds like you're making a fast trip out,<br>
however, and may not have time . but these make for good leg stretchers as<br>
you're driving!!!  We were surprised that we didn't recognize any names in<br>
the logbooks . so, Shorty, join us!!!<br>
