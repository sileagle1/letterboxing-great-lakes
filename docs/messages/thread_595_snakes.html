 <br>
Well, my son and I just watched an entire special on  them.  I'm not afraid <br>
of them because I grew up with them in CA, but  it's always good to know your <br>
stuff.  Basically, there is No way to know  which ones are poisonous.  They can <br>
mimic each other.  There are  several that even have a rattler (oh that's <br>
what we all wanted to hear,  right)?  <br>
GOOD NEWS!!!!<br>
They cannot chase you:)  They are not very  fast.  Good idea to jump over it, <br>
Timbertoes!  Unless it sees you  first and you startle it, you can just run <br>
and it can't keep up, and just gives  up.  Also if you talk with your LB friend <br>
as you walk you should frighten  the ones you are coming up upon and they <br>
should slither  away...should...<br>

me.  If I'd have been Eve, Adam would have had nothing to worry <br>

not.  <br>

jungle on animal planet. One of the girls on the show misrepresented a <br>
snake by saying it was not venomous because it's head was shaped like a <br>
triangle.. they really beat her up for that mistake! So it seems to have <br>
stuck in my head. Blue Racers bite but have no venom.. but they are fast <br>
and are found in our area. Most other snakes will avoid you at all costs, <br>
unless you step on them.. High ankle boots are a good idea to have on <br>
hiking in these kinds of areas. My brother almost sat on a baby rattler <br>
curled up on a tree stump sunning itself.. he was going to sit down when he <br>
noticed it.. wouldn't that have been awful! We were camping in the middle <br>
of lower Michigan at the time..<br>
