                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone!<br>
I am new to the group and to letterboxing in general.  I thought I  would let <br>
you know we just got signed up on the LbNA and AQ sites on March 2nd  and I <br>
got stuff this past weekend to try my hand at carving a signature stamp  for my <br>
hubby (CMB) and myself (FlyGirl409).  I found some basically blank  square <br>
ready made stamps on clearance and thought this would be wonderful to  save the <br>
trouble of mounting my own so got one for $2 to try.  Used this to  carve CMB <br>
a stamp and found it extremely difficult to carve the rubber stamp  that was <br>
already there so I am glad that I only got the one as I will not being  doing <br>
it that way again!  The stamp turned out decent in my humble opinion,  though a <br>
bit rough even for a first attempt.  I had played at wood carving  a bit many <br>
years ago, but never anything else.  I wondered if stamps could  be carved of <br>
just wood, but figured not or someone would have said it worked  online <br>
somewhere.<br>
 <br>
I bought some gray linolium to carve many stamps from since CMB does wood  <br>
working and has tons of scraps to mount them with.  Found it much easier to  <br>
carve but was not so crazy about the way my first stamp came out and I think it  <br>
is too big judging by the size of the log book in our first find tonight.<br>
 <br>
We live in Indianapolis so we decided to go look for Quack is Back in Broad  <br>
Ripple since we knew the area fairly well.  We followed the directions  which <br>
were excellent though must note the name of the creek in the clue is  <br>
incorrect and might lead out of town letterboxers astray.  Other than that  we found <br>
it easy enough and stamped in.  The hand carved stamp was very  nice!  I was <br>
not sure what most write near the various stamps in their  personal logbooks, so <br>
just wrote the name of the Letterbox, the date and the  city and state.<br>
 <br>
I think this one has hubby hooked now and I will be able to get him to  <br>
traipse the countryside in search of many more in the future though he was very  <br>
skeptical about whether it would be lame or fun before doing it.  I think  he <br>
still thinks I am nuts for getting so excited about collecting impressions of  <br>
rubber stamps but he is willing to humor me for now so I won't complain.<br>
 <br>
We are planning a short trip along I-70, I-57 and I-64 the weekend of St.  <br>
Pat's Day and used the trip planner on AQ to help us map out the routes and  <br>
such.  I think there are over 50 we could find but doubt we will get to  finding <br>
most of those as it takes some time to get to them, find them, stamp up  and <br>
put everything back.<br>
 <br>
Can anyone share with me what they have in their travel letterboxing pack  <br>
for such adventures as I want to make sure we are well prepared.  Tonight I  <br>
just took both our stamps 3 different ink pads so we had a choice, the  <br>
directions to find the box, a pen and log book.  I was glad I had baby  wipes in the <br>
car to clean the stamp before we used it and clean ours after  stamping in.  Not <br>
sure that was really the right thing to use but figured  if it is safe for a <br>
baby's bottom it wouldn't hurt the stamps too much.   Also wondering what <br>
folks carry the needed supplies in on the trail too.   So any input would be <br>
greatly appreciated.<br>
 <br>
Glad I found the whole letterboxing thing ad can't wait to get a few more  <br>
finds under my belt so I feel comfortable enough to try some plants of my  own.  <br>
The teens even acted a bit interested after they saw the stamp in the  log <br>
book and want to try carving their own now, though they acted like I was  nuts <br>
the first time I mentioned it and neither would come along tonight on the  hunt.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congrats on your first find!  Sounds like you had the items you needed, but I would suggest adding a compass with a turnable housing (that you know how to use), water, flashlight (trust me), and some thick gloves for reaching into places you can't see.<br>
<br>
Also, instead of baby wipes, wet some paper towels and place them in a baggie.  Baby wipes can leave a scent on the stamp that can attract critters.  Also, be sure to wash your hands before you go finding letterboxes if you have just eaten, so you don't add food oils t the outside/inside of a letterbox.  This can also attract critters (same with perfume or scented hand lotion.)  Critters are curious and if they think there's any chance the box or it's contents might be edible, they destroy the box.<br>
<br>
Always be sure to hide the box well, completely from view with no clues to it's location.  You want the hunt to be as challenging for the next person as it was for you.  And don't want any non-letterboxers to see the box or physical clues and get curious.  Especially intoxicated teens (if those are a problem in the area) that probably won't respect the letterbox.<br>
<br>
For carving your stamps, I would suggest PZ Kut grade B white and a #1 speedball tool from www.Stampeaz.com  Myself and many others really like these products.  Goldilocks, you've already taken care of finding products that are too hard and too soft LOL  Now get some PZ Kut and find out what's "just right."<br>
<br>
Have fun!  If you want to see some of the stamps I've carved on PZ Kut, take a look at my picturetrail below.<br>

We've added a few extra ziplock bags and even an extra box to our pack <br>
(which is now rather large)...in case we come along a box in need of <br>
some aid...as for baby wipes, I agree with Scoutdogs...just use some <br>
paper towel.<br>
<br>
For caving media, up until recently all our stamps were carved from <br>
Mastercarve.  Unfortunately, it has its limitations as its somewhat <br>
softer.  So, after WI Hiker's suggestion (and most everyone else on this <br>
board) we purchased some PZ Kut, and I've been happy with the results so <br>
far.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the LbGLK and to letterboxing! :)  It sounds like you are off <br>
to a great start.  As you find more boxes, you'll get a better idea of <br>
how people generally carve their stamps.  Atom118 and I started out <br>
making our stamps from a polymer we use at work, but after a few weeks, <br>
they fell apart.  Carving takes some practice, but it sounds like you <br>
and your husband have some artistic wood carving skills, so I'm sure <br>
you'll both get the hang of it. :)<br>
<br>
I just saw that ScoutDogs and Atom responded to your message, and I <br>
agree with them about what to include in your pack -- certainly a <br>
compass is a must since many clues involve taking bearings, a pen or two <br>
to write with, ink pads, maybe a set of markers since some stamps are <br>
colorful, a couple extra baggies in case a box should need some <br>
maintenance, snacks, water, garden gloves for digging around and <br>
reaching into hidey holes, small flashlight, and maybe some bandaids or <br>
other light first aid items.<br>

small/short pencil and then start wrapping duct tape around the body <br>

that takes up very little space in a pack.  It proves very useful to <br>
repair a crack in a box you might find (if you have no replacement <br>
box along) and we've also used it to mend a stamp or two that were <br>
broken in half.  We simply lined up the pieces and then added a duct <br>
tape backing to keep them together.  Not the sturdiest "mounting" but <br>
it works.<br>

I too want to cast my vote and say that PZKut (the grade B white stuff) <br>
is the best stuff after suffering with some of the other that is out <br>
there.  One kind that I went ahead and tried is so soft that I can <br>
damage an image with my fingernail---let alone the crumbling when I am <br>
carving.<br>
<br>
I also wanted to share something that I didn't realize I was doing until <br>
last week.  We all know to wash our hands after eating when we are out <br>
hunting or placing letterboxes, but it didn't dawn on me that I was <br>
eating popcorn while I was carving?!  YIKES!  This is probably equally <br>
as bad or worse and in case someone else snacks while they carve and <br>
didn't realize it, I thought I'd share my sin!  Can this be a Chinese <br>
New Year's Resolution???? <br>
<br>
Again, welcome to the gang and we do hope to see and meet you at the <br>
June event if you can make it!  Don't be shy!<br>

<br>
Congrats on your first find.  Just wait until hubby (CMB) finds out <br>
that that this is a great hobby to use a GPS with.  Every single LB <br>
that I have found I have marked the coordinates in my GPS unit.  I <br>
also have a photograph of every single LB that I have found.  I've <br>
started a blog that I've yet to update, but that too will list all my <br>
LB's.<br>
<br>
As for what to place on your logbook next to your stamp, it's up to <br>
what your preferences are.  Myself, I put the name of the <br>
Placer/Owner, the name of the LB, the location I.E. xy park, or xy <br>
woods, the closest city, the date, the day of the week and the time. <br>
(oh, and the stamp too)!  Sometimes if it's rainy, snowy, extremely <br>
cold or hot, I'll make that comment as well.  I started out using 3 x <br>
5 index cards and just recently abondoned this as I was getting far <br>
too many stamps that exceed 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 sizes.<br>
<br>
A couple of other items that I'd like to mention for your bag.  Take <br>
an old rag or two.  These come in handy for wiping out moist and damp <br>
boxes.  My traveling partner took off her socks and wiped out a <br>
soaked box once is how we learned this lesson.<br>
<br>
You mentioned baby wipes and someone else mentioned damp paper <br>
towels.  I've found that alcahol wipes work pretty good too, plus <br>
they serve as a first aide item.<br>
<br>
Also a note pad to help you keep track of your mental notes.  <br>
Especially when you find an HH and you've been out collecting several <br>
boxes and can't remember which one you found the HH in or replanted <br>
it in. <br>
<br>
Can't stress enough about a good compass, and if you don't already <br>
know how to use it, to learn quickly as this will aid you in finding <br>
your treasure or going home empty handed.  Also don't forget that a <br>
lot of places use the pace method which equates to two steps.  Keep <br>
in mind they are talking about their pace and not yours, so you have <br>
to allow for that.<br>
<br>
Most of all, have fun and get the entire family involved.<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went out today, Tiptoe and Tonto we had the same experience (minus the  <br>
tight rope act) -- mud mud mud. Shriveled up feet and everything. We found 5  <br>
boxes today and had a GREAT time . . . snow, ice, mud and water.<br>
 <br>
This brings me back to this topic of what to take with you while  <br>
letterboxing. So far we find the box and walk it all the way back to the car to  stamp in <br>
and then I run it back and hide it in its place again. <br>
 <br>
In the future we will encounter stamps to far to run back to the car and  the <br>
question of "where do you stamp in?" comes up when all around you is nothing  <br>
but ground, leaves, dirt and mossy fallen trees (I can't bear the thought of  <br>
placing my log book in the dirt).<br>
 <br>
I've come up with an idea and that is bring an old checkers board with you  <br>
on your hunt (or scrabble or any other board game). When you get to the  stamp <br>
open it up and put the printed (or top) side down on the ground,  fallen tree <br>
etc. Put your log book on the board to stamp in -- so your  log book doesn't <br>
get dirty. <br>
 <br>
When you are done fold the game board in half and the dirt will be on the  <br>
inside, thus nothing in your bag would get dirty.<br>

I bought something at Walgreens the other day called a Neat Sheet.  I <br>
haven't used it yet, but it looks pretty cool.  Water proof, light <br>
weight, large enough four four people and compact enough to roll up <br>
in my backpack easily.  It was about $10.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also use a backpack/stool combo.  If the one that<br>
Wisconsin Hiker linked too is a little out of your<br>
budget, check on Ebay - there's usually a variety<br>
being sold there.  Be forewarned, though, that the<br>
quality might not be as good as from the Army surplus<br>
site.  Our first backpack/stool combo purchased from<br>
Ebay for about $10 plus shipping kept falling apart on<br>
us, and it was awkward to wear because of the<br>
placement of the stool.  But our new one is much more<br>
comfortable - it's also one where the backpack can be<br>
used with or without the stool.<br>
<br>
For stamping in, we purchased a mini clipboard from<br>
the local office supply super store.  Since we use<br>
index cards for our logbook, we just clip some index<br>
cards on the board and then make our impression, and<br>
we use the stool to lay the box and our stamping<br>
supplies out on.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh yes, we had the compass problem, too.  For some<br>
reason our compass didn't make it back into our<br>
backpack from our last hunt, and when we got to the<br>
park we realized we didn't have it.  We were actually<br>
planting one of our holy grail boxes, and we'd had<br>
such a tough time finding times in our schedules to<br>
make it to the park in the first place that I refused<br>
to give up and come back another day.  So we drove to<br>
the K-Mart that was down the road to buy a second<br>
compass.    The lengths letterboxers will go to... :)<br>
