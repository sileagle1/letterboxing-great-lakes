I know F100 was lights years ago for some of you, but it is <br/>
challenging finding 100 boxes when everything around you was planted <br/>
by you.  Speaking of which, today for just a few brief minutes, the <br/>
numbers were actually F100 P100.  I have been sitting at P100 since <br/>
almost a year ago, waiting for the F count to catch up.<br/>
<br/>
THANKS to everyone who has planted boxes in this region (also some <br/>
were from the Mid-Atlantic area).  And a huge thanks to azobox for <br/>
his patience today as I fumbled through the clues and pressed on for <br/>
yet "a couple more boxes."<br/>

The day ended at F102 P101.  And now...  I must go plant more boxes.<br/>

you).  With the new Easter Egg series, I'm thinking I really DO need <br/>
to get over to MI this Easter break.  Heck, I got F100 and F200 in <br/>
MI, why not F300?  Hope I can find a way to get over there.  <br/>
Otherwise, F300 might be in IL! (Or were there 13 boxes in WI <br/>
planted this weekend?)<br/>
