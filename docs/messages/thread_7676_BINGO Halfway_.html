                    <div class="plaintext-content">Based on previous years, we are now approximately halfway through the game. The game ends when we have 3 Full Card winners, which usually is sometime in late April or early May.<br>
<br>
So, how is everyone doing towards a full card?  There are some people that have half their cards filled, but others are not quite there yet.  If you'd like to see a chart showing general stats, you can see it in the file I just posted.<br>
<br>
But remember, things can change quickly (or actually SLOWLY, since this is the slowest BINGO game in the world).<br>
<br>
Those full cards may be a ways off, but perhaps some of you are getting close to 4 corners or a "+"?????  When will the next BINGO be called??<br>
