Everything in moderation, I say!  I lived in Kenosha 3 years and I probably can count on <br/>
one hand how many times I ate kringle, and each piece was never more than 2 inches <br/>
wide.  I passed the O&amp;H Bakery many times.  I wouldn't try the cheese topped.  Almond is <br/>
such a treat, I never tried any of the fruit varieties.  But you're probably right, nostalgia <br/>
sometimes makes foods taste better than they really are.  I'm sure it wasn't the healthiest <br/>
thing to have. <br/>
<br/>
Here's my last contribution on regional foods, folks.  How many of you have ever tried or <br/>
heard of sugar-cream pie?  It seems like a central Indiana pie.  Not really a custard, not <br/>
really a cream pie.  But yummy in small pieces.  Wick's Pies ships them everywhere.  <br/>

&gt; My mother calls Sloppy Joe's - wimpies.  We eat<br/>
&gt; hoagies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also loved the almond kringles from Wisconsin -<br/>
&gt; haven't seen them <br/>
&gt; anywhere in Indiana.<br/>
