Everything in moderation, I say!  I lived in Kenosha 3 years and I probably can count on <br>
one hand how many times I ate kringle, and each piece was never more than 2 inches <br>
wide.  I passed the O&H Bakery many times.  I wouldn't try the cheese topped.  Almond is <br>
such a treat, I never tried any of the fruit varieties.  But you're probably right, nostalgia <br>
sometimes makes foods taste better than they really are.  I'm sure it wasn't the healthiest <br>
thing to have. <br>
<br>
Here's my last contribution on regional foods, folks.  How many of you have ever tried or <br>
heard of sugar-cream pie?  It seems like a central Indiana pie.  Not really a custard, not <br>
really a cream pie.  But yummy in small pieces.  Wick's Pies ships them everywhere.  <br>
