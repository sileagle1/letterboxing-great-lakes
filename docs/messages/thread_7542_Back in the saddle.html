Hospitality Hostess and her pirate crew did an outstanding job of planning and executing a wonderful event...and the good Lord provided a spectacular day!<br>
All of the usual comments regarding an event..great boxes, trails, and food were all applicable and top notch..but more so, it was a "treasured experience" to once again reunite with old letterboxers and begin new friendships that letterboxing has provided for us these past ...almost 10 years.<br>
Kudos all around!!!<br>
We will be flyin' our pirate flag...<br>
Tiptoe & Tonto<br>
P.S.  To any of you old Michiganders that weren't there...Azobox, Famofmany, Grandvilla, Rabbits...etc. you were in our hearts and conversations of past Michigan Fall events!<br>
