                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the report!  We will reluctantly wait for NEXT Saturday to head<br/>
to IL.  I am carving a stamp right now - one of a 4-box series I will plant<br/>
in WI in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about the layer of ice underneath the snow.  The roads<br/>
were TERRIBLE on the way home this afternoon!  I almost got rattled off some<br/>
roads and barely made it along our street (which I don't think had been<br/>
plowed in quite a while * I have a low car).  I then ended up gently<br/>
cruising into a snow bank on an uphill curve in our driveway.  Luckily was<br/>
able to restart &amp; get up the hill &amp; into the garage.  Postponed the ham<br/>
pickup and haircut until tomorrow when hopefully conditions will be better.<br/>
{To make matters worse, I talked with my mom (Tabby Tales) and friend (JAB)<br/>
this week.  Both are enjoying sunny 80 degree weather - one in Florida and<br/>
the other in California.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone has a Happy Easter despite the snow!<br/>

<br/>
What's the weather like in the northeast IL area - north of Chicago? Well,<br/>
the sun is shining, the birds are singing, the daffodils are in bloom...and<br/>
I am in total denial! What is all this white stuff? Where is spring? Winter<br/>
is suppose to be over. GRRRRR....<br/>
<br/>
The weathermen estimate that this area was suppose to get 5 inches of snow,<br/>
then revised their estimate to 9.5 inches of snow fall. But the actually<br/>
on-the-ground accumulation is about 10-12 inches. It's wet and heavy and<br/>
it's still falling. It's difficult to push the snow blower through this<br/>
stuff. And because it's wet, this slop is forming a bumpy, under layer of<br/>
ice on the roads.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, before this snow started coming down, I was on the trails. I have<br/>
several new letterboxes ready for placing. Now, I guess I will have to wait<br/>
to place them. I doubt you would be able to find the trails with all this<br/>
snow and ice.<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation: wait a week. By the end of the week, the temps are<br/>
suppose to warm up to the 50s and maybe all this snow and ice will melt<br/>
away. I'll bet that many of the boxes in the area are not accessible or<br/>
frozen to the ground.<br/>
<br/>
But when this snow and ice are truly gone....we'll be tripping over each<br/>
other on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
This is a time to carve and plan some new boxes.<br/>

So Beetle, are you out there? Or someone else in northern IL (north of<br/>
Chicago)? What's the weather like down there? Would it be safe to plan on<br/>
boxing tomorrow or is it starting to pile up?<br/>

Ok, we are all now awake -- 10 am!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last night I learned that I had to go to Geneseo (30 minutes drive . . . hour round trip) and that I might have to "drive to Wisconsin," to Orchard Manor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Where's Orchard Manor?" I asked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"In Wisconsin," was the response. Well, I knew that... where in Wisconsin . ... "don't know."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Flashforward and "Wisconsin is cancelled." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I don't have to go?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"no." <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Is this something that I might have to do over the weekend."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"no, I got it all taken care of," says the pharmasit<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Off to Geneseo I go, whistling a happy tune when my phone chirped.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Hello."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Matt, you have to go to Wisconsin tonight."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll spare you all the nitty gritty details as to how it went from a "no your not going," to a "you have to go tonight" it was already nearly 7pm and though we had ZERO snow here in the Quad Cities (hint hint all you boxers can come here to search . .. drop me a line and we could meet up).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't get back to the office from Geneseo until about 8pm and learned that Orchard Manor is in Lancaster, WI [[Hart family history alert]] My Grandfather went to Dubuque Seminary and my dad was born in Dubuque. The first church Grandpa pastored was in Potosi, Wisconsin where there is one letterbox (the Channel Cat) then Grandpa pastored the Presbyterian church in Lancaster where my uncle was born . . . in the early 1950's my grandparents auctioned off all the owned and became missionaries to Lebenon until Grandma got polio (Christmas Day 1954) and they moved back to the states.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, I was excited to once again go up to this part of Wisconsin.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the time I hit the Dubuque airport it was 28 degrees out and the fine misty rain was freezing to the road. An on-coming car spun out right infront of me!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had brought the clues to the Channel Cat box in Potosi though, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to find it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After the drop off at Orchard Manor I found this small park in Potosi. The clues directed me to the furthest parking area . . . have you ever seen semi trucks full of plowed snow driving through town? Have you ever wondered to yourself, "I wonder where they dump all the snow?" Well, the furthest parking spot at Hickory Hill Park in Potosi is where ALL that snow gets dumped.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had the Rocky Mountains in front of me!! Of course, I had to climb them to get to the box!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had just worn my tennis shoes, it was after 10pm and off I went. My foot dropping through to my knee... one time my ENTIRE leg fell in to my pelvis . ..  but I was determined and perservered!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once past the mountain range I found the box!! After stamping in, it was back to the car for the 2 hour drive home.<br/>
<br/>

What's the weather like in the northeast IL area - north of Chicago? Well, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, the daffodils are in bloom...and I am in total denial! What is all this white stuff? Where is spring? Winter is suppose to be over. GRRRRR....<br/>
<br/>
The weathermen estimate that this area was suppose to get 5 inches of snow, then revised their estimate to 9.5 inches of snow fall. But the actually on-the-ground accumulation is about 10-12 inches. It's wet and heavy and it's still falling. It's difficult to push the snow blower through this stuff. And because it's wet, this slop is forming a bumpy, under layer of ice on the roads. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, before this snow started coming down, I was on the trails. I have several new letterboxes ready for placing. Now, I guess I will have to wait to place them. I doubt you would be able to find the trails with all this snow and ice. <br/>
<br/>
My recommendation: wait a week. By the end of the week, the temps are suppose to warm up to the 50s and maybe all this snow and ice will melt away. I'll bet that many of the boxes in the area are not accessible or frozen to the ground. <br/>
<br/>
But when this snow and ice are truly gone....we'll be tripping over each other on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
This is a time to carve and plan some new boxes. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I learned that I had to go to Geneseo (30<br/>
&gt; minutes drive . . . hour round trip) and that I<br/>
&gt; might have to "drive to Wisconsin," to Orchard<br/>
&gt; Manor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Where's Orchard Manor?" I asked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "In Wisconsin," was the response. Well, I knew<br/>
&gt; that... where in Wisconsin . ... "don't know."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Flashforward and "Wisconsin is cancelled." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "I don't have to go?"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "no." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Is this something that I might have to do over the<br/>
&gt; weekend."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "no, I got it all taken care of," says the pharmasit<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Off to Geneseo I go, whistling a happy tune when my<br/>
&gt; phone chirped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Hello."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Matt, you have to go to Wisconsin tonight."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll spare you all the nitty gritty details as to<br/>
&gt; how it went from a "no your not going," to a "you<br/>
&gt; have to go tonight" it was already nearly 7pm and<br/>
&gt; though we had ZERO snow here in the Quad Cities<br/>
&gt; (hint hint all you boxers can come here to search .<br/>
&gt; .. drop me a line and we could meet up).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn't get back to the office from Geneseo until<br/>
&gt; about 8pm and learned that Orchard Manor is in<br/>
&gt; Lancaster, WI [[Hart family history alert]] My<br/>
&gt; Grandfather went to Dubuque Seminary and my dad was<br/>
&gt; born in Dubuque. The first church Grandpa pastored<br/>
&gt; was in Potosi, Wisconsin where there is one<br/>
&gt; letterbox (the Channel Cat) then Grandpa pastored<br/>
&gt; the Presbyterian church in Lancaster where my uncle<br/>
&gt; was born . . . in the early 1950's my grandparents<br/>
&gt; auctioned off all the owned and became missionaries<br/>
&gt; to Lebenon until Grandma got polio (Christmas Day<br/>
&gt; 1954) and they moved back to the states.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I was excited to once again go up to this part<br/>
&gt; of Wisconsin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the time I hit the Dubuque airport it was 28<br/>
&gt; degrees out and the fine misty rain was freezing to<br/>
&gt; the road. An on-coming car spun out right infront of<br/>
&gt; me!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had brought the clues to the Channel Cat box in<br/>
&gt; Potosi though, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to find<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After the drop off at Orchard Manor I found this<br/>
&gt; small park in Potosi. The clues directed me to the<br/>
&gt; furthest parking area . . . have you ever seen semi<br/>
&gt; trucks full of plowed snow driving through town?<br/>
&gt; Have you ever wondered to yourself, "I wonder where<br/>
&gt; they dump all the snow?" Well, the furthest parking<br/>
&gt; spot at Hickory Hill Park in Potosi is where ALL<br/>
&gt; that snow gets dumped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had the Rocky Mountains in front of me!! Of<br/>
&gt; course, I had to climb them to get to the box!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had just worn my tennis shoes, it was after 10pm<br/>
&gt; and off I went. My foot dropping through to my<br/>
&gt; knee... one time my ENTIRE leg fell in to my pelvis<br/>
&gt; . .. but I was determined and perservered!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once past the mountain range I found the box!! After<br/>
&gt; stamping in, it was back to the car for the 2 hour<br/>
&gt; drive home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got home at just past 1am a happy (and tired)<br/>
&gt; camper ~ I realized that this was my *first* box<br/>
&gt; that I found in the state of Wisconsin!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks Aimlesst for replanting this wonderful box!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; will be shoveling every 2-3 hours hoping that the<br/>
&gt; 15"<br/>
&gt; &gt; they say are possible aren't on my driveway. &gt;:(<br/>

&gt; Ok, we are all now awake -- 10 am!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night I learned that I had to go to Geneseo (30 minutes <br/>
drive . . . hour round trip) and that I might have to "drive to <br/>
Wisconsin," to Orchard Manor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Where's Orchard Manor?" I asked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "In Wisconsin," was the response. Well, I knew that... where in <br/>
Wisconsin . ... "don't know."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Flashforward and "Wisconsin is cancelled." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "I don't have to go?"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "no." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Is this something that I might have to do over the weekend."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "no, I got it all taken care of," says the pharmasit<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Off to Geneseo I go, whistling a happy tune when my phone chirped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Hello."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Matt, you have to go to Wisconsin tonight."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll spare you all the nitty gritty details as to how it went from <br/>
a "no your not going," to a "you have to go tonight" it was already <br/>
nearly 7pm and though we had ZERO snow here in the Quad Cities (hint <br/>
hint all you boxers can come here to search . .. drop me a line and <br/>
we could meet up).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn't get back to the office from Geneseo until about 8pm and <br/>
learned that Orchard Manor is in Lancaster, WI [[Hart family history <br/>
alert]] My Grandfather went to Dubuque Seminary and my dad was born <br/>
in Dubuque. The first church Grandpa pastored was in Potosi, <br/>
Wisconsin where there is one letterbox (the Channel Cat) then Grandpa <br/>
pastored the Presbyterian church in Lancaster where my uncle was <br/>
born . . . in the early 1950's my grandparents auctioned off all the <br/>
owned and became missionaries to Lebenon until Grandma got polio <br/>
(Christmas Day 1954) and they moved back to the states.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I was excited to once again go up to this part of Wisconsin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the time I hit the Dubuque airport it was 28 degrees out and the <br/>
fine misty rain was freezing to the road. An on-coming car spun out <br/>
right infront of me!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had brought the clues to the Channel Cat box in Potosi though, I <br/>
wasn't sure if I'd be able to find it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After the drop off at Orchard Manor I found this small park in <br/>
Potosi. The clues directed me to the furthest parking area . . . have <br/>
you ever seen semi trucks full of plowed snow driving through town? <br/>
Have you ever wondered to yourself, "I wonder where they dump all the <br/>
snow?" Well, the furthest parking spot at Hickory Hill Park in Potosi <br/>
is where ALL that snow gets dumped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had the Rocky Mountains in front of me!! Of course, I had to <br/>
climb them to get to the box!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had just worn my tennis shoes, it was after 10pm and off I went. <br/>
My foot dropping through to my knee... one time my ENTIRE leg fell in <br/>
to my pelvis . ..  but I was determined and perservered!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once past the mountain range I found the box!! After stamping in, <br/>
it was back to the car for the 2 hour drive home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got home at just past 1am a happy (and tired) camper ~ I realized <br/>
that this was my *first* box that I found in the state of Wisconsin!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks Aimlesst for replanting this wonderful box!!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What's the weather like in the northeast IL area - north of <br/>
Chicago? Well, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, the <br/>
daffodils are in bloom...and I am in total denial! What is all this <br/>
white stuff? Where is spring? Winter is suppose to be over. GRRRRR....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The weathermen estimate that this area was suppose to get 5 inches <br/>
of snow, then revised their estimate to 9.5 inches of snow fall. But <br/>
the actually on-the-ground accumulation is about 10-12 inches. It's <br/>
wet and heavy and it's still falling. It's difficult to push the snow <br/>
blower through this stuff. And because it's wet, this slop is forming <br/>
a bumpy, under layer of ice on the roads. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yesterday, before this snow started coming down, I was on the <br/>
trails. I have several new letterboxes ready for placing. Now, I <br/>
guess I will have to wait to place them. I doubt you would be able to <br/>
find the trails with all this snow and ice. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My recommendation: wait a week. By the end of the week, the temps <br/>
are suppose to warm up to the 50s and maybe all this snow and ice <br/>
will melt away. I'll bet that many of the boxes in the area are not <br/>
accessible or frozen to the ground. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But when this snow and ice are truly gone....we'll be tripping over <br/>
each other on the trails.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a time to carve and plan some new boxes. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh yeah, it's really BAD here!! Unfortunately it<br/>
&gt; &gt; looks like the 10-15" will be true.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; They closed both of our offices early, but since<br/>
&gt; &gt; Martini Man can't get up our driveway (barely made<br/>
&gt; &gt; it up our street), he's camping out at the nearby<br/>
&gt; &gt; library. I waited here at the office to get a<br/>
&gt; &gt; "driveway report", so now we're both waiting to hear<br/>
&gt; &gt; from the plowing service to find out when they'll be<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting to our house...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; MM is being productive at the library - he said he's<br/>
&gt; &gt; looking for images to carve for some of the upcoming<br/>
&gt; &gt; gatherings!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sing along now: "It's beginning to look a lot like<br/>

So Beetle, are you out there? Or someone else in northern IL (north of<br/>
Chicago)? What's the weather like down there? Would it be safe to plan on<br/>
boxing tomorrow or is it starting to pile up?<br/>

&gt; Oh yeah, it's really BAD here!! Unfortunately it<br/>
&gt; looks like the 10-15" will be true.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They closed both of our offices early, but since<br/>
&gt; Martini Man can't get up our driveway (barely made<br/>
&gt; it up our street), he's camping out at the nearby<br/>
&gt; library. I waited here at the office to get a<br/>
&gt; "driveway report", so now we're both waiting to hear<br/>
&gt; from the plowing service to find out when they'll be<br/>
&gt; getting to our house...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; MM is being productive at the library - he said he's<br/>
&gt; looking for images to carve for some of the upcoming<br/>
&gt; gatherings!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sing along now: "It's beginning to look a lot like<br/>
&gt; CHRISTMAS....!"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ... wait, isn't that OVER??? Isn't it EASTER???<br/>

Aacckkk! You're right! Here's the latest word from the local paper:<br/>
<br/>
Winter storm watch Thursday<br/>
Call it the winter that just won't quit: The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch for all of southern Wisconsin beginning Thursday morning.<br/>
<br/>
The weather service says the potential exists for 6 inches or more of snow. More snow could fall in areas near Lake Michigan, forecasters say.<br/>
<br/>
The latest forecast calls for snowfall totals of 4 to 8 inches by Thursday night.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yeah, some melting, but since we got 15" last Friday, there is<br/>

I am in the Aurora/Montgomery area and most of the snow is gone (except for the GIANT piles at the stores) my dd and I went looking for a couple boxes today. Had a Blast!!!! The clue said follow the trail to a clearing. Well when we got to the clearing it looked more like an ice skating pond lol . We did find the boxes and had a great time. At one point when we saw the clearing was flooded and frozen my 8 yr old said well how deep is it and grabbed my stick .Like I'm gonna go wading in a frozen clearing ( well if I would of had diff shoes on maybe). <br/>

I placed some new boxes this week, and I'm planning to place some all weather boxes that a lone letterboxer can find without fear of "three eyed ax murderers" following them.  This snow seems to melt just as fast as it's falling.  Spring brings those April showers.  But I'm not staying inside because of rain and mud.  I stayed inside too much last year because of the weather. This year, I plan to hike in the snow, march through the mud, get a bit wet, but I plan to find more boxes.  I need the exercise.  I like being outside.  So let's just get out there and GO LETTERBOXING!<br/>
