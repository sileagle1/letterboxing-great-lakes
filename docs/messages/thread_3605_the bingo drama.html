was looking at it and seeing me from a perspective of "how is she<br>
being mean now?", it could possibly be seen I was taking a swipe at<br>
SpringChick's posts. For that I do apologize. If this was anythign<br>
more than a very quick too off post I probably would have edited it<br>
more carefully. The worker-speak I referred to had nothing to do with<br>
the dismissive attitude of those workers, and it never occurred to me<br>
that it would be taken so, bc in my mind I know that is not possible<br>
in this particular game. It was exclusively in reference to the post I<br>
was replying to and the discussion of which free space to choose and<br>
why.<br>
<br>
I hate it when I mis-write something like that. I didn't go into the<br>
reasons why it is not possible in this game structure bc it didn't<br>
seem it would be necessary. But it is not possible.<br>

mixed up in it. (grin - That could all change with this post though,<br>
we'll see)<br>
<br>
FM: I found your Bingo observations quite interesting and I, for one,<br>
am glad you posted them.  Also, there are some people in letterboxing<br>
that seem to have the kind of personality that reacts more abrasively<br>
(threat of pain and torture can't draw me into naming names, so don't<br>
ask, just hang around long enough and you'll likely see some patterns)<br>
<br>
CB: Very nice of you to apologize, but I enjoyed the candor in your<br>
post and found it refreshing. <br>
<br>
For myself, I've invented the "24 hour code" ... if I feel strongly<br>
about a message I've read and want to reply, I make myself wait for a<br>
day. Then, I'll re-read the message and compose a reply off-line, wait<br>
until later in the day, edit the reply and then finally post. Well,<br>
the first part is really the code, all the rest "more like guidelines,<br>
really" (paraphrased from Pirates of the Caribbean)<br>
<br>
I know how much we all think of this as "our list" but, in point of<br>
fact, it belongs to SpringChick. She created it and puts a lot of<br>
effort into making it someplace we want/choose to spend our online<br>
time. It's pretty much her world, and as the list owner, each of us is<br>
only allowed to be here at her pleasure. Like it or not, that's the<br>
way it is.<br>
<br>
Now re: Bingo methods ... mine is strictly random. I decided which<br>
items I was qualified to choose from, selected them at random, placed<br>
them on my card in random order and when it was time for our own free<br>
space, (LOL coming next) I closed my eyes, spun my card around and<br>
pointed at a random spot. After I read how SC would've chosen, it made<br>
great sense that I should've chosen a corner spot. However, I hate<br>
math (always have) and my mind just doesn't work in that logical way.<br>
Not only is logical thinking not second-nature to me, it's probably<br>
not even tenth-nature. LOL!<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>

Although I created this list, it is not *my* list, rather it belongs to <br>
everyone here and I am sorry if you personally feel otherwise.  While I <br>
and Azobox do monitor posts and occasionally make decisions about <br>
inappropriate content, etc. we try to do that objectively, not just on <br>
a personal whim.  Fortunately there are very few people here who give <br>
us reason to have to play moderator.  <br>
<br>
Sorry if this feels abrasive to you, but somehow I knew you wouldn't <br>
hesitate to jump on the bandwagon with anyone who didn't see eye-to-eye <br>
with me.  Like you say...  hang around long enough and you will see <br>
some patterns.<br>
