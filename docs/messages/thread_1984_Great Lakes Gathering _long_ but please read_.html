This would have been my 2 cents, or rather a reminder, that this HAD<br/>

WAS decided by the group at that time that we would have a GL<br/>
gathering every mid-June - date to be set by the host.  It was decided<br/>
that the GL gathering would bounce back and forth east/west among the<br/>
states each year on a rotating basis.  It was also decided that<br/>
individual states would have their gatherings in the fall so as not to<br/>
interfere with the GL gathering.  This is why WI has had their last<br/>
two gatherings in the fall.  Reading through the posts, I couldn't<br/>

take more time and input before making final decisions!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like the idea of varying location.  To me, having the gathering in the<br/>
same place every year is a bit too exclusionary.  Yes, we can all travel<br/>
to that place, but is it really fair if the gathering is always 10 hours<br/>
away from Letterboxer X and only 30 minutes from Lb'erY?  Not to mention<br/>
that for me, at least, a big part of the fun is exploring a new location<br/>
and seeing new sites.  <br/>
<br/>
I also like the idea of having a set date, in theory, but I suspect that<br/>
it won't work well in actuality, and that more people will be<br/>
willing/able to host if there is some flexibility to the date.<br/>

As SpringChick notes in her post, there was no combination that was<br/>
going to please everyone. However it seemed as though a consensus was<br/>
emerging to support the decision she made. We've been tossing this<br/>
around for nearly a month in various threads and it was time to get it<br/>
settled.<br/>
<br/>
Although the event is more than six months away, many people are asked<br/>
to reserve 2006 vacation time at the first of the year. Now at least<br/>
we know which weekend to hold.<br/>
<br/>
So, SpringChick, thanks for undertaking this responsibility. Getting<br/>
agreement from a diverse group of letterboxers, especially a group of<br/>
independent thinking upper-midwesteners is like herding the proverbial<br/>
cats. (I don't think we're all in the corral yet, but we're heading in<br/>
the same direction). <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing the plans for GL 2006 emerge and hope that<br/>
I'll be able to participate.<br/>

&gt; It looks like the majority of people like the idea of keeping <br/>
&gt; the 'official' regional Great Lakes Gathering alive, and I would <br/>
&gt; agree with that. I am also very happy to see so many state and local <br/>
&gt; gatherings popping up throughout the region and as WI Hiker, feel <br/>
&gt; that all gatherings are open to anyone and hope that these smaller <br/>
&gt; gatherings do encourage folks to make a trip over to another area <br/>
&gt; and meet letterboxers there as well as do some boxing in a new place.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; There is never going to be a place or a time for the regional <br/>
&gt; gathering that will please everyone and the best we can do is strive <br/>
&gt; for consistency.  One suggested option was to set both date and <br/>
&gt; location to remain the same from one year to the next.  Making the <br/>
&gt; date consistent is certainly a step in the right direction, but I <br/>
&gt; hesitate about keeping the location the same year after year.  Not <br/>
&gt; only does this have the potential to become stale, it also runs the <br/>
&gt; risk of becoming an event localized to the state where it is being <br/>
&gt; held every year.  So I've decided to take the suggestion of rotating <br/>
&gt; between states according to a predetermined schedule.  Having a <br/>
&gt; preset schedule will enable people to make advanced plans, while the <br/>
&gt; rotation will provide variety, greater accessibility and <br/>
&gt; availability of hosts.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; The date will be moved back to that of the initial Great Lakes <br/>
&gt; Gathering -- the Saturday after Memorial Day.  Hopefully if this <br/>
&gt; date does not work for you this year, it will work out in a future <br/>
&gt; year.  We all have jobs and kids and commitments and busy lives and <br/>
&gt; what works for one person invariably causes conflicts for another -- <br/>
&gt; it is just the nature of the beast.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I have not yet set a rotation schedule for location as it will <br/>
&gt; depend on who is willing to host the 2006 event.  I am throwing <br/>
&gt; aside all previous input and starting new with suggestions for <br/>
&gt; location as I am not sure how the established date may affect <br/>
&gt; previous offers.  If you are willing to host or assist with hosting <br/>
&gt; the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering to be held on June 3, 2006, please <br/>
&gt; contact me offlist.  After this year's location has been decided, I <br/>
&gt; will set the rotation for future years and add it to the files to <br/>
&gt; have on record.  Going forward, each year during the month of June I <br/>
&gt; will ask for volunteers to coordinate the gathering for the <br/>
&gt; following year -- to be held on the Saturday after Memorial day in <br/>
&gt; the state next in the rotation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you everyone for your input.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There were no polls. My earlier efforts to go the democratic route<br/>
with this were met with resistance. Due to changes in circumstances<br/>
and rising questions as to the future of the event, a decision<br/>
needed to be made. I realize there was only a single day for input<br/>
and there may have been folks on vacation or just away from their<br/>
computer, however it was important to me to get a general feel for<br/>
what people were thinking, not hear from every single person.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry, although I was in attendance at the IL gathering, I <br/>
honestly do not recall any of the conversations you refer to.  I <br/>
would never have agreed to the date moving around like that as it <br/>
has always been my intent to have an established date for this event <br/>
to aid people in making plans. As for more time in making the <br/>
decision, I think that this has dragged on long enough and needed to <br/>
be settled.  <br/>
<br/>
As the founder of the Great Lakes Gathering, I have made the<br/>
decision as to the future of this event based on input from the<br/>
group. Hopefully this decision will work for the majority of<br/>
people, although I realize that with a group of 200 members, it<br/>
would be very difficult to meet the needs of every person.<br/>

&gt; It seems to me there hasn't been enough people heard from about <br/>
this<br/>
&gt; yet.  Less than 24 hours of requested input is not enough.  Some <br/>
of us<br/>
&gt; are on vacation and others don't read the list every day.  The <br/>
polls<br/>
&gt; to decide all this were up and gone before some of us even knew <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; existed!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This would have been my 2 cents, or rather a reminder, that this <br/>
HAD<br/>
&gt; been all discussed and decided on just after the IL GL gathering.  <br/>
It<br/>
&gt; WAS decided by the group at that time that we would have a GL<br/>
&gt; gathering every mid-June - date to be set by the host.  It was <br/>
decided<br/>
&gt; that the GL gathering would bounce back and forth east/west among <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; states each year on a rotating basis.  It was also decided that<br/>
&gt; individual states would have their gatherings in the fall so as <br/>
not to<br/>
&gt; interfere with the GL gathering.  This is why WI has had their last<br/>
&gt; two gatherings in the fall.  Reading through the posts, I couldn't<br/>
&gt; believe no one mentioned any of this!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please, if we are going to re-work all of this gathering stuff, <br/>
let's<br/>
&gt; take more time and input before making final decisions!<br/>
