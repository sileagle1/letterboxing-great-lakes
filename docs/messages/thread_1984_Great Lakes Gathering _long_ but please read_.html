It looks like the majority of people like the idea of keeping<br>

agree with that. I am also very happy to see so many state and local<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It seems to me there hasn't been enough people heard from about this<br>
yet.  Less than 24 hours of requested input is not enough.  Some of us<br>
are on vacation and others don't read the list every day.  The polls<br>
to decide all this were up and gone before some of us even knew they<br>
existed!<br>
<br>
This would have been my 2 cents, or rather a reminder, that this HAD<br>
been all discussed and decided on just after the IL GL gathering.  It<br>
WAS decided by the group at that time that we would have a GL<br>
gathering every mid-June - date to be set by the host.  It was decided<br>
that the GL gathering would bounce back and forth east/west among the<br>
states each year on a rotating basis.  It was also decided that<br>
individual states would have their gatherings in the fall so as not to<br>
interfere with the GL gathering.  This is why WI has had their last<br>
two gatherings in the fall.  Reading through the posts, I couldn't<br>
believe no one mentioned any of this!<br>
<br>
Please, if we are going to re-work all of this gathering stuff, let's<br>
take more time and input before making final decisions!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like the idea of varying location.  To me, having the gathering in the<br>
same place every year is a bit too exclusionary.  Yes, we can all travel<br>
to that place, but is it really fair if the gathering is always 10 hours<br>
away from Letterboxer X and only 30 minutes from Lb'erY?  Not to mention<br>
that for me, at least, a big part of the fun is exploring a new location<br>
and seeing new sites.  <br>
<br>
I also like the idea of having a set date, in theory, but I suspect that<br>
it won't work well in actuality, and that more people will be<br>
willing/able to host if there is some flexibility to the date.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Having wrestled with the pros and cons of places and dates for the GL<br>
annual Gathering, both publicy and privately, I have to say that this<br>
decision is likely the most workable.<br>
<br>
As SpringChick notes in her post, there was no combination that was<br>
going to please everyone. However it seemed as though a consensus was<br>
emerging to support the decision she made. We've been tossing this<br>
around for nearly a month in various threads and it was time to get it<br>
settled.<br>
<br>
Although the event is more than six months away, many people are asked<br>
to reserve 2006 vacation time at the first of the year. Now at least<br>
we know which weekend to hold.<br>
<br>
So, SpringChick, thanks for undertaking this responsibility. Getting<br>
agreement from a diverse group of letterboxers, especially a group of<br>
independent thinking upper-midwesteners is like herding the proverbial<br>
cats. (I don't think we're all in the corral yet, but we're heading in<br>
the same direction). <br>
<br>
I look forward to seeing the plans for GL 2006 emerge and hope that<br>
I'll be able to participate.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There were no polls. My earlier efforts to go the democratic route<br>
with this were met with resistance. Due to changes in circumstances<br>
and rising questions as to the future of the event, a decision<br>
needed to be made. I realize there was only a single day for input<br>
and there may have been folks on vacation or just away from their<br>
computer, however it was important to me to get a general feel for<br>
what people were thinking, not hear from every single person.<br>
<br>
I am sorry, although I was in attendance at the IL gathering, I <br>
honestly do not recall any of the conversations you refer to.  I <br>
would never have agreed to the date moving around like that as it <br>
has always been my intent to have an established date for this event <br>
to aid people in making plans. As for more time in making the <br>
decision, I think that this has dragged on long enough and needed to <br>
be settled.  <br>
<br>
As the founder of the Great Lakes Gathering, I have made the<br>
decision as to the future of this event based on input from the<br>
group. Hopefully this decision will work for the majority of<br>
people, although I realize that with a group of 200 members, it<br>
would be very difficult to meet the needs of every person.<br>
