  I am so sad to report that indeed, my Electro-Motive box is missing.<br>
  It appears as though park maintenance trimmed the bushes and must have<br>
  foud it and tossed it.  <br>
  My first missing box.... I wanted to cry sitting in the parking lot.   :-(<br>
  I will replace it, but it will take me some time to re-create this one.<br>

I think too, it might have been easier for people to see because a lot of<br>
