                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, we like to announce that the "Migrating Coconuts" hitchhiker <br>
has migrated a short distance and is now located in the "Run Away!" <br>
box.  If you don't know what this is about, check this link:<br>

<br>
Second, we picked up two of the Gathering temporary boxes, so <br>
the "Mock Turtle" and "Marriage is a Wonderland" boxes are no longer <br>
available.  They will be mailed back to their creators sometime this <br>
week.<br>
<br>
Third, it seems something else "migrated" besides the coconuts.  We <br>
had received some reports that one of the Gathering boxes might be <br>
missing and we were dismayed to hear that it was the Cottontails <br>
box.  They have had such bad luck recently that we REALLY hoped we <br>
could find it today.  Hurray!!!  We did in fact locate it.  It wasn't <br>
in the same spot we originally hid it, but had migrated to the side <br>
of one of the fallen trees.  When I looked at the log, I saw that the <br>
persistent Lizards WERE able to find it yesterday, but for those of <br>
you who missed it - it is now back it the original location described <br>
in the clues.  Hopefully you will have another chance to find it <br>
before the end of the month.<br>
<br>
Fourth, there are two temporary boxes still in the park.  Since we'll <br>
be out of town over the 4th of July weekend, they will remain in the <br>
park until July 6.  This will give you a few more days to find them <br>
if you haven't done so already.<br>

WE placed (Pack of Cards and I'm Late! I'm Late!!).  Acorn also has several<br>
