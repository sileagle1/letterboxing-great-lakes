In the clue (which I posted on AQ), it added links to 3 different internet-based maps. 2 of them simply map to the center of the city, even though I put an actual address in the location field. Only 1 (yahoo maps) got the real park location. I'm sure that part of it is that mapquest and google don't recognize the park name. When entering the location info, I entered the park name, followed by a comma and then the address. I'm sure if I took out the park name and put only the address in, it'd come out correctly, but I really want the park name in the location field so that it shows up on the search page with the park name.  I also tried entering the coordinates, but that didn't help either.<br/>

Any ideas? Thanks!<br/>

In your clues, could you tell people to refer just to the Yahoo map?<br/>
