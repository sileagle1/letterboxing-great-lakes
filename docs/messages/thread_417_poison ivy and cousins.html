<br/>
This is a page from the FDA with a lot of info about poison ivy, oak, and<br/>
sumac, though no reason why someone could be susceptible to one and not the<br/>
other.<br/>
http://www.agr.gc.ca/science/ecorc/poison/index_e.htm<br/>
<br/>
Now, this site states there are actually four antigenic compounds which make<br/>
up urushiol.  It also says that no one is completely immune to it, and<br/>
because it is a matter of delayed hypersensitivity, one may have a reaction<br/>
after years of exposure that previously caused no reaction.  My hypothesis<br/>
is that maybe there are different concentrations of the various antigens in<br/>
the different plants, and a person may be more susceptible to one than the<br/>
other????<br/>
