Based on conversations at events earlier this year, I know some of you were aware that Martini Man's mom developed more severe health problems in mid-January.  She had several strokes and seizures of various levels over the past few months, yet managed to rebound fairly well after them.  However over the past few weeks she got generally weaker and more tired, and died peacefully in her sleep yesterday morning.<br/>
