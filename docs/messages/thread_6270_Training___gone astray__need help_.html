<br/>
Zee series was top notch in giving us just the right workout for endurance on level ground.  Vee started outs on zee trail only to spy four suspicious folks with a backpack and white paper in hand near zee first box.   Hmmmm, another Olympic team perhaps?<br/>
Why, no!  It was zee Waltzing Pigs who graciously let us train along side for the duration of the trek.  Zey can attest to zee lack of any illegal drug usage on zee part of team Sveeeeden!  Absolutely no funny meatballs, hot sauce or beer soup with raw egg yolk ver anywhere in sight!<br/>
<br/>
Vee STRONGLY urge you all to go for this series - great stamps!  Don't let the distance scare you - very doable..unless you are like zee youngest little piggie who decided to do zee trip in less than acceptable gym shoes!  But, even he finished in fine fashion.. albeit, wet and a little cranky.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, zee theme of zee box followed suit and zee bad news is...Gunhild lost her favorite mitten...a black &amp; white sweater pattern with white fleece lining and a silver button somewhere on zee trail!  (Stop laughing and shaking your head, Sunnysideup!) If Any of you happen to go for this great series...and find her lost mitten, PLEASE let zee naughty kitten know!  She was counting on those prize mittens to carry her through the Olympics in February!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Atomic Beans  for a wonderful series...LOVED the stamps...And, thanks to zee Waltzing Pigs for a delightful shared adventure...Kemosabe was thrilled to meet you and make an exchange out on the trail - a rare exchange indeed....right Nature Nerd, River Rat and Hiker Babe?<br/>
