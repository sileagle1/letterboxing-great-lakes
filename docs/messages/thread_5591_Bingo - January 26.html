Isn't it great that the Great Lakes letterboxers can spend "The Days of <br>
Our Lives" following the BINGO drama--and how many more days of our <br>
lives will it be before Tiptoe gets a hit?  Will it be "24" hours--<br>
or "24" days????  I wonder if Tiptoe would be doing better if we did <br>
traditional BINGO with "Numb3rs" instead of terms.    :~)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">"According to Jim" he has been trying to explain to "All My (Our) Children" why their <br>
mother is so distraught. He decided to start at the beginning, and he began by answering <br>
their inquiry on why he ever got involved with such a "Bozo". <br>
<br>
"How I met your Mother" was one of the most unforgettable "Days of Our Lives."  She gave <br>
me "Goosebumps" whenever she walked into the room.  She was "Young and Restless" and <br>
looking to be a "Relic Hunter" - a real life "Dora the Explorer".  I (Tonto) being the "History <br>
Detective," thought we'd make a great pair, just like "Ozzie and Harriet."   I asked her to <br>
marry me.   I was "Right on the Money" - she's turned out to be a terrific wife...until now. <br>
<br>
Our mutual admiration of scavenger hunts, art and history led us to Letterboxing - even <br>
though we didn't have a "Blue's Clue" about what we were doing.  "Step by Step" we found <br>
many boxes together and truly loved the hobby.  But then she decided to up the ante and <br>
play Letterboxing Bingo.<br>
<br>
She has come up empty-handed for 26 days and her attitude has gone "Due South."  She is <br>
so out of sorts that each night I'm not sure if I should sleep "Upstairs, Downstairs."  It is all <br>
so upsetting.  Her ranting has gotten so out of hand that I'm embarrassed for people to <br>
think that "I'm with Her.   I'm considering telling people that "My Name is Earl," instead of <br>
Tonto. <br>
<br>
The kids interrupted and said, but Dad, she is making this such a "Bleak House" we can <br>
hardly stand it!  You have to do something and send her to "St. Elsewhere".<br>
<br>
No, he said, this will have to become the "Life As We Know It" until she gets her first Bingo <br>
word.  Since this is a "Family Affair," let's keep this "All in the Family" and not spread <br>
rumors by being a "Gossip Girl" about your mother.<br>
<br>
The non-letterboxing kids just shook their heads and told him, you both need to "Get A <br>
Life."<br>

"According to Jim" he has been trying to explain to "All My (Our) Children" why their <br>
mother is so distraught. He decided to start at the beginning, and he began by answering <br>
their inquiry on why he ever got involved with such a "Bozo". <br>
<br>
"How I met your Mother" was one of the most unforgettable "Days of Our Lives." She gave <br>
me "Goosebumps" whenever she walked into the room. She was "Young and Restless" and <br>
looking to be a "Relic Hunter" - a real life "Dora the Explorer". I (Tonto) being the "History <br>
Detective," thought we'd make a great pair, just like "Ozzie and Harriet." I asked her to <br>
marry me. I was "Right on the Money" - she's turned out to be a terrific wife...until now. <br>
<br>
Our mutual admiration of scavenger hunts, art and history led us to Letterboxing - even <br>
though we didn't have a "Blue's Clue" about what we were doing. "Step by Step" we found <br>
many boxes together and truly loved the hobby. But then she decided to up the ante and <br>
play Letterboxing Bingo.<br>
<br>
She has come up empty-handed for 26 days and her attitude has gone "Due South." She is <br>
so out of sorts that each night I'm not sure if I should sleep "Upstairs, Downstairs." It is all <br>
so upsetting. Her ranting has gotten so out of hand that I'm embarrassed for people to <br>
think that "I'm with Her. I'm considering telling people that "My Name is Earl," instead of <br>
Tonto. <br>
<br>
The kids interrupted and said, but Dad, she is making this such a "Bleak House" we can <br>
hardly stand it! You have to do something and send her to "St. Elsewhere".<br>
<br>
No, he said, this will have to become the "Life As We Know It" until she gets her first Bingo <br>
word. Since this is a "Family Affair," let's keep this "All in the Family" and not spread <br>
rumors by being a "Gossip Girl" about your mother.<br>
<br>
The non-letterboxing kids just shook their heads and told him, you both need to "Get A <br>
Life."<br>
