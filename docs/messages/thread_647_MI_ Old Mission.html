                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, thanks for the report on the Old Mission Lighthouse box!  Yes, that<br/>
geocache...  I keep hoping it will go away, disappear or something.  It has<br/>
been there since a couple of weeks after the box was placed -- about every<br/>
second entry in the online geocache log indicates that they also found the<br/>
letterbox.  They have both survived for about 2 years now, so I guess I<br/>
shouldn't be too concerned (?).<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting that several of my letterboxes along the lakeshore areas<br/>
have geocaches practically right on top of them -- it just seems so<br/>
coincidental that with all the open space we have along the lakeshore, they<br/>
end up within feet of each other.  I know the Point Betsie Lighthouse box is<br/>
regularly found by cachers also.  I actually have about 12 geocaches that I<br/>
watch that are within feet of my letterboxes and are often found by cachers.<br/>
It is a nice way to keep tabs on the letterboxes when I don't hear from<br/>
letterboxers who find them.  There is one letterbox that has had about twice<br/>
as many cachers as letterboxers -- they have a system in the logbook -- <br/>
cachers sign in from the back and letterboxers sign in from the front.  The<br/>
geocache isn't even at that place anymore and there is still a steady stream<br/>
of cachers that find the letterbox looking for the [now non-existent]<br/>
geocache.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will be up to Mission Point in a couple of weeks so I will plan to<br/>
bring up a new log book for the box then.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did some Labor Day weekend boxing as well up near TC.  I'm glad the <br/>
Jackie's Beanstalk HH was picked up so quickly.  Archie Park is a <br/>
pretty cool stamp (and the logbook is pretty full - we had to start <br/>
back at the beginning on the back of a page to stamp in it).<br/>
<br/>
Fun story about Old Mission Peninsula LB...My friend and I found the <br/>
spot alright, but it was empty.  We could clearly see where the box <br/>
had been, and with a bit of disappointment we stubbornly poked around <br/>
all the other potential hiding spots.  Grumbling dejectedly, we were <br/>
about to give up when a geocacher brought us back the box, as well as <br/>
a cammo-covered geocache.  We were excited to get the stamp (lovely, <br/>
SpringChick) and took the liberty to create a new (albiet very close) <br/>
hole for the geocache.  <br/>
<br/>
We also tried our hardest to find the Old Mission-45th Parallel box, <br/>
with no luck.  I'm glad to know it's out there, and kinda bummed that <br/>
I didn't stumble upon it.<br/>
<br/>
My letterboxing weekend also included Roaming Jolly Roger (neat <br/>
stamp, Bindle Babe!), Shrine of the Pines, Interlochen (talking about <br/>
searching all available rotting stumps before actually finding it!), <br/>
Serendipity (lovely...I'm glad I really examined the clues before I <br/>
left home, or I would have been in for a big disappointment), and <br/>
Point Betsie (Esperanza's box).  The sun had already set when we got <br/>
out to Pt Betsie, and after a good 20 minutes of trying to wedge that <br/>
box out of its hiding spot, it was dusk.  We tried for SpringChick's <br/>
Pt Betsie box afterwards, and I'm pretty sure we were in the right <br/>
spot, but we had no flashlight and were ultimately unsuccessful <br/>
feeling around in the dark for this box.  Oh well, some other time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had a relaxing weekend.  <br/>
Peace, Keltic Kara<br/>

<br/>
I laughed at your comment about searching every stump in the woods <br/>
for the Interlochen box.  I felt the same way on that one!<br/>
<br/>
I will check on the Point Betsie boxes also.  There is a geocache <br/>
very near Esperanza's box there so I hear frequently on that one, <br/>
but have not heard anything on my box there in some time now.<br/>
<br/>
I was also happy to hear that you got the Serendipity box!<br/>
