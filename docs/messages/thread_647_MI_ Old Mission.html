today, before the weather turned foul. We headed up to<br>
the Old Mission Peninsula and found:<br>
<br>
Old Mission<br>
Old Mission Lighthouse<br>
Archie Park<br>
<br>
All are in great shape! Old Mission Lighthouse is VERY<br>
near a Geocache, so the logbook is nearly full with<br>
entries (there are about 5 pages left.) Old Mission<br>
was a tough, but extremely good find. We second<br>
guessed ourselves and ended up coming back to the spot<br>
we thought it was all along. Archie Park has the<br>
cutest stamp!<br>
<br>
We attempted Leland Fishtown, but it was rather dark<br>
and it seems that the location where the box once was<br>
is now part of private property and sort of fenced<br>
off. Didn't get to the Sleeping Bear Dunes, as we were<br>
too busy loafing around Lake Leelenau and Fishtown. I<br>
did get to pick up a fabulous new pair of Tevas and<br>
threw away my old stinky hiking sandals. My feet are<br>
happy! <br>
<br>
Also, picked up Jackie's Beanstalk HH at Archie<br>
Park...and it has left MI...for points unknown. Maybe<br>
a rest at that fancy schmancy Hoosier Hostel will do<br>
it good, but who knows where it'll end up....<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, thanks for the report on the Old Mission Lighthouse box!  Yes, that<br>
geocache...  I keep hoping it will go away, disappear or something.  It has<br>
been there since a couple of weeks after the box was placed -- about every<br>
second entry in the online geocache log indicates that they also found the<br>
letterbox.  They have both survived for about 2 years now, so I guess I<br>
shouldn't be too concerned (?).<br>
<br>
It is interesting that several of my letterboxes along the lakeshore areas<br>
have geocaches practically right on top of them -- it just seems so<br>
coincidental that with all the open space we have along the lakeshore, they<br>
end up within feet of each other.  I know the Point Betsie Lighthouse box is<br>
regularly found by cachers also.  I actually have about 12 geocaches that I<br>
watch that are within feet of my letterboxes and are often found by cachers.<br>
It is a nice way to keep tabs on the letterboxes when I don't hear from<br>
letterboxers who find them.  There is one letterbox that has had about twice<br>
as many cachers as letterboxers -- they have a system in the logbook -- <br>
cachers sign in from the back and letterboxers sign in from the front.  The<br>
geocache isn't even at that place anymore and there is still a steady stream<br>
of cachers that find the letterbox looking for the [now non-existent]<br>
geocache.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I will be up to Mission Point in a couple of weeks so I will plan to<br>
bring up a new log book for the box then.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did some Labor Day weekend boxing as well up near TC.  I'm glad the <br>
Jackie's Beanstalk HH was picked up so quickly.  Archie Park is a <br>
pretty cool stamp (and the logbook is pretty full - we had to start <br>
back at the beginning on the back of a page to stamp in it).<br>
<br>
Fun story about Old Mission Peninsula LB...My friend and I found the <br>
spot alright, but it was empty.  We could clearly see where the box <br>
had been, and with a bit of disappointment we stubbornly poked around <br>
all the other potential hiding spots.  Grumbling dejectedly, we were <br>
about to give up when a geocacher brought us back the box, as well as <br>
a cammo-covered geocache.  We were excited to get the stamp (lovely, <br>
SpringChick) and took the liberty to create a new (albiet very close) <br>
hole for the geocache.  <br>
<br>
We also tried our hardest to find the Old Mission-45th Parallel box, <br>
with no luck.  I'm glad to know it's out there, and kinda bummed that <br>
I didn't stumble upon it.<br>
<br>
My letterboxing weekend also included Roaming Jolly Roger (neat <br>
stamp, Bindle Babe!), Shrine of the Pines, Interlochen (talking about <br>
searching all available rotting stumps before actually finding it!), <br>
Serendipity (lovely...I'm glad I really examined the clues before I <br>
left home, or I would have been in for a big disappointment), and <br>
Point Betsie (Esperanza's box).  The sun had already set when we got <br>
out to Pt Betsie, and after a good 20 minutes of trying to wedge that <br>
box out of its hiding spot, it was dusk.  We tried for SpringChick's <br>
Pt Betsie box afterwards, and I'm pretty sure we were in the right <br>
spot, but we had no flashlight and were ultimately unsuccessful <br>
feeling around in the dark for this box.  Oh well, some other time.<br>
<br>
Hope everyone had a relaxing weekend.  <br>
Peace, Keltic Kara<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the box update Keltic Kara!  I will check with the placer <br>
of Archie and see if she would like me to replace the log book in <br>
that one also, as long as I will be up there (she lives out of <br>
state).<br>
<br>
I laughed at your comment about searching every stump in the woods <br>
for the Interlochen box.  I felt the same way on that one!<br>
<br>
I will check on the Point Betsie boxes also.  There is a geocache <br>
very near Esperanza's box there so I hear frequently on that one, <br>
but have not heard anything on my box there in some time now.<br>
<br>
I was also happy to hear that you got the Serendipity box!<br>
<br>
Sounds like a great weekend!<br>
