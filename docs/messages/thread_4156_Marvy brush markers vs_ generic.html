My local Hobby Lobby carries them for $16.99 so I headed there. <br/>
However, prominently displayed on the end cap was "Hobby Lobby Brush <br/>
Pens" for $1.99! After some deliberation I decided to spend the extra <br/>
$15 and go with the tried and true. The others did not mention anything <br/>
about being archival safe/acid free. Has anyone tried these? How <br/>
important is it to use archival safe/acid free? I didn't one to be <br/>
responsible for ruining anyone's logbook!<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
We use markers out on the trail all the time.  There are so many great <br/>
stamps out there that we really want to do them justice by using color <br/>
when it enhances the image.  We carry 3 different sets of Marvy <br/>
markers - the Primary, Pastel and Garden.... and I have to admit I <br/>
just ordered the Garden set also.  If a stamp is dirty, we simply <br/>
clean it with a wet napkin before coloring it with our markers.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are some stamps that seem best with a single color, so <br/>
we also carry black, green, blue and red standard size inkpads and <br/>
a "palette" of small inkpads that can be removed from a row and used <br/>
individually.<br/>
<br/>
In the Milwaukee, WI area the Michael's craft stores and Joann Fabric <br/>
stores often have 40% or 50% off coupons.  That's when we buy our ink <br/>
supplies!  However we have found that the Marvey Markers last a long <br/>
time - we have stamped a lot of stamps and are still using some of our <br/>
original markers from over 3 years ago - so they are worth the <br/>
investment!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also love the Marvy Markers.  I started with the LePlume II dual-tipped<br/>
markers, 2 sets - primary and Victorian.  I just bought the fatter brush<br/>
markers in both sets.  I hardly ever used the writing end, so I wouldn't<br/>
recommend them over the fat brush type, which inks up much faster.  My<br/>
markers are still going strong AND I've managed not to lose a single one.<br/>
<br/>
If I could only afford one set, I would choose the Victorian colors.  They<br/>
seem more woodsy to me.  But then again, I'm in love with the Arts and<br/>
Crafts Movement.<br/>
