Anyone a former PZer who now uses something that they like better?<br>

One slab of PZ Kut Grade A for $50.00.  Is that the starting bid?  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I have a couple cherished slabs of Orange Grade B; hard on the eyes, but better than nothing.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Then, I purchased some Grade C, and then some of the Mystery Grade stuff too; but it's not the same as the PZ Kut we crave. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
This isn't fair.  It's like having to go cold turkey.  We need our PZ Kut!!!  It's hard to go back when you've used the best there is.  <br>
