<br/>
Regarding ticks, my sister has Lyme Disease.  You can never be too vigilant.  Unfortunately, my sister didn't know about the bulleye rash, flu like symptoms, and all of that.  She's not a letterboxer, but she is a hiker in Washington state, where supposedly the ticks aren't like they are here in the midwest.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a tick medication for those letterboxing dogs as well.  (We have The Midnight Pug.)<br/>
<br/>
So, keep that eagle eye out for the ticks and the letterboxes!<br/>

<br/>
Just a reminder that with the fall season comes a better chance of <br/>
getting a nasty "hitch hiker" of a different kind! TICKS!<br/>
I had the unfortuante luck of picking up such a critter this past <br/>
weekend while out boxing...and I really didn't do that much <br/>
bushwhacking to merit such a beast!<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Tonto noticed it before I was sucked dry! But, he makes <br/>
a much better letterbox finder than a tick extractor...as a result of <br/>
his botched attempt at surgery, I had to go to the doctor to get it <br/>
professionally excised! Not a fun experience!<br/>
<br/>
So, as you enjoy those crisp, autumn days of boxing beware the <br/>
tiny "spoilers"! Give yourself a good examination once you return <br/>
from the trails...also check those letterbox dogs too! These creepy <br/>
crawlers are a real "cootie" you don't want to take home with you!<br/>
<br/>
One hurting Tiptoe...and Tonto<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm having some type of problem<br/>
receiving status updates on my boxes and "contact the placer" messages. I<br/>
know it isn't a global problem since Martini Man is still getting messages<br/>
for his boxes. I've tried several things and have now sent a message to the<br/>
LBNA webmasters to see if they can provide any help.<br/>
<br/>
The last notifications I received were on SEP 26, so if you sent me any<br/>
messages since then I'm sorry to report I didn't receive them. I didn't<br/>
want you to think I'm rude in not replying, so am posting this message on<br/>
the board. If you reported any type of problem with any of my boxes, please<br/>
let me know directly at kotlarek@wi.rr.com<br/>
<br/>
I really miss getting the status updates and messages, so I hope I can get<br/>
this fixed soon!<br/>
<br/>

P.S. Congrats to Cigna Cats - I see they were successful in finding Capone!<br/>
