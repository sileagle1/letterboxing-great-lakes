Anyway, whenever my grandmother and I would come home from the butcher's, he would take the fresh sausage straight to the table (white butcher paper and all) and we would eat it with Ritz Crackers! It was areally yummy snack back then, but I don't think I could eat it now. However, I love kibbe...which is raw lamb mixed with spices and bulgur and I order that whenever I'm in a Lebanese restaurant, so...hmmm....I guess there isn't much difference. :-) It just feels different when you order it up in a restaurant I suppose.<br>
