So I see everyone is as snowbound and bored as I am, eh?  Well, except I'm at work now, sneaking into Yahoo to peek at what you guys are up to.<br>

Well, I myself have been stocking up on carved stamps.  Got a couple done, and a couple more in the works.  Haven't decided what to do with them, but if anyone is bored enough to play a postal game with me... answer the question "What happens when a lagamorph gets ahold of an aromatic organic compound?" and contact me offlist.<br>
