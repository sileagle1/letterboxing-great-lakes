And usually if we can't make it in person I try to send a box on our behalf, but I just lost track of time this year and completely forgot about creating a box until it was too late.  And I so wanted to do one on behalf of us English majors and the Partnership of English Majors (check out some Garrison Keillor if you're unfamiliar with the organization ;).  What I found most amusing about the Partnership of English Majors is that in college, my friends (also English majors and minors) and I decided we would create The Organization for the Preservation of English Majors and Minors, where the plan was that one of our fellow English majors would go on to a career making lots of money and would therefore be able to support the rest of us.  However, 10+ years later, no one has gotten that high enough paying job to support the rest of us, too...<br>
<br>
Anyway.  You all have tons of fun, and take lots and lots and lots of pictures to share with the rest of us!<br>
