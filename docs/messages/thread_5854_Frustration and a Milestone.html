                    <div class="plaintext-content">Trying to find a mystery LB after much work at home on it, I experienced major frustration today.  So, to soothe my LBing soul, I drove across two (technically three) county lines to find some boxes.  When I got home, I realized the last one was my 300th find!   It was the "Have a cookie...or two!" LB by one our newest LBers here in SE WI - Cuppie!  I highly recommend looking for this indoor LB in Rochester.   Frank and Nancy are very chatty.  Next time I want to find out why the code phrase (no secrets revealed here) is "I'm here to meet Zulu Lavendar".  <br/>
