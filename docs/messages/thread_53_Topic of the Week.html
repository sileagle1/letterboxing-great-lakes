better acquainted with one another, and provide ideas and insight on <br/>
pertinent letterboxing topics, I thought I would throw out a "Topic <br/>
of the Week" at the beginning of each week.  I can't guarantee it <br/>
will be on Monday every week, but I will try for within a day on <br/>
either side.<br/>
<br/>
If it is a topic that interests you, please feel free to share your <br/>
thoughts and ideas on the subject.  If it is not something of <br/>
interest to you -- perhaps next week's topic will hit closer to <br/>
home.  Feel free to e-mail me suggestions for future topics.<br/>
