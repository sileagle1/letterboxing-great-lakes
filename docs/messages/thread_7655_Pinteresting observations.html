<br>
Search "Letterbox"...you get letterboxes (as USPS and international versions).  Okay, there are a few shots of children merrily romping through the woods, white sheets of paper in hand, shots of stamps in logbooks, etc.  As a whole though, I think 'boxers are a little more discrete about what they're pinning than 'cachers.<br>
 <br>
Interesting to note what also shows up in the search...SpringChick's LbGLK stamped image from this group's homepage!<br>
