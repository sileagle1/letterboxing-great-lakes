State Park shelters are the best bet -- rental is for the entire day <br/>

state parks, most of them have very limited trails.  The date will <br/>
be Saturday, October 22.  Here is the scoop on the location options:<br/>
<br/>
Yankee Springs Rec Area:  Located just a short distance off U.S. 131 <br/>
between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo -- good central location.  There <br/>
are several miles of prime trails at this park, however there are no <br/>
current letterboxes in this area.  Park is open year-round and the <br/>
shelter is available.  Shelter is roof, cement floor w/ half-walls, <br/>
includes grills and electricity.  Problem:  by October the plumbing <br/>
is turned off so there is no water and the modern restrooms are <br/>
closed.  Nearest outhouses are about 1/4 mile from the shelter.<br/>
<br/>
Hoffmaster SP:  Located at the south end of Muskegon county along <br/>
Lake Michigan -- not as centrally located.  There are also several <br/>
miles of nice trails at this park with a few letterboxes already in <br/>
place and many others in the surrounding area.  Park is open year-<br/>
round and the shelter is available.  Shelter is roof w/ cement <br/>
floor, includes 1 large grill, a hand pump for water and a large <br/>
stone fireplace in the shelter -- there is NO electricity.  No <br/>
modern restrooms in this area of the park, but outhouses are located <br/>
very near the shelter.<br/>
<br/>
Both places have pros and cons.  I have created a poll and will <br/>
leave it open through May 22 (next Sunday).  If you are planning to <br/>
attend the MI fall gathering or even if you are just thinking about <br/>
it, please vote.  Please don't just vote for the location nearest to <br/>
you, rather take everything into consideration when you vote -- <br/>
amenities, facilities, letterbox availability and location.  If you <br/>

others fall through. I really was looking for a location centralized <br/>
to West Michigan, with the extremes being Muskegon/Whitehall on the <br/>

of course anyone is welcome to attend, this was just my target area <br/>
based on those who actively participate on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Yankee Springs fits that bill nicely, being just over an hour from <br/>
any of the extremes mentioned, but the lack of water and nearby <br/>
restrooms worried me a bit, which is why I included the other <br/>
choice.  My feeling was that since the big gathering (GL Gather) is <br/>
in the south of the state, if there is not a suitable centralized <br/>
location for the fall gathering, I would opt for a more northern <br/>
location.<br/>
<br/>
But... if you want to host a get-together down in your area at some <br/>
point, I would be more than happy to make the drive down there ;-)<br/>
