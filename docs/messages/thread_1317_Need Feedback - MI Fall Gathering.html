                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, after checking out various shelters, it is apparent that the <br>
State Park shelters are the best bet -- rental is for the entire day <br>
at a lower cost than 6-hr. blocks at the county and city/township <br>
shelters I checked.  Unfortunately, although W/SW MI has some nice <br>
state parks, most of them have very limited trails.  The date will <br>
be Saturday, October 22.  Here is the scoop on the location options:<br>
<br>
Yankee Springs Rec Area:  Located just a short distance off U.S. 131 <br>
between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo -- good central location.  There <br>
are several miles of prime trails at this park, however there are no <br>
current letterboxes in this area.  Park is open year-round and the <br>
shelter is available.  Shelter is roof, cement floor w/ half-walls, <br>
includes grills and electricity.  Problem:  by October the plumbing <br>
is turned off so there is no water and the modern restrooms are <br>
closed.  Nearest outhouses are about 1/4 mile from the shelter.<br>
<br>
Hoffmaster SP:  Located at the south end of Muskegon county along <br>
Lake Michigan -- not as centrally located.  There are also several <br>
miles of nice trails at this park with a few letterboxes already in <br>
place and many others in the surrounding area.  Park is open year-<br>
round and the shelter is available.  Shelter is roof w/ cement <br>
floor, includes 1 large grill, a hand pump for water and a large <br>
stone fireplace in the shelter -- there is NO electricity.  No <br>
modern restrooms in this area of the park, but outhouses are located <br>
very near the shelter.<br>
<br>
Both places have pros and cons.  I have created a poll and will <br>
leave it open through May 22 (next Sunday).  If you are planning to <br>
attend the MI fall gathering or even if you are just thinking about <br>
it, please vote.  Please don't just vote for the location nearest to <br>
you, rather take everything into consideration when you vote -- <br>
amenities, facilities, letterbox availability and location.  If you <br>
have specific comments or concerns, feel free to post to the list <br>
for discussion or e-mail me privately.<br>

others fall through. I really was looking for a location centralized <br>
to West Michigan, with the extremes being Muskegon/Whitehall on the <br>
North, Lansing area on the East and Battle Creek on the South -- -- <br>
of course anyone is welcome to attend, this was just my target area <br>
based on those who actively participate on this list.<br>
<br>
Yankee Springs fits that bill nicely, being just over an hour from <br>
any of the extremes mentioned, but the lack of water and nearby <br>
restrooms worried me a bit, which is why I included the other <br>
choice.  My feeling was that since the big gathering (GL Gather) is <br>
in the south of the state, if there is not a suitable centralized <br>
location for the fall gathering, I would opt for a more northern <br>
location.<br>
<br>
But... if you want to host a get-together down in your area at some <br>
point, I would be more than happy to make the drive down there ;-)<br>
