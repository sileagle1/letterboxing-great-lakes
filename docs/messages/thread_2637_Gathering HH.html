We saw a HH in the dormouse box I think early on the morning of June 3rd (Saturday), but we did not take it or stamp into it. We were told not to move HHs until Sunday. I do know if this helps any.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... I never heard of a request NOT to move a HH.  Is it some type <br/>
of tradition not to move a HH at a gathering, or was this a personal <br/>
request by someone for their own box?  We certainly have always moved <br/>
them around.  <br/>

There are no dumb questions.<br/>
<br/>
You don't always get a HH back.  But I have seen HH logbooks with a message on the last page which asks the last person stamping into the logbook to contact the creator of the HH.  <br/>
Maybe some HH eventually make it back to the person who launched it.  There's no rule.  The best thing to do is to make your intentions clear.  <br/>
<br/>
The first HH I launched stayed in the same place for several months.  A number of people found it, but they choose not to take it and relocate it.  Until one day, someone notified me that the stamp had been cracked in half.  I was surprised that the HH was still in the same box that I launched it from.  <br/>

I have a stamp I bought that looks like my Sarah kitty-- I would love for  <br/>
her to travel a bit and then come home.  I am taking her to Round Island  and <br/>
hoping to find the box there and stamp it with her stamp and mine since she  <br/>
will remain there by the lighthouse-- then have her stamp travel a bit.  I  had <br/>
promised to take her on my trip with me this summer but she died before  that <br/>
was possible.  I would want to have her stamp back in the end.<br/>

Because this stamp looks like your Sarah kitty, you just have to be prepared for the fact that some Hitchhikers travel around and may not make it back to you.  Think about that before you send this stamp on its way as a HH.  If you want the HH to make the rounds and return to you, label the logbook and be specific.  Return by: (a date) or Return: (when the last page in the logbook is stamped)  Most letterboxers will understand if you spell out your intentions.  But there is always the chance that it could be lost.  <br/>
