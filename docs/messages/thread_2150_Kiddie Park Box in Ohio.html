                    <div class="plaintext-content">So December 31st I convinced Deedle that we needed to<br/>
do one more letterbox hunt for 2005, esp. since there<br/>
was a box planted about 4 miles down the road from us<br/>
that we hadn't gotten to search for yet (I know, this<br/>
post is a little stale now, but last week I was too<br/>
busy trying to figure out how much alcohol we need to<br/>
buy for our wedding reception).  And Letterboxing Law,<br/>
just as we found the spot we thought we were supposed<br/>
to start searching in, someone else shows up!  Holding<br/>
what looks like a sheet of paper in their hand...<br/>
<br/>
Well, since we weren't budging (taking photos of the<br/>
creek to stall) and he wasn't really leaving, we<br/>
decided to relocate and observe from afar.  And sure<br/>
enough, he ended up going to the spot we had been at. <br/>
But then he came back, and went to another spot along<br/>
the creek...and then went back to the first part. <br/>
Then he pulled out his cell phone and was talking -<br/>
which made us wonder, if he was really a letterboxer,<br/>
did he know the placer and was calling to complain<br/>
that he couldn't find the box?  Or was he looking for<br/>
something else that just happened to be where we<br/>
needed to be?<br/>
<br/>
He finally left, and we went back to our search - and<br/>
couldn't find anything.  We went to another part (the<br/>
same part the mystery man had gone to, also, after he<br/>
left our original spot) and again couldn't find<br/>
anything, even though we poked in all the hiding spots<br/>
that matched the clue's discription.  How<br/>
disheartening... maybe the box got swept away, since<br/>
it was close to the creek?  Or maybe it's really just<br/>
hidden THAT WELL, since we noticed on LbNA that<br/>
someone found it November 12, but someone else tried<br/>
and couldn't find it November 11...<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else searched for Kiddie Park in Brooklyn,<br/>
Ohio yet and if so, I'm interested in hearing what you<br/>
findings were...<br/>
