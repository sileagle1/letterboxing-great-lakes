Coffee Beans and Atom 118<br>
invite you to spend an afternoon with friends<br>
(while getting your fingers all inky of course)<br>
at the Letterboxing Wedding event on<br>
Saturday, November 10th, 2007<br>
from 12 o'clock until 4 o'clock in the afternoon<br>
at Pulaski Park in Chicago.<br>
<br>
RSVP on the event's page on AQ.<br>
<br>
This "reception" is a potluck, so let us know what (if any) <br>
dish/beverage you could bring to share and we'll add a list to the AQ <br>
page.  Also, feel free to sign up for a wedding-related stamp that you <br>
wish to carve and share with the rest of us.  This event is going to be <br>
indoors, but we're also thinking about hiding a few outdoor urban boxes <br>
for people to find that day.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you there,<br>
(the-soon-to-be) Atomic Beans<br>

I was happy to see the NOV 10 date (I had it on my calendar as NOV 18, <br>
which wasn't going to work out for us.)<br>
<br>
We'll get thinking about stamps to carve and food....<br>

I would love to come to this event. :) I feel a special connection<br>
with you guys. Not only do I seem to always log into logbooks -after-<br>
you... but we're all engaged! I will bring my "Love" stamp (that is<br>
currently out as a postal letterbox in honor of my own engagement). <br>
<br>
It's a bummer, but my betrothed is a muggle. I may drag along one of<br>
my boxing buddies. :)<br>
<br>
LG.<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
It's very funny, in an immature way, to think of what kind of coffee<br>
atomic beans would produce.<br>
