I have a pretty awesome letterbox story that involves checking on some of my<br/>
boxes. While I was driving out past a certain unnamed pioneer cemetery in<br/>
Ionia County (has to be unnamed since my box is a mystery)to check the<br/>
status of some boxes of mine. I noticed that the large tree where my box was<br/>
stashed was GONE and that the headstones dating from the 1840's to 1880's<br/>
were being restored. I w3as thinking that my intricate stamp was missing but<br/>
decided to check out the stones anyhow (because I love this location).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I noticed that behind two headstones that were being restored and<br/>
propped up against another were concealing my box...intact and with a note<br/>
and phone number to call. Well, I called and come to find out that the woman<br/>
was an ancestor of the man that I carved the stamp about (The Lord's Anchor<br/>
box...in case you're wondering).<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, she was delighted about the box and we chatted a<br/>
bit about letterboxing and the history of this cemetery (again, I can't tell<br/>
you the name or location or it may give the box away). By the end of the<br/>
conversation, she asked if I would replace the box. I said yes. And....4<br/>

I love cemetery boxes, and cemeteries in general. I am getting ready to<br/>
plant a series in the cemeteries in the county I live in. There are 80<br/>
of them! Not all will I be able to plant in. I have spent the past 6<br/>
months researching them and visiting each one taking pictures of unique<br/>
features for carving. It's been fantastic! <br/>

Forget the BINGO, buddy!  But, your experience really is a great story!  You can't get better than that!  It underlines the fact that you can never really predict what path, what person, or what place letterboxing will take you next - a real adventure that has no end....<br/>
