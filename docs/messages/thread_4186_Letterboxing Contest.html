I would pull the clues and/or actual boxes for a while.<br>
<br>
If you can figure out who the organizer of this event is, I'd contact <br>
them and explain some of the stealth/secrecy issues involved and <br>
point out that this isn't a great way to treat other people's <br>
boxes.  If they want to have this type of contest with boxes they <br>
planted, go for it.  But they shouldn't be doing it with others boxes <br>
without consent.<br>
<br>
Also, I would post a note to this board (or whatever local board <br>
applies) to notify other planters in your area that this is going on <br>
and their boxes may be in danger.<br>

I once pulled the clue to one of my boxes in the past when it's <br>
lifespan was threatened by a curious newspaper reporter who wanted to <br>
do a story on letterboxing. Since my box was only one of a few in the <br>
area, and since the area was far from where I live, making <br>
maintenance difficult, I wasn't at all happy at the prospect of <br>
dozens of people trying out the hobby for the first time on my box.<br>
<br>
A couple of months later, when I was sure that the proposed article <br>
wouldn't be materializing, I restored the clue.<br>
