I have a dilemma. I recently found out that a group from a nearby town<br/>
is having a letterboxing contest. I have a feeling that my recently<br/>
planted boxes are being found by whole groups (quite large) and at<br/>
least one box location has been compromised. Any suggestions?<br/>

point out that this isn't a great way to treat other people's <br/>

 &gt; Hey all!<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; I have a dilemma. I recently found out that a group from a nearby town<br/>
 &gt; is having a letterboxing contest. I have a feeling that my recently<br/>
 &gt; planted boxes are being found by whole groups (quite large) and at<br/>
 &gt; least one box location has been compromised. Any suggestions?<br/>

I once pulled the clue to one of my boxes in the past when it's <br/>
lifespan was threatened by a curious newspaper reporter who wanted to <br/>
do a story on letterboxing. Since my box was only one of a few in the <br/>
area, and since the area was far from where I live, making <br/>
maintenance difficult, I wasn't at all happy at the prospect of <br/>
dozens of people trying out the hobby for the first time on my box.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of months later, when I was sure that the proposed article <br/>
wouldn't be materializing, I restored the clue.<br/>

&gt;One option is to temporarily pull the clues from whatever sites you use.<br/>
&gt;It's a somewhat drastic measure but it may be the only way to protect<br/>
&gt;the investment *you* have made in time and energy in creating the boxes.<br/>
