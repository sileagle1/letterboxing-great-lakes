<br/>
As the temporary ringmaster of Boch's Traveling Circus, I am pleased <br/>
to announce that our circus is looking for new acts. If you feel that <br/>
you would like to send an act with this traveling circo, please <br/>
contact me offlist at your earliest convenience. <br/>
<br/>
Time is of the essence, as we leave our springtime home in <br/>
Kensingtonia in mid June to arrive at your wonderful assembly of <br/>
boxers of letters on 18 June. Sorry for the lateness of this request, <br/>
but I have just received a telegram from Phineas Boch, owner and <br/>
ringmaster of this wonderful troup, giving his permission for any new <br/>
acts that meet our high standards of performing and entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
Contact me offlist with your act or any questions. And - welcome to <br/>
the circus!<br/>
<br/>
Until we meet next month,  <br/>
<br/>
Marco Peperini<br/>
Owner, Pinecone Traveling Circo<br/>
Temporary Ringmaster, Boch's Traveling Circus<br/>
<br/>
