great big THANKS to you all!  I never would have attempted this <br/>
carving wihtout the confidence I gained from the tips I wrote down as <br/>
you spoke,  so THANKS!<br/>
<br/>
Though I'm not familiar with sci-fi, I took up one of Aimless' ideas <br/>
and looked up books by Wisconsin native Clifford Simak.  I'm doing <br/>
the cover of Strangers in the Universe (Berkley Medallion edition) - <br/>
lots of lines and a water color look.  So, the stamp can be inked <br/>
with black, then colored in with pencils if desired.  If the box is <br/>
not needed for Boxacon in October, I could make a trip to Simak's <br/>
hometown (Millville) to plant it.<br/>
<br/>
I SO wish I'd known these carving tips when I first started - those <br/>
of you who have seen the "Magic School Hops Home" in the Parade Books <br/>
know what I'm talking about - SHUDDER.  I'm leaving it out there, but <br/>
every once in a while the urge to recarve comes up, KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
Carving, getting boxes together, planting and FINDING LB's sure is a <br/>
great way to deal with stress.............I sure am glad I discovered <br/>
letterboxing!<br/>

Lock's workshop inspired me too.  I have several stamps ready to be placed in new boxes, if this snow will ever stop falling.  But I look at them and think...I could do those a bit better now after Lock's workshop...or at least I feel more confident now. But I'll place those new boxes anyway.  <br/>

I love to go letterboxing, but tonight I'm doing my couch potato routine.  I'm totally absorbed in watching the 3 DVD set of The McCartney Years.  Sing to me Paul!  <br/>
