Winter in the greater Chicago area is hard on us. S.I.L.O. is just an excuse to get together and get our fingers inky.  By sitting togther, we learn more about the hobby Lots of examples. So much creative flow in the room.  <br>

Thanks to everyone who pitched in to help out, especially Fungus Woman for running the door prize giveaway and to Jabber, FW, WI HI, and others (I know I'm forgetting people) for donating prizes.<br>
<br>
Thanks to musicpals for helping at the check in table. <br>
<br>
Thanks to the experienced boxers who spent time explaining letterboxing to the newer boxers.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to the kids who come and hopefully have a good time each year because they are the future generation of letterboxing.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who carved a stamp especially Fungus Woman for creating the official event stamp.  What a great design!!!  If there weren't stamps, no one would come.  LOL  But the event boxes were truly inspiring and I heard that comment often.  There were sooooo many different types of event boxes in different containers.  The logbooks were unique.  People went home inspired.  This is a good thing.  <br>
<br>
Thank you Dragon for bringing your beer bottle letterbox. Cracks me up! You are someone who has been boxing for a long time and I have always admired.    <br>

SLLO 7 was just FUN because midwest letterboxers are just fun loving, creative folks. It was great to meet some folks for the first time too.  <br>
