nose and sore throat. Yesterday I felt like my sinuses were all <br>
stuffed up as well and I had a really bad headache. So what did I <br>

Yeah, that sounds like the perfect plan!<br>
<br>
If you have found the boxes placed there by Wisconsin Hiker, you know <br>
what the trail is like to get to the boxes. Well, combine my cold and <br>
already-feeling-nastiness with the steep climb and you get trouble.<br>
<br>
I hadn't even made it to the first landmark in one of the clues, <br>
about 50 to 100 feet up a bluff, when I started feeling sick. I <br>
stopped to stretch my legs and started seeing nothing but white. I <br>
quickly sat down on one of the rocks so that if I passed out, I <br>
wouldn't go tumbling down the steps. While I sat there I felt like I <br>
had to throw up, but tried my hardest not to because there was this <br>
beautiful yellow caterpillar crawling on the rocks and I didn't want <br>
to kill it with my breakfast. (You know I'm sick when I can't even <br>
take a picture of the thing.)<br>
<br>
I had to of sat there for 10 to 15 minutes, talking with my dad, <br>
before I could get back up and go on. I was really upset that I was <br>
now going back down the bluff trail and missing out on not one, but <br>
three letterboxes, but that was better than going on and becoming <br>
worse. I am stubborn, though, and still wish I would have pushed <br>
myself to keep going. ;) By that time, I probably looked like I made <br>
the trek twice!<br>
<br>
Still feeling sick, but determined, we went to find the Man Mound <br>
letterbox location. I figured that it would be a lot easier on me, <br>
with the paces being in the double-digits and all. I was right. I <br>
found that one in good shape. It made me feel a lot better to have <br>
found one letterbox.<br>
<br>
I suppose I've learned my lesson. If I'm sick to begin with and feel <br>
like I'm going to yak just being in the car, I probably shouldn't be <br>
climbing the bluffs (or even small hills). I will be back, <br>
though...those letterboxes will not go unfound by me again. After <br>
all, I bought some Devil's Lake patches to add to one of my <br>
letterboxing bags. If I don't find the boxes, the patches will taunt <br>
me forever.<br>

Shutterfly - who has climbed the bluffs many times before (even while <br>
being ill once) and had no troubles...lol<br>

 ===============<br>
<br>
Oh, I'm sorry you couldn't do the hike!  We were pretty tired ourselves when<br>
we planted the boxes since we had been boxing in Mirror Lake in the morning<br>
and then spent 4-5 hours at Noah's Ark waterpark. It was a scorcher of a day<br>
and it was still amazingly hot & humid 5pm - 8 pm when we planted the boxes.<br>
Our niece (12) and nephew (9) were real troopers to keep going all the way<br>
around the lake on those bluff trails after such a busy & tiring day.  They<br>
were daunted by the distance at first, but by the time we got halfway around<br>
(and soaked our heads and refilled water bottles) they got their second wind<br>
and clambered up the Balanced Rock trail like mountain goats.  When we<br>
finally finished it was getting darker, but we enjoyed a quick swim in the<br>
lake before changing and heading across the ferry and finding the "I Believe<br>
in Ferries" box on the way home.<br>
<br>
I only know of one finder so far for the Devil's Lake boxes.  They did one<br>
box one day and a 2nd box the next day, but didn't have time to find the<br>
3rd.  Hot summer days are probably not the best for this hike!<br>
<br>
Hope you're feeling better soon...<br>
