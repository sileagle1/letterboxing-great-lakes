Tell me about it!  It's been 2 weeks since my last 2 words (back to <br/>
back!) and 2 weeks before that was my 3rd from last word.  It's <br/>
almost depressing to open my bingo mail in the morning.  LOL<br/>

Hello, lovely Miss Wisconsin Hiker, are you bored?  Interested in <br/>
doing any more stats about %'s of word types called?  No big deal if <br/>
you don't have the time or inclination right now!  Just curious if <br/>
I'm doing as terribly as it feels like I am.<br/>

77 words have been called (64% if total words)  So on average you should have 16 crossed off on your cards.<br/>
On average, each of the categories should also have 64%, but here's the actual:<br/>
Letterboxes - 73%<br/>
Trailnames - 63%<br/>
Events - 62%<br/>
General Term - 54% (so you're right, they are undercalled at the moment!)<br/>

Thanks, WH!  It is as bad as I thought!  I only have 12 words!  Good <br/>
to know I am just as unlucky at Letterboxing Bingo as I am at regular <br/>
bingo.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Here's hoping for  abig surge of general terms!<br/>
