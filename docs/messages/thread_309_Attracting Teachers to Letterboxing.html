Sitting here catching up on the thread news.....after our first placement of <br/>
a letterbox....we realized that we, too, are both teachers or were..... <br/>
Lipstick Chick taught elementary school and I, Dumpster Diva, taught art!<br/>
Wonder what profound collection of occupations we have here in this group <br/>
now?  Anyone else want to divulge?   Lipstick Chick is a SAHM and pastor's wife.<br/>
( Please delete that losing our virginity remark)<br/>
I, Dumpster Diva, own a rubber stamp store here in Rockford, IL called The <br/>
Goose Barn.  Trying to get customers turned on to letterboxing but so far..... <br/>
MEGO is all I get....but I will press on!<br/>
<br/>
Hallelujah and pass the wine!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well.. I started out as a History major, and though I loved it, I feared it<br/>
was a one way ticket to a career flipping burgers.  I got a degree in<br/>
Dietetics, but after 6 yrs of that ended up teaching swimming and being an<br/>
ESL aide at a local school.  This experience propelled me to where I am<br/>
now...a homeschool mom.  Now I can do it all...just, well, nobody pays me...<br/>

My mind is already smoking thinking of ways to incorporate <br/>
letterboxing in my classroom. I can't wait!<br/>
