Well know youre starting to adapt the first time the words, "big ol" slip out of your mouth. Thats how you northerners usually begin using the softest English. Yep, when Delirium says, "Thats a big ol letterbox" or "Thats a big ol list of clues" well know.KY coon dog &gt; Well, it's official. My husband, who works for<br/>
&gt; Ford, went and got us transfered. And to *Memphis*<br/>
&gt; of all places. Memphis, as in "hey y'all, how all<br/>
&gt; y'alls doin' I reckon you're fixin' to have some<br/>
&gt; sweet tea" Memphis. (Unless there's a Memphis,<br/>
&gt; Michigan, in which case I have NO idea what's going<br/>
&gt; on)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This presents a multitude of difficulties, some of<br/>
&gt; which I'll list below for your email amusement (hey,<br/>
&gt; it's not you being shipped off down south, you might<br/>
&gt; as well get a good chuckle)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; difficulty one: My husband is leaving in ten days. <br/>
&gt; I'm not leaving until Christmas break. This means<br/>
&gt; that it's me who gets to fix the house, clean the<br/>
&gt; house, get the house up on the market and get it<br/>
&gt; sold, all before December 21st. No biggie.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; difficulty two: I've never moved in my life. Well,<br/>
&gt; there were those exile years I spent up in Lansing<br/>
&gt; during college, but other than that, I'm SE<br/>
&gt; Michigan, born and bred. And I'm *moving*?? Did I<br/>
&gt; mention that I'm moving to **MEMPHIS**?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; difficulty three: I have to find a new hair<br/>
&gt; stylist! This fact alone might make me stay if I<br/>
&gt; dwell on it too long. I went to school with my<br/>
&gt; stylist! She stole my sixth grade boyfriend from<br/>
&gt; me! She's the only one in the world who knows just<br/>
&gt; how long to leave the highlights in! I can't leave<br/>
&gt; her! Maybe she'll move down to Memphis with me....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; but the BIGGEST problem is this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go look at how many boxes there are in the Memphis<br/>
&gt; area. Go ahead- look. And I'll even broaden the<br/>
&gt; field for you, since we're looking for houses across<br/>
&gt; the border in Mississippi...I'll wait...you go look.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Grim right? THREE BOXES! And my mother-in-law<br/>
&gt; placed one-third of them. So there we are. I'm<br/>
&gt; leaving the only home I've ever known, to go across<br/>
&gt; three states, one time zone, and a whole culture,<br/>
&gt; only to settle in a landscape barren of letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But, there's a silver lining in this ugly, ugly<br/>
&gt; cloud- I'm taking all but two of my boxes with me<br/>
&gt; (my apologies to Team Taco, who went searching for<br/>
&gt; one of my boxes I'd pulled for this reason and<br/>
&gt; hadn't warned about) and planting them down south. <br/>
&gt; I'll be the foremost letterboxing presence in the<br/>
&gt; greater Memphis area. All will fear me! I will<br/>
&gt; rule by madness and tyrany! All will bow down<br/>
&gt; before my- well, you get the point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, the rest of my boxes will be pulled in the next<br/>
&gt; month or so, with the exception of "Kensington<br/>
&gt; Haiku" and my new box, carved just for the<br/>
&gt; occaision- "So Long Michigan, '75-'05". Team Rabbit<br/>
&gt; has generously agreed to not only adopt those boxes,<br/>
&gt; but also take over planning for next year's<br/>
&gt; Gathering- which I will be at, come hell or high<br/>
&gt; water. And I WON'T be sporting a new southern<br/>
&gt; accent. But I might be sporting some extra pounds<br/>
&gt; if there's a Waffle House anywhere near me. *grin*<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
