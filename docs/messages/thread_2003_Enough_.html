It's dropped as far as I'm concerned. Would you like me to go back and<br/>
delete my long-winded reply post?<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>

Bindle Babe:  We met you at the Haunted Gathering and thought you <br/>
seemed nice.  It turns out we were wrong, you aren't just nice--you <br/>
are also a real hoot!!  Your passion and humor have us contemplating a <br/>
trip to search out your boxes.  Your posts were well thought out and <br/>
civil, it's ashame you were being attacked for having an opinion.<br/>
