<br>
Our family has been letterboxing for a couple months.  We've found and <br>
transported quite a few hitchhikers.  A couple weeks ago when we were <br>
letterboxing in northern Michigan we picked up a hitchhiker with no <br>
log.  It was simply a stamp in a Hefty OneZip freezer bag.  We scanned <br>
the area and didn't find any remnants of a log.  On the wood backing of <br>
the stamp is written in pen:  "Brotherhood" HH<br>
<br>
I've been looking for an owner to let them know it was found and to ask <br>
about replacing the missing log book.  So far I haven't been successful <br>
in identifying the owner or any information about this hitchhiker.<br>
<br>
* Is it ok to have a hitchhiker without a log book?<br>
* Does the owner of this hitchhiker happen to belong to this list?<br>
* Have other people come across this particular hitchhiker and perhaps <br>
know more information about it?<br>
* Should I create a logbook and send it along without contacting the owner?<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help!<br>
