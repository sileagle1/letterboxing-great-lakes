<br/>
Is there a pizza delivery place near the park?  Pizza would be fine, <br/>
but we're also OK with bringing something for a potluck.  We've <br/>
attended several gatherings where we've come from a long distance.  <br/>
There are usually some decent stores/bakeries/delis in the area where <br/>
we can pickup something interesting to bring along to the event.  <br/>
Although one time for an event on the east coast we did bring <br/>
Wisconsin cheese curds on the plane with us based on a special request!<br/>

like there are nearly 90 people already registered for the event and I <br/>
suspect there may be a bunch more signing up in the next 5 months.....<br/>
