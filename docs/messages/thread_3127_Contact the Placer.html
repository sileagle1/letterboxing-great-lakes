who use it.  This weekend I got reports on 5 boxes AND someone took <br>
the time to send me a message about finding one of my hitchhikers in <br>
Pennsylvania.  I really appreciate getting these reports since it lets <br>
me know that my boxes are still in place and whether they need any <br>
attention.  It is also fun to hear the reactions to the location, <br>
stamp or overall experience.<br>

Thanks to all of you that take the time to do this!!<br>

Personally.......in my opinion.........and it may be MY opinion<br>

<br>
I think it's kinda polite, if a placer has requested in the clues to be<br>

a short, one sentence email saying something like "Hey, thanks for getting<br>
in touch about my box!"<br>
<br>
We're battin' zero so far this year.  And I'm only talking placers who<br>
actually mention in their clues that they'd like to be contacted.  (I<br>
realize that the 'Contact the Placer' button is there whether a placer wants<br>
it used or not.)  But when a placer has requested contact, it can just kinda<br>
make a person feel as if they're sending a message out into a big black void<br>
when there's never an acknowledgement.<br>
<br>
I know some folks only check their email once in a blue moon and that<br>
placers can be off on vacation themselves or what not..........but I'm<br>
talking this is going all the way back to January of this year.<br>
<br>
I've been reconsidering whether to bother taking the time to do it anymore.<br>

I agree!  I've had 3 notices this week that just are the generic <br>
found message, no notes.  It's such a let down to me!  I really want <br>
to know what people thought of the place, box, etc.<br>
<br>
I wish more people would add notes to their found notifications.<br>

I agree with you, too, Mosey.  Generally, I reply to messages I <br>
get.  Sometimes I even reply to the found notices with no <br>
notes.  But, I almost never get replies from my notes that I send to <br>
placers.  Even just a "Thanks" would be nice.<br>

We almost always send a message after finding a box (unless we've talked to the  planter "in person" ).  I'd say that we get an acknowledgement at least 75% of the time.<br>

Since this was a current topic of discussion, I kept track of the <br>
Contact the Placer messages we sent last night (for boxes we found in <br>
PA & NJ over the long weekend).  We contacted 15 different placers and <br>
10 have responded within 24 hours or less.  That's 67%.  I expect <br>
we'll get a few more acknowlegements over the next week.<br>

 I know I'm a few days behind here, but i'd like to comment on<br>
contacting placers- i think its a nice thing to do - it lets the<br>
placer know the box is ok. and who knows? it may start a friendship!<br>
i always try to leave a message when i find a box- it just seems the<br>
correct thing to do....gemgirl65<br>
