                    <div class="plaintext-content">Woo Hoo!  I just love the "Contact the Placer" feature and the people <br/>
who use it.  This weekend I got reports on 5 boxes AND someone took <br/>
the time to send me a message about finding one of my hitchhikers in <br/>
Pennsylvania.  I really appreciate getting these reports since it lets <br/>
me know that my boxes are still in place and whether they need any <br/>
attention.  It is also fun to hear the reactions to the location, <br/>
stamp or overall experience.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you that take the time to do this!!<br/>

Personally.......in my opinion.........and it may be MY opinion<br/>

<br/>
I think it's kinda polite, if a placer has requested in the clues to be<br/>

a short, one sentence email saying something like "Hey, thanks for getting<br/>
in touch about my box!"<br/>
<br/>
We're battin' zero so far this year.  And I'm only talking placers who<br/>
actually mention in their clues that they'd like to be contacted.  (I<br/>
realize that the 'Contact the Placer' button is there whether a placer wants<br/>
it used or not.)  But when a placer has requested contact, it can just kinda<br/>
make a person feel as if they're sending a message out into a big black void<br/>
when there's never an acknowledgement.<br/>
<br/>
I know some folks only check their email once in a blue moon and that<br/>
placers can be off on vacation themselves or what not..........but I'm<br/>
talking this is going all the way back to January of this year.<br/>
<br/>
I've been reconsidering whether to bother taking the time to do it anymore.<br/>

I agree!  I've had 3 notices this week that just are the generic <br/>
found message, no notes.  It's such a let down to me!  I really want <br/>
to know what people thought of the place, box, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I wish more people would add notes to their found notifications.<br/>

I agree with you, too, Mosey.  Generally, I reply to messages I <br/>
get.  Sometimes I even reply to the found notices with no <br/>
notes.  But, I almost never get replies from my notes that I send to <br/>
placers.  Even just a "Thanks" would be nice.<br/>

We almost always send a message after finding a box (unless we've talked to the  planter "in person" ).  I'd say that we get an acknowledgement at least 75% of the time.<br/>

Since this was a current topic of discussion, I kept track of the <br/>
Contact the Placer messages we sent last night (for boxes we found in <br/>
PA &amp; NJ over the long weekend).  We contacted 15 different placers and <br/>
10 have responded within 24 hours or less.  That's 67%.  I expect <br/>
we'll get a few more acknowlegements over the next week.<br/>

 I know I'm a few days behind here, but i'd like to comment on<br/>
contacting placers- i think its a nice thing to do - it lets the<br/>
placer know the box is ok. and who knows? it may start a friendship!<br/>
i always try to leave a message when i find a box- it just seems the<br/>
correct thing to do....gemgirl65<br/>
