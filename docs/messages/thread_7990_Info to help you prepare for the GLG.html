                    <html><body><p>Bullsnakes:</p>
<p>Mammals are the number one food item. Pocket gophers, meadow
mice, voles, shrews, ground squirrels, rabbits, squirrels, birds and birds'
eggs, frogs, and lizards are consumed. They kill larger prey by constriction
and simply swallow smaller prey alive. They are powerful snakes and can kill
rodents met in a burrow by pressing the rodent against the wall of the burrow
with part of its body. I have heard of bullsnakes hanging around chicken coops
eating the eggs and young chicks, but these snakes are really one of the most
beneficial snakes found in Minnesota. These snakes have appetites! They can
easily save a farmer hundreds of dollars every year because of the number of
rodents they can eat. They can go into burrows, holes in the walls of barns,
weave in between bales of hay, and go places dogs and cats cannot go. The smart
farmers know this and are glad to see bullsnakes around their farm. The
ignorant farmers waste their time killing these snakes, and waste their money
buying trap after trap to eradicate a nuisance that the bullsnakes would have
eradicated for free.<span></span></p>
