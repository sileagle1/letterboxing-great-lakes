Who is invited? EVERYONE!<br/>
What: ART BASH (gathering of people interested in many kinds of art and crafts)<br/>
When: Nov. 3rd and Nov. 4th, 2007.  Optional store tours on Monday<br/>
Where: Garfield Suites, Downtown Cincinnati Ohio<br/>
Why? Because last year's event was SO MUCH FUN AND EDUCATIONAL!!<br/>
<br/>
This year's BASH will be much more fun if we have stuff to learn and do!  If you have a favorite project or craft of any type you would be willing to share with the others at the bash, please let me know right away! Please submit the "Instructor's Registration Form" found at the link below.<br/>
<br/>
In order to reduce my confusion and to hopefully cover all the bills this time, there will be a flat fee for the bash.  $130 will cover both days and all the classes.  If there are classes that have supply fees that exceed that budget, there might be an extra fee to cover those supplies.<br/>
<br/>
You are welcome to only attend a single day of the bash, but unfortunately, it will be the same price as both days, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
The info on the registration form I just added to that file is correct. <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/files/2007%20ART%20BASH/<br/>
<br/>
It will be held in downtown Cincinnati (in a nicer part of downtown, across from the main library and surrounded by offices.)  I've booked a conference room at the Garfield Suites Hotel.  All their rooms are suites which means you can room share easily and bring your own food to prepare in the kitchenette to help keep costs down.  More info is on the first page of the registration.<br/>
<br/>
Registrations are now being accepted (until Sept. 15th), so please submit them at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to meeting you all at the bash!<br/>
<br/>
P.S. "Flat Selves" are also welcome if you are not able to attend, you can send a flat version of yourself with (or as) a logbook in which the attendees can write comments. The flat selves will be included in the group photo as well.  More info is on the 1st page of the registration form.<br/>
