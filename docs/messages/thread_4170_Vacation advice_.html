My family and I will be staying a few days in Schaumburg and would like <br/>
to find a few Chicago area letterboxes. <br/>
There are 4 of us (2 adults, an 8 yob and a 6 yog). We particulary like <br/>
boxes that share some of the local history or sights. <br/>
Any suggestions for our "gotta get this one" list?<br/>

Can't help with Chicago, but would like to ask the same question about Williamsburg, Virginia.  A friend who just returned from there told us about the Batman and Robin series in Waller Mill Park.  Are there any other boxes we just gotta have?  (2 adults, 14 yr. old boy, 12 yr. old girl)  Thanks in advance!  We are new to letterboxing and are hooked!  Getting ready to place our first boxes soon!  Huntin-Dogs<br/>
