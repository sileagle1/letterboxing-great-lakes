mini prequel to "A Treasure Trove" the treasurer hunters book that <br>
sucked up hours and hours of my time last year.  So I planted this box <br>
to honor it.  I even checked it out recently at a wedding I was <br>
attending at the exact location.<br>

Any way GL Lady and her group found it and let me know.<br>

I saw that Mark Pepe had an article about mystery boxes and why they <br>
languish.  In the winter, I sit around and solve them - or at least get <br>
a very good idea where they are - but alas - I must work and can't <br>
always get to the location.  <br>

Happy day for me and Zac & Ana and happy boxing.<br>

thought and creativity into finally is found by somebody, isn't it?  As <br>
Treasure Trove followers, this box sounds like a neat one and if I ever get <br>
over that way, I will definitely look it up.<br>
