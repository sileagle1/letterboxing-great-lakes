And as long as the subject is now out in the open...some of us Illini boxers have been chatting offlist, and are thinking about an Olympics-themed gathering for next year (We can't wait until 2016!!).<br>

Ok, ever since we got into letterboxing (6 months ago this friday) I have  <br>
wanted to have an annual gathering here in the Quad-Cities. Don't know if this  <br>
year will work or not and I will let the group know if there will be one this  <br>
year or not.<br>
<br>
We don't expect many from this group to be able to attend (as we are so far  <br>
west), however, many of us Quad-City folk have been planting away to make this <br>
a  more enticing area for you all -- a letterboxing haven if you will :-)<br>
