<br>
Those boxes I placed at Matthiessen and Buffalo Rock (Lil Bit of Flutter,<br>
Shuffle off to Bluffalo, Dog out of Water) were placed this summer after the<br>
tornado.  Matt The Rat's Effigy Tumuli (at BR) is still there, though I was<br>
unable to find it this summer when I went looking for it.  The only SRL box<br>
(The Point) I had a chance to find is also there as of early August (which<br>
was the last time I checked on all of my boxes.  I also have two boxes on Rt<br>
71 near Norway which are still there as of that date.  The clues to all my<br>
boxes are in this group's file section, so you don't have to use the Contact<br>
the Placer to get them from me.<br>

Subject: Starved Rock SP<br>
<br>
Pardon the questions, but being realtively new, I want to get as<br>
much information as I can.<br>
<br>
How many out there frequent the Starved Rock, Buffalo Rock, and<br>
Mathessien SP areas?   How often do you go?   Once you find all the<br>
boxes, do you ever go back to that location again?  Living and<br>
working not that far from there I like to go after a hard night at<br>
work and  walk trails and look for boxes as a stress reliever.<br>
<br>
<br>
Does anyone know if any of the boxes for SR, Matheissen or BR were<br>
damaged or lost during the tornado?  I looked for some the other day<br>
and couldn't find them based upon the clues and these were locations<br>
that the tornado went through.<br>
<br>
How can I get letterbox introduced to my community, I have placed<br>
one letterbox and have only gotten a minimal response to it.  I find<br>
it hard to believe that out of almost 20,000 people only three<br>
people are letterboxers.I am hoping to make it to the get-together<br>
next year.  Who knows, maybe I'll get an itch and put out a get<br>
together at one of our local parks.<br>
