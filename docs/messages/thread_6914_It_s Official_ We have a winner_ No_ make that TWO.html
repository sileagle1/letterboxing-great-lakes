I have to agree with the others about not checking your spaces for a few days and waiting.. I have been SUPER busy lately, and haven't checked my spaces since the 10th!....I decided last night i should probably check them again....when i did i thought to myself, OH BOY, i better start paying attention, I "could" have a bingo tomorrow! ..good thing I did, or I may have missed it!

That's right. We have a tie for winning the 10 spot game. Congratulations goes <br/>
out to Archaeofrog AND Booty Bandits. I will post their winning spaces (unless <br/>
they would like to). CONGRATULATIONS! Honestly...I didn't think we'd see any <br/>
winners in January and TWO squeaked in. So....the race is on for the straight <br/>
line, X, full card....and, oh yeah....the drunken 6 pack! Who's ready to imbibe?<br/>
