the cemetery/ Wear your boots....  Haven't been there for a few weeks, but it <br>
was alive and well then.<br>
<br>
The city of Cherry Valley is right near here, as you probably know if you are <br>
familiar with the area, but if not, there are a few there.  You should stop <br>
by The Goose Barn while you are in town and say hi!  I'm Beckyjo aka Dumpster <br>
Diva and would love to meet you.  Just let me know when you might be coming so <br>
I can be sure to be there!  The address is 5311 Charles St. between Alpine and <br>
Mulford, directly across from The First Baptist Church.  There is a big Betsy <br>
Ross flag painted on the Barn and we are upstairs in the shop!  The shop is <br>
only about 3/4 of a mile west from 4 ft Under at the Arlington Cemetery, which <br>
is also on Charles St.<br>
<br>
Call if you need directions and to let me know if you are stopping by.  <br>
397-9391 or 397-9353<br>
<br>
Have a great trip.<br>
Beckyjo in Rockford, IL<br>
