<br>
Twinkles and I will be celebrating our 30tth Wedding Anniversary there so we would like something nice but not real extravagant. This will be our first time back to Hawaii in over 35 years so our expectations are reasonable.<br>
<br>
We are looking for something with an Ocean Front of at least an Ocean View.<br>
<br>
Someone said that we should stay in the Kaanapali Beach area. <br>
They suggested the Kaanapali Beach Hotel of the Sheraton Maui.<br>
<br>
Once we book accommodations and confirm our trip they we can start talking about your favorite letterboxes in the area.<br>
<br>
Please send us your thoughts.<br>
