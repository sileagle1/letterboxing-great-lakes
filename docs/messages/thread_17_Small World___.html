with a few friends from the place I used to work.  One topic led to <br/>
another and one of the gals asked if I was still involved with <br/>
letterboxing because she had recently read an article that mentioned <br/>
geocaching and letterboxing.  I told her I was and explained for the <br/>
others there what exactly letterboxing was.  When I finished, one of <br/>
the women excitedly said, "I have seen one of those boxes."  I asked <br/>
her where and she said "at Crisp Point lighthouse" (on Lake Superior <br/>
in the U.P.)  I burst out -- "that was my box" and she said "you are <br/>
Spring Chicken?"<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought it was uncanny especially since I had just <br/>
mentioned here the other day that there are a few boxes in the U.P. <br/>
I have not ever heard anything about (that is one of them).  <br/>
Apparently the box was there last summer, although it was laying out <br/>
in the open, not in its hiding spot, and she left it there because <br/>
she wasn't really sure where else to put it.  So who knows what has <br/>
become of it since then.<br/>
<br/>
It really is a small world...<br/>
