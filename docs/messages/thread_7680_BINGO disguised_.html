Is anyone from this group planning on coming to the Live and Breathe Event in New England at the end of August ?<br/>

I was thinking someone should call it soon, since usually this interim game<br/>
is called in February.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The only interim game that is left now is the "+" (the entire "N" column and<br/>
the middle row of the card).  Then it will be the race for a Full Card.<br/>

P.S.  Martini Man will be disappointed since he had 3 corners and was<br/>
waiting for "just one more word...".  And amazingly he doesn't have a single<br/>
word in his "N" column yet!<br/>

&gt;Congrats!  Camo tape gave me three corners and a small hope for 'fungus woman' to pull out a four corner win for me.  Silly me!<br/>

&gt;&gt; For a while I kept a pen near my chair so that I could mark off my bingo squares. The pen finally wandered away but I probably didn't notice for weeks since I've been going through quite a dry spell. When I read this word I was so busy looking around for my pen that I didn't even notice that I had four corners! Bingo!!<br/>

Huh.  Weird.  Did you copy my O words too?  LOL ( just for the record, copying my card is a bad bingo strategy!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
I think ties are allowed for interim game, so I would have gladly shared the spotlight with you!<br/>
