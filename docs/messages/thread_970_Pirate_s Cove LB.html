For those of you that may be going to search for Pirate's Cove in <br>
the next couple of days, I would strongly suggest against it.   The <br>
reason is that with the heavy rain, not only is the trail very soft <br>
and slick, there is also the chance of there being parts of it <br>
underwater.    I didn't get a chance to grab it before the rain <br>
storm, so the box may have decided to set sail for somewhere else. <br>
When I placed it, I believed it was up high enough to where there <br>
shouldn't be a problem, but this was a out of ordinary rain storm.  <br>
<br>
As soon as the trail opens back up, I will go and check on the box <br>
and let everyone know the status.<br>
<br>

PS:  If anyone does happen to be searching for a letterbox and comes <br>
across the pirate, please email me and let me know you have him.  I <br>
will set up the arrangements to have him brought back.  <br>
