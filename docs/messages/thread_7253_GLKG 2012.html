Yep, you're right!<br>
<br>
I'm from Minnesota originally (about two hours from Blue Mounds State park near Luverne, which is also beautiful!), but I live in Madison, WI now, and yes, the meet-up is at the Blue Mound State Park here in Wisconsin. There's lots of hotel options in and around Madison, so I'd suggest starting your search there! :) <br>
<br>
Though like the lovely Verona Bird Patrol said, Verona and Mt. Horeb will be the closest options, as they're even closer to the park than Madison itself, but I'm not sure how many hotels they have.<br>
<br>
Also, hi, everyone -- I'm Shalar. Or, well, Sha of Shalar, since my husband (Falar) and I share our trail name! :) I just moved to Madison a few months ago, but I've been following this group since I started letterboxing almost two years ago, even though I previously lived in West Virginia. I haven't really had a reason to jump in until now, so hopefully it's okay that I'm introducing myself this way and I'm not butting in or anything. :)<br>
