Our box, "When Pigs Dream" in West Olive is in place and active (I checked it this Spring). It was placed the year before the county fair gathering at the "It's a Wing Thing" gathering. I hope you can try for it. I do know Grandvilla has a series of five boxes active in West Olive at a different yet near park. Good hunting. <br/>
