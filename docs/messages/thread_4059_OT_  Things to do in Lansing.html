  There is one letterbox placed on the campus of MSU.  (Red Cedar box)  It's location is fairly unique...I remember the campus is very CLEAN...so, possibly not to many woodsy places...Spartan Fans?  Do you know?<br/>
<br/>
  Not real far away is the Impression 5 museum - a great hands on museum for kids.<br/>
  The Capitol building is a fun excursion - and just outside the Hall of Justice is a really cool memorial with a super sweet "surpise" for kids....well, my kids thought it was "da bomb".<br/>
  In nearby Okemos, there is a very nice park with a neat letterbox (Meridian Historical Village).<br/>
  Also -- Potters Park is a great way to spend the afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope this helps!<br/>

MSU has one letterbox on campus and several that are very close by (one at patriarche park). There is a really good wood lot just south of the children's garden to plant boxes that is not landscaped. Also, go to the MSU Dairy store and campus museums. Lots to do along the E. Lansing downtown.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You might want to take them to a Lugnuts game. The Lansing Lugnuts <br/>
are a minor league baseball team. Also, the "Say Yes to Michigan" <br/>
letterbox is in a small park located near the state capitol and not <br/>
far from the Lugnuts Stadium. You wouldn't have to look for the <br/>
letterbox, but a visit to the park may be interesting, since there <br/>
is a monument to 9/11. The park is really small and a visit wouldn't <br/>
take more than 10-15 minutes, tops. It is interesting, though. The <br/>
State Capitol puts on a good tour, but I'm not sure if they do it on <br/>
the weekends. I'm guessing you will be there during the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
The MSU Dairy Store has the best ice cream. The "Red Cedar" <br/>
letterbox is located on campus and there is a scenic spot where it <br/>
is located. There is a small river running through campus and <br/>
sometimes you see some canoeists going past. There is a butterfly <br/>
house on campus, not far from the Dairy Store. There is a Children's <br/>
Garden near the butterfly house, but it's geared towards much <br/>
younger children.<br/>
<br/>
The "Impression 5 Science Center" is also geared towards younger <br/>
children. <br/>
That's about all I can remember from our visit there. You may also <br/>
