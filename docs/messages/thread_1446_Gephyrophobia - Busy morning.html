You Cook County boxers are quick!<br/>
Splash and Fungus Woman beat me to it this morning.<br/>
Congrats!  The bridge was really cool, I brought my<br/>
camera with and took some pics of the cars below, and<br/>
I loved the stamp.<br/>
I should have stopped on my work at 6am instead of on<br/>
my lunch break  :-)<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
