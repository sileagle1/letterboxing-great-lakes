I have some kinda bad news.  I was running a test at work and we had a little accident.  As a result, I'm not sure if I'm going to be well enough to attend Boxacon.  You see, I've been exposed to the Andromeda Strain.  Not to worry though, I've been told our Pharmacy and Infectious Disease teams, along with the IDPH (Illinois Department of Public Health), WSLH (Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) are all working on a cure, or at least a vaccine.  But if I feel up to it, I'm still going to try to attend.  <br/>
<br/>
But I just wanted to let you know a bit about the organism and how it's spread.  It's kind of ironic actually, but it's transmitted rather like a cootie, that is, by person-to-person contact.  And it travels fast, usually without the person even being aware they've been infected.  It leaves its mark and is on its way to its next unsuspecting victim.<br/>
<br/>
So remember to wash your hands frequently, cover your sneezes and coughs (by the way, both of which are good advice in these days of H1N1 and seasonal flu as well as the Andromeda Strain), and let's be careful out there!<br/>
<br/>
--klk/fw<br/>
<br/>
PS:  If I do make it to Boxacon, and you notice I've spread any Andromeda Strain, please make sure it gets back to me by the end of the day, so I can take it back to the lab for proper decontamination and biohazardous disposal.<br/>
