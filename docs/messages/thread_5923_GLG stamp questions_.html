OK, I'm being very good and looking at all our stamp images within a day of coming home (as opposed to my usual, oh, two years later) and I only have a few questions about images that I've got:<br/>
<br/>
#1 - Stamp image is of the Chicago Cubs "C" with "da bears" in the middle; was found in a small white jewelry box - who carved it and what is it called?  <br/>
<br/>
#2 - Stamp image has "Silo 3" on it and "mardi gras float" along with the little guy or witch or hookah (I honestly am not sure what the second stamp image is supposed to be).  I was told this was the "Dartmoor Pool &amp; Bonus Box" listed as an event box on the official green sheets, but I'm not seeing that listed as an event stamp on AtlasQuest.  I do, however, see a box listed from Tiptoe and Tonto called "Letterboxing Fool" that says it was created for Silo 3.  Are the two things I described the same?<br/>
<br/>
#3 - There was a purple Dora the Explorer bubble pen cootie; the writing for the official cootie name was all worn off, though.  Any idea what that cootie's name is supposed to be other than "Dora Bubble Pen"?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for everyone's help!<br/>

Letterboxing Fool is a round stamp about 3 inches in dia. - image of a sitting jester reading clues.  It was part of our float at SILO 3, but it doesn't have "Silo 3" or "Mardi gras float" written on it.<br/>
