I'm amazed it is still going. Any day now I am expecting 27 people to call Bingo on the same word... all for third place on the full card! This is the first year I haven't been marking words on cards as they were called -- way more players and way less available time on my part... so I have no idea how many people are "close."

Way way way back in January, it seemed like I was crossing off words on my card; sometimes 3 per week.  Then I hit a dry spell in February.  I was loosing hope.   Now, I only need 3 words.  <br/>

Spring Chick's Letterbox Bingo is a nail biter right down to the end.  <br/>

ROFLOL!  Each morning since January 1, I would rush to the computer to check the Bingo word for the day.  When the first full card winner was announced, I actually needed about a dozen more words.  At that point I thought - what's the chance of winning?  I sort of gave up, but I would still check the words.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, but we can never give up.  Spring Chick's Letterbox Bingo game is a wild ride and it hasn't ended yet.  I've been sucked back in too and now I'm actually thinking....I still have a chance to win!!!  <br/>
