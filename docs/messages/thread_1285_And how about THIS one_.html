and they never changed the clues!  Everyone's been looking in the<br/>
wrong spot!  BTW, I have already replaced it but have not posted the<br/>
clues officially, but you can find MY clues to the replacement at<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/the_lb_dragon/Algoma_Pierhead_Lighthouse_Letterbox.htm<br/>
If you go, maybe you'll find both boxes!  I'll be checking it out this<br/>
weekend myself!<br/>

Also, Steven can not tell his right from his left on the Algoma<br/>
Lighthouse Box. The clue states "park bench on left" but one must go<br/>
to the "park bench on the right." Please make another update, Mitch?<br/>

That is all from Wisconsin. Love you. die xo<br/>
