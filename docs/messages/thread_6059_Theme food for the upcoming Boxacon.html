Here are a few more recipes I found:<br/>
===================================<br/>
Tribble Gumbo<br/>
<br/>
Skin fillet and debone your tribble<br/>
<br/>
toss the bones into a big pot of water with a few stalks of celery, a couple of onions, garlic cloves, and a carrot -- season with salt and pepper. Simmer for several hours to extract all the flavor. Strain and discard the solids.<br/>
<br/>
Make a roux with bacon grease and flour Add the tribble stock, a few cans of diced tomatoes. In another skillet saute trinity --chopped onions celery and bell peppers -- until onions are transparent. Add to gumbo. Add boneless tribble cut into bite size pieces and add a big bowl full of sliced okra. Season well with cajun seasoning and allow to simmer for at least 2 hours so that the flavors meld.<br/>
<br/>
Serve over rice.<br/>
========================================<br/>
<br/>
Flaming Tribble.... one a stick!<br/>
Ingredients: Tribble, Butter, Seasoning, and a Stick.<br/>
<br/>
1. Build a nice campfire, preferably with de-barked hard wood for better flavor.<br/>
2. Swiftly stab the tribble with a standard sish kabob stick (the thick variety) insuring to penetrate completely.<br/>
3. Dip the trible, now on a stick, in melted butter<br/>
4. Roll the butter dipped tribble in your favorite blackening seasonings<br/>
5. Place butter coated and seasoned tribble directly over the campfire flames insuring that all hair is completely singed off.<br/>
6. Re dip and season the tribble<br/>
7. place directly on the flames for final cook. Note that the flames should be touching the tissue to properly sear the flesh and seal in the juices.<br/>
8. Cook about five minutes per side directly on the flames.<br/>
9. Disembowl the tribble (simply cut the gut from stem to stern) <br/>
10. Re-butter and season the tribble and place back over the fire for an additional three minutes per side.<br/>
<br/>
Serve with fresh veggies that were stir-fried in the tribbles shield, using the remaining butter for flavoring.<br/>
<br/>
Note: if the stick begins to burn, remove immediatly and cover the exposed portion on the stick with spare vamp-braces, or one of those worthless helms.<br/>
======================================<br/>
<br/>
Tribble, the Original Fast food:<br/>
<br/>
Run after Tribble, Catch Tribble, Open mouth and insert Tribble, Chew and Swallow<br/>
<br/>
MMMMMMMmmm yum<br/>
<br/>
Tribble<br/>
