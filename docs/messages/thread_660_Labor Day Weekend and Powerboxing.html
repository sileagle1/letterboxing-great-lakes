                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a fabulous weekend of hiking and boxing in Michigan, primarily <br>
in the Muskegon area.  Our travels included Muskegon, Grand Haven and <br>
Grand Rapids.  We used the new high-speed ferry between Milwaukee and <br>
Muskegon to shorten our driving time and it worked out very well.  It <br>
was a speedy and relaxing way to get from Point A to Point B.   <br>
<br>
The parks on that side of Lake Michigan were fantastic!  Impressive <br>
dunes, beaches and forests gave us plenty to enjoy.  We got very <br>
familiar with the terrain as we hunted for Spring Chick's boxes.<br>
If you've never tried walking up a mountain of sand you just<br>
don't know what you're missing ...  A variety of clues kept<br>
our brains going at the same time our legs were churning up the <br>
sand.  The hikes were rewarding not only in terms of physical & <br>
mental exercise, but also in terms of vistas and creative well-carved <br>
stamps.  <br>
<br>
Other nice boxes and hikes near the lakeshore included a series by <br>
Keltic Kara and one by Hummingbird.<br>
<br>
We also enjoyed looking for boxes further inland including several <br>
neat boxes planted by Grandvilla and Mobiusklein, one by Bindle Babe, <br>
and the topical Election '04 series by Lucky Charms.  <br>
<br>
Making some of the hunts extra fun in Grand Rapids was the fact that <br>
Delirium and her husband joined us, traveling over from the Detroit <br>
area.  Afterwards the 4 of us joined SpringChick & Old Shoe and <br>
Grandvilla & Mobiusklein for a delicious dinner and lots of LB talk.  <br>
We really appreciated the hospitality of these MI boxers!<br>
<br>
We had a great weekend and would definitely take the ferry again.  <br>
There are probably enough boxes in western MI for at least 3 more <br>
weekends of "powerboxing", north and south of Muskegon.<br>
<br>
For those of you who are wondering what our counts were:<br>
<br>
16 boxes on Saturday<br>
20 boxes on Sunday (tied our previous record)<br>
17 boxes on Monday<br>
<br>
Total = 53 boxes!  <br>
