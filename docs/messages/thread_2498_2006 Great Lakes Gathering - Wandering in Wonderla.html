<br>
We've received 16 boxes (with more expected to arrive in the mail <br>
soon) that we'll be planting over the next two weekends.  We've also <br>
received clues for 4 boxes that have already been planted by some of <br>
the local boxers.  I've heard back from almost everyone else that <br>
they are still planning to create the boxes listed on the website, so <br>
we'll probably have at least 40 boxes at the gathering.<br>
<br>
As expected, we've had a few recent attendee cancellations but also <br>
more people have been signing up to attend.  A few are <br>
still "maybes", but our current count is an amazing 113 people!!<br>
<br>
With those two bits of information, I wanted to give an early "heads <br>
up" that you will want to be sure your logbook has enough room for <br>
all the box and exchange stamps you'll be collecting.  If you're <br>
getting short on space in your book, you may want to go get (or make) <br>
another logbook before the event.  I also know some of you use a <br>
smaller logbook, so wanted to warn you that some of the stamps we've <br>
received are on the LARGE size(they must have eaten some of that <br>
mushroom from the "bigger" side!).  Anyway, if you use a smaller <br>
logbook, you may want to bring some extra paper along to use for the <br>
larger stamps (the current largest is 4"x6").<br>
<br>
I've been trying to keep the website updated on a regular basis, so <br>
if you want to know what boxes have been received, who is planning to <br>
attend, what's planned for the potluck, or descriptions of some of <br>
the workshops, just check the site:<br>

We're looking forward to seeing everyone on June 3rd!<br>
