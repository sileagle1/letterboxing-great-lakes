list, he posted a link to a map he set up through this<br>
site called Frappar where people can post a "tack" to<br>
show where they're from.  Now, some of you may<br>
remember that about a year ago, I created a file in<br>
the files section of our Yahoo Group called<br>
"Who_Where_Dec_04," which was an unofficial list of<br>
where various members of this talk list were from.  It<br>
was just fun to see how many people represented each<br>
state, and was also meant as a tool if, say, you were<br>
looking for someone to go letterboxing with, or maybe<br>
carpool to a gathering with.  However, I've kind of<br>
let keeping the file go.  Even though I made<br>
corrections and additions that were sent to me, I<br>
never got around to posting a revised list.  So when I<br>
added my entry to the PLB map that Team Armadillo<br>
created, it struck me - the new version of the "Who<br>
Where" list for our group!  So if you'd like to add<br>
yourself (or transfer yourself over), the link is:<br>

I've also added the link to the links section of this<br>
group.  Have fun!<br>

Can I suggest that you go into the Admin options and<br>
change the default on the map so that it centers<br>
itself automatically around the great lakes region and<br>
zoom it in a little since all the members will be from<br>
taht area?<br>

I've zoomed the map in a little so the initial screen<br>
is now centered more around our region.  Everyone can<br>
still zoom in & out as much as they want though.  Be<br>
careful, though, about assuming that _all_ our members<br>
are from the Great Lakes Region - even though it's the<br>
Great Lakes talk list, I think we've got a few<br>
far-reaching members :)<br>
