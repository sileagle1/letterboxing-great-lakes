I've zoomed the map in a little so the initial screen<br/>
is now centered more around our region.  Everyone can<br/>
still zoom in &amp; out as much as they want though.  Be<br/>
careful, though, about assuming that _all_ our members<br/>
are from the Great Lakes Region - even though it's the<br/>
Great Lakes talk list, I think we've got a few<br/>
far-reaching members :)<br/>
