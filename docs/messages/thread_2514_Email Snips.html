LbGLK Message 6850<br>
<br>
From: Randy Hall<br>
.... I do not believe anyone has yet found my only Wisconsin box (the drop <br>
was difficult (and I had a flight to catch), and the likelyhood that it is <br>
still there is low, but it doesn't mean the puzzle still can't be solved and <br>
the area enjoyed).<br>
<br>

<br>
Hi,<br>
....  Here's what we found.... the white top and frosted bottom of an old <br>
"Tupperware" container (actually, "Good Cook") and an old Ziploc bag.  Alas, <br>
nothing else.  All were separate and partally covered/filled with dirt and <br>
leaves. The bottom has been exposed to the sun long enough to become <br>
brittle.  So, is it possible we found the remains of  "?????" ?<br>
Thanks.<br>

<br>
Yes, it seems very likely.<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>

If you're agreeable and would like to recarve the stamp, we'd be happy to <br>
take on custodial duties.<br>

I'm not going to be able to recarve the stamp, but you're welcome to, or <br>
not, as you wish....<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>
