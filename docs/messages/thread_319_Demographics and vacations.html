and 2Lucky is a Genetic Counsellor.  I think that a GC could be <br>
counted as a teacher of sorts.  Pretty interesting survey!<br>
<br>
As for vacation plans...  really wherever we go we bring clues.  And <br>
if our destination doesn't have boxes, we bring carving tools.  We <br>
have scoped out locations to place boxes in MI, IL, and WI.  Clues <br>
are made and stamps are in progress.  Keep your eyes peeled...<br>
