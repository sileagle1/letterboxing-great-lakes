Last year the first BINGO (straight line) was called on FEB 6, so we may be approaching some excitement for someone within the week....<br/>

&gt; The bingo dauber is still lonely<br/>
&gt; and getting weaker<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So we finally got past that string of "special words" (I have none of <br/>
&gt; those) and get a "regular" word..... and its one i don't have. :{  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's ok, my words will start popping up again soon..... ( I hope)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the meantime, i noticed there is a new box in my area.... maybe it <br/>
&gt; will be warm enough to go get it this weekend.  That should console <br/>
&gt; me for a bit. (boxes in my area are few and far between.)  I'm even <br/>
&gt; more excited that there apears to be another/new boxer here. Before <br/>
&gt; this i only knew of 2 and one had pretty much retired from boxing.  <br/>
&gt; The other was new like myself.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; so, one to find and 2 to plant.... Maybe i will take Bingo Dauber <br/>
&gt; with me so she won't be so lonely.<br/>
