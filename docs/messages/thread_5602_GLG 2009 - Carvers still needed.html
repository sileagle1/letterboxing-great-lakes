                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you've been thinking about carving an event box stamp and haven't contacted me, <br>
please do so as soon as possible.  I will be out of town Fri-Mon (and may not have internet <br>
access).  On Monday or Tuesday, I will open up my request for Green Stamps, Favorite <br>
Great Lakes State Parks, and 1930's-1930's themed boxes at Atlas Quest.  I'd like to get <br>
the stamps (and whatever else you'd like to contribute towards the letterbox) by March <br>
15th.  That'll give us time to complete any box details.<br>
<br>
Originally I thought I would only ask for stamps so postage costs would be less for <br>
contributors.  I also thought a standard box size would be nice, but I discovered that is <br>
too limiting for some of you.  SO ... If you want to create a complete letterbox (stamp, <br>
logbook, container, optional ink), please feel free to do so.<br>
<br>
When you contact me with your donation, please let me know if you want it to be a SAT <br>
ONLY/SAT&SUN box.  Also, do you want me to keep the name of your box secret until the <br>
event.<br>
<br>
I have a volunteer for the Official event stamp!<br>
<br>
I have deliberately not spent much money at this point.  I am super-conscious about <br>
keeping the costs to a minimum this year.  Once the official stamp design is made, I may <br>
look into having shirts or canvas bags commissioned.  <br>
