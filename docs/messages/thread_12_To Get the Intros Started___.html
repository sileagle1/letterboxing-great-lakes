                    <div class="plaintext-content">I go by the trail name of SpringChick, live in West Michigan, and <br>
have been letterboxing for about a year and a half.  Sometimes my <br>
other half, OldShoe, is my hiking buddy, but most often I go it <br>
alone, which I actually enjoy.  When I first began boxing there were <br>
just a couple of boxes over here on the west side of the state (in <br>
the Saugatuck area).  Since there wasn't much to find, I planted.  <br>
Since then the involvement has increased significantly and there are <br>
several boxes in the area I have yet to find.<br>
<br>
Most of the boxes I have found and planted are in the West Michigan <br>
area, although we have found a few around Chicago and I took an <br>
extended trip to the Mid-Atlantic area where I found several boxes <br>
in OH, NJ, DE and PA, and planted a few along the way.  We also <br>
planted several boxes in the U.P. which we have heard very little <br>
about since they were put in place over a year ago.  We took a trip <br>
to Door County, WI just prior to getting involved with letterboxing, <br>
but are talking about heading back that way this summer, and I look <br>
forward to hunting for some boxes over on the other side of the lake.<br>
<br>
For me letterboxing combines several interests -- hiking, stamp <br>
artistry, puzzles...  and gives me that little extra push I need to <br>
get out on the trail sometimes.  In addition to letterboxing, I <br>
enjoy photography, writing and do various types of artwork.  In the <br>
short time I have been boxing, I've met some really wonderful people <br>
and look forward to the acquaintences yet to come.<br>
<br>
I have a letterboxing web site, Stamp-in-the-Box here:<br>

Nice to meet you all!<br>
