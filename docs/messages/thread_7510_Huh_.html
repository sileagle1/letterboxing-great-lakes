New letterbox: Autsidy<br>
Glenbulah, Washington, WI<br>
Placed by: Lover of Autumn<br>
Clues:<br>
1st box..... Go to the hippo park. Stand next to it and face the road that<br>
leads right to it. There should be some porta-potties on the left<br>
side.Follow that road untill the main park is in sight. You should still be<br>
on the left of the fence with the old fashion wagon. Follow the road untill<br>
you are on the left of the mini golf course. Then enter the mini golf course<br>
and head toward the tree in the back left corner or the tree that is there.<br>
The box shall be under some leaves or in the tall grass or in the tree it<br>
may be moved due to other people. <br>
<br>
2nd box....So you are in the mini golf course..GET OUT.. and face the main<br>
office building. Go through the buliding toward the pools but go to the<br>
right of it were there should be some shuffle boards. Go in the path in<br>
between them. Then follow the path out toward the porta potty. there is a<br>
road that will bring you to an outdoor movie theater... dont enter it but<br>
keep going straight on the right and there is a small petting zoo thing.<br>
face the front of the fence and walk to the back left corner of it. There in<br>
the corner behind the petting zoo is a wooden fence. go to the left corner<br>
of it and there will be the 2nd letter box. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Unfortaunlty there is no stamp, its just for fun! But there is a notebook.<br>
Have fun and good luck on your journey!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, this post is a bit perplexing, and thank you WiHi for pointing it out before a number of us would have gone out seeking the box. (Not that I'll ever get out to box again it seems...too busy...)<br>
<br>
I must admit though that I am a bit embarrassed by the tone of some of the discussions.  Usually we take a new letterboxer under the wing and send a private email to point out embarrassing mistakes, which WiHi undoubtedly did.  Keep in mind however, that if this letterboxer did continue with the hobby, and learned from their mistakes, I wonder whether after reading some of these posts once joining our group (if they hadn't already) would send them away.  Thus, we may lose out on a number of great letterboxes this individual may have produced.<br>
<br>
I'm sure we can all look back to when we first began and some of the stupid things we did before we knew better.  We have also seen some lowly starting letterboxers become some of the more beloved boxers out there.  Let's continue to build new boxers up and assist them as is the tradition of this group.  It can only be a win-win.<br>
<br>
(That being said, critizing geocachers is still fair game! ;-p)<br>
<br>
Thanks for hearing me out.<br>
