 I took two of my nephews with me to plant letterboxes today.  One<br/>
 who "gets it" and one who doesn't.  The older already wants his own<br/>
 journal and found one very cool hiding spot.<br/>
 The other-well, he talked incessantly and was dragging a branch three<br/>
 times his size around. When I asked what he was doing, he said it was<br/>
 so he could "fight any wild animals that came" (you know we just have<br/>
 so many scary animals in Illinois-as if he could even lift the<br/>
 branch!).  "You mean all of the squirrels and rabbits that can hear<br/>
 you four miles away and are running and hiding now?"  Even his<br/>
 footsteps were noisy.  I'm sure that every living thing within a 6000<br/>
 yard radius knew what we were doing.<br/>
<br/>
 Even so, it was a great day.  Now tomorrow we're going hunting!<br/>
