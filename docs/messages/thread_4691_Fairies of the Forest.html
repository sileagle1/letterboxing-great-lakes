meeting all of you and sorry we missed all of you on the trail.<br/>

 Since we spent so much time driving around Ionia State Park I planted <br/>
a box while there. I will post the clues tomorrow. We did find one of <br/>
the two I printed clues for there too. Thanks again,  <br/>

We had a great time!  Yes, we found the clues<br/>
challenging, and Mr. Doglvrs and I felt dumb... but<br/>
sometimes you need a good challenge!!  We are looking<br/>
forward to going back without kids in tow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for hosting this great event and for all the<br/>
hard work you obviously put into it!!  The event stamp<br/>
is totally awesome!!!<br/>
<br/>
It was so wonderful to see old friends again and put<br/>
faces with names we've seen on the boards.  Always a<br/>
great time.<br/>

Looking forward to the next one!!<br/>

We had a great time!  Yes, we found the clues<br/>
challenging, and Mr. Doglvrs and I felt dumb... but<br/>
sometimes you need a good challenge!!  We are looking<br/>
forward to going back without kids in tow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for hosting this great event and for all the<br/>
hard work you obviously put into it!!  The event stamp<br/>
is totally awesome!!!<br/>
<br/>
It was so wonderful to see old friends again and put<br/>
faces with names we've seen on the boards.  Always a<br/>
great time.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to the next one!!<br/>
<br/>

We have never gotten all the boxes at an event, which is why<br/>
we decided to make a weekend out of it.  At past events we spent a lot <br/>
of time exchanging and chatting.  Then we never got many boxes, so <br/>
this time we concentrated on boxes at the expense of getting to know <br/>
our fellow letterboxers.<br/>
We still owe Condo our Personal Traveler.  <br/>
<br/>
We didn't find Beechnut, Dryad or The Gatekeeper and HH.<br/>
We rechecked the clues for Beechnut and the Gatekeeper and feel like <br/>
we could find them now.  We think the Dryad was already gone by the <br/>
time we looked Sunday night.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun boxing with TrailTroll, SpringChick, LunaGirl and Papa and <br/>
without them we couldn't have found Cyclops or Indigo Fairy.  We <br/>
really owe them thanks as we are quite a bit slower with Spartanfans <br/>
Junior Varsity in tow.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday we spent the day boxing with Team Rabbit, together we were <br/>
able to get almost all the rest.  <br/>
<br/>
Family of 6 shouldn't feel bad about the clues as this was their first <br/>
time hosting an event and it was obvious they put a GREAT deal of <br/>
effort into it.  We felt like we letterboxers were the only ones at <br/>
the park and appreciated the mostly stroller friendly trails.<br/>
<br/>
The Fairies of the Forest gathering kicked off the season wonderfully <br/>
and we can't wait until the next event.  Maybe we will learn how to <br/>
balance getting to know our fellow boxers and spending time on the <br/>
trails.<br/>

really, some of the clues were hard!!! (Even my wife gave me some<br/>
grief about it). Anyhow, if you get back, you will be rewarded with my<br/>
stamps. Like the event stamp, they are very intricate, although not<br/>
nearly as large. Man, I'm not sure IF I can even do another stamp like<br/>
it again!!!<br/>
