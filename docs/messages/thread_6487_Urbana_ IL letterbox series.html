Yes, we have gotten the first 20 in the series. It has given us a good look at the many Urbana parks that we wouldn't hav otherwise seen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They were released in batches of 10 a few months apart from each other. The last 10 were just posted over the last couple of days.<br/>

<br/>
Fun stuff!<br/>

I don't know if they have done something like this in the past, but the Urbana Parks System is sponsoring a series of 30 boxes in various parks.<br/>
<br/>
The series is called "Urbana Park District's Wild About Parks Quest--celebrating the Anita Purves Nature Center's 30th anniversary. The Quest runs 6/13/09-6/12/10, but the boxes will remain in place indefinitely. Prizes can be won during the Quest for those who find 10, 20, and 30 boxes.
