It says:<br>

"Hi!  This is a hitchhiker book started by Bob on August 18, 2002 at Holy<br>

<br>
For having been started in August of 2002, there isn't much in the book.<br>
One family found it on Jan 4, 2003 and a note in there from them says they<br>
didn't have the time to pass it on until Oct 19, 2004, when they placed it<br>
at Starved Rock State Park.  It was picked up from there on Oct 23, 2004 and<br>
placed at Oakhurst Run in Aurora, IL on April 4, 2005.  Then we found it at<br>
Oakhurst Run today, June 15.<br>
<br>
Tried to contact "Bob" but the email addy was dead.  So Bob, if you're<br>
reading this, the above is what's happened with the "book" so far.  And if<br>
it did have a stamp at one time, it no longer does.<br>
<br>
Is there actually such a thing as just a hitchhiker *book*, no stamp at<br>
all???  I've never seen one before.<br>

I was with Pippi when we found Robot 1 down here in Kane County.  That was<br>
early last fall. Robot 1 hitched a ride with me when I drove to North<br>
Carolina later that same month.  It was dropped off in North Carolina in a<br>
Squirrel Lake Park box.  It had both a stamp and a logbook at that time.<br>
Checking Wanda and Pete's site, either whoever found Robot 1 didn't report<br>
it or else it hasn't been found yet.  But it wasn't in a difficult box, so<br>
it *had* to have been found by now.<br>

were only the third finder in the book.  One family kept it from Jan, 2003<br>
until Oct, 2004 before they set it free at Starved Rock in IL.  Then it was<br>
found in Oct, 2004 and set free in April, 2005.  Then we found it this<br>
month.  The folks who found it in Jan, 2003 didn't put down any contact<br>
info, nor did they sign with any trail names.  It was a parent (or two)<br>
accompanied by a 7 1/2 year old and a 4 year old.  The 7 1/2 year old wrote<br>
that this was their first letterbox.  The folks who found it at Starved Rock<br>
were also the folks who placed the box I found it in.  I didn't contact<br>
them, I just assumed they would've known what they were doing, but maybe<br>
not.<br>
<br>
But the first family could have lost the stamp in all the time they kept it.<br>
However "Bob"'s writing sort of indicates that there might not have been a<br>
stamp since he/she only mentions the book.<br>

How odd.  Did any of the people who stamped previous by chance leave an<br>
e-mail address or do you recognize them?  Perhaps you could ask them if<br>
there was a stamp when they found it.  I've never heard of a "Hitchhiker<br>
