P.S.  We don't leave our boxing stuff in the car in summer or winter, mostly<br>
because of the ink & markers.  Starts freezing in winter and we've found<br>
that the markers ooze ink even w/o pressure if they get too warm.  We<br>
usually take the pack in to the office with us if we're planning an "after<br>
