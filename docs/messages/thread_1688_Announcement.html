There has been an explosion of boxes in the Whitelake area!!<br>

Nearly 20 boxes placed in ONE DAY!!<br>

how hard could it be to find those," aren't you? (chuckle  just you<br>
wait and see)<br>
<br>
Within the 100-acre park, in addition to an abundant and diverse<br>
collection of flora and fauna, lie the remains of an old Fish Hatchery<br>
(which dates back to the 1950's) some virgin White Pines that are more<br>
than 250 years old, a canoe launch, 7 trails and now the enticing lure<br>
of 20 little letterboxes from two very different series<br>
<br>
Boxes with stamps carved by DogLvrs containing Knights, Castles and<br>
Dragons were placed first, then taking a cue from the courage of the<br>
noble Knights, we bravely went forth to place 9 boxes with my stamp<br>
carvings for the first in the Qwerbert Quartz sleuthing adventures.  <br>
<br>
One of the stamps I carved remains to be identified, even Mrs DogLvrs<br>
(the inspiration for the Worlds Greatest Music Teacher character)<br>
didn't know exactly what kind of staff symbol it was.  We've got a<br>
prize for the first person that can lead us to online confirmation of<br>
its identification. (There's a photo of this mystery music symbol in<br>
the photos section of the Letterboxing_Bindlestiff yahoogroup)<br>
<br>
Even though we both beat our own `personal best' in number of boxes<br>
placed on a single day, many "directional notes" were taken in<br>
preparation for and anticipation of clue writing.  All that is left to<br>
do now is for Bindle Babe to find time to spin out some fanciful yarns<br>
with embedded clues, have someone do a run-through to verify accuracy<br>
vs errors and then we'll post them!<br>
<br>
Have our collaborative efforts piqued your interest yet?<br>

Enjoy!<br>
