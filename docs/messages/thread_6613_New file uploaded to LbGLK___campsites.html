I'm tent camping, but need an electric site.  It's hard to tell from the map where the good sites are, so I figure I'll just get there and go scout a place.  Does anybody know what time you can start checking in?  I suppose if the site you want wasn't occupied on Thursday night, any time Friday morning is good, but does anybody know what time "check-out" is?<br>

Check in is anytime during the day and check out is at 3 pm. So if you check in on Friday at 8 am and check out Sunday at 3 pm, you are charged for 2 nights ($40 for electric), for example.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
There are lots of electric camp sites available at Jubilee, but the Woodchuck Loop would be my choice- it is cozier with only 45 sites & is the closest to the no electricity tent area where some other boxers may be staying. It would be easy to seek out other letterboxers if everyone camped in Woodchuck & the tent only areas. The other two camping loops run together and are quite massive. All of the camping is far from the shelters, so regardless where you camp you'll probably want to drive down to the gathering.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Hope this helps!!!<br>
