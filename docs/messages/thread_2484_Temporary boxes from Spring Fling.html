Seconds here... we're glad to know we'll have the chance to go back and find these.  And, we're very happy to hear that everyone enjoyed the day on Saturday.  In all, there were 33 people that made it out, and the weather cooperated perfectly.  It was great to see many old friends, and meet new faces that belong to familiar stamps.   We really appreciate everyone's support, whether carving stamps, planting extra boxes, contributing to the potluck, or just coming out, from all over, to enjoy the interaction.  Now if we had only done a little better research on personal travelers..... well, we'll get 'em next time!<br>
 <br>
Also, if you didn't stumble across a certain "refreshing" word-of-mouth box in the shelter on Saturday, this might put a smile on your "mug":  You'll have another "shot" at it!  It will become a planted box at the park as soon as we get the chance.<br>

Yeah! You made my morning! We didn't have a chance to get your three <br>
(B's sneezing was getting a bit out of control by mid-afternoon), so we <br>
had to skip them. Now we can head back to the park some day after work <br>
and make a clean sweep of it!<br>
