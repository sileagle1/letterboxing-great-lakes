                    <div class="plaintext-content">I remember this thread from the big list, and some of the responses I read on it prompted me to go out and change my logging style.<br/>
I have a big logbook- it's a nice book with thick pages and a banana-leaf cover.  Not something you'd take out with you.  When I go out, I take a regular book with medium weight paper.  That way, I can stamp multiple times to get the "perfect" stamp.<br/>
Once home, I cut the stamp from the "field book", mount it on paper, attach it to the big book with eyelets or some such, then record a rambling sort of narrative: name of box, location, date, who went with me, trials and tribulations attached to finding the box (a common theme in my 'boxing).<br/>
<br/>
My book has a little bit of everything, finds, plants (including two logbooks that were either filled up or from boxes I had to yank), exchanges, doodles, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
It's like my birding book- I have a field guide for going out, which I use to record finds, dates, places, but I also have a large bound book from Audobon which doesn't go out, but serves as a more permanent record of the hobby.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sue and I use a beautifully embossed leather logbook made by Oberon. They come in 3 sizes. I use the large size @ 6 x 9 but should have bought the 4.75 x 7 small size as we only place 1 stamp per page, unless it's a series and can fit more than 1 per page. <br/>
<br/>
We stamp on the right side only with box name, location [park/trail name], city, state, date and placer. Then I generally write a little commentary about the location, an adventure that happened finding the box, etc. We have been taking pictures and place a picture applicable to the box on the facing, left page.<br/>
<br/>
For those interested, the link for Oberon is below:<br/>

<br/>
While these journal covers are on the expensive side, they are truly works of art, available in many designs and colors but they will last a lifetime, are handmade and include a blank journal. Refills blank journals are available from the same company but these appear to be standard sizes, available from most Staples or other office supply stores.<br/>

Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I started letterboxing, I didn't really have much of a clue <br/>
what to do in the log book.  I got a neat artist's sketch book from <br/>
Schwartz's that has a transparent green cover. I stamped my personal <br/>
stamp on the first page, and it shows through for a neat effect.  <br/>
Also on the front page I have all of information needed to get the <br/>
book to me if it ever gets mis-placed.  I also keep track of my <br/>
current FPHAEX counts on the first page.<br/>
<br/>
I generally use the right side to stamp my "finds".  I have recoded <br/>
the find #, the date, and usually the name of the box, although I've <br/>
gotten quite lax in keeping up with it other than the #.  On the <br/>
left page I have stamped my "plants".  I stamp HHs in with my finds, <br/>
unless they are my HHs, which go with my Ps.  I have my exchanges <br/>
starting in the back of my logbook working towards the front.  Yes, <br/>
my log book is a twisted mess, and I don't suggest anyone to follow <br/>
my system.<br/>
<br/>
After seeing other LBers log books, I intend to do things completely <br/>
different with my next log book.  I will make it more like a diary.  <br/>
As I plant, find, echange, etc. I'll start at the beginning and go <br/>
consecutively.  I will note the # of the P,F, or whatever, the date, <br/>
name, and record a note about the experience.  This is what I would <br/>
encourage new letterboxers to do.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, I think we could do new letterboxers a service by <br/>
having more helpful information about how to begin letterboxing than <br/>
what is found at the LBNA site.  The FAQ that everyone refers to is <br/>
out of date and it only touches the surface.  I didn't find it <br/>
overly helpful.  Maybe we should make one of our own for all the new <br/>
LBers in our area.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we began letterboxing it was almost a spur-of-the-moment <br/>
decision.  So when we headed out of the house, we grabbed a couple of <br/>
journals that we just had on hand. I'm still using that first one. <br/>
It's 5x7, wirebound, medium weight cream colored, very slightly <br/>
speckled paper. The paper has a smooth surface. The book covers are <br/>
wood, which turned out to be a great advantage as it provides a solid <br/>
surface as I'm stamping.<br/>
I only stamp on the right hand side. I began in the front with my <br/>
finds (obviously). When I decided to plant a box, I stamped it in the <br/>
back. What then evolved was that pattern of "finds" from the front of <br/>
the book and placements from the back. I stamp multiple images on a <br/>
page. So, the stamps in the front and the stamps in the back are <br/>
moving towards eachother in the middle of the book. I do not include <br/>
many notes, although I have admired logbooks I've seen where details <br/>
of the find are included. I'm usually ready to head off to the next <br/>
box rather than sit and reflect on the current experience. I hope to <br/>
change that habit. When the book is full, I'll probably continue the <br/>
current stamping plan. I don't keep clues with the logbook but I do <br/>
have a file with many clues for boxes we've searched. I also keep <br/>
park-specific maps with the clues.<br/>
Hitchers I've launched get stamped in the back with placements. <br/>
Exchanges go with "finds" in chronological order.<br/>
I do like having all of the images in one book.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am still searching for the way that works best for me.  When we <br/>
first started letterboxing, I was just so excited to get out and find <br/>
a box, that I didn't really give much thought to the book (or even my <br/>
stamp at the time).  Our first log book was a 5" x 8" spiral sketch <br/>
book with a plain cardboard cover -- the only variety available at <br/>
the office supply store we stopped at on our way to Chicago.  I <br/>
stamped chronilogically, plants and finds all together (no exchanges <br/>
in the first book).  When I reached the back of the book, I turned it <br/>
over and stamped on the opposite sides as the paper was quite thick <br/>
and did not bleed through.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't like that the plants and finds were all mixed in amongst <br/>
eachother, and also didn't like that if I messed up a stamp, I was <br/>
stuck with it -- especially for plants as these were the stamps I had <br/>
carved.  In January 2003, we started a new log book -- a very nice 4 <br/>
x 6 leather cover book with textured tan colored pages.  With the new <br/>
book, I decided to use the log book only for finds and exchanges, and <br/>
to do plants on 3x5 cards, which I keep in a small photo album.  The <br/>
pages are a bit thinner than my first book and some of the inks bleed <br/>
through, so I will not be able to use the back sides of the pages in <br/>
this book.  This all seemed okay until a few times when I was sharing <br/>
my book with a friend and had only finds to show, as my plants were <br/>
home in the photo album.<br/>
<br/>
This second book is nearly full and I have just purchased a new book -<br/>
- a cute little bound book that looks very old English library.  It <br/>
is about 4 x 6 and has decorative edging on the pages -- I will <br/>
upload a photo later this evening.  With this book, I will try yet <br/>
another approach, along the lines of the method azobox uses -- stamp <br/>
from the front for finds and exchanges and begin stamping plants from <br/>
the back.  I will also continue to stamp plants onto the cards and <br/>
put them into the album as a more permanent record.<br/>
<br/>
As to what I put in the book besides the stamps -- I tend to make <br/>
lots of notes -- who I was with, date, box name, location, sometimes <br/>
the name of the person who planted it and the date it was planted.  <br/>
Comments about the weather, the hike, the scenery, the clues -- if it <br/>
was a fairly easy find or we had to work for it.  I also make notes <br/>
about boxes I looked for but did not find so that I can e-mail the <br/>
placer and hopefully give some helpful information, or just so that <br/>
when I come back and look again, I will know what my thought process <br/>
was.<br/>

from far enough back that you can barely see the box. I don't plan on <br/>
showing the pictures to those who want to search for the boxes, as it <br/>
would ruin the surprise, but I think it will be fun to look back at <br/>
where they were hidden. It is kind of like a Where's Waldo type of <br/>
thing. I also typed up the clues and printed them really small, cut <br/>
it out, and taped in on the facing page. The stamp went on the right <br/>
side with the printed photo. I'm the type of person who will look <br/>
back and say, "I wish I did it this way" and want to go back to find <br/>
all the stamps again just to make a new book, but I am trying to hold <br/>
back from that feeling...lol. I liked reading everyone else's ideas, <br/>

&gt; I had this past week with a fellow boxer as I am just finishing up <br/>
&gt; my second book and ready to break into a new one -- and still <br/>
&gt; looking for a comfortable balance of how to do it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So this week's TOTW is personal log books -- what type of book do <br/>
&gt; you use or do you use cards?  If you use cards, what do you do with <br/>
&gt; them?  What do you log in your book -- finds, plants, exchanges, <br/>
all <br/>
&gt; of the above?  Do you make notes?  If so, what do you record?  Do <br/>
&gt; you keep the clues as part of your log book?<br/>

stamps again just to make a new book, because I did exactly that.  Azobox<br/>
can atest to the fact that I drove down to Kalamazoo from Muskegon (about<br/>
this time last year) for the sole purpose of restamping a few of his boxes<br/>
that I had previously found into my "new" log book.  I don't even remember<br/>
now the specifics of why, but I think it was because I wanted the book to<br/>
begin cleanly at Jannuary 2003 even though I hadn't purchased it until<br/>
March/April, and during those few months I had done some of his Kazoo boxes<br/>
and a couple in Saugatuck.  So, I made the rounds to recollect those stamps<br/>
in the new book -- in the process getting caught in the dark at Woods in the<br/>
City, which is nota very friendly place to be after sunset.<br/>

&gt; RIght now I have only gone out to find one box. I love photography,<br/>
&gt; so I decided I would take a picture of where each one is hidden, but<br/>
&gt; from far enough back that you can barely see the box. I don't plan on<br/>
&gt; showing the pictures to those who want to search for the boxes, as it<br/>
&gt; would ruin the surprise, but I think it will be fun to look back at<br/>
&gt; where they were hidden. It is kind of like a Where's Waldo type of<br/>
&gt; thing. I also typed up the clues and printed them really small, cut<br/>
&gt; it out, and taped in on the facing page. The stamp went on the right<br/>
&gt; side with the printed photo. I'm the type of person who will look<br/>
&gt; back and say, "I wish I did it this way" and want to go back to find<br/>
&gt; all the stamps again just to make a new book, but I am trying to hold<br/>
&gt; back from that feeling...lol. I liked reading everyone else's ideas,<br/>
&gt; it gives me some good ones!<br/>
