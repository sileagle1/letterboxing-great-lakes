<br>
I went letterboxing on my day off, and my husband went to school and<br>
work.  When I came home, I told him about a very unusual part of my<br>
sleuthful day.<br>
<br>
<br>
Me: "So there I was, at this library, looking in this section for this<br>
false book that holds the LB, and suddenly this woman sidles up to me<br>
and says, quietly, 'I think we're looking for the same thing.'"<br>
<br>
My husband (mock horror):  "Oh the humanity!  The caste of secrecy has<br>
been violated!"  (mock seriousness) "So did you have to kill her?"<br>
<br>
Me (eyebrow raised):  "Gubuh?  KILL HER?  Are you stoned?"<br>
<br>
<br>
[interjection here -- my husband is well aware of all the facets of this<br>
hobby, including the stealth and secrecy, and is my frequent companion<br>
on many of my searches.  He is also very silly]<br>
<br>
<br>
Husband:  "Sure, it's like the movie 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith,' isn't it?  Once<br>
you guys find out you're competing for the same prize, you've gotta get<br>
rid of the competition, right?"<br>
<br>
Me (both eyebrows raised):  "......you do know that we even have<br>
gatherings, sometimes, right?  Where whole bunches of us meet up in a<br>
park and letterbox together?"<br>
<br>
Husband (quietly):  "My god.  How did you make it out of there alive?"<br>
<br>

Funny story.<br>

I went letterboxing on my day off, and my husband went to school and<br>
work. When I came home, I told him about a very unusual part of my<br>

there is more story being written.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking that the next never-ending letterbook I should do should<br>
be a murder mystery.  The previous finder would have to write how they<br>
 first escaped being murdered, then how they themselves are planning<br>
to murder the next finder.  It could cause "issues" though if a muggle<br>
found the book...<br>
