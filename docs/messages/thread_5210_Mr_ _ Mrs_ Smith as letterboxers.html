I went letterboxing on my day off, and my husband went to school and<br/>
work.  When I came home, I told him about a very unusual part of my<br/>
sleuthful day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me: "So there I was, at this library, looking in this section for this<br/>
false book that holds the LB, and suddenly this woman sidles up to me<br/>
and says, quietly, 'I think we're looking for the same thing.'"<br/>
<br/>
My husband (mock horror):  "Oh the humanity!  The caste of secrecy has<br/>
been violated!"  (mock seriousness) "So did you have to kill her?"<br/>
<br/>
Me (eyebrow raised):  "Gubuh?  KILL HER?  Are you stoned?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[interjection here -- my husband is well aware of all the facets of this<br/>
hobby, including the stealth and secrecy, and is my frequent companion<br/>
on many of my searches.  He is also very silly]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Husband:  "Sure, it's like the movie 'Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith,' isn't it?  Once<br/>
you guys find out you're competing for the same prize, you've gotta get<br/>
rid of the competition, right?"<br/>
<br/>
Me (both eyebrows raised):  "......you do know that we even have<br/>
gatherings, sometimes, right?  Where whole bunches of us meet up in a<br/>
park and letterbox together?"<br/>
<br/>
Husband (quietly):  "My god.  How did you make it out of there alive?"<br/>
<br/>

there is more story being written.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that the next never-ending letterbook I should do should<br/>
be a murder mystery.  The previous finder would have to write how they<br/>
 first escaped being murdered, then how they themselves are planning<br/>
to murder the next finder.  It could cause "issues" though if a muggle<br/>
found the book...<br/>
