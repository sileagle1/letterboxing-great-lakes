<br>
It contains 3 stamps, one an image of my Dad straight out of boot <br>
camp in 1967, then my "Thank You!!" stamp and "on bended knee" by <br>
mudflingingfools of Maine.<br>
<br>
There is only one logbook, a nice one that I will present to my Dad <br>
for his 60th birthday this November.<br>
<br>
I've had this box going around as a postal, and making some <br>
appearances at gatherings as it travels. I've been asking people to <br>
write something more than just, "thanks for the nice stamp."<br>
<br>
I want people to write a tribute to those who have fought or served <br>
during the Vietnam War, as so many were spit upong (including my Dad).<br>
<br>
I know that at gatherings people just want to log in and move on. I <br>
understand this and will have a header page with the BoaF Event Stamp <br>
and I just ask you to stamp in and write your trailname/city/state.<br>
<br>
If you wish to write more, please feel free to. Several have pre-<br>
written expressions of gratitude that they have taped inside the <br>
book. If you have any military themed stamps you would like to stamp <br>
into the log book, feel free too.<br>
<br>
I'm amazed at the stories, stamps and trinkets that have been <br>
included in this book. I know my Dad will love it!!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
