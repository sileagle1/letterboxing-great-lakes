to pull due to the fact that the area it was in had been roped off <br>
for dune preservation, has been replanted in a new location and the <br>
clues have been updated accordingly.<br>
<br>
If you have not already taken the trip out to this beautifully <br>
restored lighthouse, it is a wonderful spring afternoon drive up to <br>
Whitehall, especially if you take scenic drive up from North <br>
Muskegon along Lake Michigan (hint, hint...  there are boxes in <br>
North Muskegon and at Duck Lake).<br>
<br>
This is one of my favorite lighthouses!<br>
