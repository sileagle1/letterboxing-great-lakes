                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Flava Flav Fried Chicken stamp is missing. I magnatized it to an old generator thing that had been behind a building for who knows how many years. <br/>
<br/>
I place the stamp and within 4 weeks they remove the unit my stamp was stuck to :-(<br/>
<br/>
I WILL re-carve this one and get him back out there.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, I drove by FFFC today and their marquee said that Fav will be there at 11:00 am from the 1st - the 8th.<br/>
<br/>
There will be no stamp, but a LOT of people if you want to fight the crowds to meet him.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I'd be a little leary if he asks you to rub his clock. Just sayin'<br/>
