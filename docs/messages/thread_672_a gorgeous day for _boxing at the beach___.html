                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday Deedle &amp; I went to the beach to find Huntington #1.  It's not actually on the beach - the beach is just a part of this marvelous reservation in the Cleveland Metroparks.  After all the reports recently of boxes gone missing, boxes threatened to go missing, etc., we were very happy to find a box that has withstood the test of time quite well (this box was planted in 2001) and still in such good shape.  And we always love clues that put us by an ice cream stand :)<br/>
<br/>
So we then ventured further down the Lake Erie coast to look for Beach Box, placed in Rocky River earlier this year.  This small park had a decent crowd, but we thought it would be a good opportunity to fine-tune our stealth skills.  Before heading off, we pretended to admire the view (OK, we were admiring the view) as we discussed our game plan.  When we got to the hiding spot, however, no box.  We fear that this box's hiding place might have been too easily stumbled upon by "outsiders."  We emailed the placers so they can confirm the box's status.  <br/>

All in all, a wonderful Sunday here in Cleveland.<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
