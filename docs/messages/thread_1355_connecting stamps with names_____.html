fun of seeing stamps from boxers whose posts we've seen but whose<br/>
stamps were new to us.<br/>
Pale Puppy Posse and Armadillo Jo, among others, had visited boxes in<br/>
the Fort Custer State Recreation area near Battle Creek/Kalamazoo. <br/>
We loved your stamps!<br/>
I'm happy to note that, despite reports to the contrary, all three<br/>
Breakfast Elves (Snap, Crackle and Pop) are doing fine and await new<br/>
visitors.<br/>
Also, Flutterby, while a bit damp and scattered by critters whose log<br/>
he shared, is back in the box and ready for summer.<br/>
