<br>
In answer to your question...  Yes, anyone who is a member of the GL <br>
List can play, no matter if they actually live in the region or not.  <br>
Now, the more you've letterboxed in this region, the more choices you <br>
will have when making up your list (and there may be a slight advantage <br>
to having some unique items on your list), but the game is set up so <br>
that even if you have never found a box in the GL region or exchanged <br>
with any of the folks on the list, there are still 30 items you can put <br>
on your list.<br>
<br>
The more the merrier!<br>

Actually, I've been thinking about that....how someone's presence in<br>
the GL region might benefit in the BINGO game. While there are some<br>
categories in which those of us who regularly box here might have a<br>
leg up, there is no more likihood that those items will be chosen when<br>
SpringChick starts pulling them out of a hat on January 1.<br>
So the out-of-region boxer has a perfectly good chance of walking away<br>
with the booty.<br>
And as has been said, the more the merrier.<br>
We're making our list and checking it (at least) twice.<br>
<br>
The side-wager pool of guessing when the BINGO game will finally end<br>
is slowly coming together as well.<br>
I'm still deciding how to have the players submit their guesses.<br>
More to come....<br>
