                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah to Minnesota and RedCat!!  For those of you wondering, I have been checking out <br>
locations for a large gathering in Indiana that will meet the needs for a large gathering.  <br>
One that has good camping facilities, large shelters, good trails and other park attractions.  <br>
And convenient for me and other travelers.<br>
<br>
The past 2 years were a bit rough trying to manage 2 houses and all that goes with that.  <br>
We are down to one house now and recovering from the stress.  What I learned from trying <br>
to reserve a state park shelter/location is that I can reserve one up to 1 year in advance.  It <br>
is really too early to reserve one for 2009, but if the consensus of the group is that 2009 <br>
will be Indiana's turn, I would like to have permission to procure a site about June 1 of this <br>
year.  The big shelters seem to get reserved early.<br>
<br>
For the sake of discussion, my preference would be one of the following:<br>
<br>
1. Pokagon - easy access to the Indiana Toll Road, not far from my family's lake house.  It <br>
has 2 large shelters and multiple trails.  Camping, Park Inn, water activities and horse <br>
trails.<br>
2. Whitewater SP/Brookville Reservoir - closest to my home; near other local letterboxers.  <br>
Camping, moderate to rugged trails, boating, horse trails, fishing.  Not far from I-74, and <br>
box-filled SE IN, SW OH.  May be a bit warmer than northern parks.<br>
3.  Turkey Run - A beautiful park in Indiana.  Inconvenient for me to get to, so I'd need to <br>
recruit many more boxers to plant.  Has an Inn/Restaurant on site.<br>
<br>
If there are others in Indiana who would want to help me, or have another location in mind <br>
for 2009, please contact me.  It is unfortunate, but the past 2, and the next 2 gatherings <br>
will fall on the day of, or the day after my dh's graduations.  Being the principal, I can't ask <br>
him to skip those events.<br>
<br>
I've got to make plans to get to Minnesota now.<br>

<br>
I did a quick look at the parks you mentioned by using the DNR website http://www.in.gov/dnr/parklake/properties/parkres.html <br>
<br>
I know you said Turkey Run isn't near you, but it sure does look like a scenic park with lots of good trails!  But obviously it makes the most sense to choose what works best for you and/or other organizers.<br>

We were at Pokagon last fall--it was wonderful.  Walked a little bit <br>
on the trails.  They have a nice nature center.  Don't know what the <br>
camping facilities are like since we were there in November, but the <br>
inn is marvelous.  Lots of common areas to sit and read or play games <br>
or whatever.  Long passageway with lots of comfie chairs overlooking <br>
the lake.  The lake/beach is right by the inn.  They have a very nice <br>
Sunday brunch on Sunday mornings.  Plus, they have an organized <br>
birdwalk early every Sunday morning :~)  <br>

<br>
Yeah, it would be good to get it confirmed for Indiana in 2009.  I see that<br>
2 of the parks you mentioned have lodges/inns and they take reservations up<br>
to TWO years in advance.  As soon as Indiana is confirmed, and then a park<br>
selected and a shelter reserved, lodge reservations could be made<br>
immediately.  However it seems camping reservations can only be made 6<br>
months in advance.<br>

31.  Could you fill me in on the weekend activities?  Is it a weekend <br>

If you're coming from out of town and want to plant a box, you can either mail the box to The Red Cat to plant for you, or you could plant it yourself late Friday or early Saturday and then write out clues for people.  You could get copies of the clues made (in the past we've had copies made at our hotel or a nearby office store) or just post a master copy at the event  and have people copy them down by hand.<br>

If you'd like to send a box for the gathering, just let me know if<br>
you'd like me or one of my helpers hide it and if you want it to be<br>

I took Gooble Gobble's list of box ideas and posted it on the blog.  I<br>
took out the ones that have been claimed and added a few others.  If<br>
