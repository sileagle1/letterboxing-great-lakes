                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah to Minnesota and RedCat!!  For those of you wondering, I have been checking out <br/>
locations for a large gathering in Indiana that will meet the needs for a large gathering.  <br/>
One that has good camping facilities, large shelters, good trails and other park attractions.  <br/>
And convenient for me and other travelers.<br/>
<br/>
The past 2 years were a bit rough trying to manage 2 houses and all that goes with that.  <br/>
We are down to one house now and recovering from the stress.  What I learned from trying <br/>
to reserve a state park shelter/location is that I can reserve one up to 1 year in advance.  It <br/>
is really too early to reserve one for 2009, but if the consensus of the group is that 2009 <br/>
will be Indiana's turn, I would like to have permission to procure a site about June 1 of this <br/>
year.  The big shelters seem to get reserved early.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of discussion, my preference would be one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. Pokagon - easy access to the Indiana Toll Road, not far from my family's lake house.  It <br/>
has 2 large shelters and multiple trails.  Camping, Park Inn, water activities and horse <br/>
trails.<br/>
2. Whitewater SP/Brookville Reservoir - closest to my home; near other local letterboxers.  <br/>
Camping, moderate to rugged trails, boating, horse trails, fishing.  Not far from I-74, and <br/>
box-filled SE IN, SW OH.  May be a bit warmer than northern parks.<br/>
3.  Turkey Run - A beautiful park in Indiana.  Inconvenient for me to get to, so I'd need to <br/>
recruit many more boxers to plant.  Has an Inn/Restaurant on site.<br/>
<br/>
If there are others in Indiana who would want to help me, or have another location in mind <br/>
for 2009, please contact me.  It is unfortunate, but the past 2, and the next 2 gatherings <br/>
will fall on the day of, or the day after my dh's graduations.  Being the principal, I can't ask <br/>
him to skip those events.<br/>
<br/>
I've got to make plans to get to Minnesota now.<br/>

<br/>
I did a quick look at the parks you mentioned by using the DNR website http://www.in.gov/dnr/parklake/properties/parkres.html <br/>
<br/>
I know you said Turkey Run isn't near you, but it sure does look like a scenic park with lots of good trails!  But obviously it makes the most sense to choose what works best for you and/or other organizers.<br/>

We were at Pokagon last fall--it was wonderful.  Walked a little bit <br/>
on the trails.  They have a nice nature center.  Don't know what the <br/>
camping facilities are like since we were there in November, but the <br/>
inn is marvelous.  Lots of common areas to sit and read or play games <br/>
or whatever.  Long passageway with lots of comfie chairs overlooking <br/>
the lake.  The lake/beach is right by the inn.  They have a very nice <br/>
Sunday brunch on Sunday mornings.  Plus, they have an organized <br/>
birdwalk early every Sunday morning :~)  <br/>

Yeah, it would be good to get it confirmed for Indiana in 2009.  I see that<br/>
2 of the parks you mentioned have lodges/inns and they take reservations up<br/>
to TWO years in advance.  As soon as Indiana is confirmed, and then a park<br/>
selected and a shelter reserved, lodge reservations could be made<br/>
immediately.  However it seems camping reservations can only be made 6<br/>
months in advance.<br/>

31.  Could you fill me in on the weekend activities?  Is it a weekend <br/>

to<br/>

&gt; This will be our first gathering as well.  I am wondering how we get the boxes hidden before Saturday and clues written up when we are coming from out of town.<br/>

&gt; I've never been to a Gathering before, but I'm looking forward to May<br/>
&gt; 31. Could you fill me in on the weekend activities? Is it a weekend<br/>
&gt; of structured activities or are you pretty much on your own? Should<br/>
&gt; participants plant special letterboxes for the weekend? Thanks for<br/>
&gt; any info!<br/>

If you'd like to send a box for the gathering, just let me know if<br/>
you'd like me or one of my helpers hide it and if you want it to be<br/>

I took Gooble Gobble's list of box ideas and posted it on the blog.  I<br/>
took out the ones that have been claimed and added a few others.  If<br/>
