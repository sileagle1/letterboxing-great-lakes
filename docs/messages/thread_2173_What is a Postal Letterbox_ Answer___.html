<br>
1. What is a postal letterbox?<br>
<br>
A postal letterbox (PLB) is simply a letterbox that is mailed from<br>
letterboxer to letterboxer. A PLB typically includes only a stamp and<br>
a log, and recipients "stamp in" to the log while taking an impression<br>
of the PLB stamp in their personal journals. The PLB is then sent by<br>
mail to another letterboxer, and so on, and so on....<br>
<br>
*********************************<br>
<br>
2. How can I receive a postal letterbox?<br>
<br>
Usually the creator of a PLB will solicit the names of letterboxers<br>
who wish to receive the PLB by posting an announcement on the The<br>
Postal Letterboxing discussion group (see #7 below).  The address list<br>
of these recipients is included with the PLB, often in the form of<br>
address labels. Once a recipient has received the PLB and stamped into<br>
its journal, he or she sends it to the next person on the list, and so<br>
on. Most PLBs are restricted to a certain number of participants, and<br>
no new names are added to the list after the box is sent out. Some<br>
PLBs are always "open" for signups, however, and the names of new<br>
recipients are simply added at the end of the list. If you'd like to<br>
hear about new and current PLBs, check the PLB discussion group for<br>
announcements of new PLBS as well as a PLB database that indicates<br>
whether particular PLBs are open or closed to new recipients.<br>
<br>
*********************************<br>
<br>
3. How do I create a postal letterbox?<br>
<br>
Simply create a stamp and a log book for your PLB and then announce on<br>
the Postal Letterboxing discussion group that it's open for sign-ups.<br>
When deciding how many people to allow on your PLB list, remember that<br>
it can take up to 2 weeks for a PLB to travel from one person to the<br>
next (especially if it's traveling cross-country). If 100 people sign<br>
up for your PLB, for example, it could take 4 years for the PLB to<br>
reach the last names on the list! This could lead to long delays or a<br>
lost box if people move in the interim. PLB creators will often ask<br>
participants to use some form of delivery tracking (such as the US<br>
Postal Service's Delivery Confirmation service) so that the PLB is<br>
less likely to get lost in the mail, or email a report to the creator<br>
when they receive and send out the PLB. Knowing where the box was last<br>
and where it's headed next allows the PLB creator to send out address<br>
updates or deletions when necessary.<br>
<br>
Once a reasonable number of people have signed up for the PLB, create<br>
a list of recipients or even a set of address labels for recipients.<br>
Include delivery instructions, such as the order in which you'd like<br>
the box to move from person to person. Some PLB creators sort their<br>
list by geographic region to cut down on delivery times between<br>
recipients, others ask that the box be sent in the order that people<br>
signed up for it, and still others allow recipients to send it next to<br>
anyone they choose on the list. As the box creator, you get to decide<br>
how you would like it to move from person to person. If you have a<br>
strong preference, be sure to include detailed instructions about this<br>
as well as any reporting requests in your PLB's log book or<br>
instruction sheet.<br>
<br>
While certainly not required, some PLB creators send along a "first<br>
finders" certificate, a special hitchhiker or some other treat for the<br>
first recipient. Once you've gathered your log book, stamp, mailing<br>
list or labels and any instruction sheet or other items you'd like to<br>
include, put everything in a box or mailing envelope and drop it in<br>
the mail to start its journey. Don't forget to make a copy of the<br>
distribution list for your own reference first, though!<br>
<br>
*********************************<br>
<br>
4. How do I count postal letterboxes in my PFX count?<br>
<br>
Good question. There's no real consensus on counting postal<br>
letterboxes. The more traditionalist letterboxers would probably not<br>
count them as an F (Found) letterbox since PLBs don't typically have<br>
any challenge associated with finding them. But others may well<br>
include PLBs as an F, so it's up to your personal discretion. The same<br>
goes for counting a PLB that you create in your P count.<br>
<br>
*********************************<br>
<br>
5. What was the first postal letterbox?<br>
<br>
Legerdemaine's Flutterby box, released March 16, 2002, is generally<br>
acknowledged as the first postal letterbox. (See<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/10721 for more<br>
information.)<br>
<br>
*********************************<br>
<br>
6. Shouldn't I be careful about giving out my personal address to<br>
strangers on the Internet?<br>
<br>
Absolutely! All the usual cautions about providing personal<br>
information to people whom you've met online should apply to postal<br>
letterboxing. If the thought of adding your mailing address to a list<br>
that will be circulated to dozens of people whom you don't know makes<br>
you uneasy, then open a P.O. Box or don't participate! Adults should<br>
supervise their children's participation, and theme boxes aimed at<br>
minors or families are an incredibly bad idea since you're essentially<br>
advertising to the world that you have children in your household.<br>
That said, many postal letterboxers are active and known participants<br>
in the letterboxing community, and they seek only to expand the hobby<br>
in fun and interesting ways.<br>
<br>
When signing up for a PLB, make sure to send your mailing address to<br>
the creator directly, and NOT to a discussion group or mailing list at<br>
large (which might give thousands of people access to your name and<br>
address). The Postal Letterboxing discussion group (see below) has<br>
been set up in such a way to provide more privacy for participants,<br>
but the ultimate responsibility is yours.<br>
<br>
*********************************<br>
<br>
7. Where can I learn more about postal letterboxes?<br>
<br>
The Postal Letterboxing discussion group on Yahoo!<br>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/postal_letterboxing) is the primary<br>
forum for discussions of postal letterboxes. Discussions of postal<br>
letterboxes are discouraged on the LBNA letterboxing discussion group<br>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/letterbox-usa) for two reasons. First,<br>
postal letterboxes are necessarily limited to a small number of<br>
participants, since each PLB can only reach perhaps 30 letterboxers in<br>
a year. Second, the LBNA discussion group's message archives are open<br>
to anyone on the Internet, even those who aren't members of the group.<br>
Because of that, anyone who posts a message with personal information<br>
on the LBNA list is effectively broadcasting that information to<br>
millions of Internet users via search engines and spiders. On the<br>
other hand, the Postal Letterboxing group's archives are open only to<br>
members, so you must join the group before accessing any of the<br>
message archives. This helps to protect the privacy of participants.<br>
<br>
*********************************<br>
<br>
8. How does the Postal Letterboxing discussion group work?<br>
<br>
The Postal Letterboxing discussion group (see #7) is "first-post<br>
moderated," which means that new members are automatically set to have<br>
their messages approved by the moderators. Once a new member posts an<br>
appropriate message to the list, the moderators may at their<br>
discretion change that member's status to "unmoderated," allowing him<br>
or her to post to the list freely. This mechanism is in place to<br>
prevent spam and inappropriate messages from being sent to the list.<br>
Any member who sends spam or inappropriate/off-topic messages to the<br>
list may see their status set back to "moderated," or be removed or<br>
even banned from the group. List members who send their personal<br>
address information or a request to be added to a PLB list to the<br>
Postal Letterboxing discussion group may also see their status set<br>
back to "moderated." Those types of posts must be sent directly to the<br>
PLB creator, not to the Postal Letterboxing discussion group. All list<br>
members are expected to be respectful and cordial in group<br>
discussions, so let's all be civil, okay?<br>
<br>
A complete list of Rules for our group are posted in the Files section<br>
of the group web site, and are sent to all members once a month.<br>
Please review them.<br>
<br>

9. What is a PLB Ring?<br>
<br>
A Postal Letterbox (PLB) Ring is a small group of individuals who have<br>
joined together to share PLBs with each other. Instead of sending a<br>
PLB to individuals sequentially on a long list of addresses, members<br>
of the PLB each agree to create a PLB and mail them simulataneously to<br>
the next person on the list. When a PLB reaches the bottom of the<br>
list, it returns to the top of the list until it ultimately reaches<br>
the creator. PLB Rings are a great way for new postal letterboxers to<br>
participate since they don't have to wait many months for their first<br>
PLB to arrive, and they ensure that everyone who participates in the<br>
Ring will receive several PLBs. Watch the PLB Group for announcements<br>
and discussions of new Rings as they are created.<br>

just lurk a while, snoop around the site's features (files, databases, etc.)<br>
and just get a feel for things.  The next step would be to get your toes wet<br>
by joining our very own JACKS' Newbie Pool.  Send her an email with your<br>
request to be put into a small ring with other newbies and a seasoned postal<br>
mentor.  Then once you feel you understand the process, you can join in<br>
other postals, rings or otherwise.  They are a totally different animal from<br>
"wild" letterboxes.  Really, the only thing in common is the idea of stamps<br>
and logs.  Instead of finding them, they find you, though sometimes you do<br>
have to solve clues or meet some criteria to receive one.  Postals may<br>
sometimes be a bit more artsy (not always, so don't let that deter you), and<br>
in that sense sometimes fall into the "mail art" category.   Speaking only<br>
for myself, I tend to put more effort into a stamp I use for a postal than<br>
one I hide in the wild.  <br>

Hope this helps.......posting the FAQ's was a great idea, Stacey!<br>
