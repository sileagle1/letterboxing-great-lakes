Ah, no letterboxing for us this weekend. We just bought our first house and<br/>
in our excitement have already started packing...unfortunately the<br/>
letterboxing stuff was one of the first things packed. It all fit in one<br/>
box! Along with the cardmaking and embossing stuff!! But we did check on the<br/>
Coal Miner's Daughter box on Thursday and scout out some new hiding spots<br/>
for a series that was born from the stamps that were supposed to attend the<br/>
SILO II event (we didn't make it, by the time we decided we weren't too sick<br/>
to go it was too late to make it up there in time...but that was the day we<br/>

I hope everyone took advantage of the wonderful weather we had this<br/>
weekend. Coffee Beans and I managed to get out and find a few boxes on<br/>
Saturday. The snow made some of the clues a bit challenging (where is<br/>
that asphalt path...this all looks like snow!) and we had to dig out a<br/>
box or two from under the ice and snow, but we had a great time. The 35<br/>
degree weather was down-right balmy! Thanks to Growly, Kiddywriter and<br/>

 ============<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we were happy to be out most of the day on Saturday! We did a 2-mile<br/>
hike to find 3 boxes, then another 2-mile hike to find 2 boxes, then a<br/>
shorter hike to look at a box solidly frozen in place. Due to the rain the<br/>
prior weekend, a large puddle had formed in the area of the box.<br/>
Unfortunately the ice was so high, it was even covering the flaps of the<br/>
Lock'n'Lock container.  We quickly realized there was no way we could safely<br/>
get it loose, nor get it open.  I regret not taking a photo - it was quite<br/>
funny to see the camo box top in easy reach, but no way to actually get to<br/>
the contents!  We'll have to return another day after a thaw...  On the<br/>
bright side (pun intended), there was so much sun reflecting on the white<br/>
snow that we both got quite a bit of color.  At a party that night, everyone<br/>
kept asking where we had been to get so tan!<br/>
