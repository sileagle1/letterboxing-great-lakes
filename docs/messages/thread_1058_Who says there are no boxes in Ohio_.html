So I started to compile a list of letterboxes we would<br/>
be near to find when we're done in Piketon (which,<br/>
according to my friend whose mother was born there,<br/>
would be very, very soon after we got there).  106<br/>
boxes!  And we've only got three days, and we were<br/>
going to spend _some_ of that time admiring dogwoods<br/>
in bloom and oh, maybe eating &amp; sleeping a little bit.<br/>
 I'm just floored, because when I came up with boxes<br/>
for us to find on our way to and around Adrian,<br/>
Michigan, last year, I think I only had 70-some.  <br/>
<br/>
Wow.  We may need to take an extra day... :)<br/>

Just some helpful hints:<br/>
The Chillicothe area has a lot of boxes listed. The best areas to <br/>
hit with multiple boxes would be the Great Seal State Park and the <br/>
Grandview Cemetery. Don't be discouraged as several are missing, but <br/>
not listed as such on the website. Traveling a little further south, <br/>
stop by Scioto Trails State Park for another area with several <br/>
boxes. There are two really great stamps at a Rest Area, just south <br/>
of Piketon. And if you go a little further (to Portsmouth), you <br/>
should find several nice ones there. I have a plant in Portsmouth <br/>
called "The Flood of 1998", so let me know if you find it:)<br/>
