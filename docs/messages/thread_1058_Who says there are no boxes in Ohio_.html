the calendar, saw which weekends we were free, and<br>
started searching to see what was going on in various<br>

supposed to be the secondary activity.  I decided that<br>
we should attend the Dogwood Festival in Piketon, I'm<br>
a sucker for town festivals like that.  And we'd be<br>
passing by lots of letterboxes there & back.  <br>
<br>
So I started to compile a list of letterboxes we would<br>
be near to find when we're done in Piketon (which,<br>
according to my friend whose mother was born there,<br>
would be very, very soon after we got there).  106<br>
boxes!  And we've only got three days, and we were<br>
going to spend _some_ of that time admiring dogwoods<br>
in bloom and oh, maybe eating & sleeping a little bit.<br>
 I'm just floored, because when I came up with boxes<br>
for us to find on our way to and around Adrian,<br>
Michigan, last year, I think I only had 70-some.  <br>
<br>
Wow.  We may need to take an extra day... :)<br>

Just some helpful hints:<br>
The Chillicothe area has a lot of boxes listed. The best areas to <br>
hit with multiple boxes would be the Great Seal State Park and the <br>
Grandview Cemetery. Don't be discouraged as several are missing, but <br>
not listed as such on the website. Traveling a little further south, <br>
stop by Scioto Trails State Park for another area with several <br>
boxes. There are two really great stamps at a Rest Area, just south <br>
of Piketon. And if you go a little further (to Portsmouth), you <br>
should find several nice ones there. I have a plant in Portsmouth <br>
called "The Flood of 1998", so let me know if you find it:)<br>

excluding the Columbus area boxes for now.  I don't<br>
think we're going to go south enough to Portsmouth<br>

us busy in Chillocothe this time around :)  How long<br>
is the drive from that rest area to Portsmouth,<br>
