&gt; Mystery boxes really fascinate me, so I'd be very interested in a <br/>
&gt; discussion on this thread.  So far, there is no such thing as a <br/>
&gt; generic mystery box. Each one I have found has been unique, <br/>
&gt; particularly imbued with the personality of its creator.  This is <br/>
&gt; because there is so much work that goes into developing a <br/>
&gt; good mystery, the creator just shines through in every element of <br/>
&gt; the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I think for me this is part of the draw with mystery boxes -- the <br/>
fact that each one is so unique from the next and there is always an <br/>
element of surprise, not knowing what you will run up against, right <br/>
up until the end -- and too, the flavor that is given by the <br/>
personality of the creator.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer mystery boxes where I can at least get the location <br/>
narrowed down before leaving the house.  It doesn't need to be the <br/>
specific spot, but the correct city and park are nice to know.  Some <br/>
of my favorites require a bit of running around on site to get the <br/>
right trail or area of a park or city.  This is okay, and it can <br/>
really be a lot of fun running around town collecting clues to a <br/>
box.  <br/>
<br/>
But once I've followed the clues and get to the spot where the box <br/>
is hidden, I want the clue to be pretty clear about where to find <br/>
the letterbox.  My pet peeve is getting to the end of the clues and <br/>
not having a clue where to look for the box.  This puts the seeker <br/>
in a position to have to look high and low for the hiding spot and <br/>
can result in the upset of an area, turning over rocks and loose <br/>
logs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think theme is perhaps more important with a mystery box than a <br/>
non-mystery box because it provides a cohesiveness.  It gives the <br/>
seeker a framework within which to look and interpret clues.  Having <br/>
a theme also helps as the creator of a mystery box to keep a focus <br/>
when creating the clues.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite clues are those where I learn something by doing the <br/>
research required to solve the clues, riddle or puzzle -- perhaps <br/>
about the location, or the theme (i.e. maybe a person, a bit of <br/>
history, a culture or a custom), or even about the person who <br/>
created the box.  Of course some appeal more than others because <br/>
they concentrate on things that are of interest to me, such as boxes <br/>
about a particular musical group or band, but this is more related <br/>
to personal preference than the quality of the mystery. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; The "quality" of the stamp is less important to me than the <br/>
&gt; process by which I found it.  Nonetheless, I delight in skilled <br/>
&gt; carving, or clever jokes embedded in the stamp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
Yes I would agree with this wholeheartedly.  With a mystery box it <br/>
is more about the process.  Of course all of the mystery boxes I <br/>
have found have included very nice stamps, and perhaps I would feel <br/>
different about this if that had not been the case.<br/>
<br/>
I also echo some of the comments made by Azobox regarding the <br/>
frustration of *mystery spoilers* both from the perspective of a <br/>
seeker and a placer.<br/>
<br/>
As a seeker, I have several mystery boxes from all over the country <br/>
in various stages of unravel -- some I have run stuck on, some seem <br/>
the type that will fall into place with time, and still others I <br/>
simply haven't had time to complete.  Sometimes you garner clues and <br/>
hints from reading totally unrelated letterboxing posts or clues, <br/>
and this always gives that "Aha" feeling.  But there is a difference <br/>
between putting two and two together to make such a connection, and <br/>
having a mystery outrightly spoiled by a careless letterboxing <br/>
story.  And sometimes it may seem innocent to the person posting -- <br/>
a list of boxes found on a particular day may include a mystery box, <br/>
thus giving away a perhaps unknown location simply by placing the <br/>
other boxes that were found that day.<br/>
<br/>
As a placer, it can be extremely frustrating to put the time and <br/>
work into creating a mystery, putting together a story or a puzzle <br/>
referencing an obscure landmark, etc., and then have another <br/>
letterboxer's clues inadvertently give away your mystery by <br/>
referencing the same landmark AND giving location and/or further <br/>
details.  There is then the choice -- do I rework the clues or just <br/>
hope people don't make the connection?  I appreciate when people <br/>
take the time to at least read through mystery box clues before <br/>
posting their own clues so this is less likely to happen.<br/>
<br/>
One of our favorite (and most frustrating) hunts was the Newton <br/>
Apple box in NYC.  Prior to leaving MI, we had narrowed down the <br/>
general location of the box as well as formulated some theories of <br/>
how to interpret the cryptic clues once there.  Old Shoe and I spent <br/>
the better part of a day trying different possibilities and finally <br/>
at the end of an exhausting day spent trapsing around a several <br/>
square block area in NYC, we called it quits.  We found out later <br/>
that we had been right on with one of our interpretations and either <br/>
missed the box or it simply wasn't there.  Even though it was <br/>
disappointing not finding the box after all that -- it still stands <br/>
out in my mind as one of the most fun hunts we've done.<br/>

&gt; &gt; people have found to do this, etc.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; When you have your box planted, post the clues to the LbNA <br/>

I hadn't even considered that people outside the area might <br/>
hoard up mystery clues for solving at leisure on the off chance <br/>
they might  visit the area some day. I know how I'll be spending <br/>
the days I spend indoors this winter (:-&gt;), but more importantly <br/>
this bit of information will influence mystery boxes I place. <br/>
<br/>
While I want letterboxers to pursue my mystery boxes (and other <br/>
boxes), I place because it feels good.  I enjoy the process of <br/>
conceptualizing a box; I am pleased when I can find the right <br/>
artwork that inspires the stamp, I love to make custom journals, <br/>
most of all I like to explore a theme very fully and see just how far <br/>
I can take it.  Once I make something, I don't like to have it lying <br/>
around the house; letterboxing has provided me with a venue.  <br/>
<br/>
I love the research involved in developing letterboxes; I wish I <br/>
could share everything I've learned with letterboxers who visit, <br/>
but find myself making having to make choices--I know the <br/>
letterboxer will want to move on to the next box not sit in the <br/>
woods reading a dissertation while swatting huge mosquitoes.  <br/>
With a mystery box, the seeker does some of the research I've <br/>

<br/>
Most importantly, planting a box--particularly a mystery box that <br/>
demands so much of its creator--is a way of reaching out to <br/>
those who enjoy the things I enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Both Azobox and SpringChick addressed the issue of <br/>
thoughtless posters giving away locations of mystery boxes <br/>
through list discussion, clues, or box placement.  I try not to post <br/>
that I've found a mystery box until months after I've found it, and <br/>
even then I try to avoid mentioning its name on open lists.  I do <br/>
this not because because I'm averse to discreet discussion, but <br/>
I don't trust myself not to let something inadvertently slip.  <br/>
<br/>
As to clues or placement giving away a mystery box location, if a <br/>
placer has not solved the mystery she or he may not even know <br/>
it's there.  If this happened to one of my mystery boxes I might <br/>
write to the placer of the second (nonmystery) box and see if <br/>
there was something we could work out, and if not I think I'd <br/>
rather change my clues than hope letterboxers don't make the <br/>
connection.  The one thing you can say about letterboxers is that <br/>
they're a particularly intelligent bunch.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to talk a little more about the mystery<br/>
box thread.  One of the first ideas I came up with for<br/>
planting a box of my own was for a mystery box.  In<br/>
this instance, the main reason for making it a mystery<br/>
box was to keep the location low-key, in case<br/>
non-boxers googled the location and learned about the<br/>
box and then harm befell the box (or location) --<br/>
which is entirely possible, since that's how I learned<br/>
about letterboxing in the first place, while searching<br/>
for information for a location I was directed towards<br/>
clues for a box planted there.  Then as i thought more<br/>
about the location (and after having read through<br/>
numerous clues for other boxes) decided that in<br/>
addition to having to do a little research to find the<br/>
box, it might be fun to make the directions to follow<br/>
to the box once you got to the location a little more<br/>
cryptic, too.  The box is still in process (as all<br/>
mine &amp; Deedle's are, I know).  <br/>
<br/>
I really admire the mystery clues...even if a lot of<br/>
them have me banging my head against the desk because<br/>
for the life of me I can't figure them out.  It makes<br/>
the "ah-ha" moment when they're finally cracked that<br/>
much sweeter...well, as sweet as a moment can be when<br/>
the men in the white coats are taking you away :) <br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
