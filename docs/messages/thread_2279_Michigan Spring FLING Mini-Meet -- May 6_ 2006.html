   <br>
  The Michigan Spring FLING will be held on May 6th at Maybury State Park in Northville, Michigan.<br>
<br>
Activities:<br>
This will be a very casual gathering, on a smaller scale than other events coming up in June, July, and August. Think of it as a warm-up before the big game! The primary purposes are to meet other letterboxers and to spend some time 'boxing, either at Maybury State Park or in the surrounding areas. <br>
<br>
There are four permanent boxes at this park. We'll have copies of those clues, as well as park maps, available, and will also hide another 4-6 temporary boxes for the event. If you are interested in contributing a letterbox for the event, please let us know. We'd be glad to hide it in advance for you, and distribute the clues that day. (Of course, you may hide a box yourself and distribute clues... or even plant a word-of-mouth box, or plan some other surprise for everyone.) However, since there are already four boxes at this park, we don't anticipate or recommend leaving any of the temporary boxes planted permanently.<br>
<br>
There will be a Spring FLING event stamp, but we don't plan to have a table with traveling event stamps or hitchhikers, nor are any formal workshops planned. The main emphasis will really be on sharing stories and ideas with fellow letterboxers, then heading out on the trails in small groups as you wish.<br>
<br>
Outside the park, but within about a 10-mile radius, you can find letterboxes in South Lyon, Brighton, Milford, Commerce Township, Walled Lake, West Bloomfield, Northville, Livonia, and Westland. A bit farther than that takes you to Orchard Lake, Redford, Dearborn, or Ann Arbor. If you're from this area, here's a great chance to hunt that box you've been meaning to find. If you're from farther away, you'll have the opportunity to sample the offerings from a variety of creative Southeast Michigan 'boxers... many of which have just been planted in the last year or so.<br>
<br>
Schedule for the day:<br>
8am: Park Opens<br>
10 - 11:30am: Exchanges and Mingling at Maple shelter<br>
11:30am: Lunch<br>
All Day: Letterboxing<br>
Dusk: Park Closes<br>
<br>
Lunch:<br>
We will provide lunch consisting of sandwich fixings (bread, meats, cheeses, etc.) and beverages. Each attendee is asked to bring a side item or dessert.<br>
<br>
Directions and Accommodations:<br>
We've reserved the Maple picnic shelter. Enter the park from the Eight Mile Road entrance. (Note that the park mailing address is the Beck Road entrance, which leads to the equestrian area, but not to the main park.) A Michigan State Park pass ($6 daily, $24 annual) is required. After the registration booth, turn left and drive to the farthest parking lot. Head down the short trail, and then bear slightly left to the Maple picnic shelter.<br>
<br>
There are restrooms and a playground nearby. Dogs are permitted in the State Park, but must be on a six foot leash.  One of the major hiking/biking trails through the park is paved, and wheelchair-accessible, as is the path to the shelter.<br>
<br>
Please RSVP (reply to us, or use the AtlasQuest event page at http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=147 ) so we can plan for lunch and handouts, and let us know if you have any questions or suggestions!<br>
   <br>
  Hope to see many of you there!<br>
