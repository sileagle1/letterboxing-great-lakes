This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

Thanks to all of you who wished us well at state.  Eric didn't do as well as we had hoped, but we weren't too disappointed.  It was a great experience for all of us.<br/>
