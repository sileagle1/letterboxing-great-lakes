                    <div class="plaintext-content">To those of you that lurk (like we do)or participate on the Big list, <br>
you know that Tonto and I are in a little bit of a bind.  We aren't <br>
sure what to do...We planted a box on April 23 called "Cicada Mania" <br>
in honor of the 17 year cicada invasion soon to strike our area.  We <br>
have received a steady flow of "contact the placer" remarks on the <br>
box..all very complimentery with no problems mentioned about the <br>
clues or the area.  We were very excited about all the "hits" it was <br>
getting until a few days ago when we received an email from a first <br>
time letterboxer frustrated that she couldn't find the box due to the <br>
clues being too confusing and vague, and she gave up after searching <br>
for 45 minutes. And if that wasn't bad enough, upon her retreat back <br>
to the parking area she found that her brand new car had been broken <br>
into and her purse had been stolen!  <br>
<br>
She emailed us to let out her frustration and to suggest that we <br>
change the clues giving more exact directions and that we should warn <br>
everyone to consider that this is a dangerous area before attempting <br>
this box.  Tonto has lived in this area all of his 58 years, and we <br>
feel that Orland Park is by no means any less safe than any other <br>
suburban forest preserve.  We wouldn't hide a box in an area knowing <br>
it was considered more dangerous than any other!  This preserve is <br>
across the street from a middle to upper income residencial area and <br>
very well used for biking, hiking, walking etc. <br>
<br>
We responded back that we were very sorry that this unfortunate <br>
situation had happened to her.  We mentioned that as letterboxers we <br>
all take a risk going into ANY public place and cars are as likely to <br>
get broken into in a shopping mall parking lot, a grocery store.. you <br>
name it.. as much as a forest preserve.  We are vulnerable in ALL <br>
public places.  We said we would consider placing a reminder in all <br>
of our boxes that prudence and vigilience needs to be exercised when <br>
letterboxing, but we weren't comfortable on placing a warning for <br>
this box alone.<br>
<br>
Then tonight, I read the daily digest from the Big list..to our <br>
horror she brought this up on the big list under the <br>
subject.."BEWARE: Northern Illinois"  Yikes!  It was bad enough to <br>
have your clues disected and critiqued (We did get a chuckle about <br>
the grammar and punctuation comments!) But, the line was drawn when <br>
she actually posted that her husband thought we had set her up to be <br>
a victim!  The post suggested that we were laying in wait to break <br>
into her car while she was out looking for our box!  I feel sick to <br>
my stomach as I write this...If I wasn't so upset, I'd be <br>
hysterically laughing at the thought of "Teacher" Tiptoe & "Elder" <br>
Tonto living the life of Bonnie & Clyde...But we aren't laughing!  We <br>
are really upset by this. <br>
<br>
At first, we took it all with a grain of salt knowing that this was <br>
her very first attempt at a box..<br>
Others can defend us by pointing out the insanity of thinking that we <br>
would put out clues, and three weeks later still be hanging out at <br>
the parking lot waiting to commit a crime! (BTW, we do have <br>
alibi's..I've been up to my eyeballs with my Fine Arts Night coming <br>
next week!...You know what I mean Leapin' Lizard and Mrs. Cottontail!)<br>
It's almost comical...But seriously, think of the potential <br>
ramifications of these accusations not only for us, but for all of us <br>
that love this hobby!  Not so funny.<br>
<br>
There was some discussion questioning the safety of all the Cook <br>
County Forest Preserves..this covers a lot of boxes and boxers!<br>
<br>
The situation gets more complicated when on the 10 o'clock news <br>
tonight the lead story was of a murder which happened today in a <br>
Glenview forest preserve(a northern suburb of Chicago and part of the <br>
vast Cook County FP system. The man had apparently been hiking to <br>
keep fit.<br>
 <br>
All of this brings up many questions...Any thoughts to help us muddle <br>
through this?  Those that have actually found this box could you <br>
weigh in?..Those that live in the Chicagoland area and have boxes in <br>
CCFP...Anybody?<br>
Tiptoe...and Tonto who is shaking his head...<br>

haven't had any problems (other than going in circles a few times <br>
with some clues!).<br>
<br>
I think most of the comments on the big list say the same thing - <br>
don't blame letterboxing, it could happen anywhere, anytime!<br>

We certainly plan to look for that box the next time we are down your <br>
way.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good grief.  No, I don't lurk on the big list. Enough boxers have<br>
warned me away that I've never even had the urge to peek. So maybe I<br>
only have one side of the arguement here. With my limited information,<br>
I'm going to comment anyway.<br>
<br>
CCFP covers a LOT of ground.  Planting in the Dan Ryan Woods? Not such<br>
a great idea. I know that, YOU know that. We're not going to be that<br>
stupid.  Planting near Camp Sullivan? Heck, there probably isn't a<br>
safer place on the planet.<br>
<br>
Orland Park is money. It's folks living in half million dollar homes<br>
and paying other people to scrub their floors with toothbrushes. <br>
Orland Park is where baby boomers go to retire after snagging<br>
ridiculous parachute packages(and the home of the BEST Chinese food<br>
you'll ever eat).  It is not generally a high crime area. The<br>
residents tend to think of crime as being someone who didn't<br>
redecorate for Mothers' Day.<br>
<br>
The odds are good that it was some stupid teen that saw her purse on<br>
the seat. (Who leaves their purse in the car on a hike?) Smash-n-grabs<br>
happen.  Even in police parking lots. (Don't ask, just accept)<br>
<br>
I'm sure she's hurt and angry and reacting badly. Any one of us would<br>
probably lash out too.  That doesn't make her comments worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Northern Illinois is less safe than Southern Illinois simply because<br>
we have more folks per square inch, more folks per folks that are<br>
lacking resources, and more opportunities to do wrong. It is not<br>
UNsafe.  Orland Park is certainly safER than a lot of communities on<br>
this point of the compass. Drive 45 minutes East from there on<br>
127/130th and drop your kid off on foot to hike around with a clue<br>
sheet for an hour. I dare you. NOT. (I live there, so I get to say that!)<br>
<br>
You did fine. She had an unfortunate event. NOT YOUR FAULT.<br>
<br>
Ish<br>
<br>
..now I gotta get my butt out to Orland to go find that box...dang it<br>
anyhow....<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too lurk on the big board and read that post.  I felt it was way <br>
out of line.  I know every time I leave my vehicle parked at a <br>
trailhead especially if there are no other cars around, I stand the <br>
chance of being broken into.  Even more so If I leave temptation <br>
(like my purse) in the car.  Is it the fault of the placer?  <br>
Absolutely not.  I'd also like to say when I started letterboxing and <br>
was reading through pages and pages of information, there was a very <br>
good piece written about letterbox safety.  One of the things it <br>
touched upon was leaving valuables out in the open in your vehicle at <br>
trailheads.  I'm sure as a placer you feel bad for her (I know I <br>
would) but in no way should you feel responsible.  As far as the <br>
safety of the game preserves I can't address that since I'm not from <br>
your area.  But I will say I have a beautiful state park near me.  <br>
When I'm there I feel completely safe.  However, crime does still <br>
happen there.  Over the years there have been a few bodies turn up, <br>
and some other incidents.  Do I feel this makes the park unsafe, No I <br>
don't.  Let's face it, anyone doing something illegal no matter what <br>
state you are in, is going to look for a secluded, remote area to do <br>
it.  Being aware of that doesn't make me afraid; it just makes me a <br>
smarter boxer.  1.  I remove anything that may be tempting to a thief <br>
out of view in my car.  Right down to CD's and change.  2.  I lock my <br>
doors.  3.  I carry pepper spay 4.  I do not box alone 5.  I make <br>
sure I'm finished well before dark.  I felt that she had newbie <br>
frustration to begin with combined with a terrible experience, and <br>
took her frustration out towards the only target she could, the <br>
placer.  Had she found the box and continued boxing for another six <br>
to eight months and THEN had her car broken into she would have never <br>
written that post that way.  She would have looked at it as what it <br>
was, a random act of crime.  ~The Cats Meow~<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The sales prices of homes in the area often have absolutely nothing to do<br>
with crime in the forest preserves in the area.  Unfortunately.  People who<br>
commit crimes have cars -- many of them might not have driver's licenses and<br>
many of them don't have insurance, but that doesn't stop an awfully lot of<br>
them from driving cars.  As far as "type" of crime goes, if they were going<br>
to break into a car for material possessions, it makes more sense to do it<br>
in fancy neighborhoods since it's unlikely that the fancy people are going<br>
to come into the poverty stricken neighborhoods to hike or bike in the<br>
forest preserves.  Particularly if you know that the police force and ranger<br>
force are spread thin as it is in patrolling the forest preserves.  They<br>
might be a lot less apt to attack you or your car in your driveway but in a<br>
forest preserve with few other folks around and the cops far outside quick<br>
response time?  Sure.  Why break into a car of someone you know probably has<br>
as much or less money than you do?  If I was poor and inclined to break into<br>
cars to supplement my income, I'd be heading for where I thought there might<br>
be something a little better to steal.<br>
<br>
And keep in mind, an awfully lot of homeless people take up housekeeping in<br>
the forest preserves, once the weather is nice enough that they can survive.<br>
Far safer for them to take up housekeeping in woods that are in nicer areas,<br>
since they also risk getting attacked in the woods.  They have no money, no<br>
food, they're hungry, they might want to buy drugs, there's a nice car<br>
sitting there that just might have some change or credit cards in it, they<br>
just might break into it if the timing is right.<br>
<br>
And look at the attack that just happened up at Camp Pine Forest Preserve<br>
this past week on a walking trail -- three men attacked, one died.  One of<br>
the men was 67, one was 77, I'm not sure of the age of the other one, and it<br>
happened about 2pm in the afternoon.  Three elderly, retired gentlemen out<br>
for an afternoon walk.  This was not a bad neighborhood.  So far the police<br>
haven't given a reason but I can't think of too many reasons that a 20-25<br>
year old male would actually *be* justified in killing one elderly man and<br>
injuring two others.<br>
<br>
Cook County forest preserves have plenty of crime.  Crime in all of them has<br>
been on the increase and, like the police told that letterboxer, it's been<br>
kinda on *more* of an increase in the southern sections of Cook County.<br>
That's why I *haven't* yet gone down for the boxes in the Orland Park,<br>
Palos, Palos Heights area yet that are in the preserves.  We found "Shake!<br>
Shake! Shake!" a couple of years ago, and that's not in a secluded area<br>
anyway, so yes, that one I'd still probably go back for today if I hadn't<br>
found it already as long as I went when there were also plenty of cars there<br>
from people fishing and such.  But with the others, I haven't been able to<br>
combine my free time with a time of day that I'll feel OK parking at those<br>
preserves.<br>
<br>
But any forest preserve in a major metropolitan area is going to have plenty<br>
of problems with their forest preserves if they have any to speak of.<br>
<br>
Unless I'm going searching for a letterbox, the only places I go anymore in<br>
the Cook County preserves are the places right out in the open unless it's<br>
plenty crowded.  And even at that, I check out the nature of the crowd.<br>
I've hiked the Cook County forest preserves for over 50 years and for quite<br>
a few years now, the only area I've been in where I've felt "safe" was the<br>
Salt Creek Bicycle Trail and Wolf Prairie.  If I'm just hiking and not<br>
letterboxing, my local hiking is now done strictly in DuPage, Kane, and<br>
DeKalb preserves.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that this lady and her husband don't know any of the local<br>
letterboxers at all at this point.  She doesn't know who might be "well<br>
known" and who isn't.  This was her first letterboxing experience.  And they<br>
might not have been thinking of the fact that there would be no need for any<br>
criminal mind to post fake clues just to draw people.  Enough people to rob<br>
are already drawn to the preserves.  This might not only have been her first<br>
letterboxing experience, but she also might not have a ton of experience<br>
with the preserves.  She went with a group of other adults in a brand new<br>
car.  The first thing I would've done was to take the car of whichever adult<br>
had the worst looking car in the group.  And leave all credit cards at home<br>
except for one which would stay right on my person.<br>
<br>
Do I think that means folks should stop placing boxes in Cook County<br>
preserves?  Nope.  It's just unfortunately another area where, while the<br>
media has been building up and popularizing this pasttime, they've fallen<br>
down on the job as far as discussing both discretion and safety.  Even on<br>
the rare occasions that discretion is discussed at all, I've yet to see any<br>
TV blurbs or magazine/newspaper articles that stress safety.   Forest<br>
preserves present a fantastic opportunity for crime.  Too many people don't<br>
realize that.  Or they don't think *they're* going to be the victim.  But<br>
*some*body has to be the victim.<br>
<br>
Even in seemingly safe areas.  Like I posted on the big list, my scariest<br>
situation to date was out in Kane County at Johnson's Mound.............and<br>
up to that point, I'd hiked Kane County trails for half a century and felt<br>
as safe as a person could feel in the woods.  Now, the guy *could* have<br>
broken into my car.  I was the only car parked up there that morning.  But<br>
I'm pretty convinced that he was actually after *me*, not simple theft,<br>
which gave me the chance to get out of there because I had seen *him* but he<br>
hadn't yet seen *me*.  But I also think that *could've* been letterbox<br>
oriented, altho I'm absolutely positive the box wasn't planted with that in<br>
mind.<br>
<br>
When I got to the top of the Mound and parked, there were 4 different trails<br>
I had to pick from.  Two of them didn't fit the clues at all, so I could<br>
discard those trails right off the bat.  The other two, I wasn't really<br>
sure.  So I decided to just pick one and start down it and see if the rest<br>
of the clues started to fit at all.  After about 10 minutes, I knew I was on<br>
the wrong trail, so I doubled back to the parking lot to take the other<br>
trail.<br>
<br>
The woods came right up to the edge of the parking lot.  Before leaving the<br>
woods and walking out into the parking lot I stopped because I saw a beat-up<br>
old pickup truck parked next to my van and no other vehicles there but our<br>
two.  So I just hung back to see what the situation might be.  Very slowly<br>
circling my van was a slimy, greasy guy -- looked like he hadn't a bath in<br>
at least a month or two -- maybe about 25 years old.  I stayed well back in<br>
the woods, and the clothes I always wear for boxing help me blend in well<br>
with the woods, just watching him.<br>
<br>
The guy circled my van about 3 times peering in the windows.  Then he<br>
glanced over at the trail I *should* have taken to find the letterbox.<br>
Walked toward that trail.  Got to the edge of the parking lot and looked<br>
back at my van and just stood there a bit looking at my van.  Then glanced<br>
down the trail and stood looking down the trail a bit.  Looked back at my<br>
van.  Then turned and started down that trail at a fast walk.<br>
<br>
By that time, I had gotten my keys out of my pocket with my door/ignition<br>
key ready to go.  Ran over to my car, hopped in, and took off on outta<br>
there.<br>
<br>
Now why did the guy pick the trail I *should* have taken to the letterbox to<br>
go down himself?  There were four trails he could've picked from.<br>
Coincidence?  Quite possibly.  But maybe not.  He might have known that the<br>
letterbox was down there and decided to take advantage of the fact that I<br>
might be down there and that, except for his truck and my van, the place was<br>
completely deserted.  And that's one area where a person could scream and<br>
scream and scream and never be heard if there wasn't someone already in the<br>
area.  He couldn't have known that I'd be alone, but in his mind he could've<br>
been thinkin' hey, let's check it out and see.   Why not just wait for me to<br>
come back to my van?  Possibly because he felt fairly secure that I *was*<br>
down that particular trail, and by following me, there would be even less<br>
risk of meeting other people that might be driving up to the parking lot<br>
that morning.<br>
<br>
I'll never know for sure, but my gut feeling at the time told me that the<br>
guy was dangerous and that I'd been very very lucky to have seen him before<br>
he saw me.  But the reeeeally stupid thing was that my gut had told me when<br>
I first started the long, winding drive up the Mount to the top, that I<br>
should turn around and not try for that box.  And I just ignored it.  I<br>
couldn't "see" any danger at that point.  So *if* God was protecting me<br>
early that morning, He/She had actually protected me twice.  And at least I<br>
listened the second time around.  :-)<br>
<br>
I never went back to search for the box.  Tho I probably could have and<br>
probably would have been perfectly safe the second time around.  I'm sure<br>
many many people found that box with absolutely no suspicious happenings at<br>
all.  But crime, even if it's not frequent, is going to have a victim, and<br>
*some*body has to be that victim.  Possibly I could've turned out to be a<br>
victim that day if the timing hadn't been perfect -- perfect for *me*.<br>

Subject: [LbGLK] Egads! What are we to do?<br>
<br>
<br>
To those of you that lurk (like we do)or participate on the Big list,<br>
you know that Tonto and I are in a little bit of a bind.  We aren't<br>
sure what to do...We planted a box on April 23 called "Cicada Mania"<br>
in honor of the 17 year cicada invasion soon to strike our area.  We<br>
have received a steady flow of "contact the placer" remarks on the<br>
box..all very complimentery with no problems mentioned about the<br>
clues or the area.  We were very excited about all the "hits" it was<br>
getting until a few days ago when we received an email from a first<br>
time letterboxer frustrated that she couldn't find the box due to the<br>
clues being too confusing and vague, and she gave up after searching<br>
for 45 minutes. And if that wasn't bad enough, upon her retreat back<br>
to the parking area she found that her brand new car had been broken<br>
into and her purse had been stolen!<br>
<br>
She emailed us to let out her frustration and to suggest that we<br>
change the clues giving more exact directions and that we should warn<br>
everyone to consider that this is a dangerous area before attempting<br>
this box.  Tonto has lived in this area all of his 58 years, and we<br>
feel that Orland Park is by no means any less safe than any other<br>
suburban forest preserve.  We wouldn't hide a box in an area knowing<br>
it was considered more dangerous than any other!  This preserve is<br>
across the street from a middle to upper income residencial area and<br>
very well used for biking, hiking, walking etc.<br>
<br>
We responded back that we were very sorry that this unfortunate<br>
situation had happened to her.  We mentioned that as letterboxers we<br>
all take a risk going into ANY public place and cars are as likely to<br>
get broken into in a shopping mall parking lot, a grocery store.. you<br>
name it.. as much as a forest preserve.  We are vulnerable in ALL<br>
public places.  We said we would consider placing a reminder in all<br>
of our boxes that prudence and vigilience needs to be exercised when<br>
letterboxing, but we weren't comfortable on placing a warning for<br>
this box alone.<br>
<br>
Then tonight, I read the daily digest from the Big list..to our<br>
horror she brought this up on the big list under the<br>
subject.."BEWARE: Northern Illinois"  Yikes!  It was bad enough to<br>
have your clues disected and critiqued (We did get a chuckle about<br>
the grammar and punctuation comments!) But, the line was drawn when<br>
she actually posted that her husband thought we had set her up to be<br>
a victim!  The post suggested that we were laying in wait to break<br>
into her car while she was out looking for our box!  I feel sick to<br>
my stomach as I write this...If I wasn't so upset, I'd be<br>
hysterically laughing at the thought of "Teacher" Tiptoe & "Elder"<br>
Tonto living the life of Bonnie & Clyde...But we aren't laughing!  We<br>
are really upset by this.<br>
<br>
At first, we took it all with a grain of salt knowing that this was<br>
her very first attempt at a box..<br>
Others can defend us by pointing out the insanity of thinking that we<br>
would put out clues, and three weeks later still be hanging out at<br>
the parking lot waiting to commit a crime! (BTW, we do have<br>
alibi's..I've been up to my eyeballs with my Fine Arts Night coming<br>
next week!...You know what I mean Leapin' Lizard and Mrs. Cottontail!)<br>
It's almost comical...But seriously, think of the potential<br>
ramifications of these accusations not only for us, but for all of us<br>
that love this hobby!  Not so funny.<br>
<br>
There was some discussion questioning the safety of all the Cook<br>
County Forest Preserves..this covers a lot of boxes and boxers!<br>
<br>
The situation gets more complicated when on the 10 o'clock news<br>
tonight the lead story was of a murder which happened today in a<br>
Glenview forest preserve(a northern suburb of Chicago and part of the<br>
vast Cook County FP system. The man had apparently been hiking to<br>
keep fit.<br>
<br>
All of this brings up many questions...Any thoughts to help us muddle<br>
through this?  Those that have actually found this box could you<br>
weigh in?..Those that live in the Chicagoland area and have boxes in<br>
CCFP...Anybody?<br>
Tiptoe...and Tonto who is shaking his head...<br>

what life is all about).<br>

There are people in this world who think that they are "owed" <br>

<br>
I'm glad you let everyone know that this was your box so that we can <br>
jump in and help defend you!!  I don't want to beat a dead horse at this <br>
point but I can't help but say that sadly, this couldn't have happened <br>
to a nicer couple than you two. <br>
<br>
ANYONE who has met you can tell in a heartbeat that you would never <br>
/say/ even a harsh word--let alone set anyone up in any way, <br>
what-so-ever.  In fact, you two would be the first to jump in and help <br>
someone in need!!! <br>
<br>
My dog got bit by a copperhead last month while we were <br>
letterboxing---but that doesn't mean it had ANYthing to do with the <br>
placer and the boxes at all.   It never even crossed my mind that <br>
someone would put a box somewhere where we might run into a snake.  <br>
Sometimes it's just the luck of the draw.  There are no guaranteed safe <br>
places, period whether you consider potential crime, parking, terrain, <br>
wildlife, broken glass or even changes in the trail because of a sudden <br>
change in the weather.  What might have been perfectly safe an hour ago <br>
hiking in, may be even dangerous getting back to your car.  If they were <br>
all super easy, they wouldn't be considered trophies or a source of pride. <br>
<br>
Through all of these emails Tiptoe and Tonto, I hope you see we are <br>
circling our wagons around you in protection!! :)  You are both very <br>
considerate and conscientious people!  Keep on creating and we all will <br>
keep enjoying your contributions!<br>

((Advisory v. Warning))<br>
<br>
I can't help but go back to a comment I made about giving a suggestion <br>
that several boxes of mine are placed in an area where I suggest or <br>
advise taking some water because of the steep terrain.  Do I do that <br>
with all of my boxes?  No.  But since I have knowledge that I need water <br>
almost every time I hike that trail, I think it's important to share <br>
that insight with others.  Every box I plant, I try to do so as if the <br>
seeker is OUT OF STATE and not familiar with the area.  I think we owe <br>
that much to each other.<br>
<br>
I also used to think it went without saying that we should always all <br>
"be prepared" by taking water, an ACE bandage, matches etc., but as I <br>
watched SpringChick point out specifics of exactly how to be prepared in <br>
one of her responses, I was suprised at how many folks came back <br>
thanking her for the advice and insight of having a charged cell phone <br>
when hiking, for example.  It never occured to me that someone would NOT <br>
take their cell pone but very often what is "obvious to one" is not to <br>
another.  I've watched someone else make a comment on this board that <br>
was obvious to them---and I sat here silently taking strong note of new <br>
information too.<br>
<br>
So, I think since these incidents have now occured, it might be a good <br>
idea to add a note to be alert, lock your valuables out of sight and not <br>
hike for this box or these boxes alone.  It still ends up being the <br>
individual's decision.  I may never go look for these boxes you are <br>
talking about because I am not from Chicago and am definitely not <br>
familiar with the area, but if there was a similar "advisory" for a box <br>
in Columbus, I know it wouldn't stop me from going alone---only because <br>
I'm close to home, I know the area and where the hospitals are in an <br>
emergency.  I also know where my cell phone works and where it doesn't <br>
here.  I'm sure that shows in my confidence level while I am hiking too. <br>
<br>
When my dog got bit by the copperhead, I was 100% out of my confort zone <br>
because we were in a Nature Preserve in NC and I had NO CLUE where an <br>
emergency animal clinic was, for example.    It was pure luck or Divine <br>
Guidance that someone I didn't even know called my cell phone <br>
number....and ended up "helping me land the plane" over the phone by <br>
researching for me on the internet where I should take "Gunner"!!  Now <br>
what is "obvious" to me to do in an emergency like this (use a lifeline <br>
and call someone to do research on the computer while you are on the <br>
phone) is something I am going to share with others.<br>
<br>
My vote is to simply add an advisory.<br>

 <br>
We tried to find the Ghost Hunt series on Sunday and after walking an  eighth <br>
of a mile or so my 3 year old fell and cried. A hundred feet later she  fell <br>
again and landed on a thorn that caused the palm of her hand to bleed. I  had <br>
to carry her all the way back to the car (up 3 flights of stairs and a steep  <br>
incline). How dare the placers of these boxes put them in a beautiful park and <br>
 cause my 3 year old all that pain and suffering?? <br>
 <br>
This whole notion is just so absurd, I have no more comments on this  topic. <br>
