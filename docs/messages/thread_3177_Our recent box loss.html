                    <div class="plaintext-content">We too have recently lost multiple boxes, one even due to what <br/>
appears to be malicious human intervention, and it was really tough <br/>
for us to swallow.  It actually turned us off to letterboxing, and <br/>
since we are still adapting to having a baby boxer, we decided that <br/>
it might be a sign that we should take a break for a while.  <br/>
However, we recently had a really nice experience that has turned us <br/>
back around and I thought would be nice to share...  <br/>
<br/>
One of the first boxes we ever hid a few years back was placed in a <br/>
local nature center.  It has gotten a lot of activity in the last <br/>
year, especially from what appear to be new families of boxers.  We <br/>
were a bit concerned that it may go missing what with all of the <br/>
traffic it had been getting.  Luckily, its hiding spot is pretty <br/>
well covered and every time we have gone to check on it, we have <br/>
found it exactly where it belongs, well cared for, and covered <br/>
properly.  Way to go new boxers!<br/>
<br/>
Then a few weeks back, I received an email from one of the staff <br/>
members at the nature center.  She said that the maintenance crew <br/>
has been doing some grounds cleanup and the spot where our box had <br/>
been hiding was removed and no longer exists.  The maintenance crew <br/>
brought the box to the office staff, who then got my email address <br/>
from the logbook.  She said that she was holding the box for me <br/>
until I could pick it up and gave me her phone number.  When I <br/>
called her, she was quite excited.  She said that the entire staff <br/>
loved the letterbox and had never heard of boxing before.  She had <br/>
made copies of the info sheet she found in the box for the whole <br/>
staff (it's a small staff mind you) and they had all gone out the <br/>
letterboxing.org for more information.  She said that she was going <br/>
to look into carving her own stamp so that she could get out there <br/>
and find boxes on her own.  She even went so far as to thank us for <br/>
hiding the box there, as it has brought many people and families to <br/>
the nature center over the last few years.  Overall it was a really <br/>
nice experience and wonderful to have new people so excited about <br/>
boxing and to have been lucky enough to have had our box discovered <br/>
by such kind people that went out of their way to keep our box <br/>
intact.  <br/>
<br/>
We are hoping to get out boxing in the next few weeks before it gets <br/>
bitter cold here.  Perhaps a few new finds will get us even more <br/>
excited and we can spend the winter months carving in anticipation <br/>
of the spring.  Happy boxing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL - It just occurred to me which box this was!  I have sent several<br/>
families to this one for their first attempt because it was what I<br/>
considered a relatively straight forward box (also our first find!!) and<br/>
was in nice scenic area.  It was also in a relatively out of the way<br/>
area (in that most people to do not go up that trail all that often).  I<br/>
am sad to hear that it is no longer there!  I am glad that the people at<br/>
Retzer had such a positive outlook on it! I bet we see more out there<br/>
just from the staff in the future!<br/>
<br/>
I am with you WI Hiker - I hope they do not find yours as well that way!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did mention to her that there was another box hidden in the Nature <br/>
Center but didn't tell her the name.  Her excitement at discovering <br/>
letterboxing was obvious, so I would not be surprised if she has <br/>
found your box already but maybe did not use the contact the placer <br/>
functionality and/or log the find.  I think that new boxers tend to <br/>
not join letterboxing.org when they aren't yet committed to the <br/>
hobby and so they don't tend to log initial finds.  <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, we haven't yet found a new spot for our box, but the <br/>
area is so big that I don't think it will be a problem!<br/>
