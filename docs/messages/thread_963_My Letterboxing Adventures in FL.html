I was down in FL for a few days, in the panhandle, Panama City Beach <br/>
Area.  Before I went I checked for boxes because I knew I would have <br/>
a day to explore and do a little boxing.  There were 6 boxes in the <br/>
surrounding counties, 4 of which indicated they had been washed away <br/>
by the hurricanes and not yet replaced.  I headed down with clues to <br/>
the remaining 2 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
On Monday, I headed out in shorts and Birkenstocks (not my usual <br/>
letterboxing garb, but hey, it was sunny and 77 degrees there -- a <br/>
record high for this time of year -- it was freezing rain and very <br/>
cold where I had come from).  I drove to the next county over to the <br/>
city of Destin -- a place with the most wonderful location and a <br/>
disgustingly commercial tax base.  Box #1 -- I find the park, I see <br/>
the hiding spot before I am even out of my car <sigh> yes, a drive-<br/>
by...  I even see the blue rim of the box top peeking out from <br/>
behind the rock as I am getting out of the car.  Hey, at least the <br/>
box is here, I thought as I pulled it out from under the <br/>
footbridge...  my first FL letterbox.  I actually felt a little bit <br/>
of a rush -- until I opened the box and realized there was no stamp <br/>
inside.  Just a logbook and a little bag of gold-foil wrapped <br/>
chocolate coins.  Huh?  WTF is this crap?  Geocachers, maybe?  <br/>
Disappointed, but not willing to go home without some proof that I <br/>
had been there, I inked up one of the coins and stamped my book.<br/>
<br/>
Off to box #2...  This one was inside a ritzy, glitzy resort.  I <br/>
tell the guard I am there to visit the Village and he gives me a <br/>
pass, no questions asked.  I drive around the golf course and into <br/>
the Village, parking near the footbridge to this tropical-paradisey <br/>
island.  Very cool.  I follow the clues around the island and <br/>
eventually come out at the bay...  turn left and there ahead is the <br/>
swing I am looking for.  Oops, there laying in the sand under the <br/>
swing is pair of sleeping bodies, half intertwined with one another, <br/>
half intertwined with a sleeping bag, half naked -- and sleeping, or <br/>
least pretending to be sleeping.  There is no way I can get to the <br/>
box location without walking over them, so I continue on and then <br/>
back down the trail a bit, and I wait...  and I wait...  A few times <br/>
I thought about just leaving, but hey, I had no more clues and I <br/>
wasn't leaving FL without a stamp -- and I did have a book with me, <br/>
and it was a really gorgeous place...  So I waited longer, and a <br/>
couple of times I walked toward them, shuffling my feet along the <br/>
wooden boardwalk, hoping to wake them up.  After about an hour and a <br/>
half, they arose, dressed, wadded up the sleeping bag and left.  I <br/>
made my way back to the swing...  there was the pine tree and the <br/>
little bush thingie next to it.  Supposedly the box should be under <br/>
this bush/tree thing in some native grass and pine cones.  Don't see <br/>
any pine cones, just a lot of poison ivy and some briars.  Carefully <br/>
stepping over the briars and around the poison ivy (remember... <br/>
shorts and sandals), I looked under every nearby tree.  Then kind of <br/>
behind one of them, I see a pile of grass and a couple of pine <br/>
cones...  Hmm, maybe the box lies within.  So, I begin clearing away <br/>
the grass and what do I find hiding there?  One very large copper-<br/>
colored snake who did not appear to be happy I had upset his world.  <br/>
Back through the briars and poison ivy I went, this time with less <br/>
care than on the way in...  and I'll be, but that darn snake <br/>
followed me!  So, up onto the swing goes me, my backpack and my <br/>
scraped legs.  Once I decided he wasn't coming any closer, I left.  <br/>
No box.  I did however bring home a souvenir -- little red poison <br/>
ivy bumps all over my feet and ankles.<br/>
<br/>
I had thought about planting a box while down there and decided <br/>
against it -- hey, if they can't plant their own boxes, why should I <br/>
do it for them?<br/>

What an adventure! I hope the letterboxing is better in the Palm <br/>
Beach area, as I'll be down there in a couple of weeks. I visited <br/>
Key West last February and planted the first box there. I was <br/>
disappointed when I researched the area and found there were no <br/>
boxes around. When I got home and posted my clues, I found out there <br/>
was another letterboxing couple planting boxes the same time I was <br/>
there! Now there are 5 or 6 to be found:)<br/>

Geez oh pizza, SpringChick ... what a tale. I'm sorry your trip didn't<br/>
turn out the way you had planned. Looking on the bright side .. unlike<br/>
your Chicago trip, at least the bodies weren't dead this time.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe FLA has 'had it' with Mich boxers and is punishing us. I have 4<br/>
FLA themed boxes placed in Mich becuase I came down with an infection<br/>
in both ears and walking pneumonia when we were down for a charter<br/>
sailing vacation last year. Instead of the Gulf Coast trip down to Key<br/>
West that we had planned, we spent part of several days at the Urgent<br/>
Care and the rest of the time just sailing Charlotte Harbor, (staying<br/>
close to the Medico) eating fresh seafood and drinking fruity rum<br/>
drinks until the 'nap monster' sat on me.(grin) Now you know how the<br/>
Misspent Vacation series was named. <br/>
<br/>
I will agree with Doodle Bug's theatre professor because it's exactly<br/>
the same for sailing. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

We can commiserate about the poison ivy.  We ran into some poison oak while<br/>
boxing in California in November.  I had a mild case, a little rash here and<br/>
there, but Martini Man had a MAJOR OUTBREAK after we returned home!  However<br/>
at least we could console ourselves with the fact that we did find a lot of<br/>
boxes on some really great hikes along the coast.  One of the most memorable<br/>
stamps we found while on this trip was a nice carving of a plant with the<br/>
title "Poison Oak" also carved on the stamp!  Luckily the rash did not last<br/>
as long as our souvenir image will...<br/>
