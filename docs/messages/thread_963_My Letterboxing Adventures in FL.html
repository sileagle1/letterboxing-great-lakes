I was down in FL for a few days, in the panhandle, Panama City Beach <br>
Area.  Before I went I checked for boxes because I knew I would have <br>
a day to explore and do a little boxing.  There were 6 boxes in the <br>
surrounding counties, 4 of which indicated they had been washed away <br>
by the hurricanes and not yet replaced.  I headed down with clues to <br>
the remaining 2 boxes.<br>
 <br>
On Monday, I headed out in shorts and Birkenstocks (not my usual <br>
letterboxing garb, but hey, it was sunny and 77 degrees there -- a <br>
record high for this time of year -- it was freezing rain and very <br>
cold where I had come from).  I drove to the next county over to the <br>
city of Destin -- a place with the most wonderful location and a <br>
disgustingly commercial tax base.  Box #1 -- I find the park, I see <br>
the hiding spot before I am even out of my car <sigh> yes, a drive-<br>
by...  I even see the blue rim of the box top peeking out from <br>
behind the rock as I am getting out of the car.  Hey, at least the <br>
box is here, I thought as I pulled it out from under the <br>
footbridge...  my first FL letterbox.  I actually felt a little bit <br>
of a rush -- until I opened the box and realized there was no stamp <br>
inside.  Just a logbook and a little bag of gold-foil wrapped <br>
chocolate coins.  Huh?  WTF is this crap?  Geocachers, maybe?  <br>
Disappointed, but not willing to go home without some proof that I <br>
had been there, I inked up one of the coins and stamped my book.<br>
 <br>
Off to box #2...  This one was inside a ritzy, glitzy resort.  I <br>
tell the guard I am there to visit the Village and he gives me a <br>
pass, no questions asked.  I drive around the golf course and into <br>
the Village, parking near the footbridge to this tropical-paradisey <br>
island.  Very cool.  I follow the clues around the island and <br>
eventually come out at the bay...  turn left and there ahead is the <br>
swing I am looking for.  Oops, there laying in the sand under the <br>
swing is pair of sleeping bodies, half intertwined with one another, <br>
half intertwined with a sleeping bag, half naked -- and sleeping, or <br>
least pretending to be sleeping.  There is no way I can get to the <br>
box location without walking over them, so I continue on and then <br>
back down the trail a bit, and I wait...  and I wait...  A few times <br>
I thought about just leaving, but hey, I had no more clues and I <br>
wasn't leaving FL without a stamp -- and I did have a book with me, <br>
and it was a really gorgeous place...  So I waited longer, and a <br>
couple of times I walked toward them, shuffling my feet along the <br>
wooden boardwalk, hoping to wake them up.  After about an hour and a <br>
half, they arose, dressed, wadded up the sleeping bag and left.  I <br>
made my way back to the swing...  there was the pine tree and the <br>
little bush thingie next to it.  Supposedly the box should be under <br>
this bush/tree thing in some native grass and pine cones.  Don't see <br>
any pine cones, just a lot of poison ivy and some briars.  Carefully <br>
stepping over the briars and around the poison ivy (remember... <br>
shorts and sandals), I looked under every nearby tree.  Then kind of <br>
behind one of them, I see a pile of grass and a couple of pine <br>
cones...  Hmm, maybe the box lies within.  So, I begin clearing away <br>
the grass and what do I find hiding there?  One very large copper-<br>
colored snake who did not appear to be happy I had upset his world.  <br>
Back through the briars and poison ivy I went, this time with less <br>
care than on the way in...  and I'll be, but that darn snake <br>
followed me!  So, up onto the swing goes me, my backpack and my <br>
scraped legs.  Once I decided he wasn't coming any closer, I left.  <br>
No box.  I did however bring home a souvenir -- little red poison <br>
ivy bumps all over my feet and ankles.<br>
 <br>
I had thought about planting a box while down there and decided <br>
against it -- hey, if they can't plant their own boxes, why should I <br>
do it for them?<br>

What an adventure! I hope the letterboxing is better in the Palm <br>
Beach area, as I'll be down there in a couple of weeks. I visited <br>
Key West last February and planted the first box there. I was <br>
disappointed when I researched the area and found there were no <br>
boxes around. When I got home and posted my clues, I found out there <br>
was another letterboxing couple planting boxes the same time I was <br>
there! Now there are 5 or 6 to be found:)<br>

Geez oh pizza, SpringChick ... what a tale. I'm sorry your trip didn't<br>
turn out the way you had planned. Looking on the bright side .. unlike<br>
your Chicago trip, at least the bodies weren't dead this time.<br>
<br>
Maybe FLA has 'had it' with Mich boxers and is punishing us. I have 4<br>
FLA themed boxes placed in Mich becuase I came down with an infection<br>
in both ears and walking pneumonia when we were down for a charter<br>
sailing vacation last year. Instead of the Gulf Coast trip down to Key<br>
West that we had planned, we spent part of several days at the Urgent<br>
Care and the rest of the time just sailing Charlotte Harbor, (staying<br>
close to the Medico) eating fresh seafood and drinking fruity rum<br>
drinks until the 'nap monster' sat on me.(grin) Now you know how the<br>
Misspent Vacation series was named. <br>
<br>
I will agree with Doodle Bug's theatre professor because it's exactly<br>
the same for sailing. LOL<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

We can commiserate about the poison ivy.  We ran into some poison oak while<br>
boxing in California in November.  I had a mild case, a little rash here and<br>
there, but Martini Man had a MAJOR OUTBREAK after we returned home!  However<br>
at least we could console ourselves with the fact that we did find a lot of<br>
boxes on some really great hikes along the coast.  One of the most memorable<br>
stamps we found while on this trip was a nice carving of a plant with the<br>
title "Poison Oak" also carved on the stamp!  Luckily the rash did not last<br>
as long as our souvenir image will...<br>
