OK - so call me goofy, but I sat and thought about "nee-ah ha ha"<br>
for like 20 minutes, sounding out each syllable and thinking the<br>
whole time that my fungal buddy was a little nuts ... until I said<br>
it "nya-ha-ha". Then I noticed Dragon already answered. Sigh! I<br>
have to stop taking these clues so literally!<br>

Yeah, I'll leave the degree of nuts evaluation open for DH to <br>
comment on, as in "don't you two ladies already have enough to <br>
do ... ?"  Is there ever really enough to do???<br>
