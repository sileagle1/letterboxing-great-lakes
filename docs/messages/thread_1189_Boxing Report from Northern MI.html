I spent a wonderful weekend up in the Traverse City area -- checking <br>
on boxes, finding a few and planting a few.  It was perfect for <br>
letterboxing -- sunny and warm, no bugs and not a lot of tourists yet.<br>
<br>
Here's the run down:<br>
<br>
Old Stronach Cemetery, Manistee (BindleBabe) -- First Finder at this <br>
one, my second find in BindleBabe's Hauntings series -- Cool Boxes!<br>
<br>
Two Half Hitches Knot, Manistee (BindleBabe) -- Checked on this one I <br>
had previously found and it is in good shape.<br>
<br>
Half Hitch Knot, Arcadia (BindleBabe) -- Didn't see this one that I <br>
had previously found in it's hiding spot, hopefully I just didn't <br>
look good enough or remembered the spot incorrectly.<br>
<br>
Point Betsie Lighthouse (originally placed by Esperanza, adopted by <br>
me) -- Had read reports on the geocaching site (this box shares space <br>
with a geocache) that this LB was in bad shape, so came prepared to <br>
do some TLC.  Found the box soaking wet and really dirty.  Cleaned it <br>
up and put in a new log book and it's back in business.  Lovely spot -<br>
- I enjoyed the revisit!<br>
<br>
Old Mission Peninsula (originally placed by Esperanza and Matt the <br>
Rat) -- Checked on this one I had previously found and it is in good <br>
shape.  Found a nice little surprise here!<br>
<br>
Asylum Tragedy (BindleBabe) -- Another in BindleBabe's Hauntings <br>
series.  This place is incredible!  Just thinking about the history <br>
and the previous lives of these old buildings gave me the heebie-<br>
jeebies!  Box was in good shape and has had a couple of visitors.  <br>
Nice find!<br>
<br>
Central Elementary School (BindleBabe) -- Yet another in the <br>
Hauntings series.  I wasn't able to find this one.  I'm not quite <br>
sure I had the clues right and it was really busy so I didn't poke <br>
around as thoroughly as I would have liked.  Hopefully I just missed <br>
it as I would like to get this one on a future trip!<br>
<br>
<br>
My boxes checked and in good condition:<br>
<br>
- *Inspiration Point  (Mystery Location -- consider this a hint)<br>
- *She Flies...  (Mystery Location -- consider this a hint)<br>
- *Whaleback  (Whaleback Natural Area, Leland)<br>
- *Cathead Bay  (Leelanau State Park, Northport)<br>
- Grand Traverse Lighthouse  (Leelanau State Park, Northport)<br>
- Old Mission Point Lighthouse (Old Mission Park, Old Mission) -- <br>
this is my most visited letterbox, partly because there was a <br>
geocache hanging in the tree above it for a while.  The geocache was <br>
removed last year, but this continue to be a much-visited box.<br>
<br>
(*) the asterisk indicates these boxes have not had any finders yet ;-<br>

<br>
Clues to new boxes to come within the week.<br>

Thanks for the updates on my boxes, SpringChick. <br>
<br>
The Arcadia box is likely still alive. It's really a whole new box<br>
because it has new clues, new stamp and new hiding spot. The previous<br>
hiding spot wasn't all that I would have liked, so I changed the clues<br>
and moved it. I also changed the stamp. The "knot" box in Elk Rapids<br>
went missing, so I re-carved it on the way home. I liked the new<br>
carving much better than the one that had been at Arcadia. So when we<br>
got to Arcadia I put the new stamp in and moved the box.<br>
<br>
We're going that way soon, I'll check on the Arcadia box and see<br>
what's up with the Central Elementary box.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to some new clues and doing your boxes up there.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

Bummer!  I missed the chance for a find... new stamp, new clues, new <br>
hiding spot.  I did look at the clues before I headed out as I wanted <br>
to verify that it wasn't listed as missing and not worth the stop to <br>
check.  Didn't see anything that would indicate things had changed from <br>
the previous version of the box.<br>
<br>
Now I'm wondering how many other boxes I've already found that I should <br>
go back and re-read clues in case they have been reincarnated from a <br>
previous version and worth another trip.<br>
<br>
Guess I never really thought about it before.  Once I find them I cross <br>
them off the "to find" list and don't revisit the clue page unless <br>
prompted by a list posting or box name change, etc.<br>
<br>
Eeeeek, I need a personal assistant just to keep track of everything <br>
and all the different situations and all the different places to <br>
post/distribute/hide clues!<br>
