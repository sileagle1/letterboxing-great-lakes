Well, since I'm typing this anyway, I'll add that I just got another <br>
report from a Hitchhiker I released 30-JUN-06.  In a little over 4 <br>
months I've gotten 3 emails about the "Beat Generation" and it turns <br>
out it has already been to 4 of the 6 states in the Great Lakes <br>
region.  Thanks to all of you who send status reports on hitchhikers in <br>
addition to boxes!<br>

P.S.  If my other posts don't show up in another hour, I guess I'll <br>
post them directly here, which means eventually you might see a <br>
duplicate post...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes - the delays are getting longer and longer.   It only took 12<br>
hours for something to post to my Yahoo homeschooling group.  For our<br>
physical homeschooling group, we are contemplating taking our<br>
communication board somewhere else....<br>
<br>
And yes, I am posting this on the group.  I figured out about a couple<br>
of weeks ago that if I needed/wanted something to post quickly, I<br>
needed to go online - Ugh!<br>
