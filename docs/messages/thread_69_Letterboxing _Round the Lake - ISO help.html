we can find someone who wants to work with us.<br/>
<br/>
We're willing to carve some stamps, buy the boxes, logbooks etc and <br/>
get the whole thing ready to be planted.<br/>
<br/>
What we need is someone who would be willing to let us mail the box <br/>
to them, go plant it and be in charge of monitoring it.<br/>
<br/>
Any helpers in any of the states that are on the Circle Tour willing <br/>
to partner with us? <br/>
<br/>
You can reply off list if you want to enders_angel_80 at yahoo<br/>

&gt; So what is this Letterboxing 'Round the Lake series all about?  <br/>
Well no doubt many of you have heard of the Lake Michigan Circle <br/>
Tour?  It is an established road trip route that takes a person all <br/>
of the way around Lake Michigan, through WI, MI, IN and IL.  This <br/>
series would seek to populate that route with letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I won't go into great detail here in the post, but you can check <br/>
out all of the specifics in the file I uploaded to the files <br/>
section.  The short is that I am looking for participants who would <br/>
like to participate in the project by contributing a letterbox -- <br/>
you make it, you place it, you write the clues and post them where <br/>
you wish, you maintain the box and clues.  I will then create a <br/>
central web page with links to all of the clues <br/>
<br/>
