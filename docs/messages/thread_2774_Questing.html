                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we heard that the Catapulted Cow had landed in a new spot, we <br>
decided it was time to continue our quest for the Holy Grail in the <br>
southern realms of our region.  Some may think us foolish knights to <br>
undertake the quest on such a scorching day, but we consider <br>
ourselves brave & hardy knights and would not let heat deter us.  <br>
<br>
We set a lofty goal of visiting nine auspicious locations to help us <br>
in our ultimate quest.  However time did not allow us to meet this <br>
goal and we were satisfied instead with finding eight new boxes and <br>
grail clues.  In addition, we had some interesting diversions to find <br>
six other boxes including one called a "mystery" box.  This box was <br>
placed in 2004 and the tenacious "Team Taco" was the first to visit <br>
it in 2005.  Surprisingly, we were only the second visitors, almost <br>
two years after the box was placed!<br>
<br>
Our grail quest took us to several locations.  However what should <br>
have been shady forests seemed more like steamy jungles and the <br>
pleasant prairies were more like blazing deserts!  The torrid heat <br>
and the vicious deer flies were impediments, especially in our search <br>
for the Grail Beacon.  However we persevered and secured the <br>
important stamps and codes.  Not surprisingly, we were not fit to be <br>
seen (or smelled) in public after these challenging excursions.  We <br>
therefore headed home for a refreshing shower and some tasty <br>
margaritas.  We think margaritas should be the official Grail <br>
beverage! <br>
