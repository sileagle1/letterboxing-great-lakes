So, two evenings ago, I find myself in the parking lot of the local Home Depot, waiting for the police to come help me open my locked car, which contained both my keys AND MY TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER! (don't ask), when panic and fear combined and created a vision:<br>
<br>
The Lost Key letterbox.<br>
<br>
Of course, this is stealing shamelessly from the "Purple Heart" letterbox, but given the rash of "keys-left-in-locked-cars"-ness, I thought it appropriate.  The rules?  You'd have to have a significant locked keys in car while letterboxing story (no, "I locked my keys in the car, but the windows were unrolled, so I reached in" stories), and you'd be honor bound to make sure it was bona fide.<br>
<br>
So I put the call out to all carvers on the list.  I am a wretched carver, as anyone who's found a Delirium box can attest, and think it best to leave the actual stamp up to the pros.  Is there anyone out there who would be willing to design and carve the stamp for the "Lost Key" box?  If so, please send me an email off list, and we'll hammer out the details.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Delirium, who has been threatened by her husband to never be entrusted with any keys ever again.<br>
<br>
p.s. MobiusKlein, I fully expect you to have some comment about this one, after my lost keys mishap at the Gathering.  *grin*<br>
