that this was a great idea and that it would make it somewhat easier <br/>

Unfortunently for the couple that I tried (they were in some smaller <br/>
towns that I was traveling near) the GPS coordinates we no where near <br/>
where the boxes were located. They put you in the right town but at <br/>
least in one case we were miles from the box. Does anyone know how this <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently, when I placed a box at a local park, I had a similar problem <br/>
(although it was GPS coordinates for Google Maps).  The link showed the <br/>
box 6 miles away (near a highway) rather than at the address I <br/>
provided.  I "fixed" the problem by misspelling the name of the park and <br/>
including an address.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a bug in AQ; some locations don't map to the correct GPS <br/>
coordinates so Google Maps and MapQuest show the wrong location.  I <br/>
think you can send email to AQ and they'll fix it.<br/>

they just put a city or zip code, it'll center the coordinates in <br/>
that area.  If the planter gives an exact address, the coordinates <br/>
should be at that exact address.<br/>
