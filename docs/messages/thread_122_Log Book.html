Being new and all, I wasn't quite sure what to use as a logbook. I came<br/>
across a zippered 6-hole daytimer-like binder.  I punched my own sheets from<br/>
cardstock to fit in it (as a bonus I found a Stickapotomous zippered pouch<br/>
to keep my stamp and a mini-pad in the front of it.  I really like it<br/>
because I can add or remove sheets at will, including my stamped pages which<br/>
I leave at home to keep them clean when I go out.<br/>
<br/>
In other news...I heard a local Omaha paper ran an article about<br/>
letterboxing.  Anyone see it??  My friend is going to send it to me.  If<br/>
it's any good should I scan and post it in the files or something???<br/>
