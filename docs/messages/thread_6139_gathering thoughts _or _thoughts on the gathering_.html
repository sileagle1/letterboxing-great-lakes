Yes, I do feel those weekends around Memorial day do tend to get filled up quicker, but think of it this way, would you schedule a Fall Gathering in April?  It sounds silly when you put it that way.  Perhaps what we need to keep in the back of our minds is that the "Big GLG" is our Spring Gathering, sort of official opening season on letterboxing (though as we all know, there is no "season" for a hearty Great Lakes letterboxer).<br>
<br>
And to add another note concerning the number of people interested in hosting a gathering in IL, what's so say there can only be one?  A May/June gathering ("the big one"), one in July, one in August.....  You know if you plan them, we'll come running!! (-:<br>
