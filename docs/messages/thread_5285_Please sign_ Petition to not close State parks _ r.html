undersigned express our support of state spending for Illinois State Historic Sites and their staff. <br/>
<br/>
We find the proposed budget cuts by Rod Blagojevich to the funding of State Historic Sites to be a deep blow to our collective cultural history and understanding. We wish to express to the Governor, as well as the Illinois General Assembly, that we value both a balanced budget as well as support for our Historic and Cultural sites. <br/>
<br/>
The educational opportunities provided by our State Historic Sites is invaluable. The support staff, which would be impacted severely by these cuts, is an essential part of the cultural interpretation that these sites provide to the public. <br/>
<br/>
We the undersigned do not support the budget cuts nor the closing of our state parks proposed by Rod Blagojevich, and we ask you join us in defiance.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
