Hello all,<br>
<br>
I've been seriously considering placeing a HH Hostel here in <br>
Michigan.  Any advice/hints/ideas??<br>

Make sure it's a good size.  I also used an Otterbox 3500 ... it's supposed to withstand <br>
extreme temperatures and be watertight.  Gander Mtn sells a similar style, and it was <br>
cheaper than otterbox online.  Last time I looked it was holding up well.  I'll check after <br>
our first Good Snow.  I made a hostel registry and letterboxers are doing a good job of <br>
checking in and checking out.  If you you want to see an example, email me privately and <br>
I'll be happy to share it.<br>
<br>
Hey - might my registry file be something to add to the Files section?<br>

I don't see why two would be a problem. The more the merrier. Our <br>
boxes are going to be very far apart. Grand Rapids is a couple hours <br>
away from where I am going to be planting mine. Also my hitchhiker <br>
hostel is going to be a mystery box. All of the HH hostels that I <br>
have found have always contained a logbook and a stamp for the box. I <br>
even saw one that had two logs. One for the visitors and one for the <br>
hitchhikers. It is a good idea to mark on the logbook and stamp <br>
something saying, "Do not take from this box. Not a HH stamp." Just <br>
so there is no confusion. I have seen as many as three hitchhikers in <br>
a box at a time. It would be easy to mix up unless marked. If all <br>
goes well I am hoping to have it planted before Christmas. Good luck <br>
with your box. I look forward to finding it someday if you decide to <br>
make it.<br>

Just one thing to consider--hitchhikers are meant to keep moving.  A mystery <br>
may mean that some hitchhikers remain in limbo for awhile.  Though Mystery <br>

I'm starting a hostel in Houston this month for that very reason. . .HHs aren't moving. We have too many microboxes. So a mystery one wouldn't be the best option in this situation. I think if you live in a high traffic area and you don't want every single person coming through to stop, then it would probably be great.<br>

It is not going to be a hard mystery box. I do agree a mystery box <br>
may not always be a great idea for a HH hostel, but I look at it as a <br>
reward for solving the mystery. You know there will be a HH waiting <br>
for you when you find the box. I have seen HH stamps stay in limbo in <br>
regular boxes. I found the Paul Bunyan and Babe HH at the Friend In <br>
The mountain Letterbox, that was there for nine months. <br>

Woo-hoo!  I love the idea of a HH hostel.  Count me in for a<br>
contribution. <br>
<br>
If it's located anywhere close, then those of you who have missed<br>
getting the little stamp images from our Ever-Changing letterbox stand<br>
a good chance of picking them up as a HH (hint, hint)<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
