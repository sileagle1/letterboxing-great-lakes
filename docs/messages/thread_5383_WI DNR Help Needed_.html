                    <div class="plaintext-content">I need some advice, again!  In July, I planted my first LB in WI at a boat landing that is state land managed by the WI DNR.  (I can hear y'all saying, OMG, what a lost cause!)  I really liked the spot so I persevered.  I downloaded the DNR Geocache Placement Notification form, estimated the Cache coordinates from GoogleMap and sent it in.  Lo and Behold!  I received a reply yesterday that the Geocache had been approved, but I needed to email exact GPS coordinates, as mine do not match the box!  FYI there is a new updated form also.  I had used a 6/06 form and the new one is dated 4/07.  The DNR "real estate program coordinator" had checked the box, approved the location and said that it was nicely hidden, just wrong coordinates!  (Our taxpayer money at work!)  <br/>
I do not have a GPS - I don't even know the format usage.  I also don't want to buy one.  And my cell phone is not GPS enabled.  <br/>
So, I don't know if I just entered the coordinates incorrectly, or if google maps just didn't get close enough to the exact location of the tree stump.  And I don't remember how I got these coordinates off of google!  I entered:  Latitude N45/87/2118, Longitude W -89/67/3082.  The DNR wrote on my form:  S.18, T39N-R7E NH-AL State Forest.<br/>
I'd love to just ASK her what I should do, but I remember that some of you warned me not to tell her that this was a LetterBox and not a real geocache .... The address of the boat landing is 8500 Brunswick Road, Minocqua, WI.  <br/>
Would anyone be willing to help me figure this out somehow? - or do you think I should just let it go?  They must not be very busy up there, if she actually went to check these coordinates!  I planned on putting one on an island - wonder if she'd canoe out there to check it!   I'll be sure to get my next cell phne with GPS but my 2 year contract is not done until February.  <br/>
Thanks in advance for reading this far.  Good news is that they seem to be open to stuff hidden on thier lands!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since they already found it, they know it is a letterbox and not a<br/>
geocache (unless they ready as well as geocachers tend to...).  I<br/>
would just use the coordinates they gave you.  Also, if you tell them<br/>
it is a letterbox, you do not need to give coordinates.<br/>
