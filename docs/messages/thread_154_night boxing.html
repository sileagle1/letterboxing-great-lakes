Since Tim is heading up the gathering proper, I'll volunteer as <br>
field marshall for this one.  We're thinking of a vampire-hunting <br>
theme right now, but if anyone else has any ideas suited for <br>
nightboxing, please do speak up!  So far it's just The Dragon and us <br>
(Team Taco) doing the overnight at Chain o' Lakes.  As Tim <br>
mentioned, we need at least 5 participatory entities <br>
(individuals/teams).  If anyone is interested in camping and <br>
participating in the nightboxing adventure, please contact me or Tim <br>
off-list! <br>

We might be able to participate in the night letterboxing, but not sure yet<br>
if we'd be there Friday or Saturday night. We'll know our schedule better by<br>
mid-May.  We won't be camping but probably staying at a Hampton Inn that is<br>
nearby.<br>
<br>
Is anyone bringing any children in the 8-12 age range? If so, we might bring<br>
our niece & nephews along.<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to meeting everyone!<br>
