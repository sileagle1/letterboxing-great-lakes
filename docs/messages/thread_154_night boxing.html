probably only be those who are actually overnighting there that <br/>

Since Tim is heading up the gathering proper, I'll volunteer as <br/>
field marshall for this one.  We're thinking of a vampire-hunting <br/>
theme right now, but if anyone else has any ideas suited for <br/>
nightboxing, please do speak up!  So far it's just The Dragon and us <br/>
(Team Taco) doing the overnight at Chain o' Lakes.  As Tim <br/>
mentioned, we need at least 5 participatory entities <br/>
(individuals/teams).  If anyone is interested in camping and <br/>
participating in the nightboxing adventure, please contact me or Tim <br/>
off-list! <br/>

We might be able to participate in the night letterboxing, but not sure yet<br/>
if we'd be there Friday or Saturday night. We'll know our schedule better by<br/>
mid-May.  We won't be camping but probably staying at a Hampton Inn that is<br/>
nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone bringing any children in the 8-12 age range? If so, we might bring<br/>
our niece &amp; nephews along.<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to meeting everyone!<br/>
