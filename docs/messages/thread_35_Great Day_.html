only very slight damage to any of them.<br/>
<br/>
One was strange though -- at the Big Bear box, I found the box all <br/>

from the box.  I am wondering if perhaps it accidentally got put <br/>

Unfortunately without the log book, I don't know who was the last <br/>

business, but I found that strange especially since a very nearby <br/>
box had been visited just a week ago and there was no mention of the <br/>
log being missing from Big Bear.  Other than that -- I replaced a <br/>
couple of containers, some baggies and cleaned off the stamps and <br/>
all is well.<br/>
<br/>
I also checked on Ghosts Below today and that one also is in great <br/>

couple with a flat tire pulled into the parking spot right by the <br/>
hiding spot while I was off at a bench checking out the box.  They <br/>
looked like they were going to be there a while.  I will run out <br/>
tomorrow or some night this week and put it back in place.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up two HH while making the rounds, both originally placed <br/>
by folks on this list -- "Oh, the Places You'll Go" from the Leapin' <br/>
Lizards visited a few boxes in Muskegon before landing in the Little <br/>
Bear box where I found it.  And "How 'Bout a Ride?" from azobox was <br/>
left at the Ghosts Below box back in September by the folks who <br/>
found him first.  Both will be moved on to new adventures soon!  <br/>
Thanks to both Leapin' Lizards and azobox for the neat little <br/>
travellers!<br/>

It was a great day to be back out on the trail, yes -- even the sand <br/>
dunes didn't feel quite so bad on a gorgeous day as this.<br/>

Thanks for the HH report. I'd not heard about "How 'bout A Ride?" <br/>
since September. In fact, I had to go back to my logbook to remember <br/>
the image -- that one was made during a flurry of carving last <br/>
summer/autumn.<br/>
Sounds as though you DID have a great day,..... and curious about <br/>
your Big Bear, eh?<br/>
I continue to be pleased with the civility of this list (vs. <br/>
elsewhere....hmmmm).<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's time to get out for some maintenance on mine.<br/>

Thanks for the update on Oh, the places you'll<br/>
