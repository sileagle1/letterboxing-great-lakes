                    <div class="plaintext-content">My husband and I were in San Francisco last summer and did some <br/>
boxing.  I have to say that my favorite box we found was the San <br/>
Francisco Columbarium letterbox.  The columbarium is a burial vault <br/>
since cemataries are not allowed in SF.  It is filled with alcoves <br/>
that house the remains of many SF familes.  Some of the alcoves are <br/>
very old and display beautiful old urns while some of the newer <br/>
alcoves are lovingly decorated with momentos, cards, photos, <br/>
stories, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
We never would have thought to visit the columbarium had it not been <br/>
for letterboxing, but it was one of the most beautiful places we <br/>
went while there.  The stain-glass windows and mosaics are beautiful <br/>
and make for wonderful photos.  The box only took a few minutes to <br/>
find but we spent about 2 hours there just looking around - crying <br/>
at some resting spots and laughing at others.  It is worth the trip!<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few photos - http://www.noehill.com/sf/landmarks/sf209.asp<br/>
<br/>
Have a great trip!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife and I visited "very" northern California in September of 2003 <br/>
and did some letterboxing.  The furthest south we ventured was <br/>
Eureka.  If you get a chance to go "really" north in California, we <br/>
suggest the "Oasis" box in Eureka, the "Super Sewer" (we know, it <br/>
sounds kinda wierd, but it was a nice walk), and the absolute best <br/>
hike was in the Redwoods doing the "Skunk Cabbage" box a little <br/>
further north in Orick.  There's something primevil about walking in <br/>
the Redwoods.  Have a great trip.  <br/>
