Was wondering if anyone on the list could shed some light on this one, since I can't find any answers...<br>
<br>
I know that the thing that makes you itch in poison ivy, oak, and sumac, urushiol, is in all three plants.  I also know that 90% of the population is allergic to urushiol, though some are more sensitive to it than others, and the more you're exposed, the more dramatic your reaction will be.  <br>
<br>
However, I have been in contact with poison ivy many, many times (heck, someone just pointed out that I very wickedly planted "Freebird" right in the middle of a patch of it), and have never reacted to it.  In fact, though I was vaguely aware there was poison ivy somewhere near Freebird, and I was traipsing through the woods in shorts and anklet-socks, nothing happened.  Contrast that with the dreadful case of poison sumac I'm currently nursing through its fourth- yes fourth- week.  <br>
<br>
Four weeks of poison sumac from the most delicate of encounters with it, zero reaction to poison ivy.  Anyone know anything about this?  Is it possible to react more strongly to one source of urushiol than others?  Or does God truly love a fool and spends so much time sparing me from poison ivy, that the poison sumac slips by?<br>
<br>
Just a question posed to the wise folks on this talk list.  If no one knows, I'm going to ask that Jepoardy genius.  He'll know.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Del, who will scratch that rash if she feels like it, thank you<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, urushiol is an oil and you can even come in contact with it <br>
during the winter months when no leaves are present. Some people are <br>
allergic to it and some are not. I spent 39 years traipsing through the <br>
woods and never had an outbreak of poison ivy. My husband took my dogs to <br>
the park, which is mildly wooded, and then did not wash his hands after <br>
petting them. Unfortunately for me his hand placement while we sleep is <br>
exactly where I contracted a case of poison ivy much to my dismay! So I <br>
think mother nature merely picks on us all at different points in our <br>
lives, or maybe our body chemistries change with age or other natural reasons.<br>
