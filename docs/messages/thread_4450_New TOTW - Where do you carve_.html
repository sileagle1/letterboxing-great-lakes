                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have an large armoire-style computer desk that has a table surface <br>
that flips out to my right when I am using my PC.  I have my nifty <br>
multi-hinged arm, lighted, magnifying lens mounted to the table so I do <br>
all my carving at my PC desk.  Face front & center & I'm looking at my <br>
monitor and typing on the keyboard; swivel to the right and I'm carving!<br>
<br>
I don't think I could carve without the lighted lens Martini Man got me <br>
a few years ago.  My eyes are bad and I have gotten so spoiled with the <br>
amount of detail I can see with it that I wouldn't try carving without <br>
it.  Of course I could unclamp it and move it somewhere else, but since <br>
it is fairly large, I don't bother.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I use my father's old art studio, may he rest in peace.  He was practically<br>
blind.......and I don't mean legally blind, I mean *blind* blind.  The kind<br>
of blind that glasses can't help.<br>
<br>
He made these monstrous welded statues -- used to haunt auto junkyards for<br>
parts -- some of his stuff, like his dinosaurs, were a couple of stories<br>
high.  Picture someone who's blind using a welder.  Picture the neighbors<br>
quickly leaving town when they'd hear the "whooshhhh" of the torches<br>
starting up.<br>
<br>
But since he could see shadows, and differentiate much better in extremely<br>
strong light, his studio lacked for nothing, absolutely nothing, in the way<br>
of light.  And he had tons of magnification stuff for the smaller art that<br>
he made.<br>
<br>
So I design the stamps in my own art studio, then head on over to his to do<br>
the carving.  Since, because of my health, I can't stay in one position all<br>
that long, I brought over a bunch of my exercise equipment so I can carve a<br>
bit, exercise a bit, carve a bit more, exercise a bit more.<br>
<br>
I put a TV in his studio -- which my father is probably turning over in his<br>
grave about.  Ooooooooooh, the idea of corrupting an art studio with a<br>
television set!  I really think he would have liked 'Meerkat Manor' tho on<br>
Animal Planet.  But 'Survivor'?  I wait to watch things like 'Survivor'<br>
until I get back home........don't want Dad haunting me any more than<br>
necessary.  Besides, it's too close to Halloween -- I don't trust Dad.  :-)<br>

 <br>
I have a pretty neat setup in the finished attic of my house.  It's bi-leveled, and my carving desk is in the upper level, overlooking the lower level where the computer and a TV reside, plus a window looking out into the backyard.  Bad part is that it gets hot up there (not good for markers and stamp pads...used to keep them in the refrigerator during the summer, but too many trips up and down the stairs put an end to that), even with a window a/c.  Anyway, I have a lighted magnifying lamp (my eyes are really bad) and all my toys around me.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes though I'll take my carving stuff to work with me to play with over lunch.  My coworkers just roll their eyes, but I'm used to it!<br>
