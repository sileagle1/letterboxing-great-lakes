Hey, what's the scoop on the t-shirts?  Do we preorder, or will you have<br/>
them there?  Did I miss that somewhere?  What's the cost?<br/>
<br/>
I've also seen those LbNA patches.  Does anybody have a couple extra they'd<br/>
be willing to sell?  (I'd like two or three.) Otherwise I forgot where I saw<br/>
them.  Was it on Silent Doug's site?<br/>

voted last week, please vote again this week, because the results <br/>
were reset by accident.  I need to know whether we'll have enough <br/>
people to go ahead with the T-shirts.<br/>

PS I'm not even TELLING my dad I'm going!  My siblings know, but are <br/>
sworn to secrecy.  Otherwise, it's hourly cel calls from Dad and <br/>
a "present" of mace for my pack.  Oh, well, he's the only dad I got <br/>
and I wouldn't trade him for the world.<br/>
