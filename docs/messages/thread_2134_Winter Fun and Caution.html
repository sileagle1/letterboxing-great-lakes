                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a reminder to be careful around rivers, creeks, streams and bogs ... the ground is very <br/>
saturated in Indiana now; Snowfall was 8" above average for December and now that the <br/>
snow has melted, the ground is very soft.<br/>
<br/>
Hoosier Honey Bee and I went out yesterday.  The weather was balmy and we stayed clear <br/>
of rain and storms most of the day.<br/>
<br/>
The path to one box along the Wabash in Lafayette is cut off/flooded.  We observed rapid <br/>
currents on the Wabash River, Wildcat Creek and the Mississinewa River.  My hiking stick <br/>
and shoes got stuck in mud now and then.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is my box, The Life of Riley, is alive and well after 14 months!  Completely <br/>
dry and several visitors.  After the big floods in spring of 2004, I wasn't sure I placed this <br/>
box high enough.<br/>
<br/>
Happy winter boxing,<br/>
