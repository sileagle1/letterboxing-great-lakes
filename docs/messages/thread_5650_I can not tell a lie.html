                    <div class="plaintext-content">In light of the upcoming President's Day, I have chosen to take the high road and follow in <br>
the lead of our 1st President, George Washington, regarding his famous cherry tree incident, <br>
and our 16th President, good ol' honest Abe, and come clean about my Bingo streak.<br>
<br>
In all of the excitement of our Iditarod victory, I missed a few days this week of Bingo words <br>
and asked Tonto to sit down with me and double check our cards this morning.   As I read the <br>
list of called words he noticed that on January 8, I had overlooked the word "PACE" on my <br>
card!  You can only imagine the shock!<br>
<br>
So, it is with great humility that I must abdicate my crown to one more deserving.  I will let <br>
the letterboxing parliament (or the keeper of such records) make the decision as to the <br>
rightful successor.  Is it "Familyof6" with the longest losing streak from the beginning, or the <br>
crazed chicken dancin' "Birdwoman" who has the longer number of days without words <br>
called?  Or could there be one of the "silent" bingo players that might qualify?  Nonetheless, <br>
let it be said that I was happy to serve as your letterboxing bingo queen even though I was <br>
innocently fraudulent in my position.<br>
<br>
TIptoe...(who hopes the Iditarod points still stand because she still only has 5 Bingo words <br>
and has no hope of winning any Bingo games this year!)<br>
