Mrs. Cottontails, Emily and I headed out today with time finally on our <br/>
side and pulled all but two of our Illinois boxes for the winter and <br/>
some much needed maintenance.  The only boxes available are <br/>
Chickadeedeedee and by appointment, Strennenacht.  Sorry if this <br/>
impacts any plans.  We have some fun stories about this including <br/>
finding money in a box and finding two boxes that were supposed to be <br/>

We had reports of the box going missing, so in the spring we made a trek to check it out. We found the box out of place and open to the elements, but through the miracle of plastic, the baggies had protected the contents. Lots of water in the box, though.<br/>
<br/>
The box had also apparently become a minor shrine to geocaching since the usual nicknacks had accumulated in the box. But the best was the rent paid coming up to about $1.25. <br/>

<br/>
As for looooong time missing letterboxes, you can only imagine my surprise when one of my missing boxes reappeared this week.   It truly was gone for about 2 months.  I had reports, then I checked myself.  Gone!  <br/>
<br/>
The idea of mystery letterboxers who are simply 'out there' and may not be playing by 'the rules' is a scary thing.  Ex.  You go looking for a letterbox, but forgot your stamp at home.  So, simply take the box home with you to stamp in and then bring it back the next time you get around to it.  YIKES!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm enjoying this mild weather.  No snow or ice on the ground (not yet), so it was a perfect day to take a long walk and look for some new boxes.  Then, I go to work in the afternoon and into the late evening hours and stand on my feet.  What was I thinking?  <br/>
<br/>
I realized that I tend to go seeking boxes in the fall and winter months because....no heat, sweat, dry mouth, or mosquitoes.  This is nice weather to fill your lungs with crisp air.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a reminder (as if anyone needs to be reminded), tell Santa what a good letterboxer you have been all year and how you would like him to bring you more slabs of PZ Kut (or whatever you prefer).   It pays to stock up for those freezing Midwest days ahead.  Creating new boxes is a good cure for cabin fever.  <br/>

Turns out a FedEx driver had a flat tire and stopped just feet away from  the <br/>
box. As he walked around, possibly relieving himself (who knows) he came  <br/>
across the box. He put a few dollars in with a note explaining who he was and  <br/>
asked that those who found the box after him add a dollar so that if some  <br/>
unfortunate soul stumbled across it he/she would have a few dollars for a meal  or <br/>
fuel.<br/>

But sometimes, there's not a whole lot of choice.  I've been in a position 4<br/>
times now where I had no choice but to take the box with me temporarily.<br/>
Granted that's 4 times over almost twice as many years but it does happen<br/>
where I'll find a box, take it away to someplace secluded to stamp in, and<br/>
then go to return the box only to find a veritable picnic taking place right<br/>
where I have to return the box.  Once recently, in Oakbrook, IL on the<br/>
McDonald's campus, a love-in was taking place when we returned to the spot,<br/>
so we took the box home, waited a few hours, and then returned.  We thought<br/>
we were posolutely, absitively, safe since it was Halloween.  I mean, who<br/>
goes out into the woods on Halloween.  Who goes out into the woods to *make<br/>
out* on Halloween??  Haven't they watched 'Blair Witch'????<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there's just no way to create a reliable distraction where I can<br/>
feel really sure the box was safe, and to me, the ultimate rule is to keep<br/>
the box safe.  My sister once almost ended up having to take a box home.<br/>
She was out letterboxing on the N.I.U. campus and ended up spending<br/>
something like 5 hours there, waiting for the scene to be free enough so<br/>
that she could replace the box.  She was just on the verge of having to take<br/>
the box home when the place cleared out sufficiently.<br/>
<br/>
For that reason, the safety of the box, we don't like to stamp in anywhere<br/>
in the actual vicinity of the box.  We tend to go far away.  And sometimes,<br/>
when we've returned, conditions have unfortunately changed for the worse.<br/>
And it's always possible that someone else came along looking for the box,<br/>
didn't find it, and naturally didn't see us because we weren't right there<br/>
stamping in.........we were far away stamping in...........and might have<br/>
left, assuming the box is missing.  I've been thinking of making up a little<br/>
business card that says something like "If you're looking for a particular<br/>
treasure, it hasn't gone missing, it's just being stamped into at the<br/>
moment.  It shall return soon."  The only trouble is, if someone waits<br/>
around for us to return, and we don't know they're boxers, we're not just<br/>
going to walk up with the box in hand, we're going to hide in the woods<br/>
until we see the coast is clear.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it's happened 5 times, but once was to my own box.  I went to<br/>
check on the box, which was at the very tip of Boy Scout Island in Geneva,<br/>
IL, took it back to my car early in the morning to quietly see if any<br/>
maintenance was necessary, and lo and behold, when I went to replace the<br/>
box, it seemed like all the fishermen in the world had come out of the<br/>
woodwork to congregate at the tip of that island.  I hadn't thought of the<br/>
fact that people who fish often start their fishing very early in the<br/>
morning.  So that box got replaced but unfortunately rather rudely.  Because<br/>
the fishermen just never showed any signs of leaving.<br/>
<br/>
So finally, my Caveman was tired of waiting, decided to become a klutz for<br/>
the day, "tripped" over a tree stump near the shoreline, and fell into the<br/>
Fox River.  Created quite a splash.  Continued to flounder around out there<br/>
and made a ton of noise and splash while I snuck over and replaced the box<br/>
since he now had the attention of everyone on shore except me.  The only<br/>
downside was that he then had a large bunch of fishermen more than a little<br/>
angry with him and he was soaking wet to boot and it was a 45 minute drive<br/>
home to dry clothes.  But, yipee, I got the box replaced.  And I let him<br/>
stop at Starbucks in Geneva so that was one very small thing that made his<br/>
day a wee bit better.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
Glad to know you're still out there.  Yes, protecting the safety of the box is the ultimate goal.  As a box owner yourself, you know the work involved in creating and placing a box.  There is nothing more sad than a box that vanishes.  I was laughing out loud while reading your story about the "Mc Love-In" in the woods on Halloween.   <br/>
Q.  Who goes out in the woods on Halloween?  A.  A letterboxer looking for a box...holidays don't stop us.  <br/>
Taking the box a distance from the spot is a good way to protect the box, particularly in an area of high traffic or even if you think there might be too many watchful eyes that might be observing you from a distance.  These are conditions that some boxers don't consider, but thank you for mentioning the amount of care you take when finding and replacing a box.  As for the splashing distraction....OH MAN!  You are soooooo good.  Reminds me of the time I had to dump all the contents out of my purse onto a NY sidewalk just so I could get down on my knees (while I was really looking under a mail box for a stamp) and still look natural.  Once I knew exactly where the box was hidden, it was a piece of cake to palm it and walk away from the area.  Of course, the old purse got dumped again when I had to return and replace the box.  It certainly would have helped it I had tie on shoes; I could have stooped down and pretended to tie my shoes instead.  But when boxes disappear for months or longer...that's something that we haven't been able to figure out.  Real hard core letterboxers wouldn't take a box home for months.  Matter of fact, I just had one thoughtful boxer tell me that he found one of my boxes, damaged, and rather than leave it, he took it home and he's mailing it back to me.  I'll send him the postal cost.  I was so impressed by his consideration for my box.  That's a real letterboxer!  I wish there were more out there like him.  <br/>
<br/>
Here's hoping that all missing boxes will return, no questions asked.  I just hope that someone or a group of someones don't think that letterboxing is a find and collect 'em hobby.  <br/>

  The idea of mystery letterboxers who are simply 'out there' and may not be<br/>
  playing by 'the rules' is a scary thing. Ex. You go looking for a<br/>
  letterbox, but forgot your stamp at home. So, simply take the box home with<br/>
  you to stamp in and then bring it back the next time you get around to it.<br/>
  YIKES!<br/>
