We have 52 people playing Bingo this year... 54 including the two unofficial forms that MI_Rockstar and I are playing at home. All booty is in, with the exception of a couple people who were thwarted by a system glitch at Stampeaz, but Webfoot has confirmed the purchases were made and will be on the way to me very soon.<br/><br/>Today is the first word... I will post in a separate thread in just a few minutes... don't fall off the edge of your chair there...<br/><br/>Wisconsin Hiker... I love the GL Bingo photo!<br/><br/>SpringChick</p></body></html>
