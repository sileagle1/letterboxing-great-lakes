I posted a few photos of Saturday's gathering.  We didn't get a chance <br/>
to take too many, though, between all the chatting with friends, <br/>
finding boxes and wrangling kiddos.  We definitely had a great time, <br/>
though, and the kids enjoyed every second.  A special thanks to Sue of <br/>
CerealCityBoxers for being such a good friend to Charlie :) - he was <br/>
very sad to see you guys leave!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to seeing what photos the non-child-focused <br/>
photographers out there may have taken - post away, folks!<br/>
