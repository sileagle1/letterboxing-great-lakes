Those of you who were at the very first Great Lakes gathering may <br>
remember my brother's wife, Paula Shanks.  I started letterboxing in <br>
the summer of 2002, when my daughter found the site mentioned on a <br>
blog and discovered there were two boxes in Presque Isle park in <br>
Marquette, which is my hometown and where we often spend lots  of <br>
summer vacation time.  I passed the mention on to my sister-in-law <br>
Paula, who was planning to join us in the U.P.  Paula was a serious <br>
rubber stamp artist, and when she came up from Ann Arbor to join us <br>
she brought along books of clip art, good carving tools, lots of <br>
erasers, and blank journals for each of us.   Before the week was <br>
over, we'd each chosen and carved our personal stamps, found the <br>
Presque Isle boxes, and even planted our own box, with a stamp <br>
designed and carved by Paula, on Sugarloaf Mountain.   <br>
   Paula never letterboxed except with us, but she did come to the <br>
Great Lakes gathering and this summer, when we were all in Wyoming <br>
together, she carved the stamps for four of the seven boxes we placed <br>
there.  <br>
  Paula died very suddenly on December 2nd.  Her personal stamp, a <br>
pair of glasses, graced the front on the memorial program (her name <br>
was written with her own hand-carved alphabet) and the photo on the <br>
back was of her with a rubber stamp sculpture. The link to her <br>
obituary, which includes a photo of the program, is here.  <br>

I've also posted with a photo taken at the Great Lakes Gathering (and <br>
copied from the LbGLK site but I think it may have been my photo to <br>
begin with--if not, my apologies and thanks).  That post is here. <br>

John and his daughter Kati (a high school senior) are thirsty for <br>
comments on the blog, so feel free to add one.  <br>
<br>
And value the time you have with those you love.  We never know when <br>
one of our meetings may be the last.  <br>
