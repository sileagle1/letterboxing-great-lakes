Wow, almost more info than I can handle as a newbie but....it sure <br>
has given me some ideas.  The stamp logbook that we use to collect <br>
the stamp images that we find is one that I made from a notepad with <br>
a teacher/education design around the edges.  We all thought it fit <br>
since our group is retired teachers.  (Can you picture us stumbling <br>
around in the woods?)  Anyway, I used a binder machine from school <br>
and then put a very thin piece of birch bark that we found on our <br>
first letterboxing excursion on the front and back covers to decorate <br>
it.  We call it our "Stalking the Wild Letterbox with the <br>
WonderBroads" book. lol  Maybe we will do one something like that for <br>
our first letterbox.  So, thanks for all the input to my little <br>
question about how to make a log book.  I haven't had this much <br>
milage from a question since I left the classroom.  :)  I think i <br>
like this group !!!!!  <br>

hummmm?  Must be something about retired teachers!<br>

Thanks for the compliment but we are not the same bunch of retirees.  <br>
I'm glad you enjoyed the company of the Wi. retired group however.  <br>
All the retired teachers that I have met around the country seem to <br>
be really enjoying themselves.  I can tell you that since I retired <br>
(25 of us busted out at the same time) we have been having a blast.  <br>
The half dozen of us that make up the "WonderBroads of Grand Ledge" <br>
letterboxing gang are constantly busy doing some fun thing and even <br>
started a Red Hat Society chapter of the same name.  Hey, I think <br>
there is a stamp idea in there somewhere.  Anyway, we are hoping to <br>
get in a LOT more letterboxing before the snow falls.  <br>
