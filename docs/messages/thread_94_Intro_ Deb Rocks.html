                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings all! Dragon and Wisconsin Hiker told me about this group a <br>
few weeks ago and I'm finally getting around to joining in.<br>
<br>
I feel like I know a lot of you through various email correspondences <br>
I've had with you since I started letterboxing last October. And, of <br>
course, I met Dragon, Acorn, Leapin Lizards, Wisconsin Hiker, Martini <br>
Man, Agent Ink, and others (I know I'm missing names) at a recent <br>
gathering in Milwaukee. While it was a gathering of mostly Wisconsin <br>
letterboxers, everyone was very welcoming to me (a Minnesota <br>
letterboxer). It was great meeting you all and I hope to see some of <br>
you again, and meet many more of you at the Great Lakes Gathering in <br>
June. <br>
<br>
Minnesota is sadly lacking in letterboxes right now; although I'm <br>
trying to remedy that. I've now planted 9 (clues to the most recent 5 <br>
to be posted very shortly), plus 2 hitchhikers.<br>
<br>
I haven't found as many boxes as I'd like to by now. We just don't <br>
have that many here. Yet. I have been able to make a few brief trips <br>
to Illinois and Wisconsin to do some hunting. I'd love to get further <br>
afield sometime this summer. Maybe Michigan? The company I work for <br>
recently merged with a company out in Connecticut. I keep telling my <br>
boss they need to send me out there for business. I can always stay <br>
an extra few days and do some hunting. I hear you virtually trip over <br>
them out there, there are so many!<br>
<br>
I orginally got into letterboxing after reading an article in a <br>
stamping magazine. I remember the first time I read the article for <br>
some reason it didn't appeal to me.(Don't know why. I love hiking, <br>
the outdoors, puzzles, art, stamping.)<br>
<br>
I read the article again, a few weeks later and it just hit me, I had <br>
to start doing this immediately! I went out and bought materials that <br>
day and was carving stamps later that day and hunting for my first <br>
box the next day. The personal stamp I used in my first few hunts was <br>
very big and not a great representation of me, but I just had to get <br>
out there! After my first few finds I decided I really needed to get <br>
myself a trail name and a stamp to match it. <br>
<br>
One of my favorite things, after family, friends and my dogs, are <br>
rocks. I just love rocks! I have them all over my house, garage, <br>
yard, car, work. I carry them in my pockets. Well, you get the <br>
picture... That's how I arrived at my trail name and my stamp. The <br>
stamp was still an early effort and probably too big but I've grown <br>
kind of attached to it and, when the logbook is very small, I just <br>
stamp part of it.<br>
<br>
I look forward to participating in group discussions and hopefully <br>
meeting many of you in June. Great to finally have a group geared <br>
towards Midwest/Great Lakes LBrs! Thanks Spring Chick for getting it <br>
going! And thanks Dragon for organizing our upcoming gathering!<br>

well I figure Minnesota has a really great, Great Lake and I visit <br>
the other states around Lake Michigan much more than I would be <br>
visiting out East or the Rocky Mountains or Northwest, so it made <br>
sense for me to join this group.<br>
<br>
Thanks also, for the encouragement about planting them and they will <br>
come. That's advice I've heard from others too, so I'm really taking <br>
it to heart. Clues for my five most recently planted boxes will be <br>
out on LBNA by tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to meeting you at the gathering!<br>
