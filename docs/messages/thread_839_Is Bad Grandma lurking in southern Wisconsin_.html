Do Leapin' Lizards place their boxes near where others practice their secret <br>
vices, or is that Acorn and Golden Boy have an affinity for secret stashes of all <br>
sorts?<br>
<br>
Two weeks ago, searching for the second Chocolate City series, we <br>
happened upon a stash of "adult reading" hidden in the woods.  Yesterday, as <br>
were finishing up the Greatest Show on Earth series, Golden Boy found a <br>
leather box.  He opened it, and found it had once held a watch.  Being a <br>
curious sort, he lifted the interior structure and found two cigarettes stashed <br>
inside.<br>
<br>
It was clear that neither the reading or smoking malefactors were letterboxers, <br>
as both magazines and cigarettes were soaked and unusable.  I'd hate to <br>
think what we might find on the trail if Bad Grandma learns to store her vices <br>
in the woods in little plastic containers.<br>

I think, awesome Acorn, that it's you...after all, I don't know anyone else who could find a <br>
hidden, bookmarked, well-read, leatherette-bound Bible stashed atop a filthy steel <br>
support pillar on the trail to Chicago Underground.<br>

Remember the Bad Grandma rule, Acorn: if you can find Grandma's <br>
cigarettes, you can have one!  <br>
