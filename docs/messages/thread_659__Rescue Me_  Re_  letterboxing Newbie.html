needed rescuing ourselves.  We were looking around, stalking the Big <br>
Two-Hearted River box near Seney and the mosquitos were as big as a <br>
Buick.  We were hoping a kind hearted woodsman would come tearing <br>
down the fire trail and give us a lift back to our van. Sure hope <br>
there is no West Nile Virus in the UP !!!!!   How does one reply to a <br>
message?  I'm new at this. I just posted a new message and pretended <br>
it was a reply.  Pathetic huh!  <br>
