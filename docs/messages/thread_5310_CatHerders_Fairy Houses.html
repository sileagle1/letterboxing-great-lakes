My computer was broken, but it's fixed now and I'm back on line tonight.  <br>
<br>
Last Thursday, I was up rather late into the wee hours of the morning making white birch furniture for my fairy house.  Over the weekend, I attended a GS workshop all about fairy houses, although I already knew more than most because I have the book.  But I did get to see the video!    <br>
Today (Thursday) I found an 'inviting' piece of bark and a gnarly tree branch which inspired me to create an elaborate and weatherproof fairy house in my front yard.  Entrance way (tall grass, rocks, grapevine,[ine cones, pods).   Under a large piece of bark is the living room with a paper birch floor covering, dining room with crab apples on the table, and a bedroom with a moss floor and a feather bed.   Also, there is a pool (sea shell), beach house (small gourd), and a seating area with a teepee-shaped screened patio.  Lots of turkey feathers for shade.  And the tiniest piece of wood shaped like a canoe.<br>
<br>
For those who don't know what a fairy house looks like.... www.fairyhouses.com<http://www.fairyhouses.com/>  It's amazing the projects we get involved in when we spent time outside enjoying nature.  <br>
<br>
How special it would be to be walking through the woods or along a shoreline and stumble across a fairy house located near a letterbox.  Believe.  There is magic in nature.<br>
<br>
Maybe a fairy house will magically appear at the 10th WI Gathering in Door County.  <br>

  Okay, I am cracking up - the only fairy houses we have ever built are <br>
  outside. I have this picture of you outside in the middle of the night <br>
  building fairy houses around your yard, lol!<br>

  still working and we have entered the "safe" arrival zone!)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oooo - you do know about Fairy Houses!  Yours sound like sooooo much <br>
fun!  I never thought about having them leave one near a "clue" trail <br>
where people might actually stumble upon it in their search for a box - <br>
too fun!  My children would find that so exciting to find themselves <br>
(since they have left many here and there).  At this point, the only <br>
fairy that they believe exists is the Tooth Fairy (okay, make that the 7 <br>
year old, but even he is suspicious - he has lost several top teeth this <br>
summer and is amazed at how many "nights off" the Tooth Fairy <br>
has......LOL!), but still - she has to have somewhere to stop and rest, <br>
heehee.<br>
