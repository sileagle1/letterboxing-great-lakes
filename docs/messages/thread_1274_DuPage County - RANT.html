                    <div class="plaintext-content">So after careful design, carving, making the log book,<br/>
finding the perfect spot at the location that the<br/>
stamp goes with, I finally had my first letter box<br/>
ready to plant...  and remembered "Darn, someone said<br/>
I need a permit to place this in DuPage County Forest<br/>
Preserves."<br/>
So, trying to do the right thing, I call up the<br/>
offices, and find out that along with the permit, that<br/>
has to be approved before you can place the box, there<br/>
is a $35 fee.<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I love to support the forest<br/>
preserves, the money goes to a good cause.... but I<br/>
went to their website, and they have fees for<br/>
everything!  Fees for the off-leash dog areas, for<br/>
model boats, model airplanes, even use of some of the<br/>
grills in the preserves!  OK, I was disturbed.<br/>
Unfortunately, I will now not be placing my box where<br/>
I wanted, and will try to find either a city park<br/>
close by, or over the border in Cook County.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read the DuPage County rules that were uploaded to the files section. I<br/>
think one line is pretty indicative of the county's thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think they really want geocachers (and from what I understand,<br/>
letterboxers are lumped in there too).  I think they say it all in one<br/>
sentence.  The sentence where they state that virtual caches are welcome.  I<br/>
think that says it all. : )<br/>
<br/>
I've lived in DuPage County for over 50 years and the preserves are<br/>
beautiful.  They're not as pretty as areas that many other states have but<br/>
they're beautiful given the features they have to work with here in DuPage<br/>
County.  Even though there are a ton of volunteers, it also takes a ton of<br/>
employees to maintain the preserves.  A lot of money goes into both buying<br/>
the land and then doing the maintenance and repairing any damage.<br/>
<br/>
The rules listed for the geocaches (and letterboxes) involve having to fill<br/>
out paperwork that an employee or two is going to have to review.  Then the<br/>
placer has to meet an employee (not a volunteer) on the site of where the<br/>
cache/box will be placed to determine that it's a suitable site.  Then the<br/>
placer has to check in with the employee once a month stating that the<br/>
cache/box has been checked that month and that there's no problem.  And if a<br/>
report doesn't come in, I'm assuming that the employee then has to go yank<br/>
the box, or tell another employee to.<br/>
<br/>
They also might be worried that if no-gooders show up to vandalize the<br/>
boxes, will they also damage something else in the preserve while they're in<br/>
a vandalism mood?  Mmeaning more expense?  In other words, the permit fee<br/>
also includes a sort of "liability tax" maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Is that something the taxpayers should have to pay for or should it be a<br/>
pay-as-you-go type of system?  I can see both sides.  People that play golf<br/>
have to pay, people that want to be involved with horses (Danada) have to<br/>
pay, people fishing have to pay for a fishing license, people using the dog<br/>
parks now have to pay -- everybody pays their part if they're using the<br/>
preserves for anything more than hiking, sunbathing, or eating their lunch.<br/>
That keeps the general all-purpose tax that I (and all DuPage homeowners)<br/>
pay on my property taxes a bit lower.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it keeps many homeowners who are already living from<br/>
paycheck to paycheck from being able to participate in many of the programs<br/>
offered.  (Of course, they CAN still participate in geocaching or<br/>
letterboxing as long as someone with more money has placed caches or boxes.)<br/>
<br/>
I think the outlay of $35 per each little cache or box seems high because<br/>
it's all concentrated to the placer.  There's no way to charge the finders.<br/>
Whereas if a group is having a picnic, the fee can be divied up among all<br/>
the participants. Or if a person is taking a class, the fee can be<br/>
proportionally lower because many people are going to be signing up for that<br/>
same class.<br/>
<br/>
Awhile back, I was up in Lake County to go look for a couple of boxes in<br/>
Independence Grove.  I was unpleasantly surprised to find that there was a<br/>
$5 fee for folks to enter the area if they're not Lake County residents.<br/>
And that's just to get into the park itself.  There's no guarantee that the<br/>
boxes will still be there or will be in good condition or anything.  So as a<br/>
finder, I don't know as that I want to be charged much to go looking for a<br/>
box that might not be there or might not be useable. : )  So a box could<br/>
have 100 finders.  But unless the finders are charged, the poor placer has<br/>
to pay a lot more.  I didn't consider $5 a bad price tho.  I didn't end up<br/>
finding either box and I don't think I'll pay another $5 for the privilege<br/>
of going back up there and searching again, but if I'd found the boxes the<br/>
first time, it would have been worth it to me.<br/>
<br/>
I would have preferred if they left it on the honor system to begin with in<br/>
DuPage County.  Just state environmentally safe rules they want followed and<br/>
see if people stick to them.  If there were any problems, THEN go with the<br/>
permits, screens, checks, etc or eliminate caching and boxing entirely.  But<br/>
I don't think they want the caches out there period, because caches are a<br/>
dime a dozen around here.  I think the county minds might be working<br/>
overtime in worrying about the possible damages.<br/>
<br/>
I had hoped to replant Pippi's and Keith's boxes.  At $35 a whack, I can't<br/>
afford it. I might try a couple and see how it goes.  Has anyone on here<br/>
actually gone through the system and had a box approved yet?<br/>

I don't mind paying to get into a park. That is reasonable enough.  Like you <br/>

<br/>
Every year I pay the State of Michigan for a pass for my vehicle -- I have been doing this for years, since I had my own vehicle -- the cost is currently at $24/yr.  This enables me to use any state park in Michigan, for the entire year.  Now if I want to enter the park with my yearly pass and fish, I need also to have a state fishing license -- this allows me to fish for an entire year at any park in the state -- for $28/yr I can get both the standard and the salmon upgrade.  If I want to use my state park pass and take my vehicle off-roading I need also to purchase an off-road vehicle license -- for about $20 I can off-road at any orv area for the entire year.<br/>
<br/>
My point is -- most all of these things are charged and licensed annually.  I would not mind paying an annual fee to be able to plant letterboxes in the park -- as many as I want, at any park, for the entire year.  But $35 each is a bit ridiculous.<br/>

&gt;   think one line is pretty indicative of the county's thinking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I don't think they really want geocachers (and from what I understand,<br/>
&gt;   letterboxers are lumped in there too).  I think they say it all in one<br/>
&gt;   sentence.  The sentence where they state that virtual caches are <br/>
&gt; welcome.  I<br/>
&gt;   think that says it all. : )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I've lived in DuPage County for over 50 years and the preserves are<br/>
&gt;   beautiful.  They're not as pretty as areas that many other states have but<br/>
&gt;   they're beautiful given the features they have to work with here in DuPage<br/>
&gt;   County.  Even though there are a ton of volunteers, it also takes a ton of<br/>
&gt;   employees to maintain the preserves.  A lot of money goes into both buying<br/>
&gt;   the land and then doing the maintenance and repairing any damage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   The rules listed for the geocaches (and letterboxes) involve having to fill<br/>
&gt;   out paperwork that an employee or two is going to have to review.  Then the<br/>
&gt;   placer has to meet an employee (not a volunteer) on the site of where the<br/>
&gt;   cache/box will be placed to determine that it's a suitable site.  Then the<br/>
&gt;   placer has to check in with the employee once a month stating that the<br/>
&gt;   cache/box has been checked that month and that there's no problem.  And <br/>
&gt; if a<br/>
&gt;   report doesn't come in, I'm assuming that the employee then has to go yank<br/>
&gt;   the box, or tell another employee to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   They also might be worried that if no-gooders show up to vandalize the<br/>
&gt;   boxes, will they also damage something else in the preserve while <br/>
&gt; they're in<br/>
&gt;   a vandalism mood?  Mmeaning more expense?  In other words, the permit fee<br/>
&gt;   also includes a sort of "liability tax" maybe?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Is that something the taxpayers should have to pay for or should it be a<br/>
&gt;   pay-as-you-go type of system?  I can see both sides.  People that play golf<br/>
&gt;   have to pay, people that want to be involved with horses (Danada) have to<br/>
&gt;   pay, people fishing have to pay for a fishing license, people using the dog<br/>
&gt;   parks now have to pay -- everybody pays their part if they're using the<br/>
&gt;   preserves for anything more than hiking, sunbathing, or eating their lunch.<br/>
&gt;   That keeps the general all-purpose tax that I (and all DuPage homeowners)<br/>
&gt;   pay on my property taxes a bit lower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   On the other hand, it keeps many homeowners who are already living from<br/>
&gt;   paycheck to paycheck from being able to participate in many of the programs<br/>
&gt;   offered.  (Of course, they CAN still participate in geocaching or<br/>
&gt;   letterboxing as long as someone with more money has placed caches or <br/>
&gt; boxes.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I think the outlay of $35 per each little cache or box seems high because<br/>
&gt;   it's all concentrated to the placer.  There's no way to charge the finders.<br/>
&gt;   Whereas if a group is having a picnic, the fee can be divied up among all<br/>
&gt;   the participants. Or if a person is taking a class, the fee can be<br/>
&gt;   proportionally lower because many people are going to be signing up for <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt;   same class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Awhile back, I was up in Lake County to go look for a couple of boxes in<br/>
&gt;   Independence Grove.  I was unpleasantly surprised to find that there was a<br/>
&gt;   $5 fee for folks to enter the area if they're not Lake County residents.<br/>
&gt;   And that's just to get into the park itself.  There's no guarantee that the<br/>
&gt;   boxes will still be there or will be in good condition or anything.  So <br/>
&gt; as a<br/>
&gt;   finder, I don't know as that I want to be charged much to go looking for a<br/>
&gt;   box that might not be there or might not be useable. : )  So a box could<br/>
&gt;   have 100 finders.  But unless the finders are charged, the poor placer has<br/>
&gt;   to pay a lot more.  I didn't consider $5 a bad price tho.  I didn't end up<br/>
&gt;   finding either box and I don't think I'll pay another $5 for the privilege<br/>
&gt;   of going back up there and searching again, but if I'd found the boxes the<br/>
&gt;   first time, it would have been worth it to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I would have preferred if they left it on the honor system to begin with in<br/>
&gt;   DuPage County.  Just state environmentally safe rules they want <br/>
&gt; followed and<br/>
&gt;   see if people stick to them.  If there were any problems, THEN go with the<br/>
&gt;   permits, screens, checks, etc or eliminate caching and boxing <br/>
&gt; entirely.  But<br/>
&gt;   I don't think they want the caches out there period, because caches are a<br/>
&gt;   dime a dozen around here.  I think the county minds might be working<br/>
&gt;   overtime in worrying about the possible damages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I had hoped to replant Pippi's and Keith's boxes.  At $35 a whack, I can't<br/>
&gt;   afford it. I might try a couple and see how it goes.  Has anyone on here<br/>
&gt;   actually gone through the system and had a box approved yet?<br/>

But I do think that $35 is awfully steep!  $5 or even $10 would be reasonable, but $35 is more than I pay for a month's worth of Tae Kwon Do classes at the Urbana Park District.  And is that a one time fee or a yearly fee?  It certainly looks like the county is trying to discourage geocaching/letterboxing to me.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure if you're talking about DuPage County, IL or if you're talking<br/>
about SpringChick's MI, but if you're talking about DuPage County, I think<br/>
you'd have to be a registered voter of DuPage County.  Or possibly be a<br/>
non-resident but have a friend(s) either on the county board or on the<br/>
forest preserve district board (they're two separate groups now).  The<br/>
county board would have to be approached.<br/>
<br/>
It might work to the negative for non-residents to complain. And I don't<br/>
know just how many registered voter letterboxers there really are in DuPage.<br/>
The pendulum of emotion has sort of been swinging against non-residents<br/>
lately.  For example, with the dog parks.  The fact that all dogs now need<br/>
their own license to be present in our really nice off-lead dog park areas<br/>
didn't sit well at first with many residents.  But when people realized that<br/>
it will help keep many of the Cook County dog owners out of the DuPage dog<br/>
areas -- Cook County owners can obtain licenses also but at higher prices --<br/>
it greatly grew in favor and the idea passed.  People had often been getting<br/>
more than a little ticked off at all the Cook County dog owners bringing<br/>
their dogs into DuPage dog parks.  Cook County just doesn't have much at ALL<br/>
in the way of nice dog parks in the suburbs where dogs have a lot of room to<br/>
legally run and play off-lead.  Instead of pushing for dog parks in their<br/>
own areas, large numbers of Cook County residents were bring their dogs to<br/>
DuPage dog parks.<br/>
<br/>
So I can imagine the possible reaction if non-residents complain about the<br/>
placement fee for letterboxes.  "Awwwwwww....poor babies.........let them go<br/>
place letterboxes in their OWN preserves...."  I don't know if they've done<br/>
so already, but they might even think up a HIGHER fee for non-residents to<br/>
place a box if non-residents happen to complain. : )<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to consider is the fact that DuPage County is one of the<br/>
wealthiest counties in the country when it comes to household income.  It<br/>
ranks in the top 20 in the entire country.  Altho I think Lake County beats<br/>
it out.  I think Lake County is something like #5 in the country and DuPage<br/>
is something like #10.  $35 might not seem like much to most residents here.<br/>
So the general income of the area might be something to consider.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people who work in this county can no longer afford to live in this<br/>
county.  I know with me that all I need is one more property tax increase<br/>
(literally) and I'll have to move.  I've got one of the cheapest houses<br/>
currently available in the county.  So if I do end up having to move, I'll<br/>
be forced out of DuPage if I want to stay with a single family unattached<br/>
home.  I just can't afford the mortgage plus the property tax.  But them's<br/>
the breaks.  Then I'll be one of those people paying for a non-resident dog<br/>
license for the dog parks. : )<br/>
<br/>
So DuPage is both beautiful and ridiculous all the way around.<br/>
<br/>
But if you were talking about MI, then ignore all of the above.<br/>

letterboxing in DuPage???<br/>
<br/>
DuPage County is very senior citizen conscious.  If some resident SENIOR<br/>
letterboxers were to complain........<br/>
<br/>
I know for the dog park areas, it's $35 per year for the first dog and $5<br/>
for each additional dog for residents.  For non-residents, it's $150 per<br/>
year for the first dog and $20 for each additional dog.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, for senior citizens, the license for the first dog is totally free and<br/>
it's $5 for each additional dog.<br/>
<br/>
If they'd give seniors free box placements, then all we need to do is find a<br/>
few seniors we can push out into the preserves to place some boxes for us.<br/>
Kind of like what Cook County does with the contract bidding when they give<br/>
preferences to women or minority owned businesses.  Businesses find women or<br/>
minorities to quickly push into place on paper.  Instead of women or<br/>
minorities, WE might need to find a few seniors to front us if the county<br/>
would consider a senior discount.  Of course, then the county might wonder<br/>
why all box and cache placers all seem to be over the age of 65.  Hey, it's<br/>
good exercise and sure beats bingo, right?  Unfortunately, all my<br/>
grandparents and parents are dead.  Of course, in Cook County, they say<br/>
death doesn't matter much, so maybe it wouldn't in DuPage either.<br/>

Thank you for your recent inquiry regarding geocaching within the <br/>
Forest Preserve District of DuPage County.  I have attached the <br/>
District Geocaching rules (these rules are the same for <br/>
letterboxing).  I have also included an application for special use <br/>
permit.  No fees or insurance certificates are required for geocache <br/>
permits.  If you would like to submit a request for a geocache <br/>
location, please complete the application and fax it back to my <br/>
attention.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any <br/>
additional questions.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

I think the "ranters" are reading the fees for "special use <br/>
permits", which must be filed for geocache and letterbox placement, <br/>
but without the fee - the fee is only for using the FPD for a picnic <br/>
or other gathering.  So, they use the same form only.  Thanks for <br/>
ringing in on this one CMoon!  Files are being uploaded into the <br/>
files section.<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

there to confirm and was told the fee did exist.  I was encouraged to do a<br/>
