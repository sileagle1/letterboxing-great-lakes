<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/files/Gatherings/2010%20Great%20Lakes%20Gathering/Coin-Operated.doc <br>
<br>
It is a longer hike, so we figured if anyone gets to the park earlier on Friday, that they might want a warm-up to get ready for the big day.  The clues will also be included in the clue packet distributed at the event.<br>
<br>
If anyone has a problem opening the MS Word file, let me know and I could send as a pdf.<br>
<br>
We'll looking forward to seeing a bunch of you on Saturday!<br>
