On September 7th, we made a trip to Rockford. Unlike the one we made <br/>
last April the day was sunny and warm. The city looks much more <br/>
inviting without a deluge of rain falling on us.<br/>
<br/>
We decided we wanted to be home to get the kids in bed on time . . . <br/>
meaning leaving Rockford at about 5pm.<br/>
<br/>
We made our first stop in Grand Detour, IL to plant a box at the John <br/>
Deere Historic Site. Thanks to Judy, a manager there for contacting <br/>
me and giving me permission to hide the box there. <br/>
<br/>
Check out PW's "John Deere Plow" while there... its almost a 2 for 1 <br/>
deal. Sorry PW, for the close proximity, I felt compelled to follow <br/>
Judy's lead on the hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
We then went on to Byron where we found one of the IRT boxes by <br/>
p.granola honoring the Turkey Testicle Festival.<br/>
<br/>
Let me just say how proud I am of our family. We ALL WALKED, the <br/>
twins (age 2 1/2) walked too... no stroller!! This is a big milestone <br/>
for us. William didn't want to walk at first, so Becki put him on her <br/>
shoulders. I SO wish I had a camera with me, as he clung to her face <br/>
as if he were a cat and she trying to put him in a tub of water. <br/>
Hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
He did get down and walked most the rest. We had a wonderful time, <br/>
looking at all the flowers, bugs, grasshoppers, etc. <br/>
<br/>
The girls grabbed some "walking sticks" and Maddie followed suite. <br/>
Then Will picked up a "walking stick" that was about 3 inches long <br/>
and proceeded to walk bent at the waste so that his stick could touch <br/>
the ground. LOL that was too funny.<br/>
<br/>
Once home I Google Earthed our walk for this box and it was just shy <br/>
of 1 mile!! Way to go Katie, Alex, Will &amp; Maddie!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We stopped in town for some lunch, right in the lunch hour, so we <br/>
decided to try Shorty's "Sams Drive in" on our way home.<br/>
<br/>
We then got lost and ended up on the north east corner of Rockford <br/>
and found "Peace Plaza".<br/>
<br/>
Then decided to go further into town and find a new one by River Rat <br/>
and an older box by RaqsEnigma "Shimmy for a Cure". The reason we <br/>
didn't find Raqs box back in April in all the rain was the one line <br/>
in the clues that said, "look out at the carnage. Your prize lies <br/>
somewhere in this chaos."<br/>
<br/>
Despite that, we found the box!! Yipee!! Katie, Alex and I all did <br/>
that hike, and the girls did a great job balancing on a fallen tree.<br/>
<br/>
We went on and found "Softball Series: Go Thunder" left by azure from <br/>
Seattle.<br/>
<br/>
Then we drove back to the south side and found Atwood and found two <br/>
new boxes hidden since our last visit. Again, this was much nicer in <br/>
the sun!<br/>
<br/>
Wow, what time was it? What time were we to leave? Goodness, time <br/>
flew. We needed dinner in a bad kinda way.<br/>
<br/>
We proceeded to get VERY lost on the south and west end of town, and <br/>
no one seemed too safe here. Not a fast food place to be had.<br/>
<br/>
After we got out of dodge, we headed west (with empty stomachs) and <br/>
found "Larger than Life: Johnny Appleseed" What a fabulous carving!! <br/>
<br/>
We changed the twins diapers in the dark in the cemetery and headed <br/>
back south to Byron. Dinner was served at 8:30pm!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We were to leave at 5 and be home by 7:30, here it was an hour past <br/>
the kids bedtimes and we were just now getting dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, Shorty, your box will have to wait until next time!<br/>
<br/>
All in all we had a great time finding 8 boxes and 2 HH's, and <br/>
planting a box to boot.<br/>
<br/>

Becki had called me at work and told me if I had the chance to check the  <br/>
blog.<br/>

Must have been embarrassing to my co-workers to watch me cry at just seeing  <br/>
that picture.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the update on "Shimmy...." A non-boxer found that one <br/>
recently, totally unhidden, and he took it home and wrote me - then <br/>
at my suggestion he checked out LBNA, found the clues to the box, and <br/>
put it back all by himself, and it has since been found by a couple <br/>
of different people so I guess that means he did a good job!<br/>
