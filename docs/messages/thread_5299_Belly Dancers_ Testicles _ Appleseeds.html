<br>
On September 7th, we made a trip to Rockford. Unlike the one we made <br>
last April the day was sunny and warm. The city looks much more <br>
inviting without a deluge of rain falling on us.<br>
<br>
We decided we wanted to be home to get the kids in bed on time . . . <br>
meaning leaving Rockford at about 5pm.<br>
<br>
We made our first stop in Grand Detour, IL to plant a box at the John <br>
Deere Historic Site. Thanks to Judy, a manager there for contacting <br>
me and giving me permission to hide the box there. <br>
<br>
Check out PW's "John Deere Plow" while there... its almost a 2 for 1 <br>
deal. Sorry PW, for the close proximity, I felt compelled to follow <br>
Judy's lead on the hiding spot.<br>
<br>
We then went on to Byron where we found one of the IRT boxes by <br>
p.granola honoring the Turkey Testicle Festival.<br>
<br>
Let me just say how proud I am of our family. We ALL WALKED, the <br>
twins (age 2 1/2) walked too... no stroller!! This is a big milestone <br>
for us. William didn't want to walk at first, so Becki put him on her <br>
shoulders. I SO wish I had a camera with me, as he clung to her face <br>
as if he were a cat and she trying to put him in a tub of water. <br>
Hilarious.<br>
<br>
He did get down and walked most the rest. We had a wonderful time, <br>
looking at all the flowers, bugs, grasshoppers, etc. <br>
<br>
The girls grabbed some "walking sticks" and Maddie followed suite. <br>
Then Will picked up a "walking stick" that was about 3 inches long <br>
and proceeded to walk bent at the waste so that his stick could touch <br>
the ground. LOL that was too funny.<br>
<br>
Once home I Google Earthed our walk for this box and it was just shy <br>
of 1 mile!! Way to go Katie, Alex, Will & Maddie!!!!<br>
<br>
We stopped in town for some lunch, right in the lunch hour, so we <br>
decided to try Shorty's "Sams Drive in" on our way home.<br>
<br>
We then got lost and ended up on the north east corner of Rockford <br>
and found "Peace Plaza".<br>
<br>
Then decided to go further into town and find a new one by River Rat <br>
and an older box by RaqsEnigma "Shimmy for a Cure". The reason we <br>
didn't find Raqs box back in April in all the rain was the one line <br>
in the clues that said, "look out at the carnage. Your prize lies <br>
somewhere in this chaos."<br>
<br>
Despite that, we found the box!! Yipee!! Katie, Alex and I all did <br>
that hike, and the girls did a great job balancing on a fallen tree.<br>
<br>
We went on and found "Softball Series: Go Thunder" left by azure from <br>
Seattle.<br>
<br>
Then we drove back to the south side and found Atwood and found two <br>
new boxes hidden since our last visit. Again, this was much nicer in <br>
the sun!<br>
<br>
Wow, what time was it? What time were we to leave? Goodness, time <br>
flew. We needed dinner in a bad kinda way.<br>
<br>
We proceeded to get VERY lost on the south and west end of town, and <br>
no one seemed too safe here. Not a fast food place to be had.<br>
<br>
After we got out of dodge, we headed west (with empty stomachs) and <br>
found "Larger than Life: Johnny Appleseed" What a fabulous carving!! <br>
<br>
We changed the twins diapers in the dark in the cemetery and headed <br>
back south to Byron. Dinner was served at 8:30pm!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
We were to leave at 5 and be home by 7:30, here it was an hour past <br>
the kids bedtimes and we were just now getting dinner.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, Shorty, your box will have to wait until next time!<br>
<br>
All in all we had a great time finding 8 boxes and 2 HH's, and <br>
planting a box to boot.<br>

Becki had called me at work and told me if I had the chance to check the  <br>
blog.<br>
 <br>
Must have been embarrassing to my co-workers to watch me cry at just seeing  <br>
that picture.<br>

Gives me something to look forward to on my next trip home.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the update on "Shimmy...." A non-boxer found that one <br>
recently, totally unhidden, and he took it home and wrote me - then <br>
at my suggestion he checked out LBNA, found the clues to the box, and <br>
put it back all by himself, and it has since been found by a couple <br>
of different people so I guess that means he did a good job!<br>
