Glad to hear you &amp; FW are getting out on the trail!  Will you next be <br/>
heading up to Lapham Peak to find any boxes you may have missed last <br/>
year?  Some pretty good hiking if that's what you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
We still don't know when we'll be down to IL this year.  It may not <br/>
be until SEP... I'm headed back out to CA again soon - the project <br/>
that just won't end!<br/>

Problem is for me, I love to carve and make the boxes but don't have<br/>
the time for the really long hikes to put the boxes in really remote<br/>
places. As soon as my 5 year old is in school, things may change in<br/>

time) if I'm to stick with it. Thanks for the great post :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to agree with Beetle wholeheartedly.  While I certainly can understand time constraints and other demands and restrictions that influence a person's ability to put distance on their boxes and even put in the time to make clues puzzling, etc., I think Pennypenny makes a good point when stating that when planting a box that is more easily accessible, one has to accept that there will be a much higher rate of loss.<br/>
<br/>
I often hear people pondering as to why vandalism and missing boxes seem to have become such problems.  First off, these problem have always been there -- it is just a part of the game of letterboxing.  We are so much more aware of it now with all of the talk lists and message boards, etc.  I do think we are seeing many more occurrences, but there are thousands more letterboxes.  I would venture to guess that in ratio to the number of boxes that are out there, the number is probably less if you don't include widespread vandalism such as the recent events in CT.<br/>
<br/>
We have to consider that many things about letterboxing have changed and evolved to make the game accessible to a much broader range of participants, namely the overall difficulty level of boxes being placed.  While it is great that so many people are discovering the hobby and finding ways to make it work for them -- ie. given time constraints and limitations due to physical ability and young children, etc., there then needs to be the understanding that along with making such allowances, there is an increase in missing boxes.<br/>
<br/>
And then of course, there is the publicitiy...<br/>

&gt; &gt;   One easy way to take your clues off-line, is to list them in the <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Files section on this message board. Another more involved appraoch <br/>
&gt; &gt;   would be to start your own website or blog using one of the free <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I'm sorry to see this happening, since I really like the convenience <br/>

&gt; &gt;   where we travel (although in the past year or so we've also had to <br/>
&gt; &gt;   check AQ, for the people that won't use the original letterboxing <br/>

&gt; &gt;   develops in our area. If it does, I'll move them to a private <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was HOT today!  The kind of hot that causes sweat to run down your face until you can't see where you're walking.  But I was off work today and no weather condition is going to keep me in the house when there are letterboxes out there.  Those letterboxes are EVERYWHERE!  So much for homeland security....LOL!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm working on several new letterbox placements...soon to be released.  It's not easy to accept the blame for a missing box, but sometimes the location of the box causes the increasing higher risk of it disappearing.  As a box creator, I dislike hearing about logbooks that are scribbled up because that just indicates that a child found the box and they were not being supervised.  That is certainly not true in all letterboxing families.  <br/>
<br/>
The first time one of my letterboxes was reported missing, after less than a month, I was devastated!  I mourned!  But 'all things must pass' and letterboxes don't last forever.  <br/>
<br/>
Best we can do is to educate each other and be mindful that someone put a lot of time and thought into the creation of the letterboxes we find.  <br/>
<br/>
1. Carry replacement and repair supplies.  Random acts of kindness on the trail is always appreciated.  Contact the placer asap.  <br/>
2. When you find a letterbox, let the adrenaline rush settle down before you pick up the box.  You may forget exactly how the box was placed.<br/>
3. Check to make sure the baggies are all sealed tightly.  Carefully press the air out of the bag before sealing the last bit of the zipper closure. This allows the baggies to fit in the box and there is less likelihood of the letterbox lid popping off due to excessive bulk in the box.  <br/>
4. Some boxes have incredible tight sealing lids.  I try to find the tightest lids I can.  However, if we all took a few extra seconds to make sure all four corners are completely pressed down and the edges of the box are sealed (no baggies hanging out), this would help preserve the integrity of the boxes through those rainy and snowy seasons.  <br/>
5. I try to remember and emphasis when I reveal to others about this crazy pastime that I am involved in is this....avoid eating food and handling the boxes.  Those little woodland critters can sense the slightest trace of food on a letterbox.  Even scented hand towelettes may not smell like food, but may cause them to become curious as to what the scent is.  <br/>
6. And the last thing I try to remember on the trails is to BE SNEAKY!!!  That's the fun part!  Look around.  Wait for the best opportunity to retrieve the box.  Sometimes you have to wait till the coast is clear.  Sometimes you have to leave and come back later.  This is soooooo hard to do, but we do it to protect the boxes as if they were our own creation.  <br/>
<br/>
Like any hobby, letterboxing will go through ebbs and tides. Even when magazines and newspapers print articles about letterbox (what's that), I tend to think that most people skim the article and turn the page.  Why do I think this?  Because a lot of people roll their eyes and aren't about to go hiking to find a rubber stamp in a Tupperware box.  When you think about it, it's pretty weird!  They may try to find one of two boxes, but it's the truly insane ones like us that keep searching.<br/>

  I have to agree with Beetle wholeheartedly. While I certainly can understand time constraints and other demands and restrictions that influence a person's ability to put distance on their boxes and even put in the time to make clues puzzling, etc., I think Pennypenny makes a good point when stating that when planting a box that is more easily accessible, one has to accept that there will be a much higher rate of loss.<br/>
<br/>
  I often hear people pondering as to why vandalism and missing boxes seem to have become such problems. First off, these problem have always been there -- it is just a part of the game of letterboxing. We are so much more aware of it now with all of the talk lists and message boards, etc. I do think we are seeing many more occurrences, but there are thousands more letterboxes. I would venture to guess that in ratio to the number of boxes that are out there, the number is probably less if you don't include widespread vandalism such as the recent events in CT.<br/>
<br/>
  We have to consider that many things about letterboxing have changed and evolved to make the game accessible to a much broader range of participants, namely the overall difficulty level of boxes being placed. While it is great that so many people are discovering the hobby and finding ways to make it work for them -- ie. given time constraints and limitations due to physical ability and young children, etc., there then needs to be the understanding that along with making such allowances, there is an increase in missing boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  And then of course, there is the publicitiy...<br/>

  &gt; Beetle... You are absolutely dead-on here. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Problem is for me, I love to carve and make the boxes but don't have<br/>
  &gt; the time for the really long hikes to put the boxes in really remote<br/>
  &gt; places. As soon as my 5 year old is in school, things may change in<br/>
  &gt; that regard.... but until then I still like to choose the clever<br/>
  &gt; hiding places that are an easier and quicker walk to. I guess I'll<br/>
  &gt; have to make my clues much tougher, and get the word out in other<br/>
  &gt; not-so-mainstream ways (AND expect to lose some boxes from time to<br/>
  &gt; time) if I'm to stick with it. Thanks for the great post :-)<br/>

Beetle, Just got around to reading your Email and had to laugh when I read  <br/>
the above.<br/>
<br/>
I found a box back in February with snow on the ground. I brought the box  <br/>
back to my van to log in (this is back in the day before I owned my handy  <br/>
backpack/stool combo). I tried and tried to pry the lid off -- thinking it was  <br/>
just frozen shut I thumped it on my dashboard a few times and pried and pried at  <br/>
the lid. . . nothing!<br/>
<br/>
I left it in the warmth of my van for about 10 minutes . . . pried &amp;  pried <br/>
somemore . ... nothing!!<br/>
<br/>
Now that I was red-in-the-face angry (and ready to throw this box as far  <br/>
from me as possible) I pulled out one last ditch idea -- I twisted the lid!  <br/>
Eureka!! The lid was a twist on. <br/>
