It would be nice if you guys could be there, the more newbees the merrier!<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to the group and to the fun and sometimes crazy world of letterboxing (did I say addicting?)  Sorry you weren't able to make yesterday's get-together and meet some area boxers, but there will be others -- and who knows when you may just run into somebody on the trail!  Good luck as you venture out and begin looking for letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
