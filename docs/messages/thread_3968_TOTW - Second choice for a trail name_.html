Heh.  I'm still looking for a second choice.  I don't like my first <br>
choice (The BaliGrl part is an old AOL screen name, which is a <br>
nickname derived from my initials, the BNL part is my favorite <br>
band).  After seeing all the cool, funny, inventive, interesting <br>
trail names that other people had, I wish I had come up with <br>
something better. So, maybe if I ever come up with a second choice, <br>
I'll pull a "Prince" and become the "boxer formerly known as BaliGrl" <br>
and adopt a new name!  Only, mine will be pronounceable, not just <br>
some random symbol.<br>
<br>
BNL BaliGrl <br>

I got that from playing paintball.  I'm good at picking tactical spots to hide that allow me to pick off opponents at a distance :-) Much easier in the 3 story warehouse than out in the field (unless it's a night time game), but still my favorite way to play.  I even have a stamp carved that would work as my sig stamp. <br>
<br>
Some additional alternatives would be "DogMom" or "K9Kids"  (things I would get on my license plate if special plates didn't cost a fortune in Indiana and because sniper might get questioned if I put it on a license plate :-)  <br>

When the kids and I were out boxing a few days ago, we saw several <br>
trail names with the word "Nerd" in them.  I thought to myself--maybe I <br>
should have been Bird Nerd instead of BirdWoman--since they rhyme (and <br>
because my kids think I'm a bit goofy to go looking after all these <br>
birds.  When we were hiking on a short vacation (where of course I had <br>
my binoculars out--and saw a bunch of red-headed woodpeckers) they made <br>
up a goofy Birdwatcher's song and dance.  It was kind of cute, though.<br>

  I would probably pick the name I had in high school/college. I also <br>
  had it on my truck's license plate. "Li'l Brat". It was very fitting <br>
  back then, but not so much any more (well, I'm still Li'l). I wouldn't <br>
  be thrilled with it as a trail name, but I can't think of anything <br>
  else. At least if I went with "Li'l Brat", I wouldn't have to explain <br>
  the meaning so often! :) Of course I have no idea what the stamp <br>
  would look like.<br>

Really, Doglvrs is the first name we could all agree<br>
