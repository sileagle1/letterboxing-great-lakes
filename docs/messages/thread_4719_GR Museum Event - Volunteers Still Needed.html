                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are still looking for a few volunteers to help out with the carving<br>
activity at the Grand Rapids Public Museum event being held on<br>
Saturday, Feb. 2.  It was decided to forego the formal carving<br>
workshop due to potential for injury and cost of providing carving<br>
tools.  Instead there will just be an informal activity area where<br>
children (and adults) can make stamps using fun foam.  It was also<br>
decided to move this activity down to the main galleria area next to<br>
the information table instead of having it off in a separate room,<br>
which will make it much more accessible to people.<br>
<br>
A few volunteers are still needed to help oversee this area, just to<br>
be available to assist or answer questions as needed.  Shifts run for<br>
blocks of two hours each (9-11, 11-1, 1-3).  Volunteers will receive<br>
free admission to the museum for the day and free parking.  Come for<br>
the day -- volunteer for a couple of hours and then spend the rest of<br>
the day enjoying the wonderful exhibits the GR Public Museum has to<br>
offer and hunting down the letterboxes that have been placed<br>
throughout the museum for this event!<br>
<br>
If you can help out, please e-mail me offlist to let me know which<br>
time works best for you.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

<br>
I was wondering if my husband and daughters could help<br>
too?  We could all work the 1-3p slot if you are<br>
looking for multiple helpers per timeslot.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
