Unfortunately there have been many gatherings we've missed!  Lots of them in<br/>
Michigan and even one in Wisconsin in November 2004 (we are vacation out of<br/>
state).  But we're already making our plans for next year...  In addition to<br/>
the 5th Annual Great Lakes Gathering, we're tentatively planning to attend a<br/>
summer event in Virginia.  A great way to meet more crazy addicts!<br/>

  It looks like we will able to make it to this gathering after all <br/>
  (rearranged a few things)! The park is very near our house so we went <br/>
  over today to check if there were electrical outlets in the shelter <br/>
  area. There were - LOTS of them! We will therefore bring a big pot of <br/>
