&gt; Wow! That is an impressive goal. I am taking it much slower... <br/>
&gt; basically, when I am bored at work (which NEVER happens *ahem*), I'll <br/>
&gt; do one or two. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I am glad to hear that somebody is as addicted to this site as I <br/>
&gt; am! (Though I am sorry if I ruined your holidays! :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Grrrrrr...why oh why did I read this post?! I am now addicted to <br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; &gt; site and have an end-of-the-year goal to finish all four batches <br/>
&gt; &gt; before January 1st. I'm on 31 right now so hopefully it will happen.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Happy holidays, letterboxers!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; For those of you who enjoy the challenge of mystery boxes, <br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clues, or just like brain teasers AND if you are maybe a little <br/>
&gt; &gt; bummed <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that the days are too short for letterboxing and the weekends too <br/>
&gt; &gt; full <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (at least that's how B and I feel!), try this out:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.weffriddles.com/<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I admit, it is not as good as letterboxing, but it will suck up <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hours just as quickly! And it is very, very addictive. B and I <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; little competition between us on how quickly we can get through <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; levels.... I won't mention who is winning right now, because I <br/>
&gt; plan <br/>
&gt; &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; changing that very soon! :-) <br/>
