<br/>
We just met a couple of local letterboxers for lunch today -- this is <br/>
the first time that any of us have met other boxers period. Thus, <br/>
questions came up, hope you can help.<br/>
<br/>
1) Ironically we were hit with 3 cooties . . . they're crawling all <br/>
over us!! Do we count Cooties in the F column in our PFX count?<br/>
<br/>
2) When exchanging stamps do you stamp your stamp in their book? or do <br/>
you let them stamp your signature stamp into their own book?<br/>
<br/>
3) Do you put the stamps that you create into your own log book? I have <br/>
been stamping my own creations into my log book -- no, not as finds, <br/>
but rather as a record of what I have made.<br/>
<br/>
4) If you stamp your stamp into their book, do you normally ask where <br/>
they want the stamp placed? If so how does this work in a large <br/>
gathering?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure more questions came up and I may post them later. But for now <br/>
my brain is fried. Have a good evening.<br/>

I've been infested with them a few times, but have just passed them on without even considering how they should be counted.  But then, I don't count anything anymore.<br/>
<br/>
When you do an exchange, I don't think there really is a *right* way as to who actually does the stamping, just so that you each end up with the other person's image in your book.  For the most part, the exchanges that I have done, I have stamped my own stamp into the other person's book, and I generally do ask where they would like it stamped, if they have not already pointed the space out to me.  Vice versa, the other person stamps their stamp into my book and I usually will point out the page for them to stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I do stamp images of stamps I make for boxes or events, etc. into my logbook.  My book is just a simple chronological account of my letterboxing activities.  Plants, finds, exchanges, event stamps -- they all go into the same book in the order they happen.  I know of other people who use the same book for plants and finds and exchanges, but have different sections in the book for each.  Still others keep separate books for plants or events, etc.  I've tried a few different ways and keep coming back to the chronological schema, although this year I am planning to use individual small hand-made logbooks for each event I attend (event stamp, exchanges, event boxes), rather than put them into the main logbook.  As you can see -- there isn't a specific way to do it -- the right way is the way it works for you ;-)<br/>

Fun isn't it?<br/>

Here is one more question that just popped up in my mind, if you meet a  <br/>
boxer more than once (either on the trail and then an event -- or two or more  <br/>
events, etc) do you exchange stamps with them each and every time you meet? Or  <br/>
just the first initial time?<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">For the first couple of years that I was letterboxing I subscribed to the "only exchange once" theory and if I had already exchanged with a boxer on the trail or at a gathering, I didn't do so again unless their stamp had changed.<br/>
<br/>
But then I noticed that when I would go to gatherings, particularly those that were more local and included many people I had already met, I would come home with only a couple of exchange stamps on the gathering pages of my logbook, not to mention I didn't get to enjoy the exchange process of the gathering nearly so much as I had already exchanged with most of the people there.  I realized that getting a new image in my book was only part of the exchange process -- there was also the enjoyment of chatting with the other person while exchanging and then also the enjoyment I would personally get when looking back through my logbook at a later date and seeing the images of the people I had visited with while at a particular gathering.<br/>
<br/>
So I have now started doing exchanges with everyone I meet on the trail and at gatherings, even if I have previously exchanged with them.  This will be particularly applicable as I will now be using an individual logbook for each gathering, which is meant to document that particular gathering -- part of that being the other people who were there that I had opportunity to chat with, even if I have previously met them at another gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it is kind of the same question as should you stamp a box twice?  Let's say you have already done a particular letterbox and then some time later you go out with a friend to the same letterbox because they have not yet been there.  Do you stamp it a second time?  I do because I like to have the record of having been there on that particular occasion chronicled in my logbook and quite simply because I enjoy stamping as part of the letterboxing experience.  I suppose there are other people who might just wait patiently while their friend stamps and not bother taking a stamp themself because they have already been there.<br/>
<br/>
Since I don't count, it doesn't create a conflict for me as to how to count exchanges or finds when stamping multiple times.<br/>
<br/>
Just the way I see it...<br/>
