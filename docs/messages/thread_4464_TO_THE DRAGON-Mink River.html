I just received an email from a new letterboxing couple who are in Door County this week.  They have found 9 letterboxes and they are hooked!  He said he found the Mink River box today and the logbook was damp.  Someone put the logbook in one of those zipper slide baggies. Even these new letterboxers have quickly realized that those baggies aren't good. He reports that the logbook is full too.  Some people have been adding loose slips of paper to the box.  He wants to know what to do.  He's still in Door County abd writes to me daily.  <br/>

  Hmmm... that's very interesting! Maybe Dragon can comment. He adopted both boxes and lists them on his own website. He has a title indicating that Cave Point is the oldest. I can confirm that the logbook at Cave Point lists the date 26-SEP-1998, but didn't take any special note of a date in the logbook when we found Mink River 3 years ago. It might be good to add the date placed (if known) with the clues.<br/>
  How do you remember it was placed on 17-APR-1998? Do you include that info in your notes when you find a box or did you take a photo of the Mink River logbook?<br/>

  &gt; The oldest box listed in WI is Cave Point, however, Mink River was <br/>
  &gt; originally placed 4/17/1998 making it the oldest box in WI. I <br/>
  &gt; found <br/>
  &gt; the Mink River box on 8/2/2005, after years of vacationing and <br/>
  &gt; multiple attempts. At that time, the original logbook was still <br/>
  &gt; there! WOW! The Dragon adopted this box. Is it still active? Is <br/>
  &gt; it <br/>
  &gt; the oldest in WI? <br/>

Beetle - you should probably send a message directly to Dragon about the state of the box.  He might be busy with school stuff and therefore not monitoring the message boards.<br/>
(We agree about the slider bags - not good!  We're really happy that we can now get freezer quality ziploc bags in smaller sizes and that they have TWO seal strips.)<br/>
