week's topic...<br/>
<br/>
Much like SpringChick's granddaughter, I cannot go much of anywhere <br/>
anymore without noticing good locations for hiding letterboxes.  (Do <br/>
we need professional help? :-))  Usually I have an idea for a box or <br/>
series, then go to the location that would be ideal for the context <br/>
of the box and find an appropriate spot to hide the box.  Usually <br/>
this is in a tree just off the beaten path.  Unfortunately, that <br/>
doesn't always work, especially with new forests that don't have <br/>
large "holely" trees.  Then I usually go for a mound of rocks or in <br/>
a rock wall.<br/>
<br/>
I always keep in mind to avoid low places where a box might get <br/>
flooded (although I forget about low places that might get wet on <br/>
the way TO a box, 'eh Moofie &amp; Blaze? Oops!) or washed away.  I also <br/>
cover my boxes very well with loose brush and/or rocks so they <br/>
cannot be easily seen or take by animals.  So far this has worked <br/>
very well.  Only one of my boxes have gone missing, and I'm still <br/>
not sure why - either it when down the unused sewer pipe it was in <br/>
(although I had blocked it up behind the box) or I was swiped by <br/>
hoodlums.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just noticed that the post I had made earlier in the week re: TOTW <br/>
never came through -- Yahoo was a bit flakey last week.  So, before <br/>
I post the new TOTW, I'll put in my two cents on the finding <br/>
locations topic.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to try and theme my boxes, either playing off the location or <br/>
within a series.  My favorites are those where the location and the <br/>
theme compliment each other, thus allowing for more imaginitive <br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to determine which comes first -- the location or the box <br/>
theme is kind of like asking which came first -- the chicken or the <br/>
egg.  I think subconsciously I have this mental list of place and <br/>
park names in the back corner of my mind and ideas for boxes come <br/>
based on that (yes, I know, it is a sickness).<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally I come up with a box or series, having no idea where I <br/>
am going to place it, but that is rare and I then find myself trying <br/>
to make something fit, and usually being less than satisfied with <br/>
the end result.<br/>
<br/>
In seeking hiding places, I prefer not to place boxes right at <br/>
ground level as it seems these are more susceptible to critters.  <br/>
Rather I try for standing tree stumps, crooks and hollows, natural <br/>
or architectural crevices.  But sometimes you have to take what you <br/>
can find and lying hollow logs are often easier to find than <br/>
standing ones.  Rock piles are great, but are few and far between <br/>
here in Michigan.<br/>
