Yeah, we have thought about the same thing.  I have already sent 2 stamps to<br/>
the east coast for gatherings in the fall.  I carved the stamp, but someone<br/>
else will plant them (this will be a first for us, since we have usually<br/>
planted our own boxes for gatherings, even when they were in other states).<br/>
We have decided that we will count these new boxes as finds (if we find<br/>
them) when we are out in Connecticut (SEP) and Delaware(OCT).  When we HIDE<br/>
boxes for a gathering (the Haunted Harvest and the upcoming Wandering in<br/>
Wonderland), we don't count the boxes we plant for others as plants or<br/>
finds, but we do stamp the images in our journal.  We just add them to our<br/>
Miscellaneous stamp count since we didn't actually create the stamp/box and<br/>
we don't find the box.  We generally encourage the creators of boxes for an<br/>
event to later post them as their own plants on LBNA so they can get the<br/>
feedback from finders, but we offer to check on the boxes if any problems<br/>
are reported.  So far, so good, on the Haunted Harvest boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We don't consider something a "plant" unless we actually created the stamp<br/>
AND the clues.  However we have decided to count a box as a "find" even if<br/>
we carved the stamp, but didn't create the clues.  This fall will be the<br/>
first time we will have the experience of searching for a box with a stamp I<br/>
carved, but have no idea where it is planted....<br/>
<br/>
Each person/team will probably have their own opinion, but this is the way<br/>
we've decided to handle it.<br/>
