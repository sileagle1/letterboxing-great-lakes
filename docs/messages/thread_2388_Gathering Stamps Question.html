<br>
Yeah, we have thought about the same thing.  I have already sent 2 stamps to<br>
the east coast for gatherings in the fall.  I carved the stamp, but someone<br>
else will plant them (this will be a first for us, since we have usually<br>
planted our own boxes for gatherings, even when they were in other states).<br>
We have decided that we will count these new boxes as finds (if we find<br>
them) when we are out in Connecticut (SEP) and Delaware(OCT).  When we HIDE<br>
boxes for a gathering (the Haunted Harvest and the upcoming Wandering in<br>
Wonderland), we don't count the boxes we plant for others as plants or<br>
finds, but we do stamp the images in our journal.  We just add them to our<br>
Miscellaneous stamp count since we didn't actually create the stamp/box and<br>
we don't find the box.  We generally encourage the creators of boxes for an<br>
event to later post them as their own plants on LBNA so they can get the<br>
feedback from finders, but we offer to check on the boxes if any problems<br>
are reported.  So far, so good, on the Haunted Harvest boxes.<br>
<br>
We don't consider something a "plant" unless we actually created the stamp<br>
AND the clues.  However we have decided to count a box as a "find" even if<br>
we carved the stamp, but didn't create the clues.  This fall will be the<br>
first time we will have the experience of searching for a box with a stamp I<br>
carved, but have no idea where it is planted....<br>
<br>
Each person/team will probably have their own opinion, but this is the way<br>
we've decided to handle it.<br>

Fling in MI. We are carving two stamps, but not hiding them. We have <br>
decided to hunt for them like they were somebody else's stamps and <br>
count them as "finds" but not "plants". I think it will be pretty <br>
fun! :-) Also, I think we are going to re-plant out boxes after the <br>
event, at which point we will probably count them as normal plants... <br>
since we will be writing the clues and maintaining them.<br>
