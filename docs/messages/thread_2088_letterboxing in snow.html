                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well we decided to try and letterbox yesterday in the snow. It made it <br>
challenging and fun. We also got a special treat too. We saw that our <br>
HH "Just Married" made it to this box (I think it was called Misfit <br>
Teddy). It was a good feeling to know its making its rounds. I wonder <br>
where it is now? I think a relatively new boxer NeatoBorito took the <br>
HH. Well thanks for the hunt JazzFamily.<br>
