I got to the "Woods in the City" and WIC II today.  Great job <br>
Azobox!  You are very clever, but honestly it's worth the trip just <br>
to see that magnificent tree!  I was only saddened that my camera was <br>
out of battery from the butterflies at Meijer Gardens.<br>
<br>
And I picked up a hitchhiker!  What exciting stuff for a new person <br>
like me!  Thanks Tinkerbell!  I'll be re-placing it next week if the <br>
weather is good.  <br>

Oh, and I even found the massive tail end of a terra cotta piggy bank <br>
to take home as garden art!  What a day :)<br>
Thanks<br>
