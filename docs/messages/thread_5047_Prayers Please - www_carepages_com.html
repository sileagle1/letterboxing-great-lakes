<br/>
Have you heard about www.carepages.com?  It is a great way to keep <br/>
everyone you want to updated.  You update the page and everyone who <br/>
is signed up will receive an email letting them know you updated.  It <br/>
is a great way to keep everyone in the know without repeating <br/>
yourself or having to take extra steps.  Starting a care page is easy <br/>
and quick.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to your family, you are all in my prayers (especially Matt).<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone.  This is Becki from Hartx6.  Matt went to the ER <br/>
&gt; yesterday morning with major pain in his side, below his right rib <br/>
&gt; cage.  The drs all thought it would be gallstones, but he had his <br/>
&gt; gallbladder &amp; appendix removed with a tumor 5 years ago.  They have <br/>
&gt; not been able to locate any problems thus far and he will be <br/>
spending <br/>
&gt; another night in the hospital.  They did find he has pnemonia (sp) <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; his right lung and the dr said that it COULD be the reason for <br/>
&gt; everything but they want to rule out everything else first.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know that he would love to hear from you - if you don't mind <br/>
taking <br/>
&gt; a few minutes to follow the link below and send him an e-card, I <br/>
know <br/>
&gt; that you would make his day!  He is in a lot of pain (morphine is <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; working for him) and is rather discouraged/scared right now.  We <br/>
&gt; weren't able to celebrate Skeeter's 6th birthday as planned this <br/>
&gt; weekend either. :(  <br/>
