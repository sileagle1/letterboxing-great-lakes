<br>
Have you heard about www.carepages.com?  It is a great way to keep <br>
everyone you want to updated.  You update the page and everyone who <br>
is signed up will receive an email letting them know you updated.  It <br>
is a great way to keep everyone in the know without repeating <br>
yourself or having to take extra steps.  Starting a care page is easy <br>
and quick.<br>
<br>
Good luck to your family, you are all in my prayers (especially Matt).<br>

However I'm hoping that this will be a very short term situation and that you are able to send us some good news soon!<br>
