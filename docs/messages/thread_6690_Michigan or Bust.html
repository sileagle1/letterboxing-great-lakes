                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally!!!! A trip to Michigan -- I used to head up to Michigan several times a year growing up. Now its been nearly 5 years (we were pregnant with the twins) since our last visit.<br>
<br>
This will be the first trip to MI since we started boxing and look forward to finding boxes from the folks of Michigan -- I also hope to meet up with some of you while we are there.<br>
<br>
Please forgive us, as this will be a relatively short trip and it will be packed to the gills with family activities opportunities to meet all you wonderful folks will be either on-the-fly or later in the evening.<br>
<br>
Day 1: Wed. August 11 -- drive from Moline to Grand Rapids staying at the Fairfield Inn. We plan on stopping at Warren Dunes and possibly Holland en-route.<br>
<br>
Day 2: Turs. August 12 -- drive from Grand Rapids to Stanton. Will be spending much of Thurs. in Grand Rapids.<br>
<br>
Day 3: Fri. August 13 -- drive from Stanton to Battle Creek staying at the Holiday Inn.<br>
<br>
I will be with family all weekend in Portage. We will be returning home on Monday.<br>
<br>
There wont be time for any "gathering" but if you are willing/able to meet us "after-hours" we would be thrilled!!!<br>
<br>
If you live along our route and want to meet up during the day for a quick exchange please contact me for my cell phone #.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to visiting the wonderful state of Michigan.<br>

<br>
P.S. If there are any drive-by type boxes along our route that we just *have* to get -- please let me know what they are. I will be spending a good amount of time entering them in the GPS over the next month.<br>
