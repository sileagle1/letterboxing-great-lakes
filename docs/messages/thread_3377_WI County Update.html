                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we are CLOSE to having a box in every county.  Thanks to <br/>
ArtGekko from Minnesota because she managed to place a box in Barron <br/>
county on Thanksgiving Day!  Martini Man &amp; I took a long journey <br/>
after Thanksgiving to get boxes in some other counties.  The weather <br/>
was quite nice, although we did need to be aware of where those deer <br/>
hunters were!  We actually saw a magnificent buck on Sunday morning <br/>
when we were planting a box in Shawano county.  We were on a hill <br/>
alongside a river when I heard a noise below us.  I saw the buck <br/>
leaping toward the river, and quickly told Martini Man to look.  The <br/>
buck proceeded to leap through the river, with the water reaching <br/>
chest height on him, and he then proceeded running on the other side <br/>
after he crossed through the water.  An impressive sight!!  (No <br/>
hunters in sight here.)<br/>
<br/>
Well here is the map showing the one remaining county.  If you'll be <br/>
in that area, please consider taking a box along to plant so WI can <br/>
be completely "green"!<br/>

1 to go!  That's awesome.  WTG WI!  I hope you get it filled in by <br/>
the end of the year.  That'd be terrific.<br/>
<br/>
Your buck story is awesome WH.  That had to be a sight to see.  As I <br/>
was reading, I was afraid your story was going to end with the deer <br/>
collapsing with a mortal gun shot wound as it emerged from the <br/>
river.  I'm so glad I was wrong!<br/>
