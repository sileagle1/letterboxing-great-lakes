making final preparations for the event. And thought it best to send out<br/>
a quick blast to all.   We are having some difficulty locating all the<br/>
GLG yearly standards (GLG standard event Boxes &amp; whatnot), if you know<br/>
of their whereabouts please let us know.<br/>
The itinerary for GLG will be as follows (All times are Central):<br/>
<br/>
9:00 AM Event Begins: Pick up Clue Packets<br/>
11:30 AM to 1:00 PM Lunch Time<br/>
1:00 PM Group Photo<br/>
6:00 PM Tear Down (Please have all personal effects &amp; food removed from<br/>
the pavilion by 6:30, we will not be responsible for personal belongings<br/>
after this time)<br/>
<br/>
Most stamps for the event have been accounted for, but if you still have<br/>
an itch to carve please let us know what you'd like to carve and we can<br/>
quickly let you know if its still available. Time is of the essence<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
If you have Traveling Event Stamps that you will be bringing, please add<br/>
them to the Event on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like a GLG T-shirt please contact rnfrog She will be happy<br/>
to provide you with any/all details.  I'm not sure if she is actually a<br/>
member of this group so AQ mail is best for her.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, please take a look at Potluck Details and update your<br/>
contributions. We are in the neighborhood of 200 attendees and, that's<br/>
alot of people to feed!<br/>
