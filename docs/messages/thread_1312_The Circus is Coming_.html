<br>
Please let me introduce myself. I am Marco Peperini, owner of the<br>
world famous Pinecone Extravaganza Circo of Venezia, Italia. I will be<br>
on holiday in your district during the month of July and have a most<br>
wonderful surprise for you all!<br>
<br>
A fellow circus owner from the US, Phineas Boch from the southern<br>
regions of America, has given me permission to take his troop of<br>
oddities, animals and performers along with us when we come to your<br>
area.<br>
<br>
Look for Boch's Traveling Circus on Saturday, June 18th at the<br>
Waterloo Recreation Center. We are most excited to bring you this<br>
wonderful assemblage of acts from around the world for your<br>
entertainment pleasure.<br>
<br>
We look forward to performing for you all,<br>
<br>
Ciao for now!<br>

My agent made an error in booking so let's not all jump out of our clown suits.<br>
<br>
After careful checking, he has informed me that the location truly is Hudson Mills, which I understand is hosting an assemblage of stampers. We hope to perform to a sold-out crowd of well-wishers.<br>
<br>
Admission is free; but souvenirs, popcorn, candy & balloons are extra!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to our performance,<br>
