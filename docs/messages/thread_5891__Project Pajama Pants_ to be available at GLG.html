However instead of pajama pants, to receive this stamp, please bring a box of cold drink mix packets for bottled water (such as Propel, Gatorade and Crystal Lite To Go), as requested on the Operation Support Our Troops - Illinois website. Please do not bring any out-of-date or soon-to-be-expiring products.<br>

I AM NOT COLLECTING PAJAMA PANTS OR SUNDAY COMICS, SO DISREGARD THAT PART OF THE MESSAGEIN THEAQ CLUES. <br>

Letters to the troops are still welcome.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If I might make a suggestion---during my son's most recent deployment, I <br>
collected and sent probably close to 2500 of those little drink mix <br>
packets during their 16 month deployment. I got tons of feedback even <br>
after he and his soldiers got back to American soil. <br>
<br>
Bottom line---if you have a choice of what brand to buy---the WalMart <br>
brand is by far their drink of choice----plus it costs less than the <br>
other brands so your money goes farther.  No matter who I sent these <br>
packets to---most of them preferred the ones closest to orange juice <br>
tasting flavor---but they will take anything, obviously.  <br>
<br>
Buying these for our combat soldiers is WELL worth the time and money <br>
you spend.  Even the drinking water gets SO HOT that they have to figure <br>
out ways to try to cool it down so they can even drink it. So  these <br>
drink mixes go a really long way toward making drinking water non-stop <br>
far more bearable.  (Those in my son's platoon would soak one of their <br>
Army t-shirts and hang it on the end of their Howitzer keeping their <br>
drinking water supply down wind so that the evaporation process from the <br>
t-shirt would cool the air 10-15 degrees and perhaps drop the temp of <br>
the drinking water to about 90 degrees. <br>
<br>
I can also tell you that this is probably the single most wanted item of <br>
all!!!<br>
<br>
Mega hugs and thanks for doing this klk/fw and all who contribute!!!  It <br>
DOES make a difference to our soldiers!!<br>

.....going back to lurking again!  =D<br>

I sent him Gatorade, Crystal lite and Koolaid. I didn't know about the Walmart brands. Please if you can find time to grab a box your troops will love you for it!<br>
