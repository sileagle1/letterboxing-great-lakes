                    <div class="plaintext-content">OKAY. After reading the boards of all those without words and lamenting the fact, I would just like to remind you that Tiptoe and Familyof6 endured MUCH worse last year. 6 days? 8 days? 13 days? Try 23! Heck, Birdwoman even felt guilty for us and decided to join the fray...and what did it get? Familyof6 making a voodoo doll for Springchick (and we all know THAT didn't work), Tiptoe losing her mind and playing her own version of TV Bingo (BTW Tiptoe...how's that going for you?), and Birdwoman's infamous expose of her in a grass skirt dancing with a rubber chicken  (which Tiptoe, upon seeing this, thought it was a sign to mean The Gong Show, to which she quickly got a full card.) So...we congratulate you "losers" and welcome you to the club. Glad to have you aboard. LOL<br/>

&gt; I'm guessing that 13 is going to have to be my lucky number.  So that would mean you'll be picking my first word this Wed, OR ELSE!!!<br/>

I am truly disappointed to say that I do not qualify for the Loser's Club as I do have 2 Bingo words.  Although, if I remember correctly, I started out strong last year and then went 25 days without a hit.  So there is still hope  ;~)<br/>
