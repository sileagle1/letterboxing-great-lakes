<br>
B and I have started a blog to record all of our letterboxing <br>
adventures at: http://jnbbook.blogspot.com/. At this point, it is a <br>
little content-lite, as we are mostly using it to keep track of our <br>
finds (on the Boxes Found link) and to keep a journal of what we enjoy <br>
about 'boxing for our family and friends. However, we will be adding a <br>
Boxes Planted link very soon (we have our first stamp almost all ready <br>
to go!) and have big plans for several boxes in the Ann Arbor area. We <br>
will probably post the clues here, as well as on the LBNA site. Also, <br>
we are noting which boxes we have been unable to find (sadly, we did <br>
have one come up missing this weekend!).<br>
<br>
Anywho- enjoy!<br>

Team Rabbit has seen your stamps in some of the 80 Days boxes that we <br>
have found....one even stamped on the same day that we were there!!! <br>
It would have ben cool to meet you! We keep hoping that we will run <br>
into some of our fellow travelers one of these days! That would be <br>
awesome! We do have the comfort of knowing that we will always see <br>
the friendly and familiar stamps of Grandvilla and Mobiusklein <br>
whenever we visit a new destination! :-) (Good job guys!!) How fun!<br>
<br>
P.S.- Love the new website and hearing about your letterboxing <br>
adventures. <br>
