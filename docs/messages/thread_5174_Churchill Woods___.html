                    <div class="plaintext-content">In the past there have been a couple of boxes there.  I found one of them a couple years ago.  But  they have since disappeared.  I know I spoke to a ranger friend of mine at one time regarding placing boxes in DuPage county and he sited Churchill woods as a reason why they needed to control box placement.  Apparently, on the island (accessed from St. Charles road) there had been 5-6 geocaches/letterboxes in a very small area which created a lot of traffic in a small area.  Of course the letterbox placer did not know the geocaches were there but that was of little meaning to the ranger powers that be.<br/>
<br/>
  To my knowledge there are no boxes there now. Hope this helps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had two mystery boxes there a few years back -- personally I thought<br/>
Pippi's clues were really great but then she's my sister :-) -- but then<br/>
someone else, after finding our boxes, planted two of their own boxes within<br/>
about a hundred feet of our boxes and their clues gave away the location to<br/>
our boxes.<br/>
<br/>
So we pulled both of our boxes since they were no longer "mysteries".  The<br/>
family that planted the other two are, to my knowledge, either no longer in<br/>
boxing or maybe they moved away or something.  Anyway, their boxes are no<br/>
longer out there and I no longer see their stamp in any current logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
I've toyed with the idea of putting ours back out there but the<br/>
powers-that-be that control the licensing for the letterboxes in DuPage<br/>
County tend to make it take forever to get boxes approved in DuPage's forest<br/>
preserves so I probably won't bother.   We're hoping to move to eastern<br/>
Tennessee maybe by the end of next year and by the time the boxes got<br/>
approved in DuPage, we'd probably have been in Tennessee for a few years<br/>
already.  :-)  Plus, unless they've changed the rules since they first wrote<br/>
'em, the rules for planting boxes in DuPage's preserves were kind of out<br/>
there and unrealistic and unneccessary.  It was a little too much.<br/>

I tried to get info before without too much success, let's try number 2!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know if there are any LBs near or in Churchill Woods FP in Glen<br/>
Ellyn?  Or nearby area?<br/>
<br/>
