Hey DD!<br>
First of, no I haven't found that creature box.  But, I heard it was <br>
missing, too.  It's not actually in the same park as Jerome.  Mine is <br>
in lake Erie Metro park, that one is in Sterling State Park, about 12 <br>
miles south of there.  But mine isn't that far from the Elizabeth <br>
Park box in Riverview or Trenton, or wherever that is.  I haven't <br>
found that yet, either, but someone I know it/them(?) recently so I <br>
know they are still there. There's also at new box in Deaborn and in <br>
Allen Park that would be on your way down.  The Deaborn one I think <br>
is only listed on AQ. If you want to get Jerome at his summer house, <br>
he'll be there until about Labor Day.  I know there is a geocache <br>
there, if you're into that kind of thing.  The metroparks are doing a <br>
contest this summer and there are caches in 12 or 13 of the parks <br>
around the tri-county area.<br>
<br>
As far as the blog, is free cheap enough for you?  LOL It doesn't <br>
cost anything to set up or maintain.  They have dozens and dozens of <br>
premade templates that you just add whatever you want.  So easy!  If <br>
I can do it, anyone can!<br>
