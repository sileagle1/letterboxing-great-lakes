March has not been a good month - only 2 words!  I'm now at 18 days without<br>
having a word on my card called.  I don't even know where my card is<br>
anymore...  sigh.  I guess that means I should give a pop quiz in class this<br>
afternoon.  Maybe if I tell my students to go home and practice Bingo voodoo<br>
I'll be able to call bingo before finals :)<br>

I love cooties!  I especially love cooties when it's a word on my bingo card.  I only need 7 more words for a full card bingo.  Shake up that hat!  The anticipation is intense.  <br>
