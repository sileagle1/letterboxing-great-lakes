have current clues.  I heard from a searcher about one of my boxes <br>
and he asked what a particular clue meant.  It was where the box was <br>
supposed to be, but he had found it in a different place.  I had <br>
changed the clues because the box had been damaged in the original <br>
hiding spot.  Well, he found the box in the original place.  So I <br>
assume someone else had found the box with the old clues and had put <br>
it back in the original place...which was now the wrong place.  <br>
Whew, does any of this make sense? :-)  Anyhow..bottom thought is be <br>
sure the clues you have are up to date.<br>

There is one of your boxes that I haven't been able to  find.  Perhaps it was <br>
because of the mishap in the hiding and  re-hiding?  I will for sure check <br>
out the new clues rather than just taking  the old ones with me.  Dumpster Diva <br>
and I are trying to find a time to get  together and hunt down, Who's at <br>
Haggar?<br>
