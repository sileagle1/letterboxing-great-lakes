It is still accessible from 41 though as Delaney is east of that and the entrance to the Canoe Launch.  When you see the clues that might make sense. :-)<br>

Hey, I know you all are talking about Bingo and the Great Lakes Gathering<br>
2011, but I have exciting news too! We just planted another trip in the Trip<br>
Across America series. This makes trip 9. That means there is only one trip<br>
left!!! I listed it on AQ but I know some of you don't look at that much so<br>
I thought I'd give you the heads up. Cherokee Rose 2 -- not the "original"--<br>

I'm not sure why CR is listed on our GL Bingo in place of you . I thought<br>
the boxers on the list were from our area.  I have a feeling you would have<br>
been on many of our lists.  In fact, I had already checked CR until I heard<br>
it was NOT you!<br>

Aw Shucks *blushing* thanks for the support! Really, it feels great!  Makes me very glad I took on the challenge of a 50 box series.  I must admit, I'm glad I'm almost done planting them though.  Then I can sit back and relax until the next inspiration hits me!<br>
I met Cherokee Rose at a gathering a few years ago. She's very nice and didn't mind at all that I also chose that name.  We chose the name for very different reasons. I was wondering if I should change mine to just "CR2" to avoid confusion.  What do you all think?<br>

We vote you keep Cherokee Rose 2...the reason?  You are twice as wonderful, double the fun, and with all of the chit chat generated from the present Bingo game, everyone now should know that their are two wonderful people, each distinct in geography and style, that have an affinity for Native American roses!<br>

<br>
We were also very happy to add Lock, Shock & Barrel's holiday pin-up "hotties" to our books (and enjoyed a fine lunch at one of their hangouts).<br>
<br>
We're hoping the rain holds off tomorrow because we have more IL boxing planned and are looking forward to temperatures in the 50s!!  What a way to end the year...<br>

> Hey, I know you all are talking about Bingo and the Great Lakes Gathering 2011, but I have exciting news too! We just planted another trip in the Trip Across America series.  This makes trip 9.  That means there is only one trip left!!! I listed it on AQ but I know some of you don't look at that much so I thought I'd give you the heads up. Cherokee Rose 2 -- not the "original"-- but not a bad "second", right?<br>
