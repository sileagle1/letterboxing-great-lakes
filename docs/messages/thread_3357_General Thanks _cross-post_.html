============================================<br>
<br>
We were lucky enough to spend some time planting and/or finding boxes <br>
on each of the 4 days of this holiday weekend. Although the actual <br>
Thanksgiving Day has officially passed by, we'd like to take this <br>
opportunity at the end of the weekend to give some thanks. In <br>
addition to all the major things we're thankful for (health, family & <br>
friends, our jobs), we're also thankful for all the pleasure <br>
letterboxing has provided us. So here's a short list of some <br>
letterboxing thanks:<br>
<br>
1. Thanks to all of you hide boxes and thereby give us the <br>
satisfaction of solving the clues, enjoying the places you have <br>
chosen to share with us, and appreciating your creative stamps.<br>
<br>
2. Thanks to all of you who have put the time and energy into <br>
planning a letterboxing event. We've been able to attend several <br>
over the past 3 years and really appreciate the creativity and hard <br>
work that goes into putting these together.<br>
<br>
3. Thanks to all of you that have taken the time to meet with us for <br>
a hike and/or a meal when we are traveling in your area. It's great <br>
to meet "the locals" when we are away from home.<br>
<br>
4. Thanks to all of you who send us an email after finding one of our <br>
boxes or hitchhikers. We're greatful to get the updates and enjoy <br>
hearing a bit of your adventures in finding them.<br>
