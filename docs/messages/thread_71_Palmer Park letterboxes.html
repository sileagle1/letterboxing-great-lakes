HUNDREDS of Ash trees from the park!  Some of them were in our clues <br/>

over to Palmer Park after the Fate of Easter boxes this weekend if <br/>
my grand-daughter wasn't too pooped for more.  Maybe we will change <br/>
the plan to head home via Jenison/Allendale and make a stop at Grand <br/>
River Park.<br/>
