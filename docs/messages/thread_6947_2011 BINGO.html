I have to disagree -- based on my recent experience, baby's mittens <br>
don't have thumbs, so if you' really want to make a comparison between <br>
the two, WI looks more like a baby's mitten. ;)<br>
<br>
I also feel compelled to complain that the bingo gods clearly hate me, <br>
and I really should stop playing every year since all it does is crush <br>
my spirit. :P  I had a glorious streak in January where I got 6 bingo <br>
words in 9 days, and I thought I was well on my way to the 10-spot... <br>
but alas, I was still at 8 words when that game was won.  I've only had <br>
one word since then for that matter and am working on a 12-day streak <br>
without a word. :(  Why, bingo gods, why?!?!<br>
<br>
I'm not even doing that well with the BOS game -- out of the 45 words <br>
called, I only have 19.  That's not so bad, but it's not great either.  <br>
And unfortunately my "special space" box has already been called so I <br>
won't be winning any prizes there either. :(<br>
