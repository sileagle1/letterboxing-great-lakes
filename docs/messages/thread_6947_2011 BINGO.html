I have to disagree -- based on my recent experience, baby's mittens <br/>
don't have thumbs, so if you' really want to make a comparison between <br/>
the two, WI looks more like a baby's mitten. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I also feel compelled to complain that the bingo gods clearly hate me, <br/>
and I really should stop playing every year since all it does is crush <br/>
my spirit. :P  I had a glorious streak in January where I got 6 bingo <br/>
words in 9 days, and I thought I was well on my way to the 10-spot... <br/>
but alas, I was still at 8 words when that game was won.  I've only had <br/>
one word since then for that matter and am working on a 12-day streak <br/>
without a word. :(  Why, bingo gods, why?!?!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not even doing that well with the BOS game -- out of the 45 words <br/>
called, I only have 19.  That's not so bad, but it's not great either.  <br/>
And unfortunately my "special space" box has already been called so I <br/>
won't be winning any prizes there either. :(<br/>
