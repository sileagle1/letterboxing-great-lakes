Well, I got out again today, and in addition to getting my forehead<br>
sunburned (believe it!) I have the following to report for any that<br>
are interested:<br>
<br>
Since I have some students needing to seek out some of the Mathman<br>
boxes this spring break, I'm focusing on those boxes first.  Please<br>
note that the clues to these boxes are on our school's server, and I<br>
will be updating the Mathman pages/clues on Tuesday morning as soon as<br>
I can get up to school. If you go to any of these sites now, you'll<br>
probably need to "refresh" your browser if you look at the pages later<br>
on Tuesday to get the changes.<br>
<br>
Mathman #7 (Luther's Love)- Ok, but frozen in place.  I hope to pry it<br>
out Tuesday afternoon and camouflage it.<br>
<br>
Mathman #8 (OBEZAG)- Found that one of my students was the last one<br>
there, and they didn't put the box back together right.  Had to dry<br>
out the logbook (which didn't take long today :-) ) and do other<br>
maintenance, and it is fully available.  You can be sure I will have a<br>
talk with the young man when school gets back in session...<br>
<br>
Mathman #5 (West Bend Park) - Was reported missing, but was actually<br>
on the ground about 15 feet away from the hiding location and open. <br>
Luckily the students that visited it last DID reseal everything and<br>
everything survived pretty well except for the Mathman stamp which I<br>
carved out of some grey material (not sure what it was - Mastercarve?<br>
 SpringChick, this was the stuff I gave to you at the gathering, so I<br>
hope you didn't use it where it might freeze!) and it had cracked<br>
after being frozen, so there are gaps in the stamp, which I thought<br>
gives it "character".  Anyway, it is all ok now.<br>
<br>
Mathman #4 (Homestead Hollow) - Still doing fine.  Had to clean the<br>
stamps after a freshman left me a mess.  I'll be talking to him too...<br>
<br>
MAthman #6 (Remember the Vetrans) - I was hoping I could open this one<br>
for the season, but alas, the grave is still under snow.  I'll check<br>
again later this week once more thawing has occurred.<br>
<br>
The PI Day boxes are still all up and available until Monday afternoon<br>
for any that are still interested!<br>
<br>
And, I'm proud to announce the placement of the new Mathman boxes! <br>
We've been waiting since January, but now the wait is over (John and<br>
Sara, I know you just couldn't wait anymore! ;-) )<br>
<br>
Mathman 12 (Practice Parking) - Travel around Mequon, WI and practice<br>
your driving skills and math skills at the same time! Created by a<br>
group of sophomores with their "temps", this series of 4 boxes has<br>
four stamps that fit together like a small puzzle.  Oh, and of course,<br>
the box also contains the new 04-05 edition of the Mathman stamp as well!<br>
<br>
Mathman 13 (Spassland Park) - This short but sweet hunt will make you<br>
"spass out" at this small community park.  Note: Find it on Mapquest<br>
and print a map.  The signs in Germantown pointing to the park are NOT<br>
helpful!  Rumor has it that Spassland II will be coming in May...<br>
<br>
Mathman 14 (Cedar Creek) - Another short but sweet hunt will return<br>
some of you to Covered Bridge Park in Cedarburg for another box to<br>
find.  And this time you don't have to wade through the river or<br>
swampy area to get the box.  Just don't fall off the ledge!<br>
<br>
You can access the clues (noting I'll be updating the pages Tuesday<br>
morning) via my home page at home.wi.rr.com/dragonlber<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
