                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I checked out sites yesterday.  It would seem that Chain o' <br/>
Lakes SP would be the best site - lots of old trees and paths for <br/>
boxes to be hidden.  Kankakee SP on the other hand has few trails <br/>
and newer trees w/o hidding spots.<br/>
<br/>
So I called Chain o' Lake this morning to reserve a shelter - all <br/>
booked.  Reason - graduation parties.  Seems that's the weekend IL <br/>
is celebrating graduations.  I have a feeling this will be true of <br/>
all parks in IL we try for June 12 unfortunately.  I thought that <br/>
we'd be a week beyond graduation, but I guess not.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know whether we should move the date, location, or what <br/>
now...<br/>
