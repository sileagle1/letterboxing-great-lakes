  Oh, this is fantastic news, on a few fronts.  I did not plant it,<br>
  but of course wish I had.  I do not believe anyone has yet found<br>
  my only Wisconsin box (the drop was difficult (and I had a flight to<br>

I've played around with a few of these, but never made much <br>

Good point, Dragon about WI Hiker and Martini Man, I had thought of <br>

2003.  <br>

Now we'll certainly be trying to figure it out.  The Mapsurfer box(es)? <br>
(can't remember if there was more than one since I am at the office and <br>
don't have a list here) we did find weren't only an individual effort.  <br>
We were out boxing in Pennsylvania with Lightin' Bug and Gerania, so it <br>
was definitely a joint effort.  Martini Man did do very well with <br>
reverse orienteering, but we didn't pursue that hobby after we returned <br>
home.<br>
<br>
We haven't spent much time looking at the Mapsurfer clues since we <br>
didn't think any were in our area.  We sometimes remember to check his <br>
list if we're traveling somewhere, but not always. <br>
