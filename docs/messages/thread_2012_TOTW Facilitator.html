TOTW (Topic of the Week).<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about it, but not sure what you would have to do?<br/>
<br/>
It's pretty simple...  Once a week you would post a new TOTW.  <br/>
Generally to get the ball rolling, it helps to give your own input on <br/>
the topic.  Topics can be anything that comes to mind in reference to <br/>
letterboxing or letterboxers -- use your own ideas, ask for ideas from <br/>
the group, bring up topics you've seen discussed at other LB Yahoo! <br/>
groups.  It is a great way to get involved with the group and learn <br/>
more about letterboxing and your fellow letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
If I don't hear from anyone, I will just drop it and the TOTW will not <br/>
be revived at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
