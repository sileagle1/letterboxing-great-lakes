                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to finally make a brief box report on some boxes that <br>
we went in search of in October.  We were visiting Ohio from Georgia <br>
and had some time to box around the Hillsboro area.<br>
<br>
Great Serpent Mound: sorry to report the box is almost a complete <br>
loss: box cracked in mulitple places, puddle of water and logbook <br>
dripping.  The stamp was OK, though.  We no supplies with us to help <br>
it out.  I sent a message to the placer (franzsolo).<br>
<br>
Serpent Mound Crop Circles: Box in OK shape, but top is a bit <br>
cracked/open but log book & stamp in OK condition.  Logbook getting <br>
full.<br>
<br>
Serpent Mound Too: Box fine, stamp fine, logbook very full.<br>
<br>
Shepherd: Box is fine, but tree is dead. <br>
<br>
Lynchburg Covered Bridge: did not find box; bridge restored & <br>
rededicated in 2005.<br>
<br>
Wish we'd had more time to box - maybe next visit!<br>
