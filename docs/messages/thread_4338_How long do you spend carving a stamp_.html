LB. Just reading some posts about spending more time carving the stamps <br>
more likely to stay intact. My question now is, how much time do you <br>
spend carving stamps? I've done about 6 or 7 now, and there is a <br>
definite learning curve. I think my most recent ones are MUCH better <br>
than my first couple, but not nearly as good as some I've seen!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh it varies greatly depending on the size of the stamp, the detail and the material I am working on.  I find I can carve much faster on PZKut because it is my preferred material and I am not trying to "fix" things I don't like nearly so much as some of the other materials.  Even my frame of mind can affect how quickly I carve -- there are times when I carve because I just want/need to get something done and my heart is not really in it.  Those take longer because I tend to get up and putz around with other things and then come back, etc.<br>
<br>
But in general, for a letterbox stamp, I spend an average of about 4 hours carving.  Then another 1-2 hours making the logbook...<br>

Now none of mine have the detail I have seen in most the other stamps <br>
however they are all much "cleaner" than mine. All the stamps I found <br>
look all trimed up and clean surfaces but mine are all gouged into and <br>
look pretty silly even though they give me the impression exactly like <br>
I pictured. I'm new but carved 7 stamps before I had time to go out to <br>
find my first box and each of mine (however have minumum detail such <br>
as one simple picture and words) took me about an hour or less. Maybe <br>
if I slow down they would look nicer. (what a concept Sara) Well I <br>
have to get started on my new one soon so I guess I'll see what I can <br>
do. Maybe this one won't break if I take more time on it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a short attention span and I don't like to start a project and then not finish it, so I spend a relatively short amount of time carving most of my stamps.  Usually I spend about an hour on carving.  There may be more than an hour of prep work to pencil out the image I want...but actual carving time averages 30minutes-1hour.  The longest I've spent on a single stamp so far has been about two hours for my large signature stamp and I was more than ready to be done with it by the time I was finished.  My last stamp I also spent a little more time on than usual...maybe an hour and a half...because it had letters and many of the letters were rounded (like o's and g's and s's).  I am very impressed by those with enough patience to spend hours on a single stamp.  I know that my stamps will never be quite as awesome as some who've spent hours on their stamps (like Scoutdogs...her stamps are AMAZING!).  But I'm satisfied knowing that I can still carve a pretty cool stamp with<br>
 the right dynamic image.<br>
