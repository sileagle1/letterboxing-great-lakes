There is a well known brand of artists' supplies that our local<br>
Michaels does not ever stock, yet the Michaels in Battle Creek --<br>
barely 15 miles away -- carries the whole line.<br>
When I inquired of corporate Michaels about these local differences I<br>
was greeted with huge silence.<br>

So I'd say grab those bargains when you see them.<br>

after thoughraly perusing all $1 book type things, I found the "logbooks" of <br>
which J & B were speaking.  They are not exactly logbooks, as you might <br>
think....They are actually like notepads....with a nice cover, and a pen.<br>
They are not spiral bound, or really "bound" at all in the way we think of <br>
them....<br>
However, a small drill bit and a little ribbon did the trick.<br>

Had to chime in here.  They worked perfectly for the billion Holy Grail <br>
