There is a well known brand of artists' supplies that our local<br/>
Michaels does not ever stock, yet the Michaels in Battle Creek --<br/>
barely 15 miles away -- carries the whole line.<br/>
When I inquired of corporate Michaels about these local differences I<br/>
was greeted with huge silence.<br/>
<br/>
So I'd say grab those bargains when you see them.<br/>

which J &amp; B were speaking.  They are not exactly logbooks, as you might <br/>
think....They are actually like notepads....with a nice cover, and a pen.<br/>
They are not spiral bound, or really "bound" at all in the way we think of <br/>
them....<br/>
However, a small drill bit and a little ribbon did the trick.<br/>

Had to chime in here.  They worked perfectly for the billion Holy Grail <br/>
