                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah but that's all part of the fun! One of the great things about letterboxing is that it not only exercises your body when you're out hiking around in search for the box, but it also exercises your mind in the puzzles and clues you need to solve in order to reach your prize. :) After a while, you'll start developing what Lighthouse Keeper and I like to call "letterboxing instincts" (hehe). You'll start getting a feel for whether or not the clues are making sense when you're "out there" such that you'll have a pretty good idea whether you're in the right place or not. All this is to say nothing, of course, of the great creativity and art element that comes with letterboxing! i have to admit, i'm rather biased to this hobby over geocaching... ;) <br>
<br>
But welcome to the joy of outdoor playtime! i hope you enjoy both hobbies and have many great adventures! perhaps we will meet you on the 3rd...<br>
<br>
Take care, <br>
<br>
One love journeying<br>

We just started a couple years ago as well and are from Oshkosh.  My husband works in FDL.  We have a Garmin GPS and we have done some Geocaching, but I prefer letterboxing as well.  Geocaching seems so boring after you do a few letterboxes.  If you need anything let me know.  <br>

<br>
Thanks for the offer of help! I found my first letterbox yesterday here in Fond du Lac, was fun. <br>
I bought a Garmin eTrex Venture for geocaching, Haven't figured out yet how to put in the coordinates but I did download some from the computer--now if I can just figure out all the buttons on the gps so I can find one of them!!! Any hints to figuring the gps out , let me know,<br>
<br>

  We just started a couple years ago as well and are from Oshkosh. My husband works in FDL. We have a Garmin GPS and we have done some Geocaching, but I prefer letterboxing as well. Geocaching seems so boring after you do a few letterboxes. If you need anything let me know. <br>

    Welcome to the Great Lakes group! Feel free to ask any questions you might<br>
  have, we are a friendly group. If you can make it down to the Milwaukee<br>
  area on Saturday OCT 3, there is a letterboxing event planned for that day<br>
  at Minooka Park in Waukesha. You'll meet a bunch of us there.<br>
<br>
  One good resource that I always recommend is the<br>
  http://www.letterboxing.info/ web site. <br>

  Hi there,<br>
<br>
  I'm new to letterboxing--just heard about it recently and sounds like fun!!!<br>
  I've checked out different sites on the internet for info--any words of<br>
  wisdom from you out there on getting started, etc?????<br>
  I found out there are a couple hidden nearby and plan on trying to find them<br>
  in the next few days. I live in Fond du Lac, Wi-was wondering if there is<br>
  anyone in my area I could connect with to learn more about it?<br>
