Some people do to keep track of the boxes they have found; other people do it as a way of letting the planter know that they have found the box; and some people don't do it at all.<br/>
<br/>
Both LbNA and AtlasQuest provide the ability to register finds (as pointed out by Dragon). As you continue letterboxing you will probably find that neither site lists all of the boxes you have found, so using it to keep count of your finds will not necessarily give an accurate count.  Registering your finds will give the planter an idea of when their box is being found, but it doesn't give the opportunity to provide feedback, which most planters love to get.  As an alternate or additional option to simply registering the find, you can send the planter a note ("contact the placer" option on LbNA or "send AQ mail" on AQ) to let them know of your experience with their box.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, there are many different ways to do it and all are optional -- just choose what works best for you!<br/>

Letterboxing is different things to different people and everyone <br/>

to receive personal notes from finders and *try* to reply to each of <br/>
them (am not always as good at that as I should be); in turn I try <br/>
to send a personal note to a planter when I find their box. I know <br/>
of many casual boxers who never do this -- that is their choice.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good point.  I do greatly enjoy hearing that people have found my boxes...but more often than not when I do get a "contact the placer" note it's to let me know that people had trouble finding my box or that it wasn't in good condition (and I do also enjoy recieving these messages too, as they provide invaluable information to me when deciding what letterboxes to do maintenance on and when).  I think part of this argument also depends on your definition of "register."  I tend to think of registering as being a permenant or semi-perminant record, usually one open to the public.  That's why I didn't even think to mention contacting the placer when you find one of their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
And, just for argument's sake, contacting the placer is still entirely up to the personal preferences of the finder.  Although it is polite and very much appreciated by most placers, it is not necessarily rude to not contact the placer when you find a box.<br/>

  I disagree...I think if you get the clues from a website then you  should<br/>
do the person who posted the clues the courtesy of letting them  know you<br/>
found and enjoyed (or didn't enjoy) their box.  It helps  the placer know<br/>
that everything is okay with their box.  IMHO.<br/>

&gt; Good point. I do greatly enjoy hearing that people have found my boxes...but<br/>
&gt; more often than not when I do get a "contact the placer" note it's to let me<br/>
&gt; know that people had trouble finding my box or that it wasn't in good<br/>
&gt; condition (and I do also enjoy recieving these messages too, as they provide<br/>
&gt; invaluable information to me when deciding what letterboxes to do<br/>
&gt; maintenance on and when). I think part of this argument also depends on your<br/>
&gt; definition of "register." I tend to think of registering as being a<br/>
&gt; permenant or semi-perminant record, usually one open to the public. That's<br/>
&gt; why I didn't even think to mention contacting the placer when you find one<br/>
&gt; of their boxes.<br/>
