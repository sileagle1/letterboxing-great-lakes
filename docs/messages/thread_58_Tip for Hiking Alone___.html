                    <div class="plaintext-content">When was writing up the post about what was in my pack and mentioned <br/>
my cell phone, I thought of a good tip to pass along...<br/>
<br/>
I like to hike alone.  I love the solitude of walking through a shady <br/>
summer forest, a little breeze in the trees, the sounds of birds and <br/>
critters...  Only on a couple of occasions have I felt uneasy, <br/>
neither time in Michigan.  I consider myself to be able to fend for <br/>
myself, but you never know what you may be up against and you can <br/>
never be too careful.  Not only is there the threat of another human, <br/>
but animals or even just a simple trip on an exposed tree root can <br/>
leave you stranded out in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
When I go out boxing for an afternoon by myself, I don't usually <br/>
leave a note or even specifically mention where I am going, sometimes <br/>
I don't even know for sure until I am there.  If I were to not make <br/>
it back home for whatever reason, OldShoe wouldn't really have a clue <br/>
where to send the search party.  I don't remember where I heard this <br/>
idea, but I thought it was a good one and I have been doing it ever <br/>
since.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most important things if you are hiking alone is to make <br/>
sure that your spouse or another family member or friend (the person <br/>
who would most likely be contacting police if you were to disappear) <br/>
knows how to access the LbNA clue site and search for a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Then while you are out, use your cell phone to call your home (or the <br/>
answering machine) and leave "check-in messages" as you go.  I call <br/>
each time I get to the start of a hike.  I leave the time, my <br/>
location (city, park, street), the name of the box I am setting out <br/>
to find and where I am planning to head next.  Then when I get to the <br/>
next location, I do the same thing...  This way it would be easier <br/>
for somebody to figure out approximately where you might be if you <br/>
don't make it back. <br/>
<br/>
Be smart and be safe...<br/>
