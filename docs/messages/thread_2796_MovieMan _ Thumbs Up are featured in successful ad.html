The staff at "Around the World in 80 Days" has been swamped with<br>
notices of completed travels. Among the latest are the team of<br>
MovieMan and Thumbs Up. In an unusual strategy, the successful<br>
travelers submitted double documentation  one to each of the 80 Days<br>
staff!<br>
After it was all sorted out, it was clear that it was indeed a hit for<br>
MovieMan and Thumbs Up to their collective success!<br>
<br>
Congratulations!<br>
<br>
The 80 Days Travel Team is curious about the heavy traffic that must<br>
be occurring at Passport Control points at the fifteen cities.<br>
Travelers who are still out on the trails should check the official<br>
status page for updates on current conditions.<br>

Safe travels,<br>

Tonto and I had to laugh at several of the "cities" where wide new <br>
trails have been carved out to some of the boxes due to the heavy <br>
traffic.  We are certain that park employees might be tempted to <br>
spread a new surface of mulch leading directly to some of the boxes!  <br>
Also, at one box anyone curious enough to investigate the unusual <br>
traffic pattern would find at the location an area that obviously <br>
witnessed a herd of wild boar looking for truffles!<br>
<br>
The only one that has remained unscathed would probably be the elusive <br>
#8 where in fact a MAJOR trail has been made to the wrong tree!<br>
