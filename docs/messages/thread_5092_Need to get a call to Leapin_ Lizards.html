I was supposed to meet the Lizards at the SP for more boxin' on<br>
Sunday, but my car engine started making bad sounds just as we made it<br>
back to Sparta. If anyone out there gets this message and happens to<br>
have their cell number, please give them a call and tell them I won't<br>
be making it tomorrow.<br>
<br>
I'm also wondering whether anyone is heading past Sparta and going<br>
back to the Milwaukee area in the next couple of days (Monday or<br>
later). I might need ride back...<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
