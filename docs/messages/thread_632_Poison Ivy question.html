detergent and hot water.  Since having got PI a couple of time, I  <br>
make it a habit to:<br>
<br>
1) Cover the vehicle seat with a sheet when I am headed out to LB in <br>
a wooded or beachy area<br>
2) Wipe down exposed skin with baby wipes as soon as I am out of the <br>
woods and before getting into the car (hand, face, neck)<br>
3) Toss all clothing and the sheet from the vehicle into the washer <br>
as soon as I get home<br>
4) Shower immediately after getting home<br>
5) Wipe down shoes/boots with soapy cloth and put out in the sun to <br>
dry<br>
<br>
Sometimes I throw my pack in the washer too if I know I have been in <br>
PI that was high enough to have touched my pack.<br>
<br>
Haven't had another outbreak and I know I have been in some areas <br>
with a lot of it around.<br>

Good info in Message 1107 ... of course I posted it, so I'm biased. <br>

We successfully treated my aunt with it recently, after a bad auto <br>
accident in which her van rolled down a hill full of poison ivy. <br>
