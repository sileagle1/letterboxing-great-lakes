Nam Vet and I arrived around 12:30 and from then until closing time it was a feeding frenzy of stamping.  SO many great stamps, not enough time for them all!  I think I only managed to snabble a little over half the boxes on the list, grrrr . . . <br>
<br>
I can't identify one of the boxes - there were 3 stamps in the box, one was a "P" and one was "Joe Boxer" - anybody know the name of that box (or series) and the carver?<br>
<br>
Again - thanks so much, lots of fun, came home with over 40 new stamp images and 10 inky fingers :)<br>

Only a few more questions, not already mentioned (I don't think) ...<br>
<br>
- Was Hubert Cumberdale listed?<br>
- How about Heckle and Jeckel?<br>
- Is there a name for the third stamp with Full Metal Alchemist and Widget?<br>
- What are the names of the four other stamps with 'Tribute to my Dad'?<br>
- I also got a lovely stamp-in-progress (cow in a green field) - did it have<br>
a name?<br>
<br>
Other than that, I think I hit almost every box.  (No wonder my head is<br>
still spinning!)  I was bummed to just miss Bartman, Darkwing Duck, and the<br>
second Up Front box.  (Garfied and Odie weren't there, right?)  Popeye and<br>
friends were fabulous, but I'll have to schedule time to find those in the<br>
future!<br>

Thank you so much to everyone who came and carved!  What a fabulous day!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi AF - "Heckle and Jeckle" is listed on Atlasquest as a traditional box, or <br>
you can search under my plants.  That box debuted at the "Birds of a <br>
Feather" event in June of 2008.  It's on my list of boxes that need to be <br>
replanted in new permanent locations - hopefully I will get that done when <br>
the weather is a little better.<br>
