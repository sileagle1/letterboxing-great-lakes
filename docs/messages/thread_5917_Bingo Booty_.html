                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I was feeling a little down, wishing the GLG could have lasted all<br>
week, and then my mood took a rapid upswing, courtesy of Spring Chick, the<br>
other bingo players and my friendly postal carrier.  Yes, my bingo booty<br>
arrived yesterday and it is exciting!  LockNLocks, camo duct tape (which I<br>
was just thinking I needed to go buy), a beautiful handknit hat, tiny<br>
flashlights, logbook, carving media, a clever survival kit by Family of 6,<br>
two orange whistles (I think they are whistles), an LB northeast patch<br>
(which includes my birth state of NY), and a two ponchos...  All very useful<br>
and interesting things!<br>
<br>
Thanks to every one who contributed and a big big thank you to Spring Chick<br>
for enabling our additon through the winter, er, um, organizing bingo.  Now<br>
I can spend some time carving that series I've been planning and let the<br>
dogs recuperate from the weekend before dragging them out to do some<br>
planting.<br>
