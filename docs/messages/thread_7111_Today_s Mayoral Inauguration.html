<br>
At today's Mayoral Inauguration, a reporter overheard a conversation between<br>
Daley and Emanuel, I wish you the best of luck, and I had hoped to give you<br>
the KEY I inherited from Eugene."<br>
<br>
Could this be the fabled key to the city? It was rumored to have been<br>
presented to Mayor Ogden by a local civic group back in 1838. Although the<br>
actual key had never been seen, it is said to unlock all the mysteries of<br>
the city of Chicago and Lake Michigan. Its existence had been, long ago,<br>
dismissed as an urban legend, and even among the true believers, it was<br>
thought to have vanished decades ago. Did Mayor Daley actually once possess<br>
the key? Maybe, he was hazing the new guy and just perpetuating a known<br>
Chicago myth.<br>
<br>
Keep an eye out for clues to come.<br>
