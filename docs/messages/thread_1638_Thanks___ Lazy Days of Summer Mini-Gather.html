                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone who made it out to Muskegon State Park on Saturday <br/>
for the Lazy Days Mini-Gather.  It was good to see old friends from <br/>
far and near and also to meet a few new ones!  The day brought visits <br/>
from Grandvilla &amp; MobiusKlein, TipToe &amp; Tonto, Team Rabbit, Sisu Sue <br/>
&amp; Can Man and Scheherezade &amp; Puss-'n-Boots.  Despite the humidity and <br/>
late-afternoon rain, we had a great time.<br/>
<br/>
The morning was spent as a group hunting down a little sunshine <br/>
(thank goodness Mother Nature spared us the real thing or we would <br/>
have surely withered from the heat!) along one of the nicest trails <br/>
in Muskegon State Park.  We also made a side-trip over to one of <br/>
Keltic Kara's boxes for those who hadn't stamped in there before <br/>
(thanks to Sisu Sue for bringing along clues to several Keltic Kara <br/>
boxes).  After the morning trek, the group split and everyone went <br/>
their own way, tracking down area letterboxes they had yet to find.  <br/>
Unfortunately the rain put a damper on the bonfire, but thanks to <br/>
Scheherezade and Puss-'n-Boots for stopping by in spite of the <br/>
downpour!  Team Rabbit, I hope you made it back to your campsite okay <br/>
and found everything there safe and dry.  Thanks again to all and I <br/>
look forward to seeing many of you at the MI Fall Gathering at Yankee <br/>
Spring Rec Area on Oct. 22nd.<br/>

placed for us to find at the mini gathering.  We had a great time <br/>
boxing in the group!  Sorry we missed Scheherezade and Puss n <br/>
Boots!  Another time hopefully.  We did get a bit soggy at the end <br/>
of the afternoon, but it was a warm rain!<br/>
