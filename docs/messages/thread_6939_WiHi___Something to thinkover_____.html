Also, remember poor Tiptoe? She resorted to TV bingo during her wordless streak and we ALL know what became of her. (If I recall, the rolling in the snow didn't help her case either!) Don't worry, I'm sure your luck will change. :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Congratulations goes out to Mrs. Booty Bandits who not only won with the 10<br/>
&gt; spot but has also won the straight line with a perfect BINGO! WOW! Has that<br/>
&gt; ever happened? I don't know about you, but this lady is LUCKY! Mrs. Booty<br/>
&gt; Bandits, just remember your friend, Mr. Familyof6, when you win the lottery.<br/>
&gt; Dare I say that Mr. Booty Bandits won several years back with the Monopoly<br/>
&gt; at McDonald's, so I'm guessing these two have the Midas touch. (Psst....I'll<br/>
&gt; give you some rocks in return for giant gold nuggets!) Anyhow,<br/>
&gt; congratulations AGAIN Mrs. Booty Bandits! here is what she won with:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; B- book crossing<br/>
&gt; I- Doglvrs<br/>
&gt; N- Cat's eye ink pad<br/>
&gt; G- custom made stamp<br/>
