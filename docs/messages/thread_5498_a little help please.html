                    <div class="plaintext-content">The games don't really go in any particular order, rather are<br>
simultaneous.  So from the start, you are trying for any of the<br>
configurations of the interim games -- straight line, "X", 4 corners,<br>
6-pack and 10-spot -- as well as working toward your full card.  By<br>
nature of the spaces necessary to get a winner on one of the interim<br>
games, we do tend to see straight line first, followed by 4-corners,<br>
etc.  But that is not written in stone and it is very possible that<br>
somebody could get a Bingo with all 4 corners or a 6-pack block before<br>
a straight line Bingo is claimed, etc.  Of course, full card will be<br>
last just because it requires all of the spaces.<br>
<br>
Just remember...  once I begin to call the wild cards (1 each month on<br>
a random Wednesday), you can use your wild card only toward a full<br>
card winner, not in the interim games -- they still require that you<br>
actually have marked off each of the spaces required for that<br>
particular configuration.<br>
