How is one from New England doing ?<br/>
the only category that I see that I might be winning is "decrease in snow total" <br/>
So far we have had a good stretch of 35+ degree days and more on the way this <br/>
week so the snow is melting ..........This has been a record setting snow fall <br/>
total . The third most snow fall inches in the years since they have been <br/>
tracking . We need 30 more inches to beat the all time record ...a record I do <br/>
not want to break. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as BOS I am over the half way mark.<br/>
BINGO Did I miss the wild Friday year for February ? I am not halfway <br/>
crossed off on BINGO so I must come visit the Great Lakes region this summer to <br/>
get ready for next year's BINGO.<br/>

Pine Tree ( it did snow last night 1 1/2 inches ) <br/>
