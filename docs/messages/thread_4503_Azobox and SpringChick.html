the Fall Gathering.  We had an amazing time at our first Gathering and <br>
enjoyed it thoroughly.  Patti and I couldn't wait to meet so many of <br>
our Boxing heroes and we weren't disappointed, everyone was so warm and <br>
welcoming.  Many thanks to all who participated in setting up this <br>
event and carving all these wonderful stamps.  We really enjoyed <br>
meeting so many people whose stamps and boxes we've come to know and <br>
appreciate in our new-found sport/hobby/passtime/passion that we've <br>
come to enjoy so much.  We only found seven but look forward to coming <br>
back to hunt the rest of the boxes later.  We're sorry we couldn't stay <br>
for the meal but are eagerly looking forward to the next gathering.<br>
Thanks again for a great time.<br>
