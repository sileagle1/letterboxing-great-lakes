<br>
I see many boxers (50+) have signed up for the Friday pre-event camp fire. While it sounds fun, it is too much fun for me to handle.  ;)  It's been a heck of a school year and Thursday is my last day.<br>
<br>
I'm staying at the Hilton Garden Inn with my mom (gram Judy) and we're going to have some drinks at the hotel bar Friday evening.  It's open until 9 PM.  If you'd like to join us, please do. <br>
<br>
Otherwise we're very much looking forward to boxing this weekend and we'll see you on the trails Saturday and Sunday!<br>
<br>
Peace,<br>
