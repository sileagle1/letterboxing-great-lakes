                    <div class="plaintext-content">Got out yesterday with my granddaughter to do the Fate of Easter <br/>
series.  I had originally thought the 6 box series in a city park <br/>
would be perfect for her.  When the additional 6 box bonus series <br/>
was added I was a bit skeptical as to whether she would stay <br/>
interested long enough to complete them all.  It was her first <br/>
real 'boxing trip, as previously she had only accompanied me to <br/>
check on boxes, but never to hunt boxes.<br/>
<br/>
She immediately got excited when we ran into Grandvilla, Mobius <br/>
Klein and Azobox on the way to the first box.  Her blank white log <br/>
book now had 3 exchanges in and she was off to collect more stamps <br/>
and fill up those pages.  While stamping in at the first box, we <br/>
were greeted by BindleBabe who had stopped by to check up for a <br/>
minute, so some additional stamping took place there for yet another <br/>
exchange.  By the time we were headed for box #4, she had snatched <br/>
the clue sheet from me and was in charge of which move we made <br/>
next.  We had a bit of trouble with the 6th box and when I asked her <br/>
if she had had enough or wanted to keep going, the response was "I <br/>
want to find them all."<br/>
<br/>
So on we pressed...  adding stamps from all of the bonus boxes to <br/>
our log books and then heading back to eventually find #6.  Along <br/>
the way she also took over the compass and much to my surprise <br/>
learned very quickly how to set a bearing and orientate herself to <br/>
head off in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
All 12 boxes complete, I was ready to head home.  She on the other <br/>
hand wanted to go find more boxes!  I convinced her to save some for <br/>
the next trip and she agreed only if I promised to take her with me <br/>
next time.<br/>
<br/>
It was funny watching her as we walked the trail on the way back.  A <br/>
couple of times she pointed to hollow root cavities and old stumps <br/>
and said, "that would be a good place for a letterbox."<br/>
<br/>
Thanks BindleBabe for a great series of boxes, some very nice stamps <br/>
and the delightful story-style clue presentation.  We had a <br/>
wonderful time!<br/>

have much time so we ran through them and skipped reading the logs. <br/>
We hope to get back out to do the bonus boxes while they are there.<br/>
<br/>
Bindle Babe, what material are your stamps made of?<br/>
