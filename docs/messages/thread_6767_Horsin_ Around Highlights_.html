I can't add it as an event box though.... perhaps because I'm not signed up <br>
 for it? Don't know. <br>
 <br>
I hope you all had an AWESOME day out there!! What beautiful weather.<br>

I did get out to Princeton & Oregon while on-call today and found 4  <br>
boxes!! So, the day wasn't a total loss :-)<br>

Trail Rider and I were on the trail when we heard the ambulance siren in the distance.  We were hoping it wasn't coming for anyone in our letterboxing group, but Fungus Woman immediately crossed our minds.  Sorry to hear about all your battle scars, but hey....you probably found a bunch of letterboxes and that's that fun part.  <br>

<br>
Dinner w/a group of LB friends on Friday night and then a return visit to<br>
the Thai restaurant with the Leapin 'Lizards on Saturday night.  It's always<br>
fun to do some evening socializing separate from the hubbub of the event.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Great weather and nice trails, especially since we were able to enjoy them<br>
while chatting with BirdWoman, Gibson Girl, Pitties & Shorty!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Many interesting stamps, especially the "When is a Horse not a Horse?"<br>
stamps.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
A chance to meet some newer boxers, including SamWasHere who we have seen<br>
logged into many boxes in our area.  He seems like a very enthusiastic young<br>
boxer with an interest in codes, which bodes well for some future<br>
interesting plants as he gets older...<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Delicious food and we really appreciated the talents of NamVet who got those<br>
Usinger brats grilled perfectly.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Many thanks to Trail Rider, Nam Vet, Pastor's Wife and Steering Lives for<br>
hosting a fun event!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were thrilled to attend our first event, and especially happy to meet Beetle, who has been a great resource for all of our questions.  I do wish we had met more people, because we really enjoyed our conversations with those we did meet.  It seemed that most others knew someone else already, and had gone off to box together, so unfortunately we didn't have the opportunity to meet too many of you.  It was fun to put faces to sig. stamps that we have seen around us:  Leapin' Lizards, SamWasHere, tat2bob and kimberly.<br>
<br>
My son came home, inspired by all of you, and carved his own personal traveler.  I know he'll be thrilled if some of you ask him for it at Silo 5.<br>
<br>
Thank you to all the organizers!  We had such a fun day!<br>
<br>
Andwe'reoff!  <br>

As were all.  I think this is the first event where I got not 1 table top(yes, I know, I know...)  But I did get every box that was planted!  But only got to exchange with 3 people...  I saw familiar and new boxer in some of the logs, and I wanted to exchange, but never got to it...  But next event!<br>

It was a perfect fall event, great job hosts!<br>

had a good time.  NamVet is already thinking about what he's going to grill <br>
for our NEXT event.  And I am already turning around ideas in my head for a <br>
theme.  Hopefully next time I can find a location with a good shelterhouse <br>
or lodge, tons of scenic trails, and NO BEES<br>

I'll post a more complete report/thank you later, still trying to catch up <br>
with stuff!<br>

And what great boxes those were!<br>
<br>
As were all. I think this is the first event where I got not 1 table <br>
top(yes, I know, I know...) But I did get every box that was planted! But <br>
only got to exchange with 3 people... I saw familiar and new boxer in some <br>
of the logs, and I wanted to exchange, but never got to it... But next <br>
event!<br>
<br>
It was a perfect fall event, great job hosts!<br>

so many of us "older folks" you know that have met a truly warm and welcoming <br>
group of people.  Sam commented on what a great time he had no less than <br>
10 times on the way home and is looking forward to the next event.  It was <br>
really nice to put some faces to the trail names!  It's funny how you actually <br>
feel like you know people from seeing stamps and comments logged into so many <br>
books.<br>

in the canal.  We didn't bring fishing rods, so that stamp has still eluded<br>
us.<br>
<br>
If anyone has some time in the next month or so, it would be a GREAT time to<br>
venture out on at least a portion of the Yellow Brick Road.  Great stamps,<br>
nice canal views, easy walking (or bike riding) and you can park at almost<br>
every bridge that crosses the trail, so you can do as much, or as little, at<br>
a time that you want.<br>
