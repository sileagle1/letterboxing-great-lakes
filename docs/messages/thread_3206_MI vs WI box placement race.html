                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning, I thought I'd trying to catch up with the mountain of<br>
Digests in my email by reading the latest and going backward.  LOL  I<br>
soon realized the folly of that  you folks are way to prolific at<br>
posting!  <br>
<br>
However, I did catch that the gauntlet has been thrown down for a race<br>
between MI and WI to see who can fill all of their counties with at<br>
least one active letterbox.<br>
<br>
Since I couldn't have made the Mystery Gathering today, even if I had<br>
known about it in advance, and in that same spirit of friendly<br>
competition, I've created a new Album in the photos section showing<br>
which MI counties still need a box.  Here's the link (I hope it works,<br>
but if not just go to the last page of the albums in the photos area)<br>
http://tinyurl.com/ygstj3<br>
<br>
Whenever anyone gets a box placed in one of the "empty" MI counties,<br>
just email me or SpringChick and we'll get that county filled in on<br>
the map.<br>
<br>
Now then, here is a list of the MI counties and a link for information<br>
on each of them. (HINT: might be important information real soon!)<br>

Alright Michigan dwellers ... let's get out there and show those<br>
Badgers just how aggressive a Wolverine can be, shall we?  (I found<br>
this quote online while checking the aggressive nature of both<br>
animals: "Except for the wolverine, badgers are probably the most<br>
fearless and aggressive animal in North America for it's size.") <br>
Let's go MI team ... RAH, RAH, RAH!!<br>
<br>
Oh, and if anyone in MI has the inclination to place some boxes, but<br>
not the time to carve, I have some hand-carved stamps that could be<br>
sent out for adoption to help our placing efforts!  Just email me off<br>
the list and please promise you will place the box ASAP, and we can<br>
make the arrangements.<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>

Well, we will have to call in reinforcements to help our cause!  I know a<br>
lot of Illinois folk like to vacation in northern WI and there has already<br>
been some nice snow for skiing up there.  I'd encourage all of you to visit<br>
one of those "boxless" northern counties for a little R&R this winter and of<br>
course don't forget to include planting a box as part of your recreation!<br>
Martini Man & I have planted lots of boxes in the winter.  Try it, you'll<br>
like it!<br>

<br>
I will however, continue compiling the list of first boxes in each county and should have it posted sometime within the next week -- unless of course, somebody beats me to it.  Sorry I have no prizes for first boxes in a county -- it's just interesting historical information.<br>
<br>
BTW -- please contact BindleBabe directly when placing a new box in one of those boxless MI counties.<br>
