Even though I picked an early date for the side wagers, I can't believe <br/>
Bingo was called so early this year.  Perhaps because of the two-pick <br/>
Tuesdays last month?<br/>
<br/>
SpringChick--thank you so much for all of the fun!  Our family has <br/>
enjoyed bingo the last few months.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to everyone for the rest of the game...<br/>

With the calling of yesterday's word, we have a confirmed winner of the Full<br/>
Card game! WalesflyerMary, who was also the winner of the "X" game, has<br/>
claimed the win. All of her words were called with the exception of 1, for<br/>
which she was able to use her wildcard (Wisconsin).<br/>
<br/>
Remember, the full card game plays for 1st, 2nd and 3rd places so don't<br/>

your wildcard pick has been called, you can substitute it for any word on<br/>
your card.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Even though I picked an early date for the side wagers, I can't believe Bingo was called so early this year.  Perhaps because of the two-pick Tuesdays last month?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck to everyone for the rest of the game...<br/>
