Anyone up for a urban adventure?  You've heard of escape rooms...recently my daughter and her friends participated in an escape room race in downtown Chicago.   They had a blast, and she thought it might be something letterboxers would enjoy.  I've been in contact with Lauren from Escape Room Races (www.escaperoomraces.com) and she's very excited about the potential to work with us.  In fact, she's a geocacher, and they want to create an event stamp for letterboxers who book a race.  Now there is a cost involved, roughly $65+tax/person, but for a group of 30+ they would discount that $10/person.  Kids under 5 are free, 6-13 would be $30+tax.  They would set up an online link for payment.  Races begin at Grant or Millennium Park and are done on foot and takes about 2 hours.  They accept groups of 8-500 working in teams of 2-4.  There's more info on the FAQ on the website, including inclement weather policy (urban tornado boxing anyone?). <br/>
<br/>
From the FB posting, it seems like we have enough interest to make a go of it.  I will create an AQ event listing for keeping track of who will be attending.  Please try to keep it accurate.  Since there are a good number of traditional events this summer, and fall events will be right around the corner too, I scheduled it for Saturday,  September 23rd.<br/>
<br/>
A few other things that already came up...you do not need a car or public transportation other than to get to the starting point.  This is NOT an indoor escape room.  Knowledge of Chicago or its history is not necessary.  Cellphones can be used for maps.  While they don't have a strict policy on use of search engines...you're only cheating yourself out of the fun if you use them.  This event is open to anyone who is interested, so friends and family can also be invited.  (I just ask that you count them in AQ to have some idea.)  While they say teams of 2 to 4, I don't see why a couple teams can't hang out together for the duration.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure of the start time yet, but we can arrange to hang out to do exchanges and Chicago-themed event boxes before and/or after.  No boxes will be hidden.<br/>
