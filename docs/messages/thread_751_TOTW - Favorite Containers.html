Do you have a favorite container -- why is this your favorite?  What <br>
is your best source for getting them?  Anything learned from <br>

about size?  Do you try to stay within a certain size?  Do you <br>

Good topic!<br>
First, for `standard' size letterbox containers, I'm currently using <br>
Anchor-Hocking "Pop Top Storables". I use the 3-cup size (.71 liter) <br>
and they come in a three-pack at K-Mart. Admittedly, I use them <br>
because they're pretty reasonable priced at about $1.25 each. <br>
Sometimes I paint them; sometimes I use cammo tape. Most often I just <br>
leave them in their plain plastic state.<br>
My passion, however, is for the smaller mini-boxes. For all of my <br>
hitchers and minis I use what American Science and Surplus calls <br>
a "Specimen Container".<br>
It's a small plastic, transparent cylinder/bottle which holds 100 ml <br>
and is 2 7/8" x 2 " dia".<br>
It has a screw-on lid and I love them. I often cover them with <br>
camouflage tape.<br>
I have placed them and then immediately had trouble finding them <br>
because they blend in so well with their surroundings. Source is <br>
American Science & Surplus (www.sciplus.com) and the catalog number <br>
is 28848. They're six for two bucks.<br>
And, BTW, cammo tape is available at Gander Mtn (and others) in at <br>
least three different variations including `hardwood green', etc.<br>
I've also used plastic 35mm film container size bottles with screw-on <br>
lids also from American Science & Surplus (item #26751). Those are <br>
ten for two bucks.<br>
I've used those tiny ones for bonus boxes mostly  also with cammo <br>
tape.<br>
<br>
I have no affiliation/connection with American Science and Surplus <br>
other than being very pleased with their stuff.<br>
<br>
If you have questions about any of these suggestions, I'd be happy to <br>
help.<br>

I am trying to find inexpensive containers.  I didn't have good luck with rubbermaid - <br>
raccoons loved the small 2-inch rounds and the blue top type.  I found some metal candle <br>
containers at Jo Ann's - about $4 each, but wait for that 40% off coupon.  I camo'd them <br>
($5/roll at Meijer, hunting section).  My favorite, but expensive, container is an OTTERbox. <br>
(www.otterbox.com) I needed a big and good one for my Shady Rest Hoosier Hostel.  It's <br>
doing well for the first 2 months.  I'll report back in spring on its durability.  Gander Mtn <br>
sells a similar one for about 5 dollars less.  They have lots of sizes, I just needed a BIG <br>
one, the #3500.  I am going to experiment with prescription bottles, when I can find a free <br>
supplier.  I really need to make smaller stamps!  I just found the #1 carving tip to add to <br>
my collection.<br>

Speaking of hitch hiker, has anyone found my Mud Flap Moose?  I released him at Starved Rock (next to one of Edna's boxes because it wouldn't fit inside) and even though several people on this list have found all the boxes we found that day I haven't heard anything about him.  I'm starting to wonder if the squirrels carried him off.<br>

him at Starved Rock (next to one of Edna's boxes because it wouldn't fit<br>
inside) and even though several people on this list have found all the boxes<br>
we found that day I haven't heard anything about him.  I'm starting to<br>
wonder if the squirrels carried him off.<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've used quite a variety of containers -- at first anything I could get<br>
cheap, usually from the $$ store.  Although I've had pretty good luck with<br>
most of them, the problem is that you can never depend on finding the same<br>
kind again.<br>
<br>
Over time I've kind of settled on a couple of favorites.  For regular sized<br>
letterboxes I prefer the Rubbermaid Seal N Saver -- either the 1.2 quart<br>
rectangle or square.  They are the ones that have a blue band around the<br>
outer edge of the lid.  They are quite heavy duty and the lids seal really<br>
tight.  They are a little pricier than some, but are worth it in my book -- <br>
WalMart has them for about $1.69 regular price.  A while back I lucked upon<br>
a bunch of containers just like this at Big Lots (a cut-price close-out kind<br>
of place).  They had the Rubbermaid name on them, but the lids had green<br>
around the edges instead of blue -- very cool.  And they were priced at only<br>
.79 each.  I bought all I could get but have used them all.  I haven't seen<br>
them again at Big Lots or anywhere else for that matter -- seems they green<br>
edge lid was a fluke or has been discontinued or something.  One of the<br>
other reasons I like them is because they are clear and you can see the<br>
contents.  I think that helps anyone who might stumble on the box to get a<br>
peek at the contents and perhaps will keep them from tossing it out as<br>
trash.  This is also the reason I don't paint my letterboxes.  It is true<br>
that painting them helps them to blend into the surroundings better, but I<br>
think that they are more apt to be regarded as trash also, especially once<br>
the paint begins to wear off -- they can get looking pretty nasty.  I<br>
suppose it just means I have to find better hiding places so the clear white<br>
plastic doesn't glare when the sun hits it.<br>
<br>
There is another Rubbermaid kind I use as a back-up -- with a top that has<br>
kind of a foldover edges and a big lip in one corner -- not sure of the<br>
name.  The tops used to be dark blue and I have seen some in white, but now<br>
everything I am seeing is a light blue color, which would not be my<br>
preference.  These don't seem to seal as tightly though.<br>
<br>
For small boxes and a couple of HH I have gotten hooked on the specimen<br>
containers that Azobox was talking about from American Science Surplus.  I<br>
can't seem to get my stuff into a container any smaller than that (coming<br>
from the girl who packs two hefty suitcases to head to Chicago for the<br>
weekend).<br>

I'm so glad to hear they work well.  I snagged some a few weeks ago after <br>
my students did a lab on hydra, figuring they must be reasonably<br>
waterproof since they ship marine specimens in them.  You've given me all <br>
the more reason to look forward to getting live specimens for the kids!<br>
I washed them out and left them on my patio for a few days and so far no<br>
interest from the wildlife or the dog, so I guess they don't smell<br>
interesting.  Now I just have to carve some stamps.<br>
<br>
For microboxes, I like to use Fisherbrand centrifuge tubes.  I actually<br>
borrowed the idea from catbead.  We use them in my lab and store samples<br>
in the -80 freezer with them, so I know they hold up in the cold.  We<br>
also run them through the autoclave, so I suspect they hold up in heat<br>
very well, too.  The only down side I know of them is that too much<br>
pressure on the sides will shatter them.<br>
http://www.catbeadmischief.com/microbox.html<br>
has details on them, including ordering.<br>
<br>
I haven't made too many normal size boxes and none of them have weathered <br>
the winter yet, so I'm not sure what my favorite is.  I think I will<br>
continue to favor microboxes, just because they are easier to hide.  One<br>
of my boxes got vandalized and I replaced it with a microbox, in almost<br>
the exact same place, and it has been untouched by vandals, but found by<br>
4 letterboxers.<br>

two of them were visited by critters: they destroyed the outer bag but couldn't open or damage the container...<br>

I have washed them now and I'll test 'em once again to see.<br>

Hi, my container of choice is the Rubbermaid Seal'n Saver. The 1.7pt <br>
size ones with the blue lids. I also started painting them with some <br>
camouflage spray paint that I bought at Wal-Mart. I put a piece of <br>
shipping tape on the top before I paint, so my label I put on the box <br>
will still be visible if someone was to stumble across the box.. Talk <br>
