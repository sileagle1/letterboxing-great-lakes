Ok, Ok.... I didn't get this one, so I Google Image searched "Foster  Brooks" <br>
to see if I recognized him ~ I didn't. However, I had to laugh when I  saw <br>
the picture in the very top right corner with a picture of Foster Brooks and  <br>
the words, "IMPOTENCE is treatable." <br>
 <br>
LOL and the knocks just keep coming :-)<br>
