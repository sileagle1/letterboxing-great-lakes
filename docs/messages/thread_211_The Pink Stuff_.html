The Pink Stuff is a carving material generally available at Michael's <br>
Craft stores -- probably other spots, too.<br>
Frequently the people working at Michael's don't know that they carry <br>
it....or where in the store it might be.<br>
It's NOT with the rubber stamps in most cases. Find it in the fine <br>
art supplies along with Speedball carving gouges.<br>
Also check out<br>

Good luck!<br>

<br>
The "pink stuff" is rubber carving material, put out by companies <br>
like Speedball (the makers of a very popular brand of carving <br>
knives).  It's pretty widely used, and it is either loved or <br>
loathed.  I fall into column B on this issue because the pink stuff <br>
tends to resist the force of my will a bit too much;)  "The white <br>
stuff" suits me and my carving style just fine.  "The white stuff" <br>
(put out by Mastercarve, among other co.'s) seems softer and more <br>
pliable to me, but like "the pink stuff", it too is either loved or <br>
hated.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, I'm not sure many 'boxers swing both ways on <br>
this particular issue.... Hmmmmm.<br>
<br>
It's up to you and what works for your carving style to determine <br>
what is indeed the better "stuff".  <br>
<br>
<br>
May the best "stuff" win!<br>

<br>
The "pink stuff" is carving material from Speedball -- it is about <br>
1/4" thick and comes in a variety of piece sizes.  Most Michael's <br>
and Hobby Lobby stores carry this stuff if you have those near you --<br>
 it is in the block carving supplies which are usually in a little <br>
corner of the aisle with all the fine art and calligraphy pens.  You <br>
can also buy it at stores and online in kits with the Speedball <br>
carving tool set.  It is one of the preferred mediums of many <br>
letterboxers as it is soft yet firm enough for a good amount of <br>
detail.<br>
<br>
It is not to be confused with the "white stuff" which is also made <br>
by Speedball, but a much inferior product that most people find to <br>
be very crumbly and completely unsuitable for any amount of detail.  <br>
This material also does not hold up well to time and weather.<br>
<br>
There is also a white carving material made by the Staedler Mars <br>
company called Mastercarve.  It is available in varying sized blocks <br>
at many hobby stores and also frequently carried at rubber stamp <br>
supply stores.  It is quite soft and carves "like butter."  It may <br>
be perhaps a bit soft for fine detail, but does have the advantage <br>
of being thick enough (just shy of 1/2") that you don't need to <br>
mount the stamp to make it sturdy.  The disadvantage with this is <br>
that it can be rather costly.<br>
<br>
Then there is the wonderful white carving material called PZKut.  <br>
This stuff is 1/4" thick and is a lot like the pink stuff, maybe <br>
just a bit firmer.  Until just recently, it was sold only online but <br>
the supplier has closed up shop and I don't know how long it will <br>
still be available.  If you are interested in writing her (she is <br>
still shipping for a while), her e-mail is alp@4pease.com.<br>
<br>
There are a few others, but these are the main ones.<br>
