Silo isn't open for lunch on Sundays; they were only opening early <br/>
because we were a large group.  I think FW had difficulties getting off <br/>
on Saturdays and she was a co-host for SILO #1 and #2. I work <br/>
alternating weekends.  Also, I think the Silo is usually booked up on <br/>
Saturdays way in advance (it's a very popular local restaurant!), and <br/>
Sundays were available only for large groups.  They require a room fee, <br/>
a deposit, and a party menu.  We prefer to come and order from the menu <br/>
which makes more sense for our type of group, and they make more money <br/>
too.  But it takes some coordination with the table checks and the <br/>
table captains, and Sandy, the owner, agrees that she admires the way <br/>
we handle the food bills (only 6-7 checks) for this large group.  <br/>
Alcoholic drinks are paid for at the bar.  It just works for everyone! <br/>
So that might be the reasons we've been holding it on Sundays.  <br/>
<br/>
The Silo Restaurant is located at 625 Rockland Road, Lake Bluff, <br/>
Illinois 60044.  The owners are Larry and Sandy Pike (rhymes with HIKE!)<br/>
I know that several letterboxers have come back to the Silo when they <br/>
are in the area because it truly is a great place to eat.  Very popular <br/>
with the locals but their famous prize winning pan pizza is well <br/>
documented in the newspapers.  Feel free to drop Sandy a hand written, <br/>
hand stamped letter and thank her for accommodating our group.  I know <br/>
she's get a kick out of receiving thank you letters from letterboxers.  <br/>
She knows about the hobby, but seldom gets out on the trails because <br/>
she's managing a business.  <br/>
