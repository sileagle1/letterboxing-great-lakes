We're going to be Rocking the Mall this weekend in DC!  If you see anything on <br/>
the news about a flash mob or other activities, watch for me and my group, <br/>
including Queen of the Dorks, Twirlgirl, and others.  I'll be the one wearing a <br/>
white floppy hat with a long yellow scarf around the brim and down my back;  <br/>
yellow (Marjorie's favorite color) has been selected to identify ourselves as <br/>
the letterboxers in the crowd.<br/>
