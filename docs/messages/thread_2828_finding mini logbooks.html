                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not sure how "mini" you are looking for, but here are a few logbook ideas...<br/>
<br/>
-  spiral bound index cards -- flip it over and use the plain side<br/>
-  Wal-Mart has been carrying little mini-scrapbook kits -- a plain covered <br/>
3.75" x 3.75" book that comes with stickers -- for $1.  I throw out the <br/>
stickers and use decorative paper on the cover instead.  These are in the <br/>
scrapbooking area.<br/>
-  I found some really nice little books recently at Meijer (in MI and <br/>
northern IN, not sure where else) -- they are 4" x 3.5" spiral bound <br/>
notebooks with plain pages and the cover is a nice heavy printed acetate <br/>
material -- some striped, some polka dots, etc.  They even have a neat <br/>
little elastic band attached to the back cover with eyelets to snap around <br/>
the front to keep closed -- only $1!  I bought all they had at my Meijer <br/>
here in Muskegon and they have not restocked.  These were on an endcap in <br/>
the greeting card area.<br/>
-  Use adding machine tape -- cut sheets and staple down centerfold or on <br/>
one end or just roll it up.<br/>
-  Make one -- just use a simple pamplet stitch to bind together the desired <br/>
number of pages.  People love finding handmade books and the nice thing is <br/>
that you can make them any size you want...  not as hard as you might <br/>
think...   here are some links:<br/>
<br/>
Just the basic pamphlet stitch book &gt;&gt; <br/>
http://gort.ucsd.edu/preseduc/bookmkg.htm<br/>
One with a nice button closure &gt;&gt;  http://tinyurl.com/g7x5p<br/>
One with a neat slotted slipcover &gt;&gt; <br/>
http://www.enchantedink.com/projects/class18.htm<br/>
<br/>
Even if you prefer not to make your own books...  keep your eyes open and <br/>
stock up when you see things that will work even if you aren't in need of <br/>
something at that particular moment.  Before you know it, you will have a <br/>
nice little stash to choose from when you plant a box.  Now is a good time <br/>
to be on the lookout because stores are gearing up for back-to-school and <br/>
have all kinds of neat little books (the trick is finding the ones without <br/>
lines).<br/>

Got any great suggestions for finding cool little books to use for<br/>
logbooks? I was at 8 different stores last night (me, who would take<br/>
a forest preserve over a mall anyday!) and found a few, very plain<br/>
ones that will get me by for a while, but I'd like to find something<br/>
more interesting.<br/>

  ===================================<br/>
<br/>
One easy &amp; relatively simple logbook is spiral bound index cards.  The paper<br/>
is heavy so ink doesn't bleed through.  They also have the advantage of<br/>
being relatively inexpensive.  You can make some type of creative cover<br/>
design and glue or otherwise apply it to the BACK of the index card pack.<br/>
Generally you would want to use the back so that people will stamp on the<br/>
unlined side of the cards.<br/>
<br/>
Another approach is to get some heavy weight paper and cut it to the size<br/>
you want.  You can then punch holes in one or two corners and use a simple<br/>
key chain loop to keep them together (or use some other type of fastener<br/>
through the pages).  If you want to get REALLY creative, you can make a<br/>
homemade logbook using several methods.  There are some other boxers on this<br/>
board who have created some amazing logbooks and could give you more info on<br/>
this approach.<br/>
<br/>
One reminder:  Don't forget to stamp the first page of the logbook with the<br/>
stamp you carve and also stamp your own signature stamp in the book.  I've<br/>
seen several newer boxers forget to do this in their excitement over placing<br/>
their first boxes.  It's not "required" to do this, but is more of a<br/>
convention.  We like seeing an image of the stamp before inking up so we can<br/>
decide what color(s) we might like to use.  Sometimes it is easier to do<br/>
this looking at an image rather than the stamp itself.  We also like to see<br/>
the stamp of the people who planted the box, especially if it is someone<br/>
new.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like to use lined note cards. You can buy 250 of<br/>
them at the dollar store for... guess how much? I then<br/>
find cool artsy paper to make a front and back cover<br/>
for and use spray glue to attach them. True it's a<br/>
little more work than just buying a logbook, but in<br/>
the long run you're left with a very personal and cool<br/>
logbook. I like finding homeade logbooks myself,<br/>
they're kind of rare in the wild. Also target sells<br/>
packs of cardstock for $5. and you can cut any size<br/>
you want (hint, invest in a paper cutter and save<br/>
yourself some frustrations). For holding the books<br/>
together I like to use metal rings. The kind with a<br/>
hinge and a simple snap on them. Buy a hole punch, and<br/>
go to town. The rings you can find at an office supply<br/>
store for relatively cheap (about $1.50 for 5 1"<br/>
rings). Total cost per logbook= right around a dollar<br/>
for a logbook you'll never see in another box. Your<br/>
clues for your boxes you hide generally tend to be a<br/>
little harder to figure out when you make your own<br/>
logbooks. With the extra time you put into making the<br/>
logs you don't want them accidentally found. Everyone<br/>
(at least I think everyone likes a little challenge to<br/>
finding a box) will enjoy looking for your boxes<br/>
wondering what the next logbook will look like or what<br/>
crazy adventure you'll send them on next.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Also, it would be nice to include some larger<br/>
pieces of paper in your boxes with mini logbooks. That<br/>
way those of us with large signature stamps can leave<br/>
our entire image for you. I just decided to do this<br/>
myself. I can't tell you how many times I can leave<br/>
only a small part of my stamp in a log due to the fact<br/>
that my stamp is on the large side ( 3.25" x 2" ). <br/>
