<br/>
B and I were so looking forward to meeting you! We have found all of <br/>
your boxes... we love "In Memory Of"; you do great work. :-) I can't <br/>
answer your question about the Maybury boxes because we found those <br/>
last summer, but I am sure some of the other Flingers will let you <br/>
know their status. <br/>
<br/>
Hope to bump into you on the trail some time!<br/>

<br/>
  Last fall i found both boxes.  Strongheart was in great shape, but Laika was so far down inside the tree trunk I couldn't even reach it with a pair of tongs.  I could see it but not touch it!  GRRRR. <br/>
<br/>
  Also, did you plant a box called Just Us Chicks?  if so I think that one is missing.  We found the spot, but no box.<br/>
<br/>
  Just wanted to update you.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks<br/>
