Testify, sister!  I recently purchased a pretty sweet magnifing <br>
<br>
glass/light setup from American Science & Surplus because I gave <br>
<br>
myself a stiff neck from hunkering over a stamp and a headache from <br>
<br>
straining to see what I was doing.  This baby only set me back seven <br>
<br>
bucks.  Much cheaper than laser surgery!<br>
