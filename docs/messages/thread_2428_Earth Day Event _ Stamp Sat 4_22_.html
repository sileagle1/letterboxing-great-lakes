  Tomorrow, I will be sitting at our Sierra Club table at an Earth Day event at the Plum Creek Nature Centure, south of Crete, IL.  The event is free, and they always have lots of great displays and vendors, as well as fun activities for kids and families.  And I'll be by myself all day so I need some company  :-)<br/>
<br/>
  If you are stopping by, I will also have my personal traveler with me (see AQ for details on Coyote's Personal Traveler)<br/>
<br/>
  Here is the location information:<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
