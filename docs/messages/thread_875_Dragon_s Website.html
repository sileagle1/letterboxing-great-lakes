For some reason my website has been deleted both from Road Runner and<br/>
from my hard drive as I was updating it.  I'm in the process of<br/>
recovering what files I can.  (Any techies out there with ideas?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the gathering site is down for the forseeable future as well<br/>
as all of the clues to all of my boxes except for the Mathman boxes<br/>
(which go through my school account).  If anyone out there has printed<br/>
off clues to my boxes and can bring them to the gathering or email<br/>
them to me, I'd appreciate it.  I have no backups...<br/>

Thanks Silent Doug, we'd be lost without Dragon clues and the Wisconsin <br/>
letterboxing history page.<br/>
<br/>
Golden Boy reminds me that I should be backing up regularly (I remind him to <br/>
practice what he preaches 8-&gt;).<br/>
