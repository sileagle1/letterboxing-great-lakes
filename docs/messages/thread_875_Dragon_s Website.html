For some reason my website has been deleted both from Road Runner and<br>
from my hard drive as I was updating it.  I'm in the process of<br>
recovering what files I can.  (Any techies out there with ideas?)<br>
<br>
Anyway, the gathering site is down for the forseeable future as well<br>
as all of the clues to all of my boxes except for the Mathman boxes<br>
(which go through my school account).  If anyone out there has printed<br>
off clues to my boxes and can bring them to the gathering or email<br>
them to me, I'd appreciate it.  I have no backups...<br>

If you enter the URL of a page at Google (and that page has been indexed by <br>
Google), then you'll be able to view the page in Google's cache from the <br>
links provided.<br>
<br>
You can also check the Internet Archive Wayback Machine to see if a copy of <br>
the page is there:<br>

Thanks Silent Doug, we'd be lost without Dragon clues and the Wisconsin <br>
letterboxing history page.<br>
<br>
Golden Boy reminds me that I should be backing up regularly (I remind him to <br>
practice what he preaches 8->).<br>

For some reason my website has been deleted both from Road Runner and<br>
from my hard drive as I was updating it. I'm in the process of<br>
recovering what files I can. (Any techies out there with ideas?)<br>
Anyway, the gathering site is down for the forseeable future as well<br>
as all of the clues to all of my boxes except for the Mathman boxes<br>
(which go through my school account). If anyone out there has printed<br>
off clues to my boxes and can bring them to the gathering or email<br>
