                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally, after 4 weekends of too many social obligations to set aside letterboxing time, Deedle & I headed out to Berea to find the Sound of Music series.  We're happy to report that we found all 8 boxes doing fine, even though we had a tough time finding that first one!  Such cute stamps...<br>
 <br>
Buoyed by our Berea sucess, and with a few more hours before Jeff had to head off to band practice, we then headed out to Sheffield Village in Lorain County to try to find French Creek.  An exhilarating walk...but alas, we just couldn't find those fingers that pointed the way to the box!  I think we may have to wait until the fall to try again, when there aren't so many prickly plants in bloom...<br>
 <br>
Hope everyone else has had a good weekend!<br>
