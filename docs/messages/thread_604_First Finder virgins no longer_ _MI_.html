<br>
What a neat trail ... almost felt as if I had stepped into the <br>
Jurasic Park movie set a couple of times. I found the biggest <br>
feather I've ever found in my life. Not being a "birder" I wasn't <br>
sure what kind of bird it came from. Of course I had visions of it <br>
belonging to something really cool, like an eagle. Bindle Bum gently <br>
reminded me that he thought it was unlawful to possess feathers from <br>
the Bald Eagle. Oh.<br>
<br>
We had to stop at the hardware store, so I took it in and asked if <br>
they knew what kind of feather it was. <br>
Yep. <br>
Well? <br>
It's a turkey feather. <br>
Turkey? <br>
Yep. <br>
LOL! Ok, so now I've got a wild turkey feather.<br>
<br>
One more thing, if you attempt these boxes, I would advise you to <br>
bring some bug spray. After we found the second box, we decided not <br>
to hike out, it was easier to take the Mosquito Express be air-<br>
lifted back to the parking area. LOL!<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

If you would like another Jurassic Park type of experience, do the <br>
Dog in the Water box by FungusWoman when it starts getting dark. That <br>
had to be my favorite so far, just because of all the creepy sounds. <br>
The further you get on the trail, the more like JP it becomes. :)<br>
