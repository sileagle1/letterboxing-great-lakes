I have been eavesdropping on your conversations for a while now, but this is the first <br/>
time that I have written.  My name is Flagbearer and along with my sister, Full of <br/>
Heart, make up "the sisters act".  We wish to extent the following invitation. <br/>
<br/>
Date:   May 21, 2005<br/>
Place:  Plymouth, IN   Centennial Park <br/>
            Marshall County<br/>
<br/>
Marshall County has a growing number of letterboxes and, I hope, letterboxers.  If <br/>
you have noticed this and have been wanting to come to this area, plan a trip on May <br/>
21 and join us for a fun day of letterboxing. This is an opportunity for us to get to <br/>
know each other, exchange stamps, and find the boxes in the area.  There will be a <br/>
number of stamps that will be placed for just the one day, including a set of of 8 <br/>
stamps that will make a completed object when all are found.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you will plan to join us. We would like to know ahead of time if you will be <br/>
attending so that we will have enough handouts and freebies.  We have a number of <br/>
surprises planned to make the day special. Contact flagbearer at <br/>
the_sisters_act@yahoo.com  for more information.<br/>
