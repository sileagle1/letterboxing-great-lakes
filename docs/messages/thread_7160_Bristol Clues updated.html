Skootching Dog and I very rarely make it down to Bristol, and the<br/>
messages about the boxes out there are a continuous torment. :)<br/>
<br/>
It would seem that on AQ, the MN Ren Fest has NO boxes at all in it. <br/>
Might this be true?  Is it really total virgin ground, ripe for the<br/>
planting?  Please let me know, as we'll be working out there a couple<br/>
weekends and it would be rather nifty to bring the boxing bag with us<br/>
for the afternoon time we might have off!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

I would recommend contacting the Faire management team and talk to them about what letterboxing is, how having a series there will bring in more patrons, and that it won't disrupt general activities of the Faire.  Otherwise, you can try to place them secretly, but it seems that those go missing much more quickly.  <br/>
<br/>
MN Faire is a really big place, so you'll have lots of potential hiding places.  Good luck!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I strongly suggest you do NOT hide them secretly.  Faire security is very tough, and they particularly hone in on anything out of order, especially if it may resemble stealing from the sellers in any way.  In order to hide the boxes at Bristol, I need to provide a map indicating where the boxes are each year so security can be informed.  (The first year, one of the security people was actually a letterperson!)  Working with the management would probably lead to you being able to plant more boxes than you normally could have in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The MN ren faire is a great place.  Go for it! (I might be willing to carve a Puke n' Snot box for you!)<br/>
