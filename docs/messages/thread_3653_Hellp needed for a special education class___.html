POST CARDS NEEDED!<br>
<br>
As a culminating activity to my States of America Unit, I ask anyone <br>
that can, to send to my class, postcards from any State in the U.S. <br>
If you have friends or relatives in other states could you ask them <br>
if they could do my classroom this favor. I am going to have them put <br>
the postcards on the bulletin board with a string going from the <br>
postcard to the city or state it is from. I don't care if they are <br>
used or new. This will give them the little extra review of the <br>
states every time a postcard comes in the mail. <br>
<br>
I am including my address. I would really appreciate it if you would <br>
forward this message to any friend or family member in the US that <br>
you think would help us.<br>
<br>
Please try to take the time to do this for me. Everyone knows that <br>
review helps to cement the knowledge into their minds and special <br>
education students need all the review they can get and it really <br>
helps if it is a fun activity.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all of you,<br>

for their students like this.  She must be a great teacher. <br>
<br>
I am putting a postcard from Ohio in the mail today.  It has a lot of <br>
state information (bird, flower, song, tree and entry into statehood) on <br>
the front.  This might be a great thing to post on the main board too! <br>
