&gt;I wanted to let you all know that my Mary's Mugs - The Luxor LB has been <br/>
&gt;relocated and had it's clue updated.  This location is better for a number <br/>
&gt;of reasons!  ;)<br/>

&gt; I am slowly working my way through my list of LB's to write up and to <br/>
&gt; correct the clues on.<br/>
