   <br>
  I had the chance to stay with my current employer but move to a new job there, which we eagerly accepted.  This will put us much closer to our hometown, as those of you who have solved our personal traveler can attest.  Of course all of the grandparents are very excited to have more frequent visits with The Nickerboxer, Little Woodchuck, and our newest little guy.  And we are very intrigued to start discovering the dozens (hundreds?) of boxes that await us in southeastern Wisconsin!  But only, of course, after we've unpacked the dozens (hundreds?) of boxes that contain our household.... yeesh....<br>
