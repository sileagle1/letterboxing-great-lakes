like to experience a bit of local history, Hoffman Tower, the subject <br>
of the exchange box sent to Artdog, and locally commemorated by Fish <br>
Out of Water 9 (and near FOOW5), will be open to the public for tours <br>
from 5 to 8 pm this Friday, July 22nd.  All five levels of displays <br>
will be available.  For more info, see "Hoffman info" in the files <br>
section under "FungusWoman clues" (under "clues and more clues").  The <br>
tower will also be open Sunday, August 21 and Sunday, October 16th.  <br>
I'll be out of town this Friday evening, so I won't be able to meet <br>
anyone for exchanges (but I will be placing a new box in Kendall <br>
County that day!!!).<br>
<br>
On another note, I recently found out that the site of Happy Apple <br>
will be closed for vacation until September 12th.  But at least when <br>
it reopens it will be caramel apple season -- yummmm!!!!<br>
