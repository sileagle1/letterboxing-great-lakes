<br>
I just wanted to let you know that I have added my box from the WI <br>
LB'ing 10th Anniversary event to AtlasQuest. It was listed as "The <br>
First Superbowl" on the clue sheet, but you will find it listed <br>
as:  "Greatest Coach of All Time". <br>
<br>
I also wanted to say "thanks" to The Dragon for organizing the event. <br>
We had such a great time meeting up with old friends and meeting some <br>
new ones. Great food, great stamps, great weather, and great <br>
company...what more could one ask for?? <br>
