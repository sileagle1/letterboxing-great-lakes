                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few weeks ago I was traveling in western Pennslyvania. My <br/>
traveling buddy is not a letterboxers, but I don't collect Hard Rock <br/>
t-shirts, so we've learned to make compromises. We decided to make a <br/>
side trip to Pittsburg. I mapped our route to the Hard Rock and a <br/>
couple of  letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
Only after we were on our way did I realize that one of the boxes I <br/>
planned to visit was about twenty minutes out of the way. My <br/>
traveling companion said it didn't matter to her, and off we went. <br/>
it was a beautiful summer day, and we were both enjoying the drive <br/>
through some territory that wasn't nearly as flat as Illinois. <br/>
<br/>
The box we were looking for was at a rest stop. We reached our <br/>
destination and began our search. We did not find the box... I blame <br/>
the clue. Turn right. ok, but it doesn't say which way I should be <br/>
facing when I turn. we tried both ways. And I never saw a group of <br/>
three trees -no matter which "right" we tried. After a few more <br/>
minutes of futile searching i suggested we go inside and use the <br/>
rest room, let the clue swirl around in our brains, and try one more <br/>
time before we got back in the car. <br/>
<br/>
When we entered the building, there was a bit of a traffic jam <br/>
leading into the ladies room. An elderly lady was trying to make her <br/>
way in, but was very unsteady and taking the smallest of unsure <br/>
steps. Her husband had led her most of the way, but had to "release" <br/>
her at the door to the ladies room. <br/>
<br/>
One of my first jobs was as a nurse aid, and helping people to the <br/>
bathroom was part of that job. We mustered her into the stall, <br/>
leaving the door unlocked. After "resting" ourselves, I waited for <br/>
her to finish, helping her getting her clothes resituated and back <br/>
out to her husband who waiting just outside the door. Before we said <br/>
goodbye, she called us angels. <br/>
<br/>
We never did find that letterbox, but providence must have led us to <br/>
that rest stop at just that moment. i'll trade a stamp for that <br/>
memory any day.  <br/>
