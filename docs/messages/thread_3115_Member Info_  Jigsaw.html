                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, let's see... I got started in letterboxing way back in April of <br>
2005.  My current F count is F187. I found out about letterboxing by <br>
stumbling across a site while looking for clipart on the internet.  <br>
As I am always looking for new and interesting things that nobody <br>
else I know is doing, I took on the challenge.  I loved it ever <br>
since.  My first box was Calatrava in Milwaukee, only a mile away <br>
from my house.  I have attended the Haunted Harvest Gathering 2005, <br>
Great Lakes Gathering 2006 and a Micro Meet at the PAW.  I have met <br>
so many great friends through the region and can't wait to meet so <br>
many more.  I have a huge series in the works (15 boxes in total) <br>
that are finished and waiting to be planted, so that's what I've been <br>
focusing on for some time now.  <br>
<br>
I can't wait until Ohio GLG2007!  Its gonna be a great time!  If you <br>
haven't ever been to an event, I urge you to attend.  Take the time <br>
to meet people and don't forget to box.<br>
<br>
I know that letterboxing has kept me healthy too.  I always say, if <br>
you told me to walk 5 miles I would tell you to "bite me", but if you <br>
tell me there is a box at the end of a 10 mile hike, heck, I'd do it <br>
twice.<br>
<br>
My signature stamp is an image of a Jigsaw Puzzle piece.  It <br>
symbolizes not only my love for logic and clues, but also the game <br>
like atmosphere this hobby affords.  Also, if you just look at me, <br>
you might not realize how extremely complex I am.  Take a few minutes <br>
to talk to me and you will realize that there are many facets of my <br>
person, just like a multi pieced puzzle, that make up the whole me.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I look forward to being a part of this hobby for a very long <br>
time so keep planting those boxes for me to find!!  HEhe.  <br>
<br>
Always,  Jigsaw<br>
