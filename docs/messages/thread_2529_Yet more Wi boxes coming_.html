last snickers) ... Life is not fair!  I already know I have to come back<br/>
to Wisconsin to get a boatload of boxes, and now we're up to 24 MATHMAN<br/>
boxes.  There just aren't enough weekends in a year to accomplish this<br/>
might feat.  And what about all the planting I'm falling behind on here? <br/>
Letterboxing could be my full-time job.<br/>
<br/>
But ... in packing up my stuff for June 3rd, I created some impromptu<br/>
letterboxes out of pill bottles and coat hangers.  I will have to leave a<br/>
mark in God's Country.  Some are hand-carved, some are not.  I finally<br/>
decided that these stamps were never going to be used for anything else,<br/>
so why not plant them.  I've got theme names for them, I'll just be<br/>
looking for places to hide them.  Might be in the Kettle Moraine, might<br/>
not.  Wherever the spirit takes them.<br/>
