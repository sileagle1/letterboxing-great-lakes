were letterboxing!  I kept asking him, "where's your hiking stick?  where's your hiking <br/>
stick?"<br/>
<br/>
I told him "it's a sign (he loves Sleepless in Seattle)."  Perhaps he will finally come out of <br/>
the letterboxing closet and play along.<br/>
<br/>
The other interpretation might be that Tuesday is my birthday and I was hoping to get a <br/>
set of Leki poles one day.<br/>
<br/>
I can only hope.<br/>
