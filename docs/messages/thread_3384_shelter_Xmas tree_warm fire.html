                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK....let's talk WARMTH!!!  Is there a fireplace in the shelter?  If so, we can start a wood fire.  If not, we can clear an area, roll out some aluminum foil, and start a camp fire.  (Can you say roasted marshmallows!)  Fungus Woman and Beetle are good Girl Scouts.  We both have our private stash of dry tinder and kindling in our garages if someone has some dry fire wood.  Everyone can certainly keep warm around a cozy fire...and maybe sing some songs too.  And dry our socks and mittens! <br/>
<br/>
I'm glad this is an adventurous group.  A little snow isn't going to keep us home from a letterbox gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, we return to our jobs on Monday and folks ask..."What did you do over the weekend?"  How do we explain that we were digging in the snow looking for Tupperware?   They won't understand.  But we understand!  The boxes will be there and so will we.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I am bringing an artificial Christmas tree, 2 feet tall and decorated.  It's an essential part of my letterbox series.  <br/>

  I don't know what the shelter is like, but since there is electricity, <br/>
  we are bringing a small electric heater. I don't know if it will do <br/>
  any good, and I don't know how we will fit 60 people around it (huddle <br/>
  up for warmth, everyone!), but I guess we will see. But I was kind of <br/>
  assuming that the shelter was just a roof with no sides.<br/>
