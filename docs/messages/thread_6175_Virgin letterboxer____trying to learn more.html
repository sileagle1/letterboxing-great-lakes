<br/>
As a new letterboxer it is natural to have some uncertainty about if you are doing it "right."  Stick around and you will quickly find that there are a hundred different versions of "right."  While letterboxers like to claim there are "no rules" and there is no formal "how-to-letterbox" rulebook to guide a new letterboxer, there are many unwritten rules...  but be careful, because even these are subjective, differing from person to person or region to region.  It really is something that comes with experience.<br/>
<br/>
You will never please everyone simply because everyone is looking for<br/>
something different from a letterbox -- some like long hikes, some like<br/>
drive-bys; some like mystery boxes, some like a slight challenge and<br/>
others want gimmes; some expect hand-carved stamps and handmade<br/>
logbooks, others just want a stamp and a notepad; some want a location<br/>
with a view, others could care less about the surrounding area... <br/>
plant boxes that are enjoyable for you and chances are they will be<br/>
enjoyable for a hefty segment of the letterboxing crowd, even if not<br/>
for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, if there are specific things that you question or have concerns about in the feedback you receive, please feel free to pose a question to the list and you will get plenty of feedback offering various perspectives from boxers in our area.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure exactly what issues people might have.<br/>
Off the top of my head, here are a few things:<br/>
<br/>
1) Place / Location is relatively safe (not on railroad tracks or middle <br/>
of a road, not in a patch of poison ivy).<br/>
2) Place / Location does not harm the surrounding environment.<br/>
3) Clues:  Have someone else (letterboxer or non-letterboxer) follow <br/>
your clues to be sure they are correct.  For example, make sure every <br/>
compass direction is accurate.  I know some boxers who avoid letterboxes <br/>
by certain letterboxers because the clues tend to have LOTS of mistakes <br/>
in them.<br/>
4) Stamp: I find it helpful to know if the stamp we are seeking is <br/>
hand-carved or not but that is due to my highly-biased son.  You don't <br/>
need to state what type of stamp you have included.<br/>
5) Container: Don't use food containers that have ever contained food. <br/>
Make sure they seal well.  OK, there may be some exceptions to this.<br/>
6) Use of baggies: use them inside your container.  Ideally you don't <br/>
need to put your container in a baggie; if so, rethink your container.<br/>
<br/>
I think others already replied with other suggestions / tips.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbGLK] Virgin letterboxer....trying to learn more<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; I am about a month into letterboxing and just love the hobby. I have gotten into it so much that I have been doing plants and have found out that I have a lot to learn....I recevied a message this am that kinda of hit me wrong and am now questioning my planting ability....I have 7 more plants ready to go and was going to get them done before Thanksgiving. ..but am hesitating on doing them now....It seems there are a lot of "unwritten rules/thoughts" out there and was wondering if you guys would be so generous as to help out the fellow virin planters with these "rules/thoughts" ? I want to make sure my plants are a PLEASANT experience for everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
