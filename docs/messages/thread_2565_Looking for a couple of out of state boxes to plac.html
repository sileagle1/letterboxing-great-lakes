<br>
I have a few stamps from my postal days that I would like to make into <br>
HH.  I would like to send these to boxes that are planted outside of <br>
Illinois.  Would anyone out there like to help me?  Right now I am <br>
looking at doing 3 HH's.  If you are interested please e-mail me at <br>

Thanks Nuts<br>
