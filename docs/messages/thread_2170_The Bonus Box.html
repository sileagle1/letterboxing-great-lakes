Birkie Bob, a legacy if not the first LBer in the area.  Boyhood <br>
Adventures #1 and #2 are still active, thanks to Dragon's TLC, but we <br>
have not heard a whisper about #3.  So, Dragon, do you have any <br>
clues?  Or clues to clues?<br>
  The other funny thing is that it's been found eight times by <br>
Geocachers (leaving all manner of trinkets and the comment, "Found <br>

I guess we can claim first finders.  There's no date as to when it <br>
was placed, but the first entry in the logbook is 3/24/03.  The last <br>
is 11/25/04.  A couple of the notes say a geocache is 60 to 70 feet <br>
to the west (we'll have to have a look).<br>
  The stamp suggests the old toboggan slide which was not far away <br>

<br>
I remember a couple of years ago when we were headed to the U.P., Ruthann Zaroff aka Mirkwood, a legacy MI boxer, told me of 2 boxes she had placed and never written clues for in the areas we were headed.  She gave me the locations as best as she could remember -- one was quite precise and in a somewhat public area and we quickly realized it was no longer there.  The other was more obscure and we must have searched at least 3-4 hours in the area she had indicated, bound and determined to find that box.  It would have been so cool to find this box, never listed, never found, and a Mirkwood carving to boot!  But alas, we ended up walking away without it.  It may still be there...<br>
<br>
What a find for you!<br>

VERY COOL!  This is now at least the 2nd time you guys have found a box with<br>
unpublished clues and this is a historic one!  I looked in the "wayback<br>
machine" at old versions of the letterboxing.org site.  You're right that he<br>
was one of the first planters in the area.  Another BOB placed the the Eagle<br>
box earlier in 2001 (maybe the same Bob Marx who placed the Holy Hill box in<br>
SEP 2001 and the Calatrava/Green One box in Oct 2001?), and later that year<br>
Birkie Bob posted clues to the Mount Bieterman box and had this at the end<br>
of his clues:  "Placed by: Birkie Bob on 25 November, 2001 (My first!)".<br>
Birkie Bob placed Boyhood Adventures (2 boxes)  in DEC 2001.  (I'm guessing<br>
that Bob Marx and Birkie Bob are two different people since B.B. said Mount<br>
Bieterman was his first.  However other comments by Moofie & Blaze seem to<br>
indicate it might be the same person???)  I checked several different points<br>
in time after DEC 2001, but Boyhood Adventures always showed only 2 boxes<br>
and I didn't see any other box that looked like a continuation.  Maybe he<br>
was like Leapin' Lizards - planting boxes, but losing the clues before they<br>
were finalized and published!  It's nice to know LL might be carrying on a<br>
tradition!<br>
<br>
It would be great if someone could track Birkie Bob down and get him to<br>
write up a story to go along with the box, similar to the first two boxes.<br>

Actually, we have started planting clueless boxes.  We<br>
aren't saying how many we have out there!;)<br>
