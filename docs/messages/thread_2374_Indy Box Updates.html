real boxing done on the last day of vacation, Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Before the severe weather came this afternoon I was able to check on 2 letterboxes.  I have <br/>
some good news and bad news.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is ... Grandvilla's Carousel (2005 GL Exchange) is in perfect condition.  All <br/>
contents are dry and ready for the next finder.  The last finder was July, 2005.  A number <br/>
of hits ... Big Feet, Fever Fan, Hoosier Honey Bee, Artdog, Mr.T, Muellers from MI?  I know <br/>
there have been other seekers, but they didn't quite find it.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is ... I Want My MTV is *confirmed MISSING*.  So sad.  The hiding spot has <br/>
been radically bushwacked and the metal camoflage is gone.  If I can find a photo of the <br/>
stamp image, I will post it at Atlas Quest.  The stamp is not spectacular, but I was very <br/>
proud of my first poetic attempt.  Since I will be relocating, I will not replace this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I will check on My woodland friends and Dora series tomorrow, weather permitting.<br/>
