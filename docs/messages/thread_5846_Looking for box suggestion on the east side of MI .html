Was hoping to stop at a box or two, or prefereably a really nice spot with multiple cool boxes on our way back to the west side of MI.

Preferably someplace far enough outside of DEt. that the trafic and roads wont be too bad, and before Kalamazoo (we are from South Haven so we hit the kzoo boxes during our normal travels).  Maybe a nice state park with multiple boxes? Thanks in advance for the suggestions.  <br>

  picking the girlfriend up from the Det. airport in about 10 days, around 10am. Was hoping to stop at a box or two, or prefereably a really nice spot with multiple cool boxes on our way back to the west side of MI. Will be taking I-94 back, so something close to the highway, say within a half hour drive off the highway. Preferably someplace far enough outside of DEt. that the trafic and roads wont be too bad, and before Kalamazoo (we are from South Haven so we hit the kzoo boxes during our normal travels). Maybe a nice state park with multiple boxes? Thanks in advance for the suggestions. <br>

We like to walk more so a nice state or county park would be best, the I-94 crawl is a good back up plan though.  <br>
<br>
The one in Lawrence is a good idea but we live like 10 miles from there so we will probably just do it when we are in the area, I was more interested in fun boxes on the east side of the state? <br>
