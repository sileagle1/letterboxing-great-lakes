Y'know, I was going to post something when I saw #500 cross the web,<br/>
but I do know that more than one or two of our members is in under<br/>
more than one ID (in addition to the presumed aliases that are bound<br/>
to be present).<br/>
So, yes, Wisconisn Hiker is right, we do have 500 memberhips, but some<br/>
are duplicates (and we lose one or two every week, too).<br/>
<br/>
BUT, we've come a long way since that cold day in March in 2004 when<br/>
SpringChick hatched this group.<br/>
