 I plan to take notes at the Cluez In for logistic purposes.  Indiana<br>
hasn't hosted "the big one" yet either.  And now that I know next year's<br>
will fall on the last Saturday in May, I may have trouble attending.  But<br>
I'll worry about that later.<br>
<br>
Originally I was going to see about hosting one some year at Pokagon SP. <br>
It's easy to get to from the Toll Road, has an Inn and restaurant,<br>
campsites, trails and water activities.  And my family's lake house within<br>
easy driving distance.  But there is a lot of space that is "off-limits"<br>
to letterboxes and geocaches.  With the potential number of attendees<br>
doubled what I originally anticipated, I don't think Pokagon would be the<br>
best site.<br>
<br>
I will still go and talk to someone this summer and get their impressions<br>
and expectations for a large group gathering.  I will also look into Brown<br>
County and Turkey Run.  I think they are the largest state parks in<br>
Indiana.  Another thought would be to look into Whitewater State Park,<br>
just south of me.  Maybe not the most spectacular park, but it would be<br>
central to the boxing mecca of Cincinnati and all those boxes in Rush<br>
County, IN.<br>
<br>
If there are others that want to help me plan a big one, I will need it. <br>
I think the park system here allows one-year-in-advance reservations.  We<br>
might be a little late in getting something for 2008.  I will be at Clear<br>
Lake some time during the first 2 weeks of July.  We're planning to day<br>
trip into Michigan a couple of times.  We'll also be going to Louisville<br>
for a couple of days.  I could host an organizational meeting some time<br>
later this summer while the water toys are still available.<br>

<br>
This may become an issue as we move forward.<br>
As groups become larger, the capacity of any park to handle gatherings<br>
in a way that fits with the discreet nature of letterboxing becomes<br>
problematic (not to mention Leave No Trace).<br>
<br>
I am *NOT* suggesting any change in the way we meet or gather at this<br>
point, but I'm more and more aware of the impact that large groups<br>
have on any environment.<br>
<br>
The Great Lakes Annual Gathering will always be "The Big One" for our<br>
region.<br>
<br>
Worth pondering.<br>
