Can you imagine the thoughts that're going through the heads of those<br>
who have NO IDEA what "Cars on a Stick" can possibly mean?<br>
Oh, Yooperann, they'll be beating a path to the 'burbs to find what<br>
this can all be about.<br>
BTW, if you haven't been there, it is very cool.<br>
I think Artistamp still doesn't quite believe my description of that<br>
urban setting.<br>
Oh, but then we'll stop the car to take pictures of a junkyard.<br>

There's a great link, with photos of virtually all the sculptures that have <br>
ever been at Cermak Plaza, at http://users.rcn.com/jdeubel/plaza/<br>
Enjoy<br>
