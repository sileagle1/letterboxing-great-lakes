Can you imagine the thoughts that're going through the heads of those<br/>
who have NO IDEA what "Cars on a Stick" can possibly mean?<br/>
Oh, Yooperann, they'll be beating a path to the 'burbs to find what<br/>
this can all be about.<br/>
BTW, if you haven't been there, it is very cool.<br/>
I think Artistamp still doesn't quite believe my description of that<br/>
urban setting.<br/>
Oh, but then we'll stop the car to take pictures of a junkyard.<br/>

There's a great link, with photos of virtually all the sculptures that have <br/>
ever been at Cermak Plaza, at http://users.rcn.com/jdeubel/plaza/<br/>
Enjoy<br/>
