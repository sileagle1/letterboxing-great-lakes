<br>
I haven't paid close attention to the list or the Bingo words in <br>
quite some time.  So today I'm doing a little catching up.  I <br>
currently need 3 to fill my outside square and 6 more for a full card <br>
bingo. My  straight line Bingo (column G) would have fallen on 3/26 <br>
and I still have one open corner. <br>
<br>
Good luck everyone and thanks to SpringChick for this annual bit of <br>
winter enjoyment.<br>

card in which all my blank spots are perfectly positioned at this time<br>
so that I still do not have in any way shape or form any of the BINGO<br>
possibilities we are looking for.  There is one B word that could be<br>
called yet that would complete this senario, but any other word would<br>
give my some kind of Bingo (other than the ones still open for a win).<br>
