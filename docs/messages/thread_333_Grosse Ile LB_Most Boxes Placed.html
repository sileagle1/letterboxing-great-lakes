I went to the Grosse Ile box that was posted on the 16th.  Funny thing, I've lived in SE Michigan all my life (except for my exile years stuck in Lansing), but I've never been to Grosse Ile.  Man, is that place something else!  The box there was placed by the Grosse Ile Historical Society, which says that it will be placing more soon in that series.  Which reminded me:<br>
<br>
As soon as they get one more box up, THOSE people will be winning my "Most new boxes placed in SE Michigan challenge"!  We can't let those islanders win!  What about the mainland?  THey have limited space, they'll run out soon!  What about the rest of you?!  There's still time before Labor Day- get to placing!  And yes, sending me advance copies of the clues so I can get the FF certificate WILL gain you extra points *grin*<br>
<br>
STRENGTH AND HONOR!  (oh wait, that's my cycling mantra, not my letterboxing mantra.  That one's more like, "Where's that dang box? where's that dang box?"...)<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
