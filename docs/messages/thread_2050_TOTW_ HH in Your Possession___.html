So, I'll be the first one to step up to the confessional here...<br/>
<br/>
A Temple of Peace HH -- Just picked up in RI<br/>
The Witch's Broom HH -- Just picked up in RI<br/>
Prairie Bloom HH -- Have had too long, meant to take to RI, but forgot <br/>
to bring it.<br/>
<br/>
I will do my darndest to get these things into a local LB before <br/>
winter.  The Witch's Broom may be a problem as the logbook is quite <br/>
large and I will need a box with a fair amount of extra space to fit <br/>
in it.<br/>

Spring.  Our excuse was that with the proliferation of micro's and <br/>
mini's, we never could find a box big enough or with enough room <br/>
inside it to place the HH.  When we finally placed it and notified <br/>
azoobox, he mentioned that HH's don't necessarily have to go inside a <br/>
letterbox.  On top of, along side, or even underneath a micro will <br/>
all work, if the location will handle it and the HH is waterproof.  <br/>
There, even less excuses now available for holding onto those little <br/>
buggers.<br/>

We have however, recovered the recently liberated little HH of ours<br/>

Great Lakes region.<br/>

We remain firm in our conviction that people who want to conduct<br/>
"experiments" and start new trends with HH's are more than free to do<br/>
so, but they should choose a willing partner to collaborate with and<br/>
respect the right of those who choose not to participate, to decline<br/>
becoming involved.<br/>

stamping into a box! :-) <br/>
<br/>
We also recently received a new HH in the mail from Phynstar! Very <br/>
nice stamp! We had found Phynstar's "Highest Heights" HH earlier this <br/>
year, but the logbook was completely full. So, in exchange <br/>
for "Highest Heights" Phynstar sent us a brand new HH. How nice!<br/>

Exactly, make sure that poor HH is triple-bagged or in<br/>
its own container.  We found a long-lost HH last year<br/>
when looking for a mystery box.  The mystery box had<br/>
been planted about a year earlier, and we were the<br/>
first finders (yea us!), and the HH had been included<br/>
as a first finder bonus.  The HH had been left next to<br/>
the box rather than inside, though, and its lone baggy<br/>
was not enough to protect it from harsh Great Lakes<br/>
winters.  The stamp we salvaged, but alas, the log<br/>
book had turned to mush.  Nothing like seeing little<br/>
bugs oozing around the mushy pages of a logbook that's<br/>
melded together....Luckily we were able to locate the<br/>
HH's creator &amp; send it back to him for some TLC.  <br/>
<br/>
As for us hording HHs in our bookbag...glad to report<br/>
that we have none right now (I think).  Instead I'm<br/>
hording the clues to our planted Holy Grail<br/>
box...really, Dragon, I'll get them typed up &amp; to you<br/>
soon, as soon as I stop coughing up my lungs because I<br/>
got sick this weekend *WAHHH*<br/>
<br/>
Although, now planted and on her way again, we did<br/>
hold onto the Mrs. Claus HH which we found on the way<br/>
home from the Great Lakes Gathering in June a little<br/>
longer than we should have...so I understand if we<br/>
only get coal in our stockings this year.... :(<br/>

And as far as HH in my possession:  I currently have none.  I'm a good <br/>
girl (or just haven't found any recently).  <br/>

&gt; Team Bindlestiff currently possess no HH belonging to anyone else.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have however, recovered the recently liberated little HH of ours<br/>
&gt; that was stolen and used without our permission as an unwilling<br/>
&gt; participant in a convoluted "experiment" by another boxer from the<br/>
&gt; Great Lakes region.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We remain firm in our conviction that people who want to conduct<br/>
&gt; "experiments" and start new trends with HH's are more than free to do<br/>
&gt; so, but they should choose a willing partner to collaborate with and<br/>
&gt; respect the right of those who choose not to participate, to decline<br/>
&gt; becoming involved.<br/>
