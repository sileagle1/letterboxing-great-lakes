                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings!<br>
<br>
The McHenry County Conservation District in Northern Illinois has put <br>
some guidelines in place regarding the planting of letterboxes and <br>
geocaches.  One of these is to register all boxes, and gain approval <br>
for their locations.<br>
<br>
I recently followed the process for attempting to register the 'Run <br>
Away!' box from the Monty Python and the Holy Grail Series.  <br>
Unfortunately, the spot in which the box has resided for the last <br>
couple of years is considered to be in an area that is set aside for <br>
research, and is not an allowable place for boxes.  I received word <br>
that the box needs to be moved, or it will be collected and discarded <br>
at the beginning of October.<br>
<br>
That said, I am going to retrieve the box tomorrow morning (9/29), and <br>
will begin working on getting a new, approved location and drafting a <br>
revised set of clues.  My intention is to find an approved location in <br>
the same park.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions regarding the box, please don't hesitate to <br>
ask.  As soon as it is replanted, I will let everyone know so that <br>
anyone questing for that box can resume the hunt!<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>
<br>
