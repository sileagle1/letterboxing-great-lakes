Oh dear Riggsrocks...Don't fret!  We have signed up for this event and we always worry that <br/>
with these mystery events we will end up arriving at someone's funeral in the wrong <br/>
cemetery, or someone's surprise party at the wrong shelter, or under some bridge in the <br/>
middle of nowhere wondering where everyone else is!  But, we have managed to find our way.  <br/>
If we can do it, anyone can play....That being said, do come looking for us if we haven't <br/>
arrived by noon!  We just might end up in Miami looking for a dogsled!  Trust me, Tonto <br/>
would twist the clues enough to convince himself that is the right direction!<br/>

Hey, I wouldn't even THINK about arguing with Tonto on that!  Heading <br/>
south sounds like an excellent plan in February.<br/>

driving through [the wrong part of] Muskegon State Park looking for<br/>
the gathering spot -- and that wasn't even a mystery gathering! <br/>
Seeing as how you forgot to take along the directions, we were just<br/>
glad you made it to the right city!<br/>
<br/>
I'm kinda hoping we don't see you at the Iditarod by noon because it<br/>
might be nice to head down to Miami to look for you!<br/>
