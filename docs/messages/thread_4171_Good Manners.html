Hello Wisconsin Hiker,<br/>
<br/>
Today we found our first letterbox and want to thank you for a great hiking experince.  Your box is clever. We enjoyed the goat.<br/>
=========<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that we found your box on June 10.  It was a long hike, but a good one!  Our kids were just about to poop out, then we found the box and they livened back up again!  Someone else had found it in October and had placed a "hitchhiker" in the box!  The "Traveling Pants" hitchhiker started in Wisconsin last year and has made its way around WI before jumping the river into IA in Oct.  We are planning on taking it to either IL or SD.  Thanks for a great historical recount and a challenging letterbox hike!<br/>
========<br/>
We forgot our compass, but didn't have much problem with the box.  Thanks for the plant!<br/>
======<br/>
we are sad to say it seems your site for this letterbox has turned into a party site. The place matching your clues exactly is now home to a fire pit and many empty booze bottles and beer cans. We dug around as much of the rusted stuff that we could, but it's apparent they cleared out a circle in the middle of the rusty fenced area and made a fire pit. There was a bag of fresh fire wood and several new chairs. We scoured the area and found no letterbox among the rusty stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We truly hope we were in the wrong spot, but I don't think we were. :(<br/>
