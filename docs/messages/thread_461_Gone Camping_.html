Well, there's no more time left- we're leaving in a few short hours for our triathlon/camping extravaganza.  I'll have no access to email for the next 8 days, but I'll be looking forward to reading all the "NEW BOX- SE MICHIGAN" postings when I come back.  *smirk*<br/>
<br/>
I hope to hit as many of the Cheboygan and Mackinaw/Mackinac boxes as possible (the former which seemed to sprout like mushrooms in the last few weeks), as well as tricking my better half into letterboxing during a certain rest stop along northbound 75.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all have a happy and fruitful week<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Del, who will hopefully be able to sign all future posting with a very annoying "Triathlete Extraordinaire" when she returns<br/>
