                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry about this being a cross post, but I wanted to say thank you to<br>
everyone on this list for their contribution to my life!<br>
<br>
I have spent my life at home, hiding from the world. This list is why. . .<br>
<br>
Social Anxiety<br>
<br>
Agoraphobia- Fear of open spaces or of being in crowded, public places<br>
like markets. Fear of leaving home.<br>
<br>
Ataxophobia- Fear of disorder or untidiness.<br>
<br>
Atychiphobia- Fear of failure.<br>
<br>
In October, 2004 I read an article about Letterboxing. I was so<br>
thrilled, that all fear left me. I packed a little backpack, printed<br>
some clues and swallowed my fear.<br>
<br>
I found a Letterbox called "Spotted Puppy" by Spring Chick and I was<br>
hooked!<br>
<br>
I have learned that in the woods I feel safe, I have gone from being<br>
terrified of the world and computers, to a heavy addiction to<br>
Letterboxing and reading Letterboxing Websites.<br>
<br>
I have attended 2 mini-gatherings, planted 16 boxes of my own and um,<br>
the computer I love soooo much that now my family diconnects it so<br>
that I can't play on Letterboxing websites all day!<br>
<br>
One year ago, I didn't know how to turn the computer on, now I can<br>
figure out exactly what they have done to it, so that I can get back on.<br>
<br>
So, thank you for Letterboxers for planting.<br>
Thank you for this beautiful board.<br>
And thanks to everyone for being so kind.<br>
Also, thanks for helping me figure out what this strange thing called<br>
a computer is for, LETTERBOXING!!!<br>
<br>
I like leaving my house now, I know there is always a treasure waiting<br>
for me in a safe and beautiful place.<br>
<br>

I never knew letterboxing had such healing effects.  On us, it's <br>
been sort of the reverse: it's led us to all sorts of compulsivity <br>
and obsessions.<br>
<br>
Not to be trite or anything, but these (Social Anxiety, Agoraphobia, <br>
Ataxophobia, Atychiphobia) sound like a cool letterbox series along <br>
the lines of CMoon's "Gephyrophobia" box.<br>

Heh...Hehe....HEHE.....hey Scheherezade, you thinkin'<br>
what i'm thinkin'????<br>
<br>
Seriously though, I just want to say that Scheherezade<br>
is a fantastically wonderful person who has perhaps<br>
one of the most wicked senses of humor around. I'm<br>
glad that she's around, as if she weren't....i'd have<br>
one less person to be in cahoots with....<br>

Yeah, and they can only be solved by going to Sophie and Me's Prozac<br>

What a great story and if you have not been to one of Scheherezade's <br>
boxes, she does wonderful stories - my nieces and nephews love them.  I <br>
like them too, because they are challenging in that you actually have <br>
to think to find them.<br>
<br>
So Happy for YOu!<br>

I can't count the times I have sat here at my computer near to tears from laughing at something you have posted or written me in e-mail.  I am glad you found that little spotted puppy and have come to share your wonderful sense of humor and friendship with us, not to mention those fantastic letterboxes and stories.  Whodda thunk I would have hoisted my fat butt up a tree to get a naked princess in a letterbox?<br>
<br>
I am so happy for you and everything letterboxing has done for you, but we also are the lucky ones to have the chance to know you!<br>

  Subject: [LbGLK] What Has Letterboxing Done To Scheherezade???<br>
<br>
<br>
  Sorry about this being a cross post, but I wanted to say thank you to<br>
  everyone on this list for their contribution to my life!<br>
<br>
  I have spent my life at home, hiding from the world. This list is why. . .<br>
<br>
  Social Anxiety<br>
<br>
  Agoraphobia- Fear of open spaces or of being in crowded, public places<br>
  like markets. Fear of leaving home.<br>
<br>
  Ataxophobia- Fear of disorder or untidiness.<br>
<br>
  Atychiphobia- Fear of failure.<br>
<br>
  In October, 2004 I read an article about Letterboxing. I was so<br>
  thrilled, that all fear left me. I packed a little backpack, printed<br>
  some clues and swallowed my fear.<br>
<br>
  I found a Letterbox called "Spotted Puppy" by Spring Chick and I was<br>
  hooked!<br>
<br>
  I have learned that in the woods I feel safe, I have gone from being<br>
  terrified of the world and computers, to a heavy addiction to<br>
  Letterboxing and reading Letterboxing Websites.<br>
<br>
  I have attended 2 mini-gatherings, planted 16 boxes of my own and um,<br>
  the computer I love soooo much that now my family diconnects it so<br>
  that I can't play on Letterboxing websites all day!<br>
<br>
  One year ago, I didn't know how to turn the computer on, now I can<br>
  figure out exactly what they have done to it, so that I can get back on.<br>
<br>
  So, thank you for Letterboxers for planting.<br>
  Thank you for this beautiful board.<br>
  And thanks to everyone for being so kind.<br>
  Also, thanks for helping me figure out what this strange thing called<br>
  a computer is for, LETTERBOXING!!!<br>
<br>
  I like leaving my house now, I know there is always a treasure waiting<br>
  for me in a safe and beautiful place.<br>
<br>
