                    <div class="plaintext-content">Geocities has finally gotten around to letting us know how and when the closing and transition will occur.  My site is a Geocities Plus site, and will continue to function as is until Oct. 26.  After that date, it will be converted to a Yahoo Web hosting site with a new domain name.  People trying to access my geocities site will be redirected to the new site.  After the switch, I will update AQ, etc.  There shouldn't be much of an issue at accessing the clues on my site at all.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem I'm having with this is coming up with a good new domain name.  Unfortunately, dragonsden.XXX and dragonslair.XXX and similar domains have already been taken.  I want a relatively short, yet descriptive domain name (dragonsletterboxes.xxx seems too long, and dragonslbs.xxx doesn't seem right).  I am open to suggestions if anyone has a creative suggestion.<br>
<br>
I'll be working on updating my site today.  Unfortunately there still is no word from Bristol, so don't look for new clues on that page yet.<br>
<br>
To top this all off, I also have to move my school webpages off the school's website so I have to find a home for those now too.  (I'm still trying to figure out what our IT is thinking about that new policy...) If you think my letterboxing site is massive, you should see my school pages...<br>

Hmm...maybe dragonsletterbox.info isn't too bad...<br>

I agree about dragonslbs, makes me think you are a dragon concerned <br>
about your weight.  :-)<br>

Since I will also be hosting my school webpages at the same site, I'm now trying to mix the two.  I've found that both "mathdragon.net" and "dragonmath.net" are available, so I might go with one of those.  Any comments on these or other suggestions on mixing the two are appreciated.<br>
