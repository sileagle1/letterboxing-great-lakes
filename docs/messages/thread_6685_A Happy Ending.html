Angels are watching over your letterboxes, well at least they are watching over the Famous Jamaican. Today, we were coming home from dinner and my husband looked at the wooden fence where I hid your letterbox. Mr. Beetle comments to me - "Hmm...that looks like new wood. Doesn't it look like someone replaced that wooden fence? Isn't that were you hid a letterbox?" YIKES!!!!! And the pile of old wood fencing was on the ground in a haul away pile. Mr. Beetle turned the car around and I jumped out and hiked back to that spot. My heart was pounding. Oh, please, let the letterbox be on the ground. Maybe it fell out of the fence post and the workers never saw it. Fingers crossed. I was ready to lift up all the old wood in the pile to see if the letterbox was still wedged in a fence post. The sun hasn't set yet, so I was going to bushwack the entire area. Oh, please let that fabulous stamp still be there, somewhere, anywhere. YES! I found it. It almost looks like someone found it and gently placed it on the ground not far from the new fence. Amazing. The 14 page mini-logbook has about 5-6 stamps per page and it's completely full. The stamp is fine. (Deep Breath) (Exhale) It's getting late to find another place to hide this box, at least not tonight. And it's been raining off and on today and more threatening skies. <br/>
Right now, I'm just letting my heart settle down. Mr. Beetle wants to know if he gets any special points for observing the replacement fence when your letterbox was hiding. Answer: Absolutely YES! For now, you can update this box clue and let people know it's temporarily out of commission...but we'll see about finding another location to hide it, or maybe you want to retire it. Your call. <br/>

Yes, this was a happy ending story.  Sometimes letterboxes go missing for all sorts of reasons.  I'm sure that someone picked up this letterbox, looked inside, and decided to carefully place it on the ground along the newfence.  They didn't know exactly how it was hidden in the first place.  They probably figured that it belonged there and another person would come along soon to find it.  There were so many others who had previously been to that location.  It's good to share some warm fuzzy letterbox stories.  <br/>
