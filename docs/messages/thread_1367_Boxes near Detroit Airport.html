site does show the stamp images from a planned series of 8 boxes at Crosswinds<br>
Marsh, which is several miles south of the airport (and is in fact a wetland<br>
created to replace some wetlands lost during a Metro airport <br>
expansion), but to<br>
my knowledge only the first 2 boxes were ever planted.<br>

http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/letterboxing/index.htm<br>
<br>
Mirkwood also had 2 boxes at Lower Huron Metropark, a few miles west of the<br>
airport, and Clickermom3 has a new box at Oakwoods Metropark, a few miles<br>
south.<br>
<br>
We found the 4 local Mirkwood boxes in summer 2003, but do not know their<br>
present status.  The locations are all enjoyable places to visit, in <br>
any event!<br>
