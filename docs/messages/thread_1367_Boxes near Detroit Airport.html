Marsh, which is several miles south of the airport (and is in fact a wetland<br/>
created to replace some wetlands lost during a Metro airport <br/>
expansion), but to<br/>
my knowledge only the first 2 boxes were ever planted.<br/>

Mirkwood also had 2 boxes at Lower Huron Metropark, a few miles west of the<br/>
airport, and Clickermom3 has a new box at Oakwoods Metropark, a few miles<br/>
south.<br/>

We found the 4 local Mirkwood boxes in summer 2003, but do not know their<br/>
present status.  The locations are all enjoyable places to visit, in <br/>
any event!<br/>
