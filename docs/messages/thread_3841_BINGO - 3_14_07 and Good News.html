The Bingo word for 3/14/07 is:<br>
<br>
B - Linda Fay<br>
<br>
I am more than mildly distracted today.  Yesterday we got an offer on our house in Indy <br>
which we accepted!!!  Assuming (while holding breath) all goes as planned, we will be down <br>
to one house on March 30th!!!  I ordered the last moving truck today and left my credit card <br>
behind.  I have to coordinate a couple more repairmen and make the calls to utilities.<br>
<br>
No feelings hurt!  Just overwhelmed at the moment.  After 1 year and 1 week, we can't believe <br>
this day is coming.  I am looking forward to replenishing the savings, paying off the new old <br>
house, and taking many more letterboxing road trips to destinations far and wide.<br>

I remember you talking about it last June when you were in WI for the GLk event.  I'm sure it is a big relief to see the end in sight!<br>
