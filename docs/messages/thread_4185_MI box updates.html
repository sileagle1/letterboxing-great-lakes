&gt; Hi, I just wanted to let you know that Jerome the Nomadic Gnome will <br/>
&gt; be moving to a new summer home shortly. If you want to visit him at <br/>
&gt; the really cool spring home, go quickly!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
When heading to Jerome's Spring Home, make sure to check out AtlasQuest <br/>
as there is a new box nearby (it's not listed on letterboxing.org).  <br/>
There's also a box that's been there a long time but still active in <br/>
case you haven't gotten that one...<br/>

Awwww!  Sorry Kat! He's really cute!  Nothing to shudder over!<br/>

He's successfully relocated to Brownstown, MI.  I also met J Walkers <br/>
while I was moving him out of Dearborn Sunday!  That was fun!<br/>
