GLG is just about 2 weeks away, can you believe it?? We can't, we are really getting down to crunch time now.<br>
<br>
It rained yesterday and doesn't look much better today. Lets hope and pray for a dry week leading up to the gather as well as a dry weekend for the gathering.<br>
<br>
However, if it does rain, we wont have very much roof space to hide under. Some brought Canopies to Boxacon and that seemed to work really well. If you have a large canopie/shelter and are willing to bring it to Peoria that would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Even if it doesn't rain, they would provide shade from the sun.<br>
<br>
Thanks all,<br>
