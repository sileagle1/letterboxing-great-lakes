Count me as a tech person. I'm in the IT industry like Martini Man. I <br>
have taught photography in the past, if that counts. Letterboxing now <br>
gives me one more reason to wish I was a full time teacher, however. <br>
I'd have my summers off and time for one of those long letterboxing <br>
quests like Dragon is planning.<br>

I just realized that out of 30 some people attending the recent<br>
gathering in northern Illinois, there were at least 3 Debs. That's<br>
almost 10%. Is there something significant in that? Hmmmm...<br>

All three Deb/Deb-variants on this board have tech jobs, so then all <br>
Debs are inherently techs.  This is not to say all techs are <br>
inherently Debs, but there's no way of knowing that these techs may <br>
actually be harboring an "inner Deb".  That is, not unless <br>
they 'fess up to it! ;)<br>
