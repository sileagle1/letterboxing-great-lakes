Ladies, you'll have to trust me on this one.  This was one of the most handsome men to walk the earth.  As like fine wine, he just got better with age.  Always a smile, filled with enthusiasm about living life, and sooooo very proud of his daughter - our own Fungus Woman.  <br/>
Many good memories left behind. I still smile when I look at his photo from a gathering and think about him.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't cry because it's over,<br/>
Smile because it happened.<br/>
<br/>
Boxer, we miss you, but we know you're just watching us from a different level of in the universe.  <br/>

activity allows one to leave a little bit of himself everywhere he goes?  I<br/>
found a box right before summer with his stamp image in it and I stopped for<br/>
a moment to remember him.<br/>
<br/>
In Texas, we remember Boxer fondly and with great respect.  It's hard to<br/>
believe it has already been a year since his passing.  Thank you for the<br/>
reminder to stop and honor him on this day.<br/>
