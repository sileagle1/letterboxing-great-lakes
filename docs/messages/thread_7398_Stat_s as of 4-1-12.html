                    <div class="plaintext-content">How many words do you have left? Better yet...do you know your odds? This is what has been called thus far.<br/>
<br/>
B: 18 words out of 25 (72%)<br/>
I: 23 words out of 25 (92%)<br/>
N: 22 words out of 25 (88%)<br/>
G: 18 words out of 25 (72%)<br/>
O: 19 words out of 25 (76%)<br/>
<br/>
Putting it all together, 100 out of 125 words have been called, or 80% of all terms. (Are you at 80% filled?)<br/>
<br/>
To put it into another perspective:<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes: 39 words out of 45 (87%)<br/>
Trail Names: 20 words out of 25 (80%)<br/>
Events: 13 words out of 15 (87%)<br/>
General Terms: 28 words out of 40 (80%)<br/>
<br/>
Where do you stand?<br/>
<br/>
On another note, there are only 25 more words left, meaning that the game will be finished no later than April 26th. If you're playing the sidewagers game and picked a date from the 27th or later, then, well....you lost!<br/>
<br/>
Watch your cards people. The game is about to ramp up. Remember, there are no ties for 1st, 2nd, or 3rd and winner's will be announced by how soon you date stamp your notification to me by email. So....if 6 people all call on the same day it goes by who notifies me first. So...don't be a slacker.<br/>
<br/>
(I'm thinking this might be a replay of the Hunger Games, don't you?)<br/>
