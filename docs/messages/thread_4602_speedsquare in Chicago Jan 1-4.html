                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay - here's the scoop.  Looks like the weather is going to be typical during our trip this <br>
week.  My first list of 29 box listings had to be cut way down to appease the silent one.  We <br>
have other family commitments Tuesday afternoon in Forest Park (wave to Aunt Tillie) and <br>
Wednesday dinner at the Brat Stop in Kenosha County.  We expect another reunion with <br>
graduates of our old school, probably Thursday.  We'll spend Wednesday looking for furniture <br>
in St. Charles, IKEA.  Downtown/neighborhood shopping on Thursday.  I wish I could be more <br>
specific, but I don't know how I can fit a "quick meet".  I will say we are looking for the <br>
Cemetery boxes in FP, Hunting for the Pink Panther in RF.  And stopping off at Chocolate <br>
Milk, sometime on Monday - if possible.  DH is looking forward to Johnny's Italian Beef or <br>
Parky Dogs.  I loved those salty fries in the brown bag.<br>
<br>
Bird Woman - call my Aunt Tillie on Tuesday to see if we're there yet.  If you haven't hunted <br>
the Pink Panther yet, we could use the company.<br>
<br>
~speedsquare<br>
<br>
PS - For all those boxes I had to shelve this time - never fear - I want to visit this summer.<br>

Oh, Speedsquare--what is your "real" name.  I'm going to fill really <br>
silly calling up Tillie and asking for "Speedsquare".  She'll think I'm <br>
nuts   :~)<br>
