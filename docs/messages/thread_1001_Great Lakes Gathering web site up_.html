Alright everybody!  The official Great Lakes Gathering 2005 webpage is<br/>
up and running (and hopefully won't be deleated on me again)!<br/>
<br/>
You can access it directly following this link:<br/>
<br/>
http://home.wi.rr.com/dragonlber/GLG%202005.htm<br/>
<br/>
I will also place a link on the group site, and "big" list site, and<br/>
there already is one from my main page.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to incorporate all the information that was flying around when<br/>
it was discussed on the list last week, but I probably got something<br/>
wrong, so let me know any information I need to fix.  Also be sure to<br/>
notify me if anything changes or if I need to add anything later.<br/>
<br/>
We're still in the process of picking an exact location, so watch for<br/>
that detail to appear soon!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy and think of warm June weather!<br/>
<br/>
