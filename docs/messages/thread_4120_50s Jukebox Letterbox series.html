                    <div class="plaintext-content">Stacey (m&8x) will have these in the clue packet but in case anyone <br>
wants to hunt for them before hand, here they are.  I will post <br>
online tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Difficulty: Pretty darn easy clues and walking.<br>
Time: approx 1 hour, if you have no problems finding boxes.<br>
Distance: ~  1  mile round trip from parked car. <br>
Terrain:  Fairly flat with shallow ups and downs.<br>
Note:  This is a wooded area with all the hazards of a <br>
forest.....briars, fallen trees, undergrowth,  poison ivy in areas, <br>
muddy places at times, and mosquitoes and ticks in the summer.... but <br>
the  trails are well marked and mowed.  Some  boxes require travel <br>
around or through some light briars so be prepared.  Maybe some <br>
adversity will keep out the muggles.<br>
Please bring your stamp, a stamp pad, compass, pen and an old rag to <br>
wipe off the box/your hands. Bug repellent is highly desired in the <br>
summer and I believe this summer is worse than others.  I got some in <br>
Okla. recently, even with the off well used. <br>
 <br>
The first box contains several first finder awards (NOTE:  This award <br>
is in a special format and will not work on a standard machine so do <br>
not remove the hand made label but figure out the format first.  And <br>
I hope this note did not fully divulge the actual award itself and <br>
ruin the surprise) and I request the last person to take a first <br>
finder award to also take the large container and burlap bag that <br>
helps hide it, home with you  ....but leave the letterpouch in this <br>
location for future finders.  Thank you in advance.   And when found, <br>
please make sure the award container is replaced with the lid side up <br>
to help prevent moisture entering the container.<br>
 <br>
Ok here we go.    See the map at:  <br>
http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/parks/pdf/alumcreek606.pdf  to help <br>
you with directions.<br>
 <br>
Make your way to the east side of the lake and take Africa Road/CR21 <br>
to the intersection with Plumb Road.  This is at the S.E. end of the <br>
lake.  At this intersection turn west into the parking area and gate <br>
crossing area of what used to be Plumb Road heading westward (before <br>
the lake was filled).  <br>
BOX 1:   Park your car and start hiking the old roadway westward.  <br>
Before long you will be met from the left by the all purpose trail <br>
but you will continue westward.  A little ways further you will see <br>
the all purpose trail go to the right (north) and a trail marker, on <br>
the left side of your roadway, which points back toward your car.  <br>
Here you will go north, from the trail marker, 37 steps,  looking <br>
left for a large tree with a broken limb pointing southerly.  This <br>
tree is about 8 steps off the west side of the trail and you will <br>
make your way to its back side. (Note:  please make sure you are <br>
unobserved before entering the woods)  From there take a look at a <br>
heading of ~ (approximately) 315* and back there you will see a 3 <br>
trunked tree amongst some other trees.  Horse Trader took 25  steps,  <br>
starting to the left and then circling clockwise, to reach this three <br>
trunked tree where he placed the 50s JUKEBOX LETTERBOX and first <br>
finders awards in a tan burlap sack.  Please replace as and where <br>
found.<br>
BOX 2: Go back to the all purpose trail and continue northerly, going <br>
down a slight hill and then back up to the crest and look left for a <br>
tree with 4 large limbs branching out about 6-7 feet above ground.   <br>
Go 13 steps further to an animal path going right and follow this <br>
animal path 14 steps, from the trail edge,  to a 4 trunked tree and <br>
find ELVIS at its base beside some briars under some limbs.<br>
BOX 3:  Back on the all purpose trail heading northerly go down a <br>
slight dip and back up to the trail marker on the left.  Go past the <br>
marker 20 steps to a large forking tree on the left.  From this tree <br>
turn 90* to the right and see the animal  path and follow it 24 steps <br>
off the trail to the second large tree on the left.   YAKETY YAK is <br>
at the base of this second tree under bark.<br>
BOX 4:  Back on the all purpose trail heading northerly circle the <br>
mud hole as best you can and pass the trail marker on the right and <br>
then the culvert 41 steps ahead.  102 steps past the culvert look for <br>
a broken,  leaning tree on the left hand side of the trail.  (The <br>
broken portion starts about 3 feet above ground and is presently <br>
leaning on another tree.  It may fall down at some future time).  <br>
Directly across the trail and 17 steps into the woods is a three <br>
trunked tree with a GATER, looking for water, at the base of the tree <br>
under limbs.<br>
BOX 5: At this point Horse Trader and I looked on up the  trail at <br>
the rather large mud hole and decided to try some other areas closer <br>
to the lake so we reversed our hike and headed back south to the  old <br>
Plumb roadbed.  Upon reaching the road we turned west and headed <br>
toward the lake.  Not to far ahead you will be met from the left by <br>
the all purpose trail loop but you will keep going westerly toward <br>
the lake until seeing the all purpose trail jog to the north again.  <br>
