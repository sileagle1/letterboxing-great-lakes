                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone. I've recently received several "can't find it" emails <br>
regarding the 'Laika' and 'Strongheart' boxes in Maybury Park in <br>
Northville MI.<br>
I'm happy to report that a local 'boxer found both boxes safe and <br>
sound in their hiding places last week. I had removed the clues for <br>
Strongheart because based on the emails it had seemed to be MIA. I <br>
will repost the clues in case those who gave up trying to find the <br>
boxes get the urge to try again.<br>

Thinking of taking my two kids box hunting in Maybery on Friday <br>
afternoon (weather permitting) can I ask if any of the boxes are <br>
stroller friendly? I'm letterboxing with a 1 year old and a 9 year old! <br>
You could email me if you'd rather keep this information quiet. I <br>
appreciate your help! <br>

We have a graco travel system.<br>
It was pretty bumpy and at times hard to push<br>
I would think it could be a little muddy this time of year,<br>

Our stroller seems to have had it with letterboxing.<br>
we bought a backpack carrier because we didn't want<br>

<br>
depending on how much your 1yr old weighs a carrier could<br>
be a good alternative.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Still, though, I'd have to say that the Laika, Strongheart, and Lovebirds boxes at Maybury are among the more stroller-friendly in the area, since most of the trail is a paved biking path.  (The clues mention this, so I don't feel I'm giving away any secrets here.)  Other boxes in the park are on the hiking trails, so a more trail-ready stroller or a carrier would definitely be preferable for those.  Your 9 year old will surely enjoy any of them, though!!<br>
