give us all a day of fun. The preparation and the communication before the event was <br>
top drawer.  I couldn't believe WH & MM were there to welcome us as we straggled in <br>
late on the day of the gathering. I had a chance to seek a few boxes this morning and <br>
was mightly amused by some very clever box placement.<br>
<br>
I so enjoyed talking with old friends and new that we did very little boxing on <br>
Saturday.  I returned this morning but didn't do as many boxes as I wantedI love to <br>
walk in the rain, but I hate to try to keep logbooks dry.  I'll be going back on Friday.<br>

White Rabbit #3 is missing from his hidey hole; Oryctolagus cuniculus is a very elusive <br>
fellow. 8-<<br>
