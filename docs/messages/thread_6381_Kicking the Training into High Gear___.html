The Swiss Miss half of Team Switzerland will be kicking her training program<br>
into high gear as she braves the luge track at the Muskegon Winter Sports<br>
Complex on Friday. If you have found the Kiss 'n Tell letterbox at Muskegon<br>
State Park, that's the track, although it is my understanding that novice<br>
lugers must start part of the way down the track, not at the top (Grimette<br>
Point). Anyway, on Saturday I'll either be fearless, having successfully<br>
maneuvered the luge, or well... we all know what the possibilities are on<br>
the luge. If I'm not there on Saturday... remember the good times!<br>
