                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tomorrow is the day!  Are you excited?  We are!!!  We look forward to<br/>
this gathering each fall to see our letterboxing friends from previous<br/>
years and meet new letterboxers in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Pigeon Creek Park<br/>
West Olive, MI<br/>
9:30 a.m. - 7:00 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
Note Time Change!!! We moved up the start time by a 1/2 hour to 9:30<br/>
a.m. to accommodate those who were coming a little early as<br/>
temperatures are supposed to be a bit cool and the heated lodge will<br/>
be a welcome start to the day!  Don't worry if your plans revolve<br/>
around the 10:00 a.m. start time -- we will still be there when you<br/>
arrive!  The end time was extended to 7:00 p.m. as we have quite a<br/>
large group coming and didn't want to have to rush through dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  We've been busy hiding letterboxes and preparing clues and<br/>
have a great batch of creativity in store for you!  The clue packet<br/>
will be uploaded to the files section of this list early this evening.<br/>
 You do not *have* to print out a copy as they will be available at<br/>
the gathering.  But if  you want to come early and get a jump on<br/>
finding boxes, they are available for you.  If you are planning to<br/>
hunt down any of the other area letterboxes, you must bring your own<br/>
clues as we will only have clues available for the event boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Food:  Reminder that the potluck will be at dinner this year (5:00<br/>
p.m.).  Table service and hotdogs/buns/condiments will be provided. <br/>
Please plan to bring a side dish to pass and your own drinks.  There<br/>
will be no formal break for lunch, but you are encouraged to pack a<br/>
lunch for your family and welcome to picnic in the lodge or on the<br/>
trail.  <br/>
<br/>
Workshops/Activities:  There are no formal workshops scheduled for the<br/>
event, but we learn best from one another so if there is something you<br/>
would like to share or something you want to ask/learn about, please<br/>
don't hesitate to bring it up!  Also, since there is a possibility of<br/>
rain, you might want to bring along your carving materials and if the<br/>
weather thwarts our box hunting, we can sit around a carve for a while.<br/>
<br/>
