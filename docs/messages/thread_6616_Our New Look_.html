Tiptoe, you were right... but only partially. We've carved new personal stamps to be used at the GLG and beyond. They are no less colorful, however we have carved our names in them and they are slightly different to represent our growth as people and as letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Also keep your eyes out for Moon Goddess, OLJ's lil sis through the Big Brothers Big Sisters program. She will be with us throughout the GLG and has caught the letterboxing bug like so many of us. She just graduated high school and is the reason for our trip to Flordia (where we will be driving from on our way to peoria).<br/>
<br/>
So if you have our stamps already flag us down to update your books...and if you haven't met us yet.... we would love to meet you! See you all in a few days!<br/>
