                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmm, this is an interesting observation, I think I saw somebody else mention this a while back and I was surprised at the time as I am now.  I've been using the gallon size freezer bags with zipper sliders as the 'everything' bag in my boxes for a few years now and have not really noticed any significant problems other than the normal wear and tear on bags.  Face it, plastic food bags were not made to hold up forever in various weather and environmental conditions with people opening and closing them with varying degrees of care.  I think any plastic bag gets worn and torn and needs to be replaced now and then.<br>
<br>
One thing I have noticed when I check on my boxes though, when comparing zipper slider bags to the regular ziploc bags without the siders -- people tend to actually take the time to reclose the sliders, on the other hand, I find more of the regular bags not sealed (and thus often wet).  It also seems as though the regular bags more often break apart at the seal, perhaps just a weak spot or perhaps from being hastily pulled open.  So while I see the reasoning that the sliders may fall off and if somebody is not careful when closing the bag, the slider may catch and tear the plastic (I have not actually ever seen this), there are pros and cons.<br>
<br>
The brand may make a difference also.  I picked up some zipper slider bags at the dollar store and they were junk.  The little sliders did come off very easy and the plastic was so thin that holes were likely just from normal usage.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've definitely found that both the brand name seems to matter and also the<br>
type of bag.  Freezer bags are more expensive but do a much better job than<br>
those thin "sandwich" bags.  And I find the Ziploc brand bags hold up much<br>
longer than the store-brand names or dollar store bags.<br>
<br>
The trouble with the gallon size bags tho is that they won't fit into a lot<br>
of boxes.  Or sometimes they *just* fit, if alllll the air is squeezed out.<br>
Which means that each finder has to be responsible enough to make sure the<br>
top is totally securely snapped back on the container, something that<br>
doesn't always happen.<br>
<br>
And I've never really seen any freezer bags small enough for some of these<br>
really small boxes.  I've tried using the small bags I use for ATCs but<br>
those don't seem to survive well at all.<br>
<br>
I've found the ones with the zippers work OK as long as they're zipped<br>
gently but completely. I've found boxes where there were no holes or<br>
anything in the zipper bag but the contents were all wet because the bag<br>
wasn't quite zipped completely shut.  Too much force and it can break the<br>
zipper, too little force and it's not closed completely.<br>
<br>
Just more good reasons for double-bagging.  :-)<br>
