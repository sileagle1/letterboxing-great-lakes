<br>
  Today is the 5th anniversary of finding our very first letterbox (E-<br>
  way trails - Madison, WI). We've found a LOT of boxes since then, but <br>
  it was fun to think about that first box today. We were out in <br>
  sandals and I had some very basic supplies (2 colors of ink pads, our <br>
  sig stamps and our brand new logbooks) in an old summer canvas purse <br>
  as we headed down the trail. We were SO excited to actually find it!<br>
<br>
  So today, we also found some boxes. We had better supplies (and <br>
  better footwear) and still had a lot of fun!<br>
<br>
  Thanks to all of you who place boxes!!<br>
