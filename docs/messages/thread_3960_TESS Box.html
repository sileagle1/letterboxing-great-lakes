I acutally ended up going back to the table where you were at.  The <br/>
TESS box was still there, but you had moved on.  LOL....<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I found there to be 16 stamps in that crazy box.<br/>
<br/>
I too would like to thank everyone who contributed to this very well <br/>
thought out box.  There were several carvings in there that were well <br/>
worth the time to wait to stamp in.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To all Schoolhouse attendees~I inadvertantly left one box off the "cheat <br/>
sheet".  See the Ohio board where I posted last night.  Safari Man and I <br/>
each added one stamp that are "Made In Ohio" and so there should be the <br/>
main stamp of SpringChick's called Letterboxing Great Lakes, plus 15 <br/>
Made In My State stamps for a total of 16 now.  Some are listed and some <br/>
are not.  SpringChick's is and then there are about 5 or so Made in My <br/>
State stamps that are as well, and they are listed under "Made In My <br/>
State" if you list your finds. <br/>
<br/>
Ohio is now "on the map" and I have a very strong feeling there will be <br/>
more Made In Ohio stamps after so many got to see the entire collection <br/>
for the first time!<br/>
