Thanks to Dr. Watson for hosting a great event. We had a super turnout <br>

<br>
I had the privledge of stamping in all 15 of the stamps in the TESS <br>
Series. What great stamps!  I made sure I got all of them before the <br>
box moved from our table. Thanks to all of you that contributed to this <br>
box. <br>

I'm looking forward to meeting all of you some day. Maybe June 2.<br>

I acutally ended up going back to the table where you were at.  The <br>
TESS box was still there, but you had moved on.  LOL....<br>
<br>
Oh, and I found there to be 16 stamps in that crazy box.<br>
<br>
I too would like to thank everyone who contributed to this very well <br>
thought out box.  There were several carvings in there that were well <br>
worth the time to wait to stamp in.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To all Schoolhouse attendees~I inadvertantly left one box off the "cheat <br>
sheet".  See the Ohio board where I posted last night.  Safari Man and I <br>
each added one stamp that are "Made In Ohio" and so there should be the <br>
main stamp of SpringChick's called Letterboxing Great Lakes, plus 15 <br>
Made In My State stamps for a total of 16 now.  Some are listed and some <br>
are not.  SpringChick's is and then there are about 5 or so Made in My <br>
State stamps that are as well, and they are listed under "Made In My <br>
State" if you list your finds. <br>
<br>
Ohio is now "on the map" and I have a very strong feeling there will be <br>
more Made In Ohio stamps after so many got to see the entire collection <br>
for the first time!<br>
