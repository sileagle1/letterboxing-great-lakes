We can't send you a card if we don't know where you live!  And while I'm sure we can probably track you down if you give me a first and last name and a state, I'll probably be busy gearing up for Chinese New Year and the SILO II later that month.<br>
<br>
Also, just a clarification...each participant will be mailing their own cards to the other participants on the list.  After Jan. 10 I will email the list of addresses to all of the participants so that they can mail their cards by Feb. 7 (actually, I will probably ask that participants mail their cards sometime earlier in that week or the previous week so that they are hopefully received by the seventh).  <br>

Thanks for organizing this!!  While I have zero Chinese blood, I have <br>
been reading up and working toward the goals of cleaning etc before the <br>
first day of the Chinese New Year!  The superstitions and goals serve as <br>
fantastic motivation!!<br>

I have absolutely zero Chinese blood too (although my dad has an aunt who is Korean) but I've always been fascinated with the asian zodiac.  Katy and I started celebrating Chinese New Year a few years ago as an excuse to host a party.  I make these yummy little steamed pot stickers (dumplings, I'm not sure what the Chinese word for them is but the Japanese call them gyoza) and Flying Dragon makes absolutely fantastic pork buns (I believe they are called shu mai in Chinese).  We also learned how to make fortune cookies which, although not truly asian in origin, are great for parties.  It's a lot of fun and if I'm going to have a bunch of people over who aren't family it's a great incentive for me to clean my house from top to bottom (ok, so the basement is still a mess...but I have to clean that up a bit this year too so that the dogs have someplace to hang out during the party).<br>

Those steamed pot stickers are the BEST!!!! <br>
<br>
I forget if I already shared this with you or not....but my New Year's <br>
Resolution is to get my house completely cleaned out, purged---the whole <br>
deal and I made a PT for this as well.  Actually all of us who attended <br>
a local event last Sunday did!  There are 3 of us who are now on a roll <br>
to "pitch, purge, clean, clear and organize"!  =) <br>
