                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got asked the same thing, via direct e-mail from LbNA, from a reporter in our hometown in Michigan's U.P.  We've planted 6 of the 7 boxes in the area covered by the newspaper.  Most of them are fairly easy finds in somewhat popular places, so I hate to have them called out in the newspaper and brought to the attention of everyone in town... but then, they'll probably be mentioned in the article whether I respond to the reporter or not.  At least if I respond, I can try to emphasize the "stealth" aspects of letterboxing so that she can (hopefully) include that aspect in her article, and not give away the box locations.<br>
<br>
Maybe it'd be good if the article appeared in December... by the time the weather warms up again for people to be out at the box locations, they'll have forgotten about it!<br>
