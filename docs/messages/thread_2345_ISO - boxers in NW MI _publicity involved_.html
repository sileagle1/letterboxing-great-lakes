participate in an article that the Traverse City Record Eagle may be<br/>
doing related to Letterboxing, please send me a note off list, ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
Note: they are not seeking folks who have boxes in Northern Mich but<br/>
do not live there.<br/>
<br/>
I think they are looking for someone to give them another perspective<br/>
besides the 20 minutes they got from me. (Hint: do you see the<br/>
underlying request here? They are, at this point, merely SUPERFICIAL,<br/>
in their investigation and I really NEED someone else to help me<br/>
impart to them the depth and breadth of our activity!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>
