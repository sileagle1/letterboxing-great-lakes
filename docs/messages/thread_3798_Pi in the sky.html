We have actually loved letterboxing for the nature part of the <br>
hikes.  We have learned more about creatures and bugs from <br>
letterboxing hikes than I ever could have come up with.  I need to <br>
find a nature guide that I can load on my PDA so I do not have to <br>
carry around so many different guide books, LOL - starting to look <br>
like a reference library in the letterboxing bag, LOL!<br>
