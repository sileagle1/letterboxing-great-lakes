The Atomic Beans had a wonderful time over the weekend, and now we are <br>
all tired!<br>
<br>
We arrived on Friday afternoon and quickly bumped into a few of our <br>
hosts.  Tie Dye Sue quickly put me on notice when she told me to keep <br>
the ticks I found (on myself) so I could win her twisted childhood <br>
game.  (EEK!)  I'm happy to say, that turned out not to be a problem for <br>
the Atomic Beans (although we did collectively find three) as much as <br>
the mosquitos.  [Our poor children are a bit tasty for the bugs is <br>
seems, and no matter how many how many layers of spray/wipes we applied, <br>
the children are polka dotted today. Fortunately, it didn't seem to <br>
phase them much.]<br>
<br>
We started Friday afternoon (after wrestling with the new tent) by <br>
pondering Pingo....kinda like Bingo but with stamps hidden at the <br>
various pottys around camp.  It also proved to be a nice opportunity to <br>
bump into several familiar (and new) faces around the campgrounds.  We <br>
had already had a long day to get to MN, so we going to  turn in early <br>
after a festive campground dinner...but oops...kids like the smores, and <br>
they were on a bit of a sugar high afterwards.  Fortunately, we bumped <br>
into the younger portions of the Boston Terrorists at the nearby <br>
sandbox...and the kids had a fun time in the sand and doing daredevil <br>
jumps off the large rocks. That did help to spend a bit of the kids <br>
energy, but as some of you might have noticed while walking to the MN <br>
pregathering campsite, it didn't zap them off all of their energy ("BUT <br>
I WANT TO STAY UP LATE!").<br>
<br>
Saturday morning started out beautifully.  We walked from the campsite <br>
over to the gathering and managed a FF along the way. After a few brief <br>
"hellos" we set off on the trails.  We did a few sets by ourselves <br>
before meeting Martini Man, Wisconsin Hiker, Hartx6, the Hills, and <br>
Lewis (of Lewis and Clark) on the trails. The stamps were great, and the <br>
company was festive.<br>
<br>
We returned to the shelter for lunch (Dartmoor Dreamer asked if we found <br>
any Bonus Boxes "DOHT, WE KNEW SHE LIKES BB...OOPS!") at which point we <br>
were already a bit wiped out (oh how the children have made us soft).  <br>
Fortunately, there was a 'kids only' section near the shelter and we <br>
were happy to send our oldest off to box while the younger one napped so <br>
we could have a few moments to ourselves.<br>
<br>
The sky was seemingly starting to darken, so we opted to go try some of <br>
the 'area' boxes and do some driving while the kids relaxed in the AC <br>
and watched TV (BTW, it has been awhile since I noticed/loved AC as much <br>
as after hiking several miles with kids in tow and then jumping into a <br>
cool car).  Hartx6 had invited us to dinner in North Branch so after a <br>
few finds we took him up on his offer...and just in time.  As we entered <br>
the restaurant, the skies opened up. "We did zip up the tent, right?!"  <br>
After 30-60mins of torrential rain (sometimes coming in nearly <br>
horizontal), the rain slackened.  At this point we were unsure if our <br>
campsite would still be there when we returned (Hartx6 recalled stories <br>
of gatherings past filled with tornadoes and naked DD).<br>
<br>
Fortunately, we had zipped up the tent and our campsite was rather dry <br>
(at least inside).  The kids zonked out after playing a bit more, and we <br>
followed soon thereafter.<br>
<br>
Given the long drive home, we packed our wet gear and started the long <br>
drive south...tired, but happy.  Sorry for the long report, but needless <br>
to say, a WONDERFUL gathering!  On another side note, our campsite <br>
letterbox turned out to be a very nice excuse to meet several new <br>
people....it is much easier to identify unfamiliar letterboxers as they <br>
were finding our letterbox!<br>
<br>
So, anyone volunteer for 2015?  It seems like IL might be up in the <br>
rotation...the Atomic Beans has formed an exploratory committee to do a <br>
feasibility study if no one has claimed dibs yet.<br>
