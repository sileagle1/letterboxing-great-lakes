Great food, great company and great boxing was the name of the day.  My kids <br/>
had a wonderful time learning to juggle (thanks Gooble Gobble!!), boxing and <br/>
basically running around with the other young boxers in attendance.  I had a <br/>
wonderful time seeing old friends, meeting new ones and stamping, stamping, <br/>
stamping!  My husband enjoyed his first gathering playing with the kids, <br/>
hiking the challenging trails and napping the afternoon away in the shade.<br/>
<br/>
I too want to add my many thanks to Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man for <br/>
everything they did to make this gathering the fantastic outing it was. <br/>
Just reading the clue sheets gives you a hint of how much time and energy <br/>
they put into this endeavor.  They prepared our donated boxes with such care <br/>
and obvious love for this hobby.  I am in awe.<br/>
<br/>
I also can't thank them enough for adding the Project Linus PLB information <br/>
to not just the web site but the postings preceding the gathering.  This box <br/>
is so near and dear to me and was received with such enthusiasm by this <br/>
group I was truly touched.<br/>
<br/>
Coming home with all your wonderful log-ins were two huge pieces of fleece, <br/>
nine skeins of yarn, a bag full of over 40 granny squares, a beautifully <br/>
quilted blanket by Kimono Girl and Flying Dragon and amazing crocheted <br/>
blankets by Kiddy Writer and Mrs. Doglvrs.  I am truly humbled by this <br/>
group's generosity.  The fleece will be made into blankets for donation by <br/>
my daughter and I.  Any yarn I haven't had a chance to crochet into blankets <br/>
before the next blanketeer meeting in July will be taken to the meeting and <br/>
snatched up faster than a new letterbox in northern Illinois.  Most will be <br/>
made into blankets that day.  Thank you all once again for your generosity.<br/>
<br/>
I too will be adding pictures to the photo section, including pictures of <br/>
the wonderful donations made to Project Linus.  Thanks again!!!<br/>

She gets pretty down when she has one of her exacerbations and can't<br/>

trails.<br/>

I know she said she spent the money she was saving for my anniversary<br/>

planned, but seeing her this happy is the greatest gift I could have<br/>

She's off taking my Grandmother to lunch getting her involved at the<br/>
Sr Center in Traverse today, so don't tell her I sent this, ok?<br/>
