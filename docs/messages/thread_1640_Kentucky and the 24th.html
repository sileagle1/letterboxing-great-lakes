                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well...this weekend I went to Louisville for<br/>
Lebowskifest...and found several local boxes with Luke<br/>
and Co. from South Bend. Louisville is a great city!<br/>
We loved their parks! First off we headed to Cherokee<br/>
Park to find the 2 Louisville boxes. Found the first<br/>
one after wandering for a bit...the second we are 85%<br/>
sure we found the right spot, alas the box was not<br/>
there. It was a great walk nevertheless by a beautiful<br/>
creek...and we decided to get some beverages after<br/>
that one, as it was blazin' hot! After some<br/>
refreshment we headed to the park where Bubbles Blue<br/>
was. Fun, easy find! We definitely wanted to check out<br/>
the whole Paranormal Researchers of the Ohio Valley<br/>
thing, as both Crystal of Luke and CO. and I dearly<br/>
loved Unsolved Mysteries...so we went looking for the<br/>
Thantoposis box. Another fabulous park and good find.<br/>
The log book was WAY creepy as was the cemetery. We<br/>
had one more clue....Crazy Cat...that we were initally<br/>
convinced that we'd never find. We had bought a good<br/>
map in order to find Thantoposis and after a good look<br/>
at the map realized that we COULD find Crazy Cat or<br/>
we'd die trying! Dave from Luke and Co. just rolled<br/>
his eyes as Crystal from Luke and Co. and I manically<br/>
searched for Crazy Cat. We did the happy dance when we<br/>
found that Crazy CAT even though both of us are<br/>
allergic to them! It was a great day for letterboxing<br/>
and Louisville is definitely our kind of place.<br/>
Yesterday was my one year letterboxing anniversary,<br/>
and we couldn't find the River View box to mark it! We<br/>
couldn't even find the park! So, my one year stats are<br/>
P 30 something, F 230 something, x seventy something,<br/>
misc 30 something. Here's to another great year of<br/>
letterboxing!<br/>

<br/>
There are times when I think that if our kids weren't quite so young <br/>
our stats would be higher, but we're having a blast finding a box or <br/>
two each weekend and enjoying the hobby.  This month marks our one <br/>
year anniversary as well.<br/>
