Tonight (Wauconda, IL) has been replaced.  A big thanks to those who <br>
let me know it had gotten wet and to the person who stayed there a <br>
while trying to let it dry out.<br>
<br>
I'm so glad it that everyone had so much fun finding it!  Thanks for <br>
all your notes!<br>
<br>
I've placed it back very nearby (just drier) and updated the clues <br>
online.<br>
<br>
Now, regarding All the World's a Stage 1: Kindergarten.  It is still <br>
there, but the trail is falling into disuse and has a dead tree that <br>
fell across it.  I just went there yesterday and it is in good <br>
shape, but be prepared to push through some over growth and step <br>
over a dead log. <br>
<br>
I'm researching whether the park district will be clearing the trail <br>
or if it is going to seed.  If so, I'll be relocating it in the same <br>
park.  Thanks for your patience and thanks to the person who warned <br>
me it had overgrown.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
