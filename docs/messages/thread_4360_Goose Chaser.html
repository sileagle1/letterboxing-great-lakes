                    <div class="plaintext-content">As some of you know a pioneer in letterboxing in the Quad City area <br>
was Goose Chaser. She planted nearly 20 boxes in less than a year and <br>
her carvings are among the best that I've found.<br>
<br>
Today is the one year anniversary of her death. You can check out the <br>
details on the tribute page on Atlas Quest. She was a wonderful woman <br>
and volunteered much of her time and resources to increase the <br>
enjoyment of others.<br>
<br>
Now a year after her death many still find her boxes, she left a <br>
legacy for us to continue to enjoy. Our very first stamp ever was a <br>
Goose Chaser stamp. And just last week we found the last two <br>
remaining Goose Chaser stamps that we had yet to find. <br>
<br>
A few of her boxes have gone missing, one in particular "Lincoln Park <br>
Art" -- we attempted to find this one on our first day of boxing and <br>
couldn't find it. Another boxer went to check on it and confirmed it <br>
was missing.<br>
<br>
This box has gone missing before, however, it was recovered. Now it <br>
has been gone for 9 months!!<br>
<br>
Today being the anniversary of Goose Chaser's death I wanted to stop <br>
and visit one of her boxes. I had planned on stopping at "Tom's Tale <br>
Tales" as there is a great view there and I could spend some time to <br>
reflect on Goose Chaser's life and contributions.<br>
<br>
I wont get a chance to stop by Tom's Tale Tales so I figured I would <br>
drive by Lincoln Park -- Though we never found the stamp I knew she <br>
was there and at one point her box was there.<br>
<br>
As I was leaving the park I saw a couple of grounds crew out and <br>
about and figured, "what the heck" so I stopped to ask the dreaded <br>
question, to which I already knew the answer "what are you talking <br>
about?"<br>
<br>
As soon as I asked one of them said, "oh with camo. on it?" and he <br>
went into the shed and produced Goose Chaser's "Lincoln Park Art."<br>
<br>
I am still doing my little happy dance. I am thrilled I was able to <br>
recover this box of Goose Chaser . . . on the anniversary of her <br>
death no less. <br>
<br>
On the inside cover the log book is written, <br>
<br>
"Fellow Letterboxers, this box was placed by Goose Chaser. She passed <br>
away on Aug. 13, 2006. Please guard this box with care and pass on <br>
this sad news.<br>
<br>
Thank you -- Goose Chaser's Family"<br>
<br>
We plan on doing just that! Thank you Goose Chaser for making my day <br>
on this sad sad anniversary.<br>

letterboxer!  I have never been to any of her letterboxes nor did I have <br>
a chance to meet her, but I see I have missed out for sure.  I hope that <br>
wherever she is buried, there is at least one box placed there so she <br>
can still enjoy the hunt and maybe even whisper, "not there---THERE!"  <br>
We should be lucky enough to have someone say such kind things about us <br>
after we are gone.  Thanks for sharing!<br>

Being fairly new to this group, and boxing itself, I was unaware of <br>
Goose Chaser's passing. The reason I am responding is because I have <br>
a hitchhiker of hers in my possession. I found it in Eagle, WI and <br>
was planning on moving it tomorrow to one of YOUR boxes (amazingly). <br>
I thought it would be fun to move it farther away, to Iowa, to help <br>
it on it's travels. <br>

return it to? <br>

Her family wished to have her boxes "retired" once they go missing. I don't  <br>

 least twice now makes me wonder if they would like it put back or find a new <br>

Either way, I'll leave it up to her family (who very well may want the box  <br>
back to be with them).<br>

I'll keep everyone posted on if it will go back out or not.<br>
