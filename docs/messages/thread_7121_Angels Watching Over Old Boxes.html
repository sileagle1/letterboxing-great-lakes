I was LBing in Door County Friday and Saturday, where I found a lot of the old LBs needed first aid - but in every case the original stamp was fine!  Way Cool!<br>
<br>
If anyone happens to have the clues to the second bonus box for the Sturgeon Bay Shipping Canal East Side LB, please send them to The Dragon (the box owner).  I had to replace everything but the stamp for bonus #1, and we want to include the clue for #2 in the new logbook.<br>
<br>
My favorite comments were in a box that Pugnasties were the first finders for - they noted that they beat WH and MM.  When WH and MM found it, one of them drew a "pfftt!" face that was for Pugnasties.  LOL!<br>
