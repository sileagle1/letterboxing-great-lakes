Late yesterday afternoon we went by the place where we just planted<br/>
Cemetery Stroll #4.  There were a number of cars in the area, with a<br/>
group of people gathered in the cemetery.  We thought it was odd to<br/>
have a burial on a Sunday afternoon.  As we got closer, we saw several<br/>
people standing amongst the gravestones wearing capes and greenish-<br/>
blackish makeup on their faces.  And another person or two with<br/>

Thanks for helping to get it back where it belonged.  It is <br/>
(supposed) to be hidden pretty deep in a hole--don't know why people <br/>
don't put it back as deep as they found it!  I have found it not so <br/>
well hidden several times.  In fact, I went to check on it earlier <br/>
this morning but couldn't as the cemetery workers were about 20 feet <br/>
away--i guess it is maintenance time for them too.  I walked right <br/>
past the spot and didn't see it laying on the ground, so I guess that <br/>
is good.<br/>
