Second, two more questions - I've seen a few posts on boxes in <br>

Next, does anyone from the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek area know if a box <br>
can be planted in Kellogg Forest? I saw several geocache plants there <br>
on their website and it seems like a great place for letterboxes - just <br>
wondering if there was a reason no one had put one there yet, as we <br>
seem to have several active boxers in our area (Yeah!)<br>

We have planted several letterboxes in the western suburbs of <br>
Chicago.  Some are planted on the periphery of the cemetery, but one <br>
is right in the middle.  We use trees, plants, rocks to hide our <br>
boxes--we don't plant them on an actual gravesite or use someone's <br>
gravestone or mausoleum as a hiding spot.  We have alot of old <br>
cemeteries near us, and it is fascinating to look at the old <br>
gravestones (plus there are usually lots of birds to watch, too).  <br>
The older cemeteries were originally designed to be parks as well as <br>
graveyards--families would come out from the city and spend the day <br>
at the cemetery and eat their picnic lunch, etc.  In the recent past, <br>
I have seen picnickers in one of the cemeteries where we have planted <br>
(they were even playing soccer).  Obviously, I don't think <br>
letterboxes in cemeteries are a bad idea, as long as they are done <br>
respectfully.<br>
<br>
If you are thinking of planting in an active cemetery, I would <br>
suggest that you include a note in the clues to be respectful of <br>
graveside services and to be on the lookout for cemetery workers. <br>

BirdWoman's comment about the people picnicing by the<br>

grandparents' graves - it was the weekend of a big<br>
Ohio State game, and there were a group of people, in<br>
their OSU garb, bundled up with a portable TV by the<br>
one grave, having a tailgate party with their deceased<br>
relative.  Quite an interesting sight....<br>

<br>
And with that said, I have a feeling that if the<br>
cemetery by you is like the big Catholic cemeteries by<br>
me, those signs might be more about what visitors are<br>
allowed to put by the graves.  No glass jars,<br>
Christmas decorations must be removed by March 15th or<br>
they're going in the trash, not allowed to plant<br>
personal plants around the graves, etc. etc.  Does the<br>
list of restrictions look anything like what's on this<br>
webpage?<br>
<br>
http://www.clevelandcatholiccemeteries.org/decoration_visitation_policies.html<br>
<br>
Now, if this is a functioning, well-maintained<br>
cemetery - Catholic or otherwise - even if you plant<br>
your box on the outskirts of the cemetery there may<br>
still be a chance that the maintenance crews find the<br>
box while doing landscaping.  <br>

Hmmmm....catholic cemeteries can be tricky. If it's the strolling through and looking around that you love -- why not send the seeker to the cemetery for informational clues, and then use those clues to hunt up the box in a nearby park.<br>
