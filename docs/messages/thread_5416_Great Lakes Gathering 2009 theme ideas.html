I believe there was mention in an earlier post about a theme tied to<br>
saving our parks. I love that idea! How about expanding that to be<br>
an overall "green" theme. Saving our open spaces and parks are a<br>
major component of a healthy, sustainable environment so the earlier<br>
parks idea would fall nicely within that and it would open the theme<br>
up a bit so there would be plenty of room for some great box ideas. <br>
I'm not thinking of a catchy one-liner, theme name at the moment<br>
though... <br>

Here's an idea.....we can carve all the stamps as line art so we won't have to do any hand coloring on the stamp...just bring one juicy green ink pad and all stamps can be stamped in green.  How simple would that be?  After the event, we could hand color the detail areas in our logbooks if we choose.  <br>
