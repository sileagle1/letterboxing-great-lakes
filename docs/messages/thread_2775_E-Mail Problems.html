                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been out of town for the weekend and returned to several messages <br/>
from people who have tried e-mailing me at the springchick a-t <br/>
letterbox-mi.com address and were not able to get through.  I tested <br/>
it out and it appears that this address indeed is not delivering me <br/>
the messages.  This applies to anything sent to an e-mail account at <br/>
the letterbox-mi.com domain (including 80days a-t letterbox-mi.com).<br/>
<br/>
I have sent a tech support ticket to my hosting service, but have no <br/>
idea when this will be resolved.  In the meanwhile, please send me e-<br/>
mail to letterbox a-t comcast.net.  If you have sent anything to the <br/>
other address in the past few days, I probably didn't receive it and <br/>
it will need to be resent.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the inconvenience.<br/>
