                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, as stated in a previous note, Skootch and I are planning trips this<br>
summer for letterboxing just for fun.  To geek out and plan our trips, I<br>
ordered a map of Omaha, NE so I can map out where we need to search for<br>
boxes (grouping them together so I can make a route and itinerary... I<br>
told you, I'm geeking out).<br>
<br>
Instead of a map of Omaha, I have now received the children's book,<br>
"Magic Rings and Funny Things".  It has a creepy clown lurking on the<br>
cover.  I have indeed contacted the seller and will remedy this, but in<br>
the meantime, I think I may just carve up a stamp for a box, which I<br>
think I shall name "Map of Omaha"... although it will be less fraught<br>
with 1970's child-angst as depicted in the book (creepy).<br>
<br>
Just wanted to share a (weird) part of our summer adventures in boxing. <br>
It's so safe compared with grade 4 stroller trails!<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

We use paper maps for an "overall view", but like to use the MS Streets &<br>
Trips software package (relatively inexpensive) for planning our LB trips.<br>
We electronically "pin" each box with box title and maybe another short note<br>
or two.  We sometimes even let it plan a route for us, using one of the<br>
features of the package.  We can print maps zoomed in or at any scale we<br>
want.  However we don't actually print as many now that we also use a GPS<br>
when driving on our adventures.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We also "geek out" when planning our trips and already have our route<br>
planned for a September trip (a loop through portions of Montana, North<br>
Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming) and a corresponding spreadsheet.  We also<br>
have our spreadsheet and pinning done for a May trip and Martini Man is busy<br>
mapping boxes for an Oct trip to Maine.  OH YEAH!  We are MORE than READY to<br>
hit the trails!!!!  Impatiently waiting for the trip to New Mexico next<br>
month....<br>
