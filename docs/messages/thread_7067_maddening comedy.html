                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, as stated in a previous note, Skootch and I are planning trips this<br/>
summer for letterboxing just for fun.  To geek out and plan our trips, I<br/>
ordered a map of Omaha, NE so I can map out where we need to search for<br/>
boxes (grouping them together so I can make a route and itinerary... I<br/>
told you, I'm geeking out).<br/>
<br/>
Instead of a map of Omaha, I have now received the children's book,<br/>
"Magic Rings and Funny Things".  It has a creepy clown lurking on the<br/>
cover.  I have indeed contacted the seller and will remedy this, but in<br/>
the meantime, I think I may just carve up a stamp for a box, which I<br/>
think I shall name "Map of Omaha"... although it will be less fraught<br/>
with 1970's child-angst as depicted in the book (creepy).<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share a (weird) part of our summer adventures in boxing. <br/>
It's so safe compared with grade 4 stroller trails!<br/>

We use paper maps for an "overall view", but like to use the MS Streets &amp;<br/>
Trips software package (relatively inexpensive) for planning our LB trips.<br/>
We electronically "pin" each box with box title and maybe another short note<br/>
or two.  We sometimes even let it plan a route for us, using one of the<br/>
features of the package.  We can print maps zoomed in or at any scale we<br/>
want.  However we don't actually print as many now that we also use a GPS<br/>
when driving on our adventures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also "geek out" when planning our trips and already have our route<br/>
planned for a September trip (a loop through portions of Montana, North<br/>
Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming) and a corresponding spreadsheet.  We also<br/>
have our spreadsheet and pinning done for a May trip and Martini Man is busy<br/>
mapping boxes for an Oct trip to Maine.  OH YEAH!  We are MORE than READY to<br/>
hit the trails!!!!  Impatiently waiting for the trip to New Mexico next<br/>
month....<br/>
