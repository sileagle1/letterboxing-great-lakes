   ----  A grandpa in a Speedo (Ewww...nothing against grandpas or Speedos, but in this case they should not have been one and the same.)<br/>
<br/>
   ----  A nude (male) sunbather!  (Yikes!  And he was lying on his back!)<br/>
<br/>
   ----  The "rescue" of a duffel bag from the lake which contained what appeared to be the belongings of a homeless person (all sorts of strange odds and ends: fake holly, windchimes, candles, mismatched drapery panels, t-shirts, a baby blanket, ads for psychic readers, a chain letter, etc.).  Kind of sad...hopefully the owner didn't undergo the same fate as the bag.......<br/>

   ----  The nude sunbather...again!  (and there were LOTS of people walking around too!)<br/>

Back to boring Suburbia........  Thanks for the adventure, AB!<br/>
