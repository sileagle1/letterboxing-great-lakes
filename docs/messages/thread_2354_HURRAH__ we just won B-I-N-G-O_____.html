We can only hope.  In any case, Congratulations!<br>

Who is the lucky winner of the side wager?<br>
<br>
Spring Chick, this has been a wonderful way to keep us chatting and hoping through long <br>
winter days.<br>
<br>
azobox, thanks for keeping our minds sharp and amused with the clues to trail names.  I <br>
bet we might see some of these cryptic monikers popping up in mysterious clues in the <br>
future.<br>
