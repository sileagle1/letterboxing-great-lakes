are still out there boxing.  Was disappointed we didn't get to meet <br/>
at last year's gathering, but hope we will do so this year!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome!<br/>

&gt; Hello list!<br/>
&gt; Everything moves so slowly in my house.  I got this invite for <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; group a while ago, and just this instant had any time to accept <br/>
it.  <br/>
&gt; Yay!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Brief Intro:  I'm Delirium, live in SE Michigan, and have been <br/>
letter <br/>
&gt; boxing with my husband and daughter for just about two years now.  <br/>
In <br/>
&gt; fact, our first letterboxing trip took place when the baby was 18 <br/>
&gt; days old.  I am an enthusiastic boxer, but dreadful at actually <br/>
&gt; locating them.  Thank goodness for the better half, who usually <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; find what I'm missing.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had to miss the Gathering last year (argh!), but am bound and <br/>
&gt; determined to make it this year.  Anything I can do to help, <br/>
please <br/>
&gt; let me know!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
&gt; Delirium<br/>
