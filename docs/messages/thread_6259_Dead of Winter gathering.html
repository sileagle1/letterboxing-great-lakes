A big thanks to GGGHiker and her crew for organizing a fantastic gathering today! The nature center was the perfect place for our group... and to imagine it was once a private summer home - wow! It was neat to explore all the rooms and find boxes throughout. The screen porch fireplace was a nice touch, too.<br>
<br>
It was cool to have just a few boxes out on the trails... I don't think Little WoodChuck's legs would've lasted on any hikes beyond what we did. We laughed when we arrived at WiHi/MM's "Seclusion" box at the same time as 4 other groups -- all part of the fun! Great to meet several new faces and see many familiar ones.<br>

No doubt ggghiker is not reading any of these posts...she worked so hard today, we are certain she is sound asleep...We really hope she made it out of the building before the alarms went off!  She can go to sleep tonight knowing she did a GREAT job of hosting a delightful event. We've never seen an event where the planner is both hosting a LB event AND working as a diligent volunteer at the same time - very impressive!  (Ditto to TJMich's nod to the fireplace and facility!)  Thanks ever so much ggghiker for providing a day in which we could all revel in the fun, food and friendship!  Job well done!<br>

socialize mid-winter AND be able to get out on a nice loop trail for some<br>
winter scenery.  ggghiker had everything covered, including a way for us to<br>
print clues for boxes we had just hidden that morning.  Definitely a "full<br>
service" location!! She was everywhere making sure everything went smoothly.<br>
The nature center was great - roomy enough for the "mini" group of 50+<br>
boxers in the main room, with the added attraction of the outdoor porch and<br>
fireplace and the other various rooms that allowed people to spread out &<br>
explore.  This was especially popular with the kids in attendance.  As at<br>
all other LB events, the potluck food was great and we had the bonus<br>
opportunity to purchase some farm-fresh eggs from Terrio.  It was also nice<br>
to meet a few people we hadn't met before - they all seemed like fellow<br>
addicts (... I mean enthusiasts!).<br>
<br>

Oh, and that chicken dance was a new initiation rite for Great Lakes<br>
letterboxers, although next time I think it will be the ROOSTERS who need to<br>
perform instead of the hens!<br>

<br>
Thanks gghiker for a fun day and we're glad to hear you're already planning<br>
a sequel!<br>

today, we are certain she is sound asleep...We really hope she made it out<br>
of the building before the alarms went off! She can go to sleep tonight<br>
knowing she did a GREAT job of hosting a delightful event. We've never seen<br>
an event where the planner is both hosting a LB event AND working as a<br>
diligent volunteer at the same time - very impressive! (Ditto to TJMich's<br>
nod to the fireplace and facility!) Thanks ever so much ggghiker for<br>
providing a day in which we could all revel in the fun, food and friendship!<br>
Job well done!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We add our thanks to ggghiker and her able assistants.  What a wonderful center--ideal for our group. Thanks to those who planted on the trail--WI Hiker, Martini Man, and Atomic Beans--the beautiful walk was one of our favorite parts of the day and your boxes, as always, were delightful. Thanks also to those who planted in and around the nature center--some very clever and some very beautiful stamps.<br>

We loved talking to old friends and meeting new ones.  And we appreciated the opportunity to size up the Olympic competition--this may be more difficult than we thought, but we're up for the challenge. The Swedish team should not sell itself short; perseverance is a virtue. The greatest oak was once a little nut who held its ground.  <br>

I wonder if the chicken dance is a winter event?<br>
