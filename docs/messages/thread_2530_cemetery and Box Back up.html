&gt; It is good to know other people placed boxes in cemeteries. I didn't <br/>
&gt; know if it would offend people. I'm glad, they are usually very <br/>

The cemeteries near us date back to the 1800's.  In earlier times, <br/>
families would take the train out to the cemeteries and make a day of <br/>
it--packing their picnic lunches, etc (almost like a trip to the park <br/>
for us).  I figure that if they could be used for recreation at the <br/>
start of their existence, then why not continue that.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe in treating the cemeteries and their residents with <br/>
consideration, though.  For instance, I wouldn't plant the box under a <br/>
marker or in a mausoleum (unless it was a family member, maybe).  So <br/>
far, we've done historical topics for our boxes (like the circus train <br/>
wreck in our Showmen's Rest box)--and I try to be respectful of the <br/>
people involved.  There is one box I would love to do, but I fear it <br/>
wouldn't be very respectful (although the story is fascinating):  one <br/>
of Liz Taylor's husbands is buried in our neck of the woods.  A number <br/>
of years after his death, graverobbers dug up his body, presumably <br/>
looking for jewelry.  They never did find the culprit--although they <br/>
did find the body to rebury.<br/>
