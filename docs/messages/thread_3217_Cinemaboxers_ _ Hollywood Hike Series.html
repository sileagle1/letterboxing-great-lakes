<br/>
TO: Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man:  I know you had a great weekend if you went in search of Cinemaboxers' "Hollywood Hike" letterbox series.  After searching for those boxes, I would just like to say that this series has so many outstanding aspects to it!!!  The stamps are masterpieces!!!  The location has so many beautiful sights.  The clues are well written.  <br/>
<br/>
I encourage everyone to plan a day and drive to find this series....and bring a camera!!!  <br/>

  No, I sent her a note last weekend, but haven't heard anything back.<br/>
  Perhaps they are on vacation?? We did their great "Hollywood Hike" last<br/>
  Saturday.<br/>
