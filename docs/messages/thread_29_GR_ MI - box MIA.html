my Kent Trails box so I could change out the freezer ziplock bag.<br>
<br>
Bad news is that we found it MIA... completely missing. No box, no <br>
baggies, no stamp or logbook turned up in a search of the general <br>
area. I will be replacing it, but due to the high traffic in that <br>
area, I may need to adjust it's placement a bit.<br>
<br>
Clues will be updated on LbNA and my own site as well.<br>
<br>
The good news is that we scouted out several great spots to put the <br>
Fate of Easter series, so look for that soon.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
