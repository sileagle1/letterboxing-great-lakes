&gt; We did take our previous dog on many letterboxing trips.  He loved to <br/>
&gt; hike - and except for getting foxtails and burrs in his coat, it was great <br/>
&gt; fun.  He was a papillon - and he died during a dental procedure in <br/>
&gt; February, due to a problem with the anasthesia.  We've been devasted.  I <br/>
&gt; really didn't know how hard it would be to lose a dog - he was my baby. <br/>
&gt; So, noving on, we are looking at a new papillon.  Hopefully the breeder <br/>
&gt; will like us and we will like the dog!  She looks cute!  And is an active <br/>
&gt; girl.  Her dad is a champion agility dog.  Good for hikes and <br/>
&gt; letterboxing!  Here she is:<br/>
