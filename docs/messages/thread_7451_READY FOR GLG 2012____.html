very excited for all the enthusiastic 'boxers who are coming!<br>
<br>
Are you sitting around this weekend wishing you could have carved a stamp<br>
for the event?  Never fear, there's still time!  We've extended our box<br>
deadline to May 15th and would love to have even more great contributions.<br>
Please contact either myself or the Verona Bird Patrol and let us know what<br>
will be coming.<br>
<br>
Remember that the theme is cartoons or drawings, so there is plenty of<br>
fodder for great stamps.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing you all there!<br>
