                    <div class="plaintext-content">We think it is a bad idea to put a pen or pencil inside a baggie - they<br>
often puncture the bag and in your case it sounds like they broke the<br>

We just had to restock our maintenance supplies in our pack after our recent<br>
trip to NY.  We added or replaced numerous baggies & logbooks in boxes that<br>
needed them and used our spare box to replace a very lightweight container<br>
that was cracked/shattered. Over the years we've found that it is also good<br>
to carry a good supply of napkins for drying out boxes!<br>

So I eventually get to the Lakeshore Lights LB - the sun finally came out<br>
just before I got the box! - and I replace the box itself. The location is<br>
lovely, by the way. Then I go on to the next Manitowoc location - I leave<br>

Thank you so much for taking care of the maintenance on the Lakeshore Lights LB.  I felt bad that I couldn't provide all the TLC the LB needed.  I appreciate you taking the time to finish it.<br>
