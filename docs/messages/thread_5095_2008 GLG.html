                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to send out a "Thanks" to everyone who organized this <br/>
wonderful gathering.  Jason &amp; I absolutely loved the park. We came up <br/>
early on Friday to get Gooble's series so we got to enjoy two days <br/>
exploring the trails.  And although my legs are crying now from <br/>
climbing up those hills - I am so very glad that we made the trek out <br/>
to MN for this one.  <br/>
<br/>
We got so involved with the actual boxing this year that we missed out <br/>
on the group lunch &amp; picture and only got to do a couple exchanges, but <br/>
we found almost every box in the clue packet in addition to the Snow <br/>
Friends series and Gooble's series.  We probably could have found them <br/>
all, but at about 5:30pm on Saturday we decided to call it quits.  We <br/>
were both too exhausted and just wanted to hit the hot tub at the <br/>
hotel :)<br/>
<br/>
But it was really nice to get back on the trails with all you wonderful <br/>
folk!  We got to box alongside a couple groups - the Papeseed &amp; <br/>
Triclops group, TJMich &amp; company, the Leapin Lizards/Dragon crew - <br/>
which is always a fun experience.  Usually Jason &amp; I box alone so it's <br/>
a nice treat for us to box with a group. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all involved with the gathering.  We really enjoyed <br/>
ourselves and hope to see you all on the trails soon. <br/>

Oh yes, I think Red Cat has it.  Her dad asked if we knew who it <br/>
belonged to.  We guessed it was either someone in the Papeseed group or <br/>
Pugnasties, since you both are from the GB area.  I suggest you send <br/>
her an email to check on it.<br/>
