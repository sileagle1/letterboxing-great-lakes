I loved all three of those series - read every book I could get my hands on<br>
from friends and the boys next door!<br>

<br>
I remember when my grandmother gave me my dad's set of Hardy Boys books -- <br>
that was in the late 60's/early 70's so many of them were probably the<br>
original printings...  but they are long gone, probably sold by my mother at<br>
a garage sale for a quarter each -- oh well at least some other kid got to<br>
read them.<br>
<br>
How about the Happy Hollisters?  Anyone else read those (am I dating myself<br>
here)?  They were my favorites -- about a family with a bunch of kids (5 I<br>
think) that went to cool places on vacation and came across mysteries to<br>
solve.  I have slowly been collecting these books over the years as I see<br>
them reasonably priced at flea markets and on E-Bay, etc.  Have been<br>
thinking it would make a cool letterbox series (so many ideas, so little<br>
time...  I should have been a teacher ;-)<br>

When I was a pre-teen/teen, they came out with the Nancy Drew Files, new Nancy Drew mysteries that updated Nancy.  My aunt used to buy them for me by the handful for birthdays and Christmas.  Those were my equivilant to her Harlequin Romance novels.  Ahh, and I remember how I started to do a "happy happy joy joy" dance in Border's a few months ago when I saw a display that Trixie Belden books were resurfacing.<br>
 <br>
Maybe that's the common thread between the techies & the teachers...our love of mystery-solving & clue hunting!  <br>
 <br>
And speaking of Nancy Drew...do you know about the Nancy Drew Letterboxes?  I found this page surfing one day:<br>

 <br>
I learned to read on the Happy Hollisters!  They were my  sister's books, but <br>
I borrowed all of them and actually missed the characters  and stories when I <br>
ran out of new books to read.  Natalie I started over  and reread the series. <br>
 When I taught school I wanted to read them to  my class.  Called my mother, <br>
another set sold into slavery at a garage  sale!  We didn't have the Web back <br>
then.  Good idea to hunt them  down.  I can't find anyone who has ever even <br>
heard of them.  Nancy  Drew and the Hardy Boys were great for older kids, but <br>
the Happy Hollisters met  the voracious appetite of the young reader!  Make a LB <br>
series out of those  kids.  They were much like us, finding mysteries while <br>
on vacations.   They deserve a comeback<br>
