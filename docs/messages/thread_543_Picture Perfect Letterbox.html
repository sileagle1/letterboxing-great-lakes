In response to the question in this forum about the<br>
Picture Perfect Letterbox:<br>
<br>
1.  The box was checked today.  It is intact and<br>
in-place.<br>
2.  The box is hid in a very wooded area and is<br>
difficult to bushwack to.<br>
3.  The final paces count is based on a man with<br>
around a 2.5 to 3 foot stride.  If you think you've<br>
gone far enough, try just a little bit farther in case<br>
your paces aren't as big.  <br>
4.  We checked all of our boxes in Southeast Wisconsin<br>
today.  All are intact and in-place.  <br>
<br>
Happy Boxing,<br>
<br>
Agent Ink and Z-fan<br>

strides!  The box is in a great place and well hidden from view!<br>
