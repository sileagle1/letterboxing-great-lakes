The woman driving the car was (Mrs.) JACKS' mother.  Here is an update on her mom's status and a request for something we can all do to help.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to thank you all once again for all your good wishes.  I'm finding it comforting to go through my e-mails.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As of this afternoon my mother is still in ICU and is slowly being taken off of sedation.  Due to the snowstorm we had Friday I didn't <br/>
go to the hospital but I went down this morning and she looked much better than Thursday.  Her eyes are open but she is still not able to <br/>
respond due to the sedation she is still on.  I talked to her for a bit and kept my father company for a bit more.  He spent yesterday and today at the hospital and is going into her room for small intervals throughout the day.  She is still not out of the woods but we are keeping our thoughts positive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My mother received 16 units of blood on Thursday.  This blood saved her life.  So many of you have asked what you can do for us during this difficult time.  I'm hoping to encourage any of you who can to find a couple of hours this holiday season to donate blood.  I know this is an activity we may all put off until after the holidays but this is a time when donations are low and accidents still happen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you all once again for the thoughts and prayers you've been sending our way in the past few days.  They are felt, and appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
