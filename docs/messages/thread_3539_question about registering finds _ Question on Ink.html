Side note to Dragon's response. The green flags next to the clues on <br>
the LBNA website only appear if you become a member. Membership is <br>
free you just have to give your Email address, Trail name and <br>
password -- then you will see the green flags.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm kinda new as well, started Nov. 25, 2006. My black ink is <br>
already running a little low on my ink pad. <br>
<br>
All of the ink pads I looked at said to buy ONLY the same brand ink <br>
as the brand of ink pad to "re-fill it." Is this the case? Or will <br>
any brand ink do. Or is it just a ploy to get us to buy more of the <br>
same brand?<br>

As long as you use the same type of ink (pigment, dye, etc.), you <br>
should be ok, especially because black is an easy color to match up.  <br>
For other colors, I would probably buy the same brank re-inker just <br>
to be sure it was the same color.<br>
