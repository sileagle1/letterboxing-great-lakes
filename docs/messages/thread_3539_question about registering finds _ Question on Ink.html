&gt; If you are doing in on LBNA, just click the green flag next to the<br/>
&gt; name of the box you found and that will take you to the page to log<br/>
&gt; your find.  AQ has something similia - on the clue page of the box's<br/>
&gt; clues there is a link to click there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We just started this yesterday and I do not know where and if we <br/>
need <br/>
&gt; &gt; to register the letterboxes we found. I saw something about it <br/>
but now <br/>
&gt; &gt; I can't find it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your help!<br/>

Side note to Dragon's response. The green flags next to the clues on <br/>
the LBNA website only appear if you become a member. Membership is <br/>
free you just have to give your Email address, Trail name and <br/>
password -- then you will see the green flags.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I'm kinda new as well, started Nov. 25, 2006. My black ink is <br/>
already running a little low on my ink pad. <br/>
<br/>
All of the ink pads I looked at said to buy ONLY the same brand ink <br/>
as the brand of ink pad to "re-fill it." Is this the case? Or will <br/>
any brand ink do. Or is it just a ploy to get us to buy more of the <br/>
same brand?<br/>

As long as you use the same type of ink (pigment, dye, etc.), you <br/>
should be ok, especially because black is an easy color to match up.  <br/>
For other colors, I would probably buy the same brank re-inker just <br/>
to be sure it was the same color.<br/>
