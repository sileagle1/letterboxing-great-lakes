                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, on my way from WI -> MI, I stopped in Homewood, IL to pick up <br>
a few newly planted I-94 Traffic Crawl boxes.  I was excited by all <br>
of Tiptoe & Tonto's boxes.  "Big Hole" sounded interesting because <br>
I've driven by that quarry often and the chance to explore it a <br>
little more was enticing.<br>
<br>
I found the ball park, made it to center field and enjoyed the view <br>
of the quarry and I-294 (quite a sight!).  I then found the box in a <br>
very neat hiding spot and stamped in.  While closing up the box, a <br>
pickup pulled up to the gate and a guy hopped out and unlocked it.  <br>
I was 20-30 yards away from the hiding spot, so I quickly stuffed my <br>
markers, the box, and my gear into my backpack while the truck drove <br>
up near me.  The truck had the Quarry logo on it and a man stepped <br>
out and asked how I was doing.  I told him things were great and <br>
that this was quite a view.  He just kind of stared at me for a <br>
while.  I then asked him a couple "quarry questions" (when was it <br>
started?, etc.) and we chatted for a bit.  After a couple minutes he <br>
told me this area was private property and that the Director of <br>
Security for the quarry was coming around to give a tour and <br>
wouldn't be happy if I was around.  I told him that I'd take off.  <br>
As I was leaving, I could see him open up a gate to an overlook of <br>
the quarry that they were apparently using for the tour.  Earlier, <br>
the guy had told me that the overlook was closed off because of <br>
vandalism.<br>
<br>
I needed to keep going east so I kept the box in my pack while I <br>
quickly found "The Compleat Angler", dropped off the "Treetops" <br>
hitchhiker, and kept heading east to my destination.  (I picked up <br>
SpringChick's "Welcome to Michigan" box along the way.)<br>
<br>
So now I'm in Pittsburgh (after a night in MI) and will mail the box <br>
back to Tiptoe & Tonto.  I'll let them decide what to do with it.  <br>
It was a neat spot and hopefully something can be done.<br>
<br>
It was my first run-in with security personnel while <br>
letterboxing ... not terribly exciting, but interesting nonetheless.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh my! We sure didn't think this "Big Hole" box would cause such a <br>

letterbox going on sabatical to Pittsburg over the weekend.  We <br>
posted the missing box on LBNA ASAP...Unfortunately, two new <br>
letterboxers that we had introduced to this great pastime of ours <br>
had printed the clues earlier in the week and had not gotten the <br>
revision...Oops!  Did they have a tale to share with me when we all <br>
returned for the first day of school!....Apparently, M Clan ran into <br>
the Material Service Corp. security, but these two gals ran into the <br>
Thornton police!  Questioning what they were doing....they just flat <br>
out told the officer all about letterboxing (potential <br>
newbie?)...They didn't think they explained it very well..He told <br>
them to "Well, just do what you gotta do quickly and be on your <br>
way."  They were feeling really stupid as the clues are very <br>
forthright and the box just wasn't there...They weren't amused to <br>
find out that "Big Hole" was enjoying a great vacation out east with <br>
M Clan!  They returned to their car with their perverbial tail <br>
between their legs!<br>
<br>
For the record, I've written for permission to replant at the site <br>
and I'm contemplating making a visit to the police station!  What we <br>
will go through just to plant a tiny camo tupperware!  But, all of <br>
this does make us think about the resemblance of our benign hobby to <br>
more covert activities.  After all the same parks, reclusive nature <br>
spots, etc. that attract us also are appealing for others to carry <br>
on with dangerous, illegal or even criminal activities.  It is rare <br>
to find a woods, lake or park that has not been altered by the <br>
debris left strewn about by partying types. It is a given that we <br>
share the trails and public spaces with their ilk...And now with <br>
heightened security measures being taken around public venues we are <br>
even more likely to be targeted as suspitious characters...Now, some <br>
of us are indeed characters...but I'm thinking it might be helpful <br>
to share ideas that other letterboxers use to not "look" so <br>
suspitious....Personally, we like the "Birding-geeky" look, or <br>
the "Official data-collecting-clip board-carrying naturalist" <br>
look....any others?<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is why it's good to go letterboxing with the dog.  Aina's bright orange backpack might make us stand out like sore thumbs, but everyone's so distracted by her and her pack that no one notices what we're doing over there on the side of the trail.  And if someone does notice anything suspicious, we can always claim to be training her for something.<br>
