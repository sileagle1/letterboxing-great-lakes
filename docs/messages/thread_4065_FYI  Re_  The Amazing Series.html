better copy them anew!  All the boxes are alive and well after some <br>
serious maintenance today and some of the clues had to be altered.  In <br>
fact box number 5 is in a completely different place due to Mother <br>
Nature's restructuring the location and some park signs being changed.  <br>
Don't you hate when they do that? :-)  Enjoy!<br>
