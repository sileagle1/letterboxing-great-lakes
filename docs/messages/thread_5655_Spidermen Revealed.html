<br>
<br>
<br>
Many thanks to Beetle and Lock, Shock & Barrel for organizing a great gathering today! Everyone was decked out in their beads and there were many VERY creative floats in the parade. We saw lots of people busily stamping the stamps that were cleverly included with the floats, or otherwise available throughout the afternoon.We enjoyed catching up with several of our long-time LB friends and also had a chance to chat with a few new addicts such as Tat2Bob & Kimberly and Terrio. However we somehow missed Popcorn Lady who we really wanted to meet! (I counted a total of 14 attendees from Wisconsin and she is the only one we still haven't met.)After lunch, Lock gave an interesting presentation on carving and then it was back to socializing and stamping. One of the newest additions to the Great Lakes LB family was in attendance, but even with all the noise, the littlest Christmas Elf managed to snooze her way through most of the afternoon. We also saw some spirited dancing by two boys in Spiderman outfits and some of the other kids were decked out in jester hats and feathers in addition to beads.A waitress was kind enough to serve as photographer and she willingly took a group photo with probably a dozen different cameras. Tomorrow I'll try to get a bunch of photos posted from the event.Thanks again to the hosts and to everyone that attended! Wisconsin Hiker & Martini Man<br>
