the two.  No, there's no danger of an explosion.<br/>

  I used a Q-Tip to wet the surface of "The Pink Stuff" with acetone <br/>

soon as the surface looked dry I placed the laser printer image on the <br/>
wetted surface, placed a sheet of paper over that and then the hot iron <br/>
on top for maybe 30 seconds.  When I pealed off the printer image there <br/>
was a perfect copy on "The Pink Stuff". <br/>

acetone method, too, and were just contemplating new and better ways <br/>
to get that image to actually transfer. We'll give your method a <br/>
whirl and report back on results!<br/>
