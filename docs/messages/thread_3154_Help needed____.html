are in NJ, so we don't know too many 'boxers in OH.<br/>
<br/>
In honor of mystery day, I planted a box while visiting OH <br/>
recently.  We were ostensibly out there to visit my aunt, who is <br/>
currently fighting cancer, and I had dedicated the box to her.  I <br/>
was surprised by the interest she took in it, and she is eagerly <br/>
awaiting its first visitors.  So I wondered if some boxers in NE <br/>
Ohio could help me out!  The clue is here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br/>
boxnum=26109&amp;boxname=Friend_and_Foe<br/>
<br/>
It is also listed on Atlas Quest.  I don't think the clues are that <br/>
hard, esp for someone who lives in that area, but heck, I'll even <br/>
help out if things aren't dead obvious after a little searching on <br/>
Google.  All I ask is that people who visit the box leave her a <br/>
little note in the logbook.  It is nice to see her so excited about <br/>
something, and I know that the 'boxing community is a very generous <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help with this little project!<br/>

visit it one of these days.  <br/>

Hmmm, maybe I can convince Deedle to go for a drive<br/>
when he gets home from the monster convention he's at<br/>
this morning.  Only fair, right?  He's indulging one<br/>
