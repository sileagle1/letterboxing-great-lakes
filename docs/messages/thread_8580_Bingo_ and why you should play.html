Maybe you haven't played before, and you are wondering what this is all about.  So, I'll tell you.<br/><br/></div>1. Find the BINGO 2018 folder in the file section on the Yahoo group's page: <br/><br/><a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LBGLK/files/Great%20Lakes%20Letterbox%20BINGO%21/2018%20BINGO%20Game/">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LBGLK/files/Great%20Lakes%20Letterbox%20BINGO%21/2018%20BINGO%20Game/</a><br/><br/></div>2. Open the word list file and note all the boxes, events, and boxers you might have found, attended, or met.  <br/><br/></div>3. Put together a BINGO grid using the boxes, events, and boxers you've met, and then fill in with any general terms.<br/><br/></div>DO NOT WORRY if you rely heavily on the general terms.  Many past winners have won using a large amount of general terms.<br/><br/></div>4. Send me your card, log your name in the database section, send in your booty, and then sit back and wait for the game to start.<br/><br/></div>OK, so now you've entered..NOW WHAT!?!<br/><br/></div>5. You will find that there is nothing better than crossing off a called word from your list. And if not, the hope that it might be tomorrow is a nice thought to warm you through winter.<br/><br/></div>6. As people get their first words called, its common for there to be notes of excitement and relief.<br/><br/></div>7. Then, after what seems like a much too long of a time, others will post disappointment that they still don't have any words crossed off their lists.<br/><br/></div>8. A word will get called, that you were sure was on your list...or maybe one you changed at the last moment. DOHT!<br/><br/></div>9. Meanwhile, there may be some nonsensical posts...this year by BaliWho, which you will eventually realize is some sort of code for sidewagers.<br/><br/></div>10. Tiptoe will mention that she's in the running for the Biggest Loser.<br/><br/></div>11. Wisconsin Hiker may note some random BINGO stats about words called or how much of the card is typically filled by this point (Oh NO! am I suppose to do that this year?).<br/><br/></div>12. You quietly realized you might actually win one of the intermediate games.<br/><br/></div>13. You do not win the intermediate game you thought you might win.<br/><br/></div>14. Tiptoe assures everyone that she will be Biggest Loser although ArtGekko may refute her claim.<br/><br/></div>15. Spring approaches and you start realizing that you'd rather be boxing vs just posting about it...but you also note that you will try to find a few more boxes to bulk up your BINGO card for next year.<br/><br/></div>16. Someone wins..and while you post your congratulations, you secretly are annoyed for those last few words you put on your card, vs the other ones you had considered.</div><div><br/></div><div>17. For the few winners, a few weeks after the game starts, you get a package of booty and goodies in the mail.</div><div><br/></div>In short, its a fun way to pass winter so fill out a card!<br/><br/></div>Cards are due Sunday with booty to follow.<br/><br/></div>Good luck,<br/><br/></div>A of Atomic Beans<br/></div>
