                    <div class="plaintext-content">Checked my "Milwaukee Neighborhood" box tonight and it was alive &amp; <br/>
well and in good shape.  A few people had logged it as "Attempted" <br/>
but as many of us know, this does NOT necessarily mean a box is <br/>
missing.  This is especially true if it is a "mystery" type box. I <br/>
know that at least one of the persons that logged an "Attempt" was <br/>
actually a few miles away from the correct location.<br/>
<br/>
6 groups have found the box in the 8 months it has been there, but <br/>
all 6 visited within the first 2 weeks of it being placed!  It's been <br/>
lonely for a while, so if you have been delaying hunting it down due <br/>
to the "Attempted" reports, have no fear - it IS there!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I just received an email saying my "Who Is It?" <br/>
box might be missing - Darn!  I'll try to check it out in the next <br/>
few days.<br/>
<br/>
Also checked on my "Picnic in the Capitol" box last weekend and it <br/>
had migrated from its original spot, but was still in the general <br/>
area.  I put it back in the correct spot.<br/>
<br/>
My "Door County Tradition" box was in fine shape on June 24.<br/>
<br/>
I will probably be slightly relocating my "Playing Possum" box in <br/>
McHenry, IL this weekend since I have had several reports that <br/>
a "Restricted Area" is now posted on your way to the box.  I'll <br/>
announce an update when I write some new clues, so DON'T go looking <br/>
for this one Saturday or Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
That's it for now...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm very relieved to report that my "Who Is It?" box is in fine shape. <br/>
(It is one of my favorite stamps, so I was dismayed to hear of its <br/>
possible demise!)<br/>
<br/>
However this is another example of a box that is MUCH harder to find in <br/>
the summer.  It was placed in February so there wasn't any undergrowth <br/>
to contend with, not to mention additional trimming discards that don't <br/>
even belong there...  This means you'll need to be a dedicated searcher <br/>
or you may want to wait until late fall when things aren't so thick!<br/>
<br/>
The box has been found by 5 groups so far.<br/>
