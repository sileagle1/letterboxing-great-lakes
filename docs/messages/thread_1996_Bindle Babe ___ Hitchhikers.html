AQ.  I think Ryan has put a tremendous amount of effort into building<br/>
that site and I always try to appreciate the volunteered time and work<br/>
given to benefit others.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it's true, I am a registered user at AQ.  For personal and<br/>
sentimental reasons, I wanted to receive a particular Postal<br/>
Letterbox. Registration on AQ was a requirement by the box owner for<br/>
obtaining it.<br/>
<br/>
I have no intention of ever registering any of my Hitch Hikers<br/>
anywhere but at Pete and Wanda's site.<br/>
(http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/travelers) This choice is my way of<br/>
honoring them for all of their volunteered time and personal<br/>
commitment, freely given to us boxers, in hosting the HH tracking page.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, my personal perception of Letterboxing.org is that the<br/>
site is mainly for listing clues to letterboxes.  Since HH's don't<br/>
normally have clues, I personally see no reason to list them on<br/>
Letterboxing.org <br/>
<br/>
For my letterboxes (not HH's) my published clues will continue to be<br/>
listed at Letterboxing.org or on my Yahoogroup <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxing_bindlestiff/) and nowhere<br/>
else. <br/>
<br/>
In the aprox 2 years that I have been boxing, I have placed over 100<br/>
boxes (some are retired and some WOM only boxes)  As someone who<br/>
recently placed their first box, I'm sure you can calculate the effort<br/>
you put into your box multiplied times 100+ boxes and see that it<br/>
represents not only the original financial investment but also a<br/>
significant investment of time and energy; especially as every single<br/>
one of my boxes contains a hand carved stamp, and the majority of them<br/>
also have a handmade logbook. <br/>
<br/>
For myself, (and as you, a letterbox owner, will soon see) simply<br/>
placing a box does not end the responsibility nor investment of time<br/>
required  there is time needed for maintenance of the box, sending<br/>
replies to emailed box reports - requests for hints - complaints about<br/>
vague clues - etc,  not to mention keeping clues current by updating<br/>
them if the landmarks or terrain used are changed or the box is<br/>
verified MIA. <br/>
<br/>
Oh dear, a box is confirmed MIA  now you have to post the MIA notice,<br/>
recarve, rehide, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I am not willing to devote any more time in duplicating my<br/>
work and listing boxes plus clues at yet another site.  (AQ)  I hope<br/>
that after reading the above information, you can understand that.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that the Letterboxing.org site has continued to evolve<br/>
since I began boxing and that there are more features being added all<br/>
the time.  I'm not particularly in favor of some of those features but<br/>
I try not to sweat the small stuff.  Let me tell you, the features of<br/>
a website that offers me a high-profile, free place to post clues to<br/>
my boxes and also provides the ability for seekers/finders to contact<br/>
me; definitely falls into the category of stuff not to worry about,<br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
I think most of my HH's logbooks contain an email address for the<br/>
finder to use if they wanted to contact me. So if one of my HH's ended<br/>
up in another state, or country (!) I'd be thrilled to either get an<br/>
email from the finder/driver or to see that kind of update on Pete and<br/>
Wanda's site.  Do I think it "would be nice if the new finder could<br/>
list them among their finds at Atlas Quest" --- no.  And I say no<br/>
because, I don't feel anyone's ability to track their finds online<br/>
should be my responsibility.  It's my personal belief that we are all<br/>
responsible for keeping track of our finds.  This is what I, and many<br/>
others use a logbook for.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to track all your finds online, I'm afraid you're bound<br/>
to be disappointed.  There will always be boxes for which there are no<br/>
on-line clues; (for whatever reason .. I can think of several right<br/>
off the top of my head) so your online count, using AQ or<br/>
Letterboxing.org is forever bound to be inaccurate.<br/>
<br/>
If keeping an absolutely accurate online count is important to you,<br/>
may I offer a suggestion? You could get your own web page or start<br/>
your own yahoogroup and list all your finds there. <br/>
<br/>
Let me be the first to offer you congratulations on your first placed<br/>
letterbox (Paul Bunyan's Baby Blocks) and welcome you to the "other<br/>
side" of letterboxing.  Yeah! Cheers!!  I hope you will enjoy it and<br/>
find as much pleasure in being a letterbox placer, as I have.<br/>
<br/>
With regards to your announcement of your first box and that you had<br/>
placed my Christmas Swish Tree HH within it, I wish you hadn't posted<br/>
that part.  HH's are traditionally considered a surprise, and by<br/>
posting that your box contains a HH, especially naming the HH, you've<br/>
taken away the "surprise gift" aspect of the whole HH concept.  Does<br/>
that make sense to you?  <br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug has put quite a lot of work into providing a comprehensive<br/>
website of valuable information for letterboxers.  Here is the link,<br/>
if your interested: (www.letterboxing.INFO)  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; Why do you prefer not registering some of your Hitchhikers and<br/>
LBoxes with Atlas Quest or Letterboxing.org ?  I notice that you both<br/>
are listed as members with Atlas Quest, but until recently neither<br/>
"The Wandering Rocker" or the "Christmas Swish Tree" was registered at<br/>
either website. <br/>
&gt; Suppose one of your Hitchhikers ends up in California or Hawaii or<br/>
Florida or Arizona for the winter. Wouldn't it be nice if the new<br/>
finder could list them among their finds at Atlas Quest. If you took<br/>
the time to register as a member of Atlas Quest why not take the time<br/>
to register your LBoxes with AQ? In general are LbGLK members<br/>
boycotting AQ, and if so WHY?<br/>

Obviously if you have your email listed in the HH it would explain how to find you. We've come across some that do and some that don't and I just assumed obviouly wrongly that it wasn't listed.<br/>
<br/>
As a newbie your email also explained  why clues are listed on some sites and not on others which I didn't really understand now completely do.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all the information in the email. Now I have some new spots to go check out too. LOL<br/>
