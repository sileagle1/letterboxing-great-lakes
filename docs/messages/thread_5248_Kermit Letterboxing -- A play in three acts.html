Warning:  Language, stupidity.<br>
*<br>
Act I:  Initial mis-reading of the clues*<br>
<br>
*Scene I*<br>
K:  Huh.  10 paces at 100 degrees leads me into the middle of a field.  Box<br>
can't be here, can it?.....<br>
*{pause}*<br>
K:  Oh, I'm supposed to start over THERE.<br>
<br>
*Scene II*<br>
K:  OK.  10 paces at 100 degrees now has me in front of this tree.  There is<br>
nothing else around.  Just a tree.  In the middle of a field.<br>
*{stares hard at tree}*<br>
K:  Maybe it's up there, in that hole there in the trunk.<br>
*{continues to stare at tree.  Tree is frustratingly unresponsive}*<br>
K:  How high up do you think that is?  Ten feet?  Twelve?<br>
*{shuffles through clues to see if placer has indicated that they are eight<br>
feet tall}*<br>
<br>
*Scene III*<br>
*{mother and two small children are now staring at Kermit as she stares at<br>
an unresponsive tree}<br>
{Kermit notices}<br>
{exeunt stage left, away from tree, back towards the middle of the field,<br>
trips over nothing, nearly stabs self through spleen with compass}<br>
{children in stitches as mother herds them away from crazy lady}*<br>

*Act II: Our heroine discovers another clue within the clue*<br>
<br>
*Scene I*<br>
K:  OK.  10 paces at 100 degrees from HERE is where the box should<br>
be........stupid box......*<br>
{aims compass in a chillingly dispassionate fashion}*<br>
*{compass indicates a path straight through heavy undergrowth up a steep<br>
hill}*<br>
K:  Dammit!<br>
*{fifteen minutes of thrashing through underbrush, returning frequently to<br>
start point to see if 100 degress magnetic has changed in the past few<br>
moments}<br>
*<br>
*Scene II**<br>
{incipient madness due to lack of box-finding}*<br>
K:  Perhaps all these random golf balls lying here in the brush are a<br>
clue?????<br>
<br>
*Scene III*<br>
*{pause}*<br>
K:  Oh, wait...maybe I'm supposed to start down THERE...<br>
<br>
*<br>
Act III:  The triumph of persistence, the folly of delay*<br>
<br>
*Scene I*<br>
*{Kermit discovers a hollow log 10 paces away at 100 degrees}*<br>
K:  Ha!  Damn right!  Letterboxing queen right here, bitches!  Yeah!.......<br>
*{stick inserted into hollow log reveals no letterbox}*<br>
K:  What the.......?<br>
*{turns slightly to her right}*<br>
K:  Oh, sweet merciful Zeus, NO!<br>
*{discovers only the lid of a Tupperware container.  Alone.  On the ground.<br>
Covered in camo duck tape.}*<br>
<br>
*Scene II*<br>
*{clutching the remains of a muggled letterbox to her chest}*<br>
K:  I need to see if I can find any other remains.  Maybe the stamp<br>
survived.....<br>
*{digs through the undergrowth}<br>

two years ago!}*<br>
K:  WHOOOHOOOO!!!!<br>

Unfortunately we could also be the leading characters since your saga sounds just like one of our hunts in Massachusetts yesterday!  The clues had an "easy" way and a "harder" way.  Somehow we managed to do both, and added a LOT of additional difficulty when I was SURE those huge rocks WAY up that REALLY STEEP slope were the 3 white-faced sisters we were looking for... NOT!<br>
<br>
Luckily we had the same happy ending as your adventure.<br>
