Exchange project and about the image collection for those who <br/>
participated.<br/>
<br/>
Just to give you an update...<br/>
<br/>
-  I have put together a web page that lists all of the boxes in the <br/>
exchange here:  http://www.stampinthebox.com/projects/exchange05.asp<br/>
<br/>
-  Finally all of the boxes have arrived at their recipient, <br/>
although a few remain to be planted.  Thanks to those who responded <br/>
to my e-mail queries...  I appreciate the updates!<br/>
<br/>
-  I have a draft of the image collection and will be contacting <br/>
those who did not submit an image to verify if this was an oversight <br/>
or if they preferred not to be included before finalizing it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for participating in this exchange -- it was a <br/>
lot of fun and I look forward to the next one...<br/>
