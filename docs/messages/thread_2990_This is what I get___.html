instead of letterboxing; 50 messages to read through<br>
today!  Rather than send a bunch of separate emails<br>
I'm going to respond in "digest form":<br>
<br>
- Welcome again to all the new list members, and esp.<br>
to ScoutDogs also, who we've met once or twice<br>
(everything kind of blurs together) and who helps add<br>
to our Ohio list membership.  I think part of the<br>
reason there seems to be a lack of Ohio members on our<br>
list is because most Ohio boxing takes place south of<br>
Columbus, and they may associate with that river more<br>
than the lake? :)  For those of you who are new, a<br>
while ago I created a just-for-fun location map at<br>
frappar ( http://www.frappr.com/letterboxinggreatlakes<br>
- the link is also in the links section of our yahoo<br>
group) to get a general idea of where people on this<br>
list are located.  So if you want to represent your<br>
hometown, add yourself to the map!  (Or if you're<br>
moving, update your location? <br>
<br>
- Which segues me into, first everyone's having twins,<br>
and now everyone's relocating - what IS in the water<br>
in our great lakes? :)  Good luck to all of you<br>
moving!  <br>
<br>
- Letterboxing.org versus AQ for posting clues - our<br>
trick is that we host our clues on our personal<br>
geocities webpage, then post that link at<br>
letterboxing.org & AQ.  That way, if we need to update<br>
our clues, we only have to update the clues on our<br>
website.  As long as we haven't changed the link, we<br>
don't need to update anything at the other two sites. <br>
<br>
<br>
- And lastly, I admitt it, we are one of those 7 Holy<br>
Grail boxes still lagging to be planted.  Now, I know<br>
where I want to plant it, the perfect spot, just<br>
haven't had a chance to make the drive out there - and<br>
then a week ago Deedle commented, "I think that's<br>
private property."  So now I have to research to see<br>
if it IS and/or find a new perfect spot.  Sorry for<br>
the delay!  The goal is to get it planted by Labor<br>
Day...<br>
<br>
And that's all for now...<br>
