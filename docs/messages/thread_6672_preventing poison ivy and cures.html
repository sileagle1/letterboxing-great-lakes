                    <div class="plaintext-content">OH WOW, I took a look at this link and I think the "poison Ivy" I had last summer was actualy a Wild Parsnip burn. <br>
<br>
I see this plant all over, my leg looked like the photos shown, and it didn't go away in the normal poisin ivy's 2-4 weeks but after 8 weeks of pain (not really itching, but skin sorness) it took an additional 3 months for the scabs to heal up and I only just noticed in the last month that the "scaring" is fading (11 months) I think I have some real scars from it where my pant legs would rub on it and didn't allow the skin to heal, but at least the redness is now going away. <br>
<br>
THANKS!... I'll be more careful now. <br>
