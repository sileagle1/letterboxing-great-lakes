If you pin down a specific date in May 2008 we could probably attend. <br>
 <br>
Rumor has it there will be a gathering in Iowa (east/central) this October,  <br>
but the organizers are being hush hush about it. Keep your ear close to the  <br>
ground, you may hear more later . . . but I can't promise (as I am not in the  <br>
loop).<br>

leading to some of the most beautifully carved stamps I've seen yet. <br>

Doctors B went beyond the call of duty with the beautiful carvings they<br>
created AND placed. These are works of art and humbling to behold. The event<br>
itself was a nice, low-key affair that allowed us to meet some new folks as<br>
well reconnect with old friends and find some outstanding letterboxes. We<br>
had a great time hunting down some of these awesome boxes with a group of<br>
good sports as well as the most energetic and good-natured four-year olds I<br>
have had the privilege to box with (and if I got their ages off, mea culpa).<br>
They were into it!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Decorah itself is a great place to visit and now it is a HOT bed of boxes!<br>
Thanks again to the Doctors B. A fabulous labor of love.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Our warmest regards<br>

I just wanted to give a great big "thank you" to the Doctors B for an <br>
awesome gathering on Saturday!! It was so well organized, with tons of <br>
amazing boxes, great food, great prizes, and some wonderful bagpipe <br>
music to end our day. The clues were nice and straight to the point, <br>
leading to some of the most beautifully carved stamps I've seen yet. <br>
And to add to my excitement I got my 100th find that day too!<br>
<br>
I had a great time seeing familiar faces, meeting some new people and <br>
finally catching some that I always seem to miss. Thanks again for a <br>
job well done. <br>
