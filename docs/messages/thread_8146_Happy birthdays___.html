<br>
Thanks for the birthday wishes and we hope you all had a very nice Easter!<br>
<br>
As some of you know, my mom broke a small bone in her foot 2 weeks ago and can't drive for a while.  So we are down here in Florida helping her out for several weeks.  It was a pretty hot Easter here, with temperatures near 90 degrees.  Luckily we've been ale to hit the pool every day and yesterday we went to a nearby state park where a gathering was held a few weeks ago.  Great trails and lots of great stamps.  We plan to return next weekend to find more of the boxes there.<br>
<br>
Good luck to all of you in the Bingo game - only 44 more words to be called....<br>
