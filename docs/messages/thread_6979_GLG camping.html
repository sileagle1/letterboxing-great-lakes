don't think there's going to be a GLG area of the campground.  the GLG activities will be at the organizational campground (see map), though.  however, mr. park ranger person has been very accommodating and amiable, and i'm sure if we do need a GLG section, we'll be able to make one up on the spot.<br>

I tried to create a database file so we could track where everyone was staying (campsites or hotel names), similar to what we did in previous years.  However we are apparently at our limit (10) of databases.  Perhaps the one from last year, or some of the Bingo files could be deleted to make space for new files???

For anyone interested in hotels....I was able to get the Holiday Inn Express in Wixom for $36 per night on priceline. First bid went through, so someone else may even get it for a lesser rate. Standard rates at that hotel begin around $85/night. Obviously not a 4* place, but I doubt we'll spend much time there other than sleeping anyway. Love priceline for getting great rates!<br>
