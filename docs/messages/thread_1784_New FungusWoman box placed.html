Anyway, Little Box on the Prairie 2 has been placed at the Wolf Road <br>
Prairie in Westchester, just down the road a stretch form Meadow Walk <br>
and Field of Dreams.  Remember - those prairie plants are protected by <br>
law, so tread lightly.<br>

New improved stamp (must admit, the previous was one of the most <br>
shoddy ones I'd ever carved), new clues, new location.  And the box is <br>
