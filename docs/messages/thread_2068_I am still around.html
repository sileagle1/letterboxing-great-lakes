changes! I moved back to Michigan a couple of months ago to go back <br>
to school full time. I don't have any intensions of moving anytime <br>
soon, so I will be around for a while this time. :-) As soon as I <br>
get some time, I plan on planting about seven or eight new <br>
letterboxes. They are all finished just need to find time to plant <br>
them. Talk to you later,<br>
