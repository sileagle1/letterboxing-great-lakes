                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last week's T-shirt discussion prompted me to place an order of a <br>
few Silent-Doug designed goodies from CafePress, including a T-<br>
shirt, a coffee mug and a license plate frame.  Today the goodies <br>
arrived...  I love them and can't wait to show them off!<br>
<br>
One thing I did want to pass along that took me by surprise, and <br>
frankly was a bit of a disappointment...  The URL printed on the <br>
items is not www.letterboxing.org (the LbNA site), rather it is <br>
www.letterboxing.info (Silent Doug's site).  I wasn't sure how I <br>
could have missed that so I went back to look at the items I ordered <br>
and the pictures are so small that although you can see there is a <br>
URL, and you can deduce the word "letterboxing" it would be <br>
difficult to see that the domain is .info instead of .org unless you <br>
know it is.  The one item that you can see the text clearly -- the <br>
box stickers, which I did not order, but did view at the time I was <br>
ordering, actually does say letterboxing.org.  So my own fault, I <br>
made an assumption that was the URL on all of the items.<br>
<br>
It is a little disappointing because I would hope to catch some <br>
people's attention and possibly lead them to check out the web site <br>
for more information.  While it is true that Doug's site does give a <br>
lot of great information, I would have preferred to direct people to <br>
the official LbNA web site.  And being honest, I guess as the web <br>
person behind my own letterboxing web site, it seems a bit strange <br>
to be walking around with the URL to somebody's personal <br>
letterboxing site that is not my own.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Doug please don't be offended -- you know I love you dearly <br>
and I think your site is certainly one of the best 'boxing sites out <br>
there.  I was just surprised...  But hey after all, you designed the <br>
merchandise, you are free to put whatever you want on there, <br>
including promoting your own site.  The stuff is cool anyway and I <br>
will use it proudly.  Thanks!  <br>

I am sorry about your disappointment, but completely understand. I was <br>
concerned that people would be offended if I used the letterboxing.org URL, <br>
since some folks on the big list are sensitive about the appropriation of <br>
anything related to LBNA and letterboxing.org (not to mention the flak I <br>
get if I ever mention my site on the list). But your point is good, and I <br>
think I will make some changes based on your comments to make it clear <br>
about what's on the items (such as in the description text), or maybe add <br>
some LBNA logo items (at cost, of course, as their guidelines do allow) to <br>
give people a choice if they'd rather not have the .info domain on items.<br>
<br>
(And personally I'm grateful for the graceful way that you wrote your <br>
message, which is in stark contrast to a lot of the a bit <br>
less-than-pleasant tone of way too many posts on the big list, IMHO. On a <br>
related note, I'm finding that a lot of the conversations in the regional <br>
letterboxing groups are much more interesting and friendlier than the main <br>
LBNA list, and so I'm pleased that you set up this group....)<br>

I agree with your observations about the tone of this list.<br>
I periodically check in 'over there' to get a feeling for what's <br>
currently on people's minds. But there seems tendency for responders <br>
to jump in quickly with both feet.<br>
Your gracious acceptance of Deb's comments speaks volumes.<br>
Thanks for contributing your thoughts here.<br>

Hadn't thought about some of what you said -- that some folks might <br>
actually be offended if it was the letterboxing.org URL.  I suppose <br>
there is always somebody who wants it one way or the other.<br>

Glad you like our list... Glad to have you around.<br>
