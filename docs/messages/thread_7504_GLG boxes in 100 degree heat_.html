                    <div class="plaintext-content">Seconding that recommendation. Did them last Sun-Tuesday and Sunday evening when we started it was in the 90's and I was drenched in sweat that night. The next 2 days were reasonable temps (70's) and it is strenuous hiking in some spots. Lots of rocks and tree roots. Loads of fun though! <br/>

Please, please, please reconsider!<br/>
My hubby is in EMS (Emergency Medical Services) and the number of calls he has responded to recently is astronomical.  People are not aware they are in trouble with the heat until medical help is required (which is sometimes too late).<br/>
Yes, we are all addicted to letterboxing, but the boxes will be there later.  If you miss one or two, so be it.<br/>
Better to lose out on a few boxes than to lose you, your hubby and your little 2-year old.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can totally attest to the fact that you never realize you're in danger until it's too late. I've suffered heat exhaustion 5 times in the last 8 years working at the Renaissance Faire and you will think you're fine 1 minute and be on your butt in serious danger the next. It is not worth the risk! And if you're considering doing the boxing at night, to avoid the heat, don't! Those trails can turn ankles in broad daylight! Just have patience and wait for later in the season when it's cooler. You'll be less likely to bump into muggles that way too.<br/>
