  B and I stopped at Michael's last night and, as usual, I started <br>
  searching for good logbooks to place in boxes. I usually strike out in <br>
  this quest, but for once, I found perfect books! They are small enough <br>
  to fit in a gladware/tupperware container, have blank pages, and even <br>
  have a little matching pen. And the best part? They are $1/each. I'm <br>
  not sure if these were available at just our Michael's or if they are <br>
  available at every store, but it might be worth checking out. They are <br>
  in the $1 bins/sale items near the checkout. We stocked up on them... I <br>
  hope everybody else can, too; they are quite the deal!<br>
