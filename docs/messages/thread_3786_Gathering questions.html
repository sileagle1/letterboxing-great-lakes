have some questions!<br>
<br>
Are people camping Friday night, Saturday night or both?<br>
<br>
I see on Atlasquest a listing of boxes in the area.  Do people <br>
generally search for those on the day of the gathering or <br>
before/after the actual day?  Do you generally search with other <br>
people at the gathering or just with your normal "search party"?<br>
<br>
Are there one-day-only boxes planted for the day of the gathering <br>
(and if so, how do you get the clues for them?)<br>
<br>
As far as the 50's theme... do people dress to match the theme?  Or <br>
is it mostly for event boxes/letterboxes that fit with the theme?<br>
<br>
I've never been to a gathering so, I'm just trying to get an idea as <br>
to what happens at these things.   Thanks for any insight!<br>

All of the above!  Most of the campers will be camping Friday night with an oatmeal breakfast tentatively planned for Saturday morning.  Many of the campers will stay Saturday as well and some of us are even thinking about camping out on Sunday as well (makes for a nice long weekend, with more opportunities to 'box).<br>

I would strongly recommend searching for these boxes either before or after the gathering itself.  There will be so much going on at the gathering that you'll go crazy if you try to find all the available boxes on one day!  These listings are mostly there for the convenience of people who are coming from out of the area and may not be back again anytime soon.<br>
<br>
>Are there one-day-only boxes planted for the day of the gathering <br>

Yes!  There are likely to be one-day-only boxes on the clue sheets that will be distributed at the gathering, WOM boxes, and special event boxes just to name a few.  Some of the clues will be out in the open, and some you will just have to be clever to figure out for yourself (it's a good rule of thumb to keep your eyes and ears open at any gathering).<br>
<br>

It is mostly for event boxes/letterboxes...but if you can hike in a '50's costume (or don't plan on hiking much) go for it!  <br>
<br>

The best piece of advice I have to offer is to prioritize before you get to the gathering.  Don't try to do it all, unless you like loosing your mind!  The GLK gathering is HUGE! and it can be overwhelming even for those of us who have several gatherings under our belts.  Usually your best bet is to decide if you want to hunt for letterboxes or socialize and try to spend the majority of the time doing the one that you have decided is more important to you.  Since we are usually coming from several hours away (and I have a horrible memory for faces and names!), we tend to focus more on finding boxes.  Others really look forward to meeting other letterboxers and renewing old friendships and don't care if they never get out on the trails.<br>

camp at one of the Alum Creek State park campgrounds<br>
(they have 2 camping areas) you have to reserve a<br>
minimum 2 nights on the weekends - either Friday &<br>
Saturday or Saturday & Sunday.  For more info on<br>
reserving a campsite at Alum Creek, search for message<br>
10556 in the group's archives.  The majority of boxers<br>
camping at the park are staying in Area 1, but there<br>
are also some boxers who reserved spaces in Area 2.  <br>
<br>
If you book a campsite at Alum Creek, feel free to add<br>
