Regarding a Friday night gathering, I immediately think of 3 restaurants <br>
that each have a reasonably priced fish boil dinner. I will check out the <br>
prices for a group for Friday night. Since you don't enjoy eating fish, I do <br>
know that these three places that I'm thinking about also serve other <br>
food...so you won't starve.<br>

I'll be going up to Door Co. in a few weeks. We've been going there 1-3 times a year for the past 15 years, so I know the area and the businesses well.  For the gathering, we will most likely stay at The Wagon Trail Resort from Friday - Sunday.  <br>

Dragon doesn't like to eat fish. You don't either? This is fresh fish; no <br>
smell. It's so delicious. I'm checking into three locations for fish boils <br>
and they also serve other entrees. Maybe an evening campfire too. I'll be <br>

  Dragon doesn't like to eat fish. You don't either? This is fresh fish; no<br>
  smell. It's so delicious. I'm checking into three locations for fish boils<br>
  and they also serve other entrees. Maybe an evening campfire too. I'll be<br>
  going to Door county in a few weeks so I agreed to check out some Friday<br>
  evening activities.<br>

Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving<br>
safely in an attractive and well preserved body, but rather to skid in<br>
sideways - red wine in one hand - chocolate in the other - body thoroughly<br>
used up, totally worn out and screaming "WOO HOO, What a Ride"<br>
<br>
I firmly believe in this, and did my part by drinking red wine and eating<br>
chocolates at a very nice free outdoor concert with 9 other friends tonight!<br>

Well I certainly don't want you to order a fish boil dinner and eat anything<br>
'unhealthy" like cherry pie. So, in the interest of your good health, I'll<br>
eat that nasty homemade cherry pie for you. I'll extend the offer to anyone<br>
else who really doesn't want their cherry pie either. LOL!<br>

P.S. A fish boil is DELICIOUS and fairly healthy (except for the dessert<br>
part....)<br>

I am willing to TRY a fish boil, but in case I don't care for it I'd<br>
appreciate a restaurant with other choices. I do like fish occasionally but<br>
usually baked (healthy) or fried (yummy!). BOILED fish just sounds weird to<br>
me!<br>
<br>
So is someone carving a "Fish Boil" stamp???<br>
