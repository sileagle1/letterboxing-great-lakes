                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many times, Sylvie-Rose has invited me to join her at the Ren Faire. (Wrenches never take "nay" for an answer.)  So I replied "yay."  But I can't go in my modern clothes!  Ah, but Sylvie-Rose has some garb for me to wear.  But I'm not sure what my faire name should be and I haven't given any thought to my persona.  For you see, I'm a Ren Faire virgin; this will be my first time.   Since many of my friends, both old and new, will be gathering at the faire this weekend and I'm not working, this will be a special opportunity for me to experience the magic.  I will meet you on the grassy area near the town square pub on Saturday.  <br>

  Should we make a group (or two) of it? Sylvie-Rose and Beetle would <br>
  like to join, and I'll ask Howling Coyote if she wants to bring her <br>
  LB kit along. <br>
<br>
  It's going to be a great weekend, with temps below 80!<br>
<br>
  Sylvie-Rose was thinking we could all meet in the grassy area near <br>
  the town square pub (can't miss it, it's the huge 4 story building <br>
  when you head up the hill towards "town") around 1:30.<br>
<br>
  Just a warning - it doesn't seem like Dragon was able to track down <br>
  all the letterpeople to give them their stamps before he went on <br>
  vacation, but I know at least 2 have them!<br>
