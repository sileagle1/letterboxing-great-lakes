   <br>
  I think I recounted almost every tale and topic to Jeff when I got home. I'll get him into a gathering person yet.... I hope.<br>

  Trying to keep my focus and continue to work on my big project. It was exciting to hear what others thought. <br>

  Thanks again for all the help and suggestion and a great time.<br>

What a wonderful time I had on Saturday!  It was small, yes - but lots got <br>
accomplished!!<br>
I carved only 1 and 1/2 stamps (I was going for 9) - but I got as much <br>
talking done as I possibly could!  (always my favorite part of a gathering)  <br>
I got to hold a baby, I filled up a logbook on one of my postal boxes, AND, <br>
I got to hear the voices of some of my dearest friends from across the lake! <br>
  WooHOO!!  : )  ("Is this a video phone?")<br>
<br>
I would just love to make this an annual event - the snow tends to get me <br>
down when it drags on...we could think of it like "Mid-winter break" -- what <br>
fun!  I'm happy to host it too!<br>
<br>
Thanks for making an otherwise gloomy Saturday a bright spot in my February!<br>

making the first Gathering that "Smart Cat" attended a fun time. (2yr <br>

interested in the pizza than anything else. LOL <br>

Sorry we couldn't stay for more than our little "pop-in" but it was <br>
nice to see some GL boxers. I didn't check our bag yet, but I don't <br>
think the cootie went out with us!<br>
