daughter and I found it last spring.  We had printed up more clue sheets for <br/>
other nearby boxes, but enjoyed Ft. Sheridan so much that we just spent the <br/>
rest of the afternoon there, walking around, taking pictures, and letting <br/>
the dogs play in the water.<br/>

Today, I followed up on a tip from a letterboxer that my Ft. Sheridan Lb <br/>
might be missing. I am sad to say, it IS gone! This area along the beach has <br/>
been remote and unused for decades. Now that the Lake Country Forest <br/>
Preserve has purchased many of the acres in this area, the beach has become <br/>
populated with 'partiers'....which is obvious by the large amount of debris, <br/>
alcoholic beverage containers, cook out leftovers, and piles of burned wood. <br/>
What a mess that beach has become in one short year!<br/>
