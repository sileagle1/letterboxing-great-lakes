                    <div class="plaintext-content">I saw that! It was a bit different, to say the least.  Don't know who was scarier, the pirate lady or her counterpart -- the oraganizer lady.  Randy took one look at her labeled plastic bins and said, "hey look, it's you!"  I beg to differ -- I may have labels on all of my art supplies, but I have NEVER labeled my underwear drawer or my children (well, at least not physically).  Although it is mindless entertainment, I find that show fascinating -- mostly that there are so many eccentrics out there and so many completely different lifestyles within the realm of "normal" (exactly where is that line anyway?).<br>
