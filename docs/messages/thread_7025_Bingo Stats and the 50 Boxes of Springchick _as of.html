                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we are officially 3 months done with bingo. Want to know how you're doing? Here are the stats.<br/>
<br/>
There are 135 terms<br/>
45 are letterboxes<br/>
25 are trail names<br/>
15 are events<br/>
50 are general terms<br/>
<br/>
of that:<br/>
<br/>
34 of the letterboxes have been called. (76%)<br/>
18 of the trail names have been called (72%)<br/>
9 of the events have been called (60%)<br/>
35 of the general terms have been called. (70%)<br/>
<br/>
Of the columns called:<br/>
<br/>
B: 20 terms (@21%)<br/>
I: 22 terms (@23%)<br/>
N: 14 terms (@15%)<br/>
G: 20 terms (@21%)<br/>
O: 20 terms (@21%)<br/>
<br/>
...which comes out to about 19 words per column.<br/>
<br/>
AND...about 70% of all terms have been called, which means if you have 70% of your card filled, you should have 18 squares.<br/>
<br/>
Of the letterboxes called:<br/>
<br/>
MI-UP: 3 (@9%)<br/>
MI-LP: 4 (@12%)<br/>
OH:    6 (@18%)<br/>
IN:    6 (@18%)<br/>
IL:    4 (@9%)<br/>
WI:    6 (@18%)<br/>
MN:    5 (@15%)<br/>
<br/>
Which means most of the letterboxes called have been from Ohio, Indiana, and Wisconsin. If both the Upper and Lower Penisulas of Michigan were combined, they would represent @21% of boxes, but, being a Michigander (and yes, it's GANDER, not Michiganian...that's a dirty word), we know that you're either a YOOPER or a TROLL. Sorry Illinois, but you're not doing to well. Just like the president...you're down in the polls. lol<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, if you're betting on N words, keep wishing. It seems that the N words are bad (go figure) and the events from that column are even worse (O events called).<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the events that have been called:<br/>
<br/>
2 from MI (@22%)<br/>
1 from OH (@11%)<br/>
1 from IN (@11%)<br/>
3 from IL (@33%)<br/>
2 from MN (@22%)<br/>
AND O from WI! Oh wait, that's because those WI boxers aren't hosting. What's up with that? Darn Cheeseheads! (just kidding!)Those Illinois boxers just love their events though, don't they?<br/>
<br/>
Of those boxers, we've seen lizards leaping, beans from that Japanese nuclear power plant, a bunny that gave us a full moon, some old poop (probably from that bunny), a team with awesome pants, terrorists from Boston, a green turtle (maybe he's the one who left that old poop?), an Angel that winks and another Angel who is a doglvrs, a frog, a wind jammer, someone who isn't content to party with just six, Choi (is that like tea?), an Egyptian beetle, The Queen of MahJongg, a Ford, Sunday Morning, and Springchick!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Springchick, that 50 Boxes of Springchick game is STILL going! Come on people! Is ANYONE going to win this game? Seriously, there are only 14 words left to be called. Did you all get together and pick the SAME terms? Honestly, I thought this game would be done at the beginning of March. Anyhow, it's goping top be a photo finish...and remember....there is only ONE winner for the 50 Boxes of Springchick! So, should we take bets on who it will be? Here are the players for that game:<br/>

&gt; Well, we are officially 3 months done with bingo. Want to know how you're<br/>
doing? Here are the stats.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are 135 terms<br/>
&gt; 45 are letterboxes<br/>
&gt; 25 are trail names<br/>
&gt; 15 are events<br/>
&gt; 50 are general terms<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of that:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 34 of the letterboxes have been called. (76%)<br/>
&gt; 18 of the trail names have been called (72%)<br/>
&gt; 9 of the events have been called (60%)<br/>
&gt; 35 of the general terms have been called. (70%)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of the columns called:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; B: 20 terms (@21%)<br/>
&gt; I: 22 terms (@23%)<br/>
&gt; N: 14 terms (@15%)<br/>
&gt; G: 20 terms (@21%)<br/>
&gt; O: 20 terms (@21%)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ...which comes out to about 19 words per column.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; AND...about 70% of all terms have been called, which means if you have 70%<br/>
of your card filled, you should have 18 squares.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of the letterboxes called:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MI-UP: 3 (@9%)<br/>
&gt; MI-LP: 4 (@12%)<br/>
&gt; OH: 6 (@18%)<br/>
&gt; IN: 6 (@18%)<br/>
&gt; IL: 4 (@9%)<br/>
&gt; WI: 6 (@18%)<br/>
&gt; MN: 5 (@15%)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which means most of the letterboxes called have been from Ohio, Indiana,<br/>
and Wisconsin. If both the Upper and Lower Penisulas of Michigan were<br/>
combined, they would represent @21% of boxes, but, being a Michigander (and<br/>
yes, it's GANDER, not Michiganian...that's a dirty word), we know that<br/>
you're either a YOOPER or a TROLL. Sorry Illinois, but you're not doing to<br/>
well. Just like the president...you're down in the polls. lol<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, if you're betting on N words, keep wishing. It seems that the N<br/>
words are bad (go figure) and the events from that column are even worse (O<br/>
events called).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Speaking of the events that have been called:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2 from MI (@22%)<br/>
&gt; 1 from OH (@11%)<br/>
&gt; 1 from IN (@11%)<br/>
&gt; 3 from IL (@33%)<br/>
&gt; 2 from MN (@22%)<br/>
&gt; AND O from WI! Oh wait, that's because those WI boxers aren't hosting.<br/>
What's up with that? Darn Cheeseheads! (just kidding!)Those Illinois boxers<br/>
just love their events though, don't they?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of those boxers, we've seen lizards leaping, beans from that Japanese<br/>
nuclear power plant, a bunny that gave us a full moon, some old poop<br/>
(probably from that bunny), a team with awesome pants, terrorists from<br/>
Boston, a green turtle (maybe he's the one who left that old poop?), an<br/>
Angel that winks and another Angel who is a doglvrs, a frog, a wind jammer,<br/>
someone who isn't content to party with just six, Choi (is that like tea?),<br/>
an Egyptian beetle, The Queen of MahJongg, a Ford, Sunday Morning, and<br/>
Springchick!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Speaking of Springchick, that 50 Boxes of Springchick game is STILL going!<br/>
Come on people! Is ANYONE going to win this game? Seriously, there are only<br/>
14 words left to be called. Did you all get together and pick the SAME<br/>
terms? Honestly, I thought this game would be done at the beginning of<br/>
March. Anyhow, it's goping top be a photo finish...and remember....there is<br/>
only ONE winner for the 50 Boxes of Springchick! So, should we take bets on<br/>
who it will be? Here are the players for that game:<br/>
