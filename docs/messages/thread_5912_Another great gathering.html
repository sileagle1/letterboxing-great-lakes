And thanks to everyone who came for helping to make it such a great weekend. Flying Dragon and I just got home. The dogs are pooped! We all had a great time this weekend. The weather was a bit dicey Friday night and maybe a little iffy at times on Saturday but it held and was really quite beautiful for hiking and camping. The mosquitoes were biting but they weren't too bad. We only saw one tick all weekend (on Aina during the car ride home). And the stamps were beautiful! We got all of the event boxes in the park except for one (and we would have found that one too if Atomic Beans hadn't beat us to pulling it on Sunday) and even got a few exchanges and personal travelers too. Of the boxers that participated in our boy vs girl "poll," it seems that more people think this baby is going to be a boy (6 to 4). <br/>

<br/>
It was wonderful seeing and meeting so many new and not-so-new boxers at <br/>
our campsite and at the gathering.  All the boxes were wonderful with <br/>
many, many AWESOME carves, and Dartmoor Dreamer's bonus box was a cute <br/>
addition and fun challenge to find (of course it was the LAST place we <br/>
looked!). <br/>
<br/>
Sorry to Katy, Kimono Girl, and Flying Dragon for being so prompt on <br/>
our  assignment for the Post-Gathering clean up [we had the task of <br/>
collecting  the last three boxes (GFP,  Compost, and  RRR) and we bumped <br/>
into them on our way back after removing them].  Ooops. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, we discovered something new and wonderful to go into our camping <br/>
supplies....EARPLUGS!  WOW, it really helps.  No more waking up at the <br/>
crack of dawn with the rest of nature!<br/>
<br/>
Great gathering!  (when/where is the next one!!!!)<br/>
