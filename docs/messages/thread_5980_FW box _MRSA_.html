                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep, you're all correct...Methicillin Resistant Staph aureus. I was in San Jose for a VA-sponsored MRSA conference this past Februarywhere I met up witha bunchwild and crazy (and wonderfully nice) local letterboxers, including Wassa, whom I gave the box to for hiding since I didn't have time to do it myself. He in turn gave it to Deniserows who did the actual planting. I didn't have time to do a very elaborate carve. Without giving away details, but for WiHi and MM's interpretation of the image, the "swiss cheese" effect is supposed to represent the cocci (round bacterial cells) which tend to grow in tetrads (clusters of 4). Not a very good representation, if I do say so myself. The purple paper was used to represent their staining reaction, what we call "Gram positive", or retaining the crystal violet stain used.<br/>
<br/>
There you go...more microbiology than you ever cared to know. (Just a point of professional nit-pickiness...we in the field never call it "mersa"...we always refer to it as "M-R-S-A", but we know it's very commonly accepted to use the phonetic version.)<br/>
<br/>
Some of you may recall my experience with a "spider bite" a couple years ago...that was actually the first of my twoown personal experiences with a skin/soft tissue abscess caused by MRSA. Let me tell you, it's just as nasty as they say. <br/>

--klk/MRSAwoman, who really got excited when GollyGee sent me the entire set of images from her "Microbes" series!!<br/>
<br/>
PS: And so now you all know why I don't know anything about wild mushrooms!! (-:<br/>
