Hi everyone. The Patrol is taking a summer vacation. We're hopping on<br>
a train in Chicago and headed for San Francisco. We will spend a<br>
couple of days in San Francisco and then drive up the coast, north, to<br>
Eureka. I see a lot of letterboxes in the area, and we can't get them<br>
all. Just wondering if anyone can suggest the best ones. Are there<br>
any that we just must get? Has any one been boxing there in the last<br>

Thanks for all the suggestions.  This definitely helps!!  <br>
<br>
To Cherokee Rose 2, I have printed out Sea Ranch, but can't find<br>
Hidden Angel on AQ or LbNA.  Any hints, or the placer?<br>
<br>
I have also emailed the LBer's suggested by WiHi and have emailed to<br>
see if Skunk Cabbage is still in place.  <br>
<br>
We don't leave until Thursday, so please keep the suggestions coming!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One more thing...There are 2 boxes, one called "Sea Ranch" by Toucan <br>
