I just went and posted how I have a goal of catching a letterboxer <br>
in the wild but haven't managed to do it yet.<br>
<br>
This morning, my daughter and I decided go out and quick put the <br>
dates into the logbooks of the Fate of Easter series. (Yea, I fogot <br>
to do it while we were placing them in the rain this weekend.)<br>
<br>
So we stop at the park and hit the first box in the series. Hmmmm... <br>
it's been stamped by Grandvilla and Mobiusklien on todays date. <br>
(They were also kind enough to have put the placed date into the log <br>
book per a message I posted earlier, too!)<br>
<br>
We figured they might be out on the trails doing the series at that <br>
very moment... and they were!<br>
<br>
Hurrah!!! Letterboxers "in the wild" just as I had hoped for! <br>
<br>
Uh-oh. My logbook and stamp were back home. LOL!! Enders Angel <br>
wasn't so foolish. She rushed back to her car for her logbook and <br>
got her first exchanges. <br>
<br>
Lesson Learned: Never, never, EVER go anywhere without your stamp. <br>
Especially (quoting Grandvilla here) "if you're going to be anywhere <br>
near where a box might be."  You can bet I won't be making this <br>
mistake again!<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

Guess who is NEVER ever gonna let her forget it either. Maybe I got <br>
a little too close to that Bill the Bad Bunny box.<br>
