I'm going out again today to look for places to hide new boxes.  Reminder to self: wear boots!  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I went to one new location yesterday but decided to leave when I saw a posted sign: Attack guard dogs on duty after hours.    Hmmmm.....might be a simple scare tactic, but I wasn't going to get out of my car, hike around, and take that chance.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Good advice about providing nearby cover.  Thanks for passing along WH and MM advice. <br>

Oh, this made me laugh, because when I started volunteering with the Red Cross years ago, I worked a lot with one of the veteran volunteers (15+ years of experience) and to this day, I tell people that when I'm on a Red Cross call that there is a little miniature of this volunteer (think the good angel/bad angel sitting on your shoulders) whispering things into my ear like, "Be a good steward of the donated dollar."  So I can just picture the miniature WiHi - or even better, her signature stamp - floating above your shoulder guiding you on your plants!<br>
