                    <div class="plaintext-content">Generally yes.<br>
<br>
The hitchhiker's log book should typically be stamped with your <br>
personal stamp, the stamp of the box it is found in (if the hider <br>
did not do it), and the stamp of the box you hide it in.<br>
<br>
You should also stamp the HH stamp into your logbook.<br>
<br>
The box's logbook, both where you find it and where you place it, <br>
should also be stamped with your personal stamp and the HH stamp.<br>
<br>
There are some exceptions to this general setup however.  If the <br>
logbook of the HH is small, sometimes the HH owner will tell finders <br>
to only stamp the HH log book with only your personal stamp OR the <br>
stamp of the box, not both, to save room on the HH logbook.  This is <br>
the case with the HH I currently have in my possession.<br>

And I might add, if the HH is not just a tiny, in-a-baggy hitcher, <br>
make sure the hiding spot will accomodate both the main letterbox and <br>
the hitcher. If the HH is itself a full sized box (it happens!) you <br>

When you get home, if so requested by the person who placed the HH, <br>
please take a moment to drop them an e-mail to let them know the <br>
status of the little traveller, or perhaps post your find to the HH <br>
Yahoo list and/or send an update to Pete and Wanda for the HH <br>
tracking page they maintain.<br>
<br>
The biggest complaint people have about HH is that they plant them <br>
and then never hear of them again.  I am sure many of these HH are <br>
just fine and are happily travelling the country, and are not <br>
actually lost as the placer fears.<br>
<br>
It only takes a minute to send off a quick note to the placer and it <br>
is very much appreciated!<br>
<br>
But do be aware, there are a few folks who do not want to hear the <br>
status of their HH or have it posted on the HH list -- in which case <br>
please respect their request.<br>
