<br/>
The hitchhiker's log book should typically be stamped with your <br/>
personal stamp, the stamp of the box it is found in (if the hider <br/>
did not do it), and the stamp of the box you hide it in.<br/>
<br/>
You should also stamp the HH stamp into your logbook.<br/>
<br/>
The box's logbook, both where you find it and where you place it, <br/>
should also be stamped with your personal stamp and the HH stamp.<br/>
<br/>
There are some exceptions to this general setup however.  If the <br/>
logbook of the HH is small, sometimes the HH owner will tell finders <br/>
to only stamp the HH log book with only your personal stamp OR the <br/>
stamp of the box, not both, to save room on the HH logbook.  This is <br/>
the case with the HH I currently have in my possession.<br/>

make sure the hiding spot will accomodate both the main letterbox and <br/>

When you get home, if so requested by the person who placed the HH, <br/>
please take a moment to drop them an e-mail to let them know the <br/>
status of the little traveller, or perhaps post your find to the HH <br/>
Yahoo list and/or send an update to Pete and Wanda for the HH <br/>
tracking page they maintain.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest complaint people have about HH is that they plant them <br/>
and then never hear of them again.  I am sure many of these HH are <br/>
just fine and are happily travelling the country, and are not <br/>
actually lost as the placer fears.<br/>
<br/>
It only takes a minute to send off a quick note to the placer and it <br/>
is very much appreciated!<br/>

please respect their request.<br/>

I've got 8 or more HH's on the road, and infrequently hear back about them,<br/>
you'd think I'd have mentioned that every so subtly, eh? (Grin)<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, insert a step, 4.a I think, where you drop a line to the originator<br/>
and let them know that it's safe, sound and found, and moving on.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And adding my two cents...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When you get home, if so requested by the person who placed the HH,<br/>
&gt; please take a moment to drop them an e-mail to let them know the<br/>
&gt; status of the little traveller, or perhaps post your find to the HH<br/>
&gt; Yahoo list and/or send an update to Pete and Wanda for the HH<br/>
&gt; tracking page they maintain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The biggest complaint people have about HH is that they plant them<br/>
&gt; and then never hear of them again. I am sure many of these HH are<br/>
&gt; just fine and are happily travelling the country, and are not<br/>
&gt; actually lost as the placer fears.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It only takes a minute to send off a quick note to the placer and it<br/>
&gt; is very much appreciated!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But do be aware, there are a few folks who do not want to hear the<br/>
&gt; status of their HH or have it posted on the HH list -- in which case<br/>
&gt; please respect their request.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Good suggestions.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; And I might add, if the HH is not just a tiny, in-a-baggy hitcher,<br/>
&gt; &gt; make sure the hiding spot will accomodate both the main letterbox<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the hitcher. If the HH is itself a full sized box (it happens!)<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; may have to carry it until you find a spot with enough space.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes it is actually. Here's the normal sequence of events for<br/>
&gt; &gt; hiding,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handling and moving a hitchhiker:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) While out casually letterboxing one day, you stumble across a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hitchhiker<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the letterbox you've just uncovered.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The Happy Letterboxing "I've discovered a Hitchhiker" dance<br/>
&gt; &gt; ensues!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) Check to make sure that the Hitchhiker was stamped into the<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that you discovered it in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) You stamp into the Hitchhiker's log book and take it with<br/>
&gt; you,<br/>
&gt; &gt; if you so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; choose to do so.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) When you've found the perfect letterbox to place it in, you<br/>
