really.  As far as I know, no one has tried to find this box in <br>
almost a year.  But, just in case someone happened to be planning to <br>
go this weekend, I wanted to let everyone know that my "Warning! <br>
Warning!" box in Sanilac County, MI is currently missing.  It was <br>
found by a muggle who brought it home with him.  His grandmother <br>
contacted me this AM, so the box is safe, just not in place.<br>
<br>
I may end up retiring it, since this is the second time it's been <br>
found and recovered by muggles.  Apparently it's a crappy hiding spot <br>
and/or the finders aren't recovering it with the rocks as well as <br>
they should be.<br>
