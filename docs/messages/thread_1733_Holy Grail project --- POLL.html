the movie for this project. However, there are SO MANY great lines, we<br>
can't decide so we've created a poll to see what you think you'd like<br>
to have as part of the project.<br>
<br>
You have up to 6 choices in the poll, but be aware we're trying to<br>
keep it "family friendly" so some of your favorite lines might not be<br>
on the list of choices. <br>
<br>
To make carving easier, and make sure we can meet the deadlines, we'll<br>
be doing these stamps in the "reverse"<br>

Thanks for the help, everyone.<br>

stamp are more than welcome to do so. Team Bindlestiff however will<br>
elect not to include it in the boxes we're doing.<br>
<br>
It's just been my experience that some parents do not want their<br>
child(ren) to be exposed to "bathroom humor" and, have sometimes been<br>
quite hostile in expressing their feelings on the subject. <br>
<br>
I think those parents secretly think their child will one day be<br>
President, famous or otherwise in the media spot light.  And they<br>
harbor a fear of having someone say something about their precious one<br>
to the media that begins with: "Oh yea ... when we were kids we used<br>
to tell each other the most disgusting potty jokes, like ..." LOL<br>
