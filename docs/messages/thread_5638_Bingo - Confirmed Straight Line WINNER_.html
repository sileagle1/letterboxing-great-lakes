                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, the first two games won were both new games this year so it is hard to make a comparison.  But the straight line has been won in the first week of February for the past two years, so this year is right on track with that.  In past years, "X" and Four Corners range from the end of February to mid-April, so even though it is conceivable that four corners could happen any time (it is only four squares after all...), based on past experience, we probably won't see any further winners for at least a couple of weeks.<br>

But I know we're all "Friends" here and thanks for all the kudos and <br>
well wishes you sent my way.  Spring Chick is my "Greatest American <br>
Hero."<br>
