OMGosh!  I am crying tears of laughter!  I nearly had a Dilly Bar moment <br>
laughing so hard at the "get up" notes.  That was great!  I needed that good <br>
laugh.  We haven't taken that much with us when we have gone out on a hunt, but the <br>
list of things the rest of you drag around gave me a great list to keep for <br>
when I might need to take that stuff with me.  <br>
<br>
Lipstick Chick and I (Dumpster Diva) would be the ones giggling all along the <br>
trail, sharing funny stories, catching up on what we hadn't already discussed <br>
on the phone 6 times a day and remarking about how far we had come since our <br>
first letterbox hunt!  in the rain, mud, good sandals on, no umbrella, huge <br>
tote bags plus our purses! (what were we thinking! who takes a 10# purse with <br>
them - duh!) no water, of course all we had to do was drink from the sky if we <br>
needed to, no compass, no tissues incase we had to potty or "loop", no nothing <br>
but this huge tote with the worlds largest, heaviest journal to use as our <br>
logbook..... duh!  no power bars for nourishment, no plastic sleeve for our clues <br>
which got very soggy and difficult to read, and then to finish us off....we <br>
couldn't find the box!  Ugh!  But it's one of our best memories!~<br>
<br>
With LC living in MI and me in IL and trying not to letterbox except together <br>
we seem to live vicariously thru all of you and chat everyday about the <br>
thread and what's going on.... thanks for that great laugh - and I'm laughing with <br>
you, not at you.... <br>

PS:  To all you English majors out there who are squealing about all the run <br>
on sentences..... sorry I am in a hurry.  Gotta open the Barn and I am still <br>
in my jamamas!  <br>
