my family's ancestral home - New England. Since there are, at last estimate, <br/>
a bazillion boxes in those six states, we thought we'd ask if there are any <br/>
"can't miss" boxes - ones we should absolutely make sure we get. We are <br/>
probably going to spend most of our time in CT and MA, but may travel more <br/>
extensively.<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't done so already, you may want to join some of the <br/>
regional message boards for that area.  The Connecticut group and the <br/>
Northeast group would seem to match your plans well.<br/>
<br/>
We've always done this when we travel with boxing in our plans.  We've <br/>
gotten tips on recommended boxes/areas, warnings about boxes that are <br/>
missing, tips on additional clues that aren't widely published and <br/>
suggestions on where to eat.  We've also made plans with some of the <br/>
local boxers to get together with them while we're in the area.  Lots <br/>
of fun!<br/>
