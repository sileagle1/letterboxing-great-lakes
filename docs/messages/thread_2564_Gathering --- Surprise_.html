Not that I approve of her method of asserting herself, but I love <br>

<br>
Bindle Bum has a sailing race that needs his attention on Sat (and I <br>
don't race sailboats) so he'll not be along (neither will his <br>

Wooooooo-hoooooo! Going to the Gathering!  Can hardly wait.<br>

We won't be able to pick you up, but for anyone else in the local area <br>
that might be able to, it looks like the hotel she is staying at is <br>
near Timmerman Field, near the intersection of Silver Spring & Lovers <br>
Lane (HWY 100).<br>

I am driving in from Milwaukee on Saturday morning early.  I live <br>
maybe two blocks from Lake Michigan so If you really want a ride, I <br>
am willing to help out.  Let me know.<br>
