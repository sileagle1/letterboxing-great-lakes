I have been told my hostel was left exposed on top of the deadfall. <br>
It was originally <br>
stocked with 4 HH's and one box stamp, the Shady Rest.  My HH's have<br>
been taken away <br>
out of state.  There were at least 2 other new guests at some point. <br>
There may be just 1 <br>
stamp remaining now.  I will be investigating the location soon and<br>
checking in new <br>
guests.  If you visited Fort Harrison SP this weekend, would you be<br>
so kind and update me <br>
off-list with the box's condition/location when you found it?<br>
<br>
Please ignore the double-post to the Traveller's list.<br>
