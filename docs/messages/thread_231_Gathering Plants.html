<br>
I will want to make sure that the planting of boxes at the gathering <br>
is done so there are not too many in the same location.  It would be <br>
best if they were spread out at the various picnic/parking areas so <br>
we're not tripping over each other as we find them.<br>
<br>
To that extent, if you are planting a box of your own there, please <br>
at least let me know the parking lot you intend for your clues to <br>
start so I can keep track of where the boxes generally are.  If you <br>
intend for me to print your clues in the gathering booklet, be sure <br>
to get them to me by the Wednesday before the gathering.  Otherwise, <br>
you'll have to bring copies to the gathering or rely on WOM.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>

boxes at the park in an eco-friendly way, but you cannot <br>
be "gathering plants" at the park. :-)<br>
