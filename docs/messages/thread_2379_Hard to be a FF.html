...A while back we were beat out of FF at KiddyWriters "GNAS Tower" by <br/>
what was probably an hour or so....<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we like the board. HELLO to you all!<br/>
<br/>
Atom 118 and Coffee Beans (she was very excited about everyone's <br/>
quick finds of her new box)<br/>
<br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
Hello to you too!  We're looking forward to meeting you at the <br/>
gathering in June.<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 FF stories:<br/>
<br/>
It was a Saturday afternoon and we had just finished making dessert for <br/>
our gourmet dinner group that night.  We checked our emails and saw <br/>
that a 3-box series had just been posted!  Without any hesitation we <br/>
decided we had enough time to head to the lakefront to hunt them before <br/>
the dinner group met.  As we were on our way to the 3rd box of the <br/>
series (logging in as FF), we passed the 2nd box's location and saw <br/>
someone with sheets of paper in his hand.  And so it was that we met <br/>
our first boxer out on the trail - The Dragon himself!  (who had ALSO <br/>
obviously jumped in his car when he saw the new clues).  I think your <br/>
chance of meeting other boxers out on the trail increases if you're out <br/>
right away for a new box.<br/>
<br/>
Our other story:  Clues to a new box only a mile or so from our house <br/>
were posted late Friday night.  Martini Man was already sleeping, so I <br/>
printed them off and figured we could head out on the hunt the first <br/>
thing in the morning.  Well, MM is usually a very early riser, but that <br/>
day he slept in.  I didn't want to wake him (well, actually I DID, but <br/>
figured he might not appreciate it), so waited for him to wake up.  As <br/>
soon as he did (still well before 8 am), we were out the door.  We got <br/>
to the park and saw a car just pulling out of the lot.  It COULDN'T <br/>
have been another boxer, could it? Well, when we got to the box we <br/>
discovered it HAD been.  Acorn, all the way up from Illinois, had <br/>
stamped in before us!  Unfortunately we missed doing an exchange at the <br/>
time, but had the good fortune to meet her later at some events.<br/>

Funny you should mention stamping in the time.  We have done so <br/>
occasionally (usually if it is getting late at night, we note what time <br/>
we were there and if there was any natural light or not...)<br/>
<br/>
We also recently did Dragon's "Triangles! Triangles! #2" series and <br/>
noted the time in the first box so his student could see how early LB <br/>
addicts will be out on the hunt.  We then stamped the time in the other <br/>
2 boxes to note how long it took us to finish the entire series.  <br/>

I'm very, very new. Have only found 4 boxes. Should I be stamping in with the TIME as well as the date I visit the box??<br/>

 Yea, we realized there are some hardcore boxers in the area. A <br/>
 while back we were beat out of FF at KiddyWriters "GNAS Tower" by <br/>
 what was probably an hour or so. This caused us to go a bit <br/>
 overzealous on "Illinois Centenial Monument" and find it on a <br/>
 weekday morning before work!....AND THEN THIS WEEKEND, Cottontails <br/>
 found "Swamp Choir 2006" before us (probably should have done the <br/>
 new box FIRST, we won't make that mistake again!).<br/>
<br/>
 By the way, we like the board. HELLO to you all!<br/>

Yes, we certainly noticed that some other areas of the country aren't as<br/>
anxious to get out and find new boxes.  It took 8 months before anyone<br/>
attempted (and found) the box I planted in Pennsylvania.  To my knowledge,<br/>
no one has found the box I planted in Mexico over a year ago, nor one of the<br/>
boxes I planted in Michigan's Upper Peninsula last July.  Still also waiting<br/>
to hear if someone finds the box I planted in Oregon last August and the two<br/>
I planted in Texas in November (although one person did email me to say they<br/>
planned to look for these 2 in July 2006).  I guess the local boxers don't<br/>
go to the same places tourists do.....?<br/>

B and I have been contemplating a trip to Ohio to box for awhile (we <br/>
are pretty close in Ann Arbor). The thing that has discouraged us, is <br/>
that the boxes are all so far a part! But... we will make sure to <br/>
stop by your boxes if/when we plan our trip... especially if we have <br/>
a chance of being FF on them! :-)<br/>

&gt; new one near Lombard last year that we headed out in the  rain, and <br/>
&gt; strolled around a bit to make sure we weren't seen, and I  think we <br/>
&gt; were actually right behind the placer!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, it's  sad to be travelling through more rural areas, and <br/>
&gt; finding that  after 6+ months at it's location, you can still be <br/>
FF.  <br/>
&gt; It's  happened to me twice, once in Burlington, Iowa (I've <br/>
&gt; unofficially  adopted this box since I'm there for work every 6 <br/>
&gt; months and I'm  still the only finder) and recently in Ohio.  But I <br/>
&gt; suppose  even if you only get one finder at your LB, you've still <br/>
&gt; encouraged  at least one person to go exploring at that particular  <br/>
&gt; place.<br/>

&gt; I know I have boxes placed in NE Ohio that still haven't been  <br/>
found.  I <br/>
&gt; think one is coming up on 6 months since its been  placed.  Just <br/>
not that many <br/>
&gt; boxes in the area.  ~The Cat's Meow~  <br/>

us!  <br/>

Then I have good news for you!  Went back to my clues page, and I <br/>
found "A Simpler Way" on March 28 (Placed last October).  I love Amish <br/>
country myself, and it was nice to drive through the country rather <br/>
than take the expressway.  Thanks again for your LB!<br/>

be FFs on the newest Ann Arbor box (Trail Troll's Brave Little <br/>
Buckeye). I didn't even notice that it had been planted until a whole <br/>
two days had passed! And then... we had plans... and couldn't get out <br/>
and look for the box until tonight.. nearly 5 days after the official <br/>
post. Gack!<br/>

But guess what? We lucked out... and were FFs! :-) <br/>

&gt; I have to say that this thread just about has me splitting my sides <br/>
&gt; from laughing so hard!!  The reason is that we were the ones who <br/>
beat <br/>
&gt; the Waltzing Pigs, and Atom 118 and Coffee Beans on the the last <br/>
two <br/>
&gt; weekends.  Over the two weekends we have gotten 3 First Finders!  <br/>
To <br/>
&gt; be honest we were sure in all three instances that people would <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; gotten there before us because we didn't get started until after <br/>
&gt; noon!!  I don't remember the exact time (we just started putting <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; time with the date last weekend) but I am pretty sure that we <br/>
didn't <br/>
&gt; get the Swamp Choir box until after 2:30 after being skunked on our <br/>
&gt; first attempt of the day.  For the rest of the day we were seeing <br/>
Atom <br/>
&gt; 118 and Coffee Beans' stamp in every box we went to, and we think <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; we just missed them at Waterfall Treasure.  All in All we have had <br/>
two <br/>
&gt; pretty good weekends after spending most of our time recently <br/>
carving, <br/>
&gt; placing and otherwise managing our boxes.<br/>

Middlefield OH (Amish Country) is one of my favorite places.   I'm glad you <br/>
enjoyed the ride to find the box.  Its alway so nice to  hear positive feedback <br/>
on a box.  Makes the effort of planting worth  while.  ~The Cat's Meow~ <br/>
