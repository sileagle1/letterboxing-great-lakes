                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's always a temptation, once you've discovered a good thing, to keep it to yourself.  But how many of us came to letterboxing because of the Smithsonian article?  My hope is that more letterboxers means more good boxes in more good places.  Sure that means my urban ones will disappear even faster, but it also means more people have a good time participating in a low cost hobby that gets them out of the house, encourages them to be creative, and makes them think a little.  How can this be a bad thing?  <br/>
Incidentally, I've had three e-mails from people who've gone to my architectural mystery box this last weekend and two of them mentioned that it was their first letterbox.  Fortunately I'd been warned that my log book was filled up and had just added a dozen more pages.  I think we're already seeing some of the new enthusiasts.   <br/>
Anyone else notice an upsurge of interest?  <br/>

As far as I can see, tagging hasn't become a mainstream sport for all its hip sub-culture status, and I'm sure letterboxing will survive as well.  After all, I'm sure those Brits were, LIKE, FREAKING OUT, YA KNOW? when they heard we Yanks had caught the bug, and look, we haven't ruined it too much.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the article is a nice overview, well written.  It talks about the hobby, stays pretty true to its essence, but doesn't get all big and detailed, which it didn't need to do.  As people have posted in various places in the past, part of the fun is NOT having all the how-to's laid out before you.  <br/>
<br/>
My worry with a story in a major publication like this, though, esp. for a sport that thrives on secrecy and mystery, is that everyone will now come out of the woodwork and it becomes the Next Big Thing.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in some ways it does still take a little something away for everyone who was into it before it hit the "big time" - it's kind of like having a favorite band, being a big fan from record number one which was recorded in their basement, and next thing you know your band is now playing arenas and no one cares that you were a fan back then.  There's a feeling that the newfound fans just "don't get it" the way you do....<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe that's just me :)  Do you think The Gap will start using a "letterbox" theme for its commercials, like it did with swing dancing?  "Letterboxers wear Khakis" ;)<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that made me cringe in the article is when she listed letterboxing.org to find clues, and that was only out of a sense of security, knowing how recently several boxes have gone AWOL and foul play is suspected in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
I still need to get a print copy to see the photos, though....if I bring it to gatherings will those mentioned/pictured sign it for me? :)<br/>

You bet... big ol' personal stamp right over the photo!<br/>
<br/>
I personally enjoyed the fact that every person in the photos had a hat brim <br/>
obscuring his or her face (or a head cut off entirely!).<br/>
<br/>
Really added to the "mystery" aspect of the game ("and you never see a <br/>
letterboxer's face.... ever!")<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the insight into a freelancer's life, Acorn. Esp. the comment about <br/>
fortitude, knowing that most of their work may never see the light of day. I <br/>
think about Elizabeth Coady and the two photographers who spent the better <br/>
part of a humid, mosquito-y Saturday on a quest of their own... the elusive <br/>
by-line or credit in a national publication. (speaking of which-- I looked at <br/>
the credit "Saverio Truglia for TIME"? I don't recall that being the <br/>
photographer's name... maybe his agency?)<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have very mixed feelings about the Time Magazine article and its <br/>
impact on letterboxing. They're the same conflicts I've experienced <br/>
when I read or hear of other mass media pieces about `boxing, whether <br/>
newspaper, television or radio or other magazines.<br/>
Many (most?) of us learned of letterboxing through some media source, <br/>
yet I find myself cringing a bit when yet another feature article is <br/>
announced.<br/>
So without those articles there would be fewer of us in the game. <br/>
But, is that a bad thing? Not necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
I recall that when we first became involved we told nearly everyone <br/>
we knew about this great fun adventure that we'd discovered. I know <br/>
one couple who learned about letterboxing from us and have become <br/>
very dedicated to the game. A number of others we told have dabbled <br/>
but have then gone away. And that's not a bad thing either.<br/>
Two years ago there were two or three boxes within a two-hour drive <br/>
of us.<br/>
Now there may be a hundred or more. In 2002 there may have been a <br/>
half dozen placers. Now there are scores.<br/>
In my opinion, the conflict occurs when it becomes too easy for <br/>
someone to read an article, run out and find a bunch of boxes and <br/>
think that's all there is to it.<br/>
We've already read on this list about increased letterbox activity <br/>
due to the Time article.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of some major league sports expansion. When hockey and <br/>
baseball grew too fast, there was a dilution of the quality player <br/>
pool, and the sports still suffer.<br/>
<br/>
I still think that one-on-one word of mouth is the best way to spread <br/>
letterboxing to likely cohorts. As we move to seminars and lecture-<br/>
demos the likelihood of speaking to people with similar mindsets <br/>
begins to diminish, though attendees are more apt to self-select into <br/>
those environments.<br/>
Which leads me back to the mass media.<br/>
They are aimed at the masses and the likelihood of a few sour apples <br/>
increases.<br/>
<br/>
I think Randy Hall's book, The Letterboxer's Companion, does the <br/>
sport justice, but I probably think that because I'm already in it. <br/>
Others can only scratch the surface and that's part of our conflict. <br/>
Some seem to think that if it can't be done well that it shouldn't be <br/>
done at all. (I'm probably one of them).<br/>
<br/>
But the Time article did cover the basics: the plant, the clues, the <br/>
hunt, the stamps. We all know that there's a lot more to it, though.<br/>
<br/>
Much of what I spoke with the Time freelancer about was the mystery <br/>
and the "under-the-radar" aspects of letterboxing. That was not in <br/>
the article and it's probably just as well. Maybe to talk about it <br/>
might bring that aspect into more light than we'd like.<br/>
<br/>
SpringChick and I have discussed publicity and letterboxing at great <br/>
length over the past couple of years as other opportunities have <br/>
surfaced, and we've have reached similar conclusions (though I would <br/>
not speak for her).<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, enough rambling. Artistamp and I laugh (along with <br/>
Mobiusklein, I'm sure) that our pictures are there, but in the secret <br/>
nature of letterboxing, no one knows or cares who we are.<br/>

&gt; I still need to get a print copy to see the photos, though....if I bring<br/>
it to<br/>
gatherings will those mentioned/pictured sign it for me? :)<br/>
You bet... big ol' personal stamp right over the photo!<br/>
I personally enjoyed the fact that every person in the photos had a hat brim<br/>
obscuring his or her face (or a head cut off entirely!).<br/>
Really added to the "mystery" aspect of the game ("and you never see a<br/>
letterboxer's face.... ever!")<br/>
Thanks for the insight into a freelancer's life, Acorn. Esp. the comment<br/>
about<br/>
fortitude, knowing that most of their work may never see the light of day. I<br/>
think about Elizabeth Coady and the two photographers who spent the better<br/>
part of a humid, mosquito-y Saturday on a quest of their own... the elusive<br/>
by-line or credit in a national publication. (speaking of which-- I looked<br/>
at<br/>
the credit "Saverio Truglia for TIME"? I don't recall that being the<br/>
photographer's name... maybe his agency?)<br/>
