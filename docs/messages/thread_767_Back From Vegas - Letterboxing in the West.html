                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
  I just flew back from Las Vegas yesterday afternoon, and I'm glad to be home.  We (my fincee and I) drove from Rockford, IL area all the way out to Vegas, and made it a point to pick up at least 1 box from every state we passed through.  We picked up a box in Southern Illinois (one of the first 3 placed in IL), picked up 2 in Missouri, took a detour into Kansas for 1, 1 in Oklahoma, 1 in the Texas panhandle, 1 in New Mexico, 2 in Arizona and 1 in Nevada.  We also deposited a hitch hiker and picked up 2 along the way!  One of the HH I found has traveled back home with me and will circulate in our region.<br/>
<br/>
  Our favorites were the Route 66 series from Leapin' Lizards.  I'm glad we detoured to pick up the series of 5.  We got to see many nifty places on Route 66.  The Texas panhandle was very boring visually, and there was only 2 boxes along the route we were taking.  We got to Amarillo just before sunset and managed to snag one microbox.  New Mexico was beautiful.  I got to see mountains for the first time, and climb up one to get a box in Alberquerque!  I think Arizona was my favorite state.  We saw the Painted Desert/Petrified Forest, stoped at the Jackrabbit Trading Post for a break (got a box too), watched the sun rise at the Grand Canyon, amoung other things.<br/>
<br/>
  We saw the Hoover Dam, but missed the box there because we couldn't realy afford to spend 5 bucks to park (we were broke) and passed up the only free parking stop.  We took a swin in Lake Mead to cool off and went to get the Big Horn Sheep box in Boulder City.  We found the park and about 50 sheep had come out of the mountains to feed in the parks grass.  I was great to see these wild sheep.  But they were blocking the area where the box was and they wouldn't leave!  And these aren't those fluffy sheep on the farm.  The males were rams, like in that Mountain Dew commerical (but without their winter coats). It's near mating season and the sheep were feeling "frisky" and some of the males were butting heads.  So I wan't about to get butted for a box.<br/>
<br/>
  Las Vegas was a bit of a dissapointment.  There are no 3 dollar buffets!  =(   We went to go sell at the Las Vegas Renaissance Festival (I make candles) for 4 days, so we couldn't box while we worked.  Monday was spent resting.  Tuesday we went out to find the Las Vegas Boneyard box.  The dirrections were a bit vague for a out of towner.  After many detours and traffic jams, we finally located the box.  Unfortunatlly many of the Las Vegas boxes have been reported missing, so there wasn't much to choose from unless we wanted to travel out further.  And with the price of gas ($2.29 gal, yikes!) we tried to walk to most places.  Also, boxing in the desert is scarry.  Every clue had warnings like "careful about putting your hands in holes" or "watch out for things hidden under rocks".  Yikes!  I know it's necessary to warn boxers about the possibilities of rattle snakes, scorpions and spiders.<br/>
<br/>
  So needless to say, I'm glad to be back home where the only poisionous thing I need to worry about is ivy.  I get to see the leaves change colors and go boxing in the fall.  I also incresed my 'states letterboxed in' count (IL, WI, MO, KS, OK, TX, NM, AZ, NV), one more and I have 10!<br/>

Sounds like you had an adventurous trip!  Traveling on a shoestring <br/>
can be difficult, but can also make for great adventure!  I remember <br/>
traveling out west on my own just after college and, because I was <br/>
trying to save money (and because I like to), I camped out the whole <br/>
two weeks (don't tell my mom - she thinks I stayed in motels).  Some <br/>
of those memories are my favorites!<br/>
<br/>
We're so lucky that Leapin' Lizards are local - they do fantastic <br/>
work (John is my kids' art teacher at elem. school)!  Hope they keep <br/>
planting for a long time to come!<br/>

from and with only two days I am going to squeeze in as many as I can while <br/>
sightseeing. I know we are going to hit three wineries on the way so... may <br/>
present an opportunity or two for a box!<br/>
