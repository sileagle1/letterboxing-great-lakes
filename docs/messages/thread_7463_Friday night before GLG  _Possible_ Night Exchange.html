                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just called Blue Mound SP and asked about extra visitors in the campground area ... there is a possibility that the Minnesota contingent could host an evening event.  (We Minnesotans have a few camping reservations clustered together.)<br>
<br>
The Blue Mound policies that would effect a Friday Night event are:<br>
1. Every vehicle entering the park needs a State Park sticker (either annual or a daily sticker)<br>
2. Parking in the campground is limited to 2 vehicles per campsite.  Other cars need to park in the overflow area and walk to the campsite. (I cannot tell from the park maps how far the walk would be.)<br>
3. The park closes at 11 pm.  All guests need to leave before 11:00.<br>
<br>
So, Minnesota, shall we host a Friday Night Exchange Event?<br>
