                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went to check on Cemetery Stroll #2 today.  I got a little nervous when <br>
I saw a stamp laying on the ground next to the hiding spot.  However, <br>
it wasn't my stamp and the letterbox was intact.  The stamp is a <br>
storebought frog stamp.  I didn't see that stamp in the logbook when I <br>
checked.  Is anyone missing a stamp that looks like this?  Seems like <br>
it should be connected to a letterboxer, as I can't imagine a stamp <br>
randomly appearing in a cemetery right next to a letterbox.<br>
