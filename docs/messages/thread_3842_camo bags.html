I'm not sure if you will be able to find one right now, though.  I got <br/>
mine at WalMart during halloween and they were meant to be goodie bags.  <br/>
The really great thing was that they were only $1.99 or some super low <br/>
price.  I think I pay more than that for Lock-n-locks!  Maybe they have <br/>
a clearance section?????<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I looked at Wal-Mart a few months ago during hunting season and the guy  told <br/>
me they didn't stock anything like that and told me to look at Gander  <br/>
Mountain or some outdoor type store.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Diamonds in the Rough where they found there's and they wrote  me <br/>
back saying they had to buy the camo mesh and sew the bags  themselves using a <br/>
shoelace as a drawstring.<br/>
<br/>
We barely have time to duct-tape our boxes let along sewing bags. I read in  <br/>
an earlier post on this mailing list someone wrote something about camo cloth  <br/>
tape. I'm not sure what that is but maybe an alternative to the mesh bags. <br/>
<br/>
Though the bags are nice for hanging in trees.<br/>
