                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,<br/>
My cousin is getting into planting some boxes in MN, and wanted to plant one at a state park.  I know many of you had some chat a while back about the rangers taking them and such.  She went to the station to ask for a permit, but got a newbie worker that had no idea what she was talking about.  Do you know the name of the permit she should be asking for so that she can get it planted? And is there a fee to place in MN state parks?<br/>
Thanks for the help<br/>

There is no fee for planting in the parks, aside from the usual entrance fee.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have emailed Gene Groebner from Afton State Parks regarding the status of the letterboxes remaining there, so maybe he would be a good source to ask about what permit your cousin needs and if there is a fee involved. His email address is Gene.Groebner@dnr.state.mn.us . For some reason I am thinking that it is a geocaching permit your cousin will need because letterboxing will be included in that category. Hope this helps!<br/>
