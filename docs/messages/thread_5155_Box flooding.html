"flooded" survived the submerging!  Now that the waters have receded I was<br>
able to check on it today. Thanks to all of you who carefully reseal the<br>
baggies and boxes, both the stamp and logbook are in perfect shape, even<br>
though a little water had seeped in.  Hurray!  Perhaps there is hope for<br>
some of the other boxes that may have been flooded...<br>
