us to replace it.  The ORIGINAL logbook is still in the box, and 2 <br/>
other logbooks have been added to the box over time. The original <br/>
custome-made stamp is also in the box. Over the course of 9 years, 80 <br/>

There has been a fair amount of debate on this subject in past on <br/>
various boards. [Note that this is different from ADOPTION, where the <br/>
box/stamp still exists, but instead is REPLACEMENT of someone else's <br/>
box.] Some people think of it as "preserving history" while others <br/>
think it violates the original planter's intentions and prevents <br/>
others from planting newer boxes in the same area.<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that I'd rather that my boxes NOT be replaced <br/>
by someone else.  If my boxes disappear for some reason, they can be <br/>
thought of as a "limited edition" that is now closed, unless I myself <br/>
decide to replace it.  Other than some ESPECIALLY significant boxes <br/>
(such as the first box in a state), I really don't see the need to <br/>
create a lot of "replica" boxes, especially without the original <br/>
planter's permission.<br/>

The oldest letterbox in Indiana is Corbeau.  As far as I know it is still<br/>
active.  We went to look for it 2 years ago, but were not prepared for the<br/>
terrain that day.  We plan to hunt for it again.  I did get a most<br/>
fortunate and gorgeous photo for our short attempt.<br/>
