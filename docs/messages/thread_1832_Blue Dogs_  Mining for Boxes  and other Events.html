Glad to hear The Blue Dog did her duty (so to speak) to help the<br/>
hurricane survivors.  Her sister box (BD#1; this was BD#2) will be<br/>
appearing October 1st at the Haunted Harvest and #2 will be available<br/>
October 8th at Lake Eerie.  Any takers for an appearance October 22nd<br/>
in Michigan?  BD#2 has an open calendar before she goes postal on us.<br/>
 (#1 will be attending a private GS event on October 23rd.)<br/>

&gt; I'ld just like to send out a huge thanks to everyone who could make<br/>
it to the gathering this past Saturday.  We really couldn't have done<br/>
it without you.  It was a great bunch of people and we really couldn't<br/>
have asked for better weather.  Unfortunately, not everyone remembered<br/>
to stamp into the gathering logbook so I can't be 100% sure about the<br/>
attendance...but according to the stamp exchanges an my memory, we had<br/>
10 adults, 4 children, and 2 dogs from Illinois and Indiana.  In<br/>
addition, Sprite and Highlander from New York were unable to attend<br/>
but were kind enough to send us a box for this event.  And a special<br/>
thanks to Ruth of Team Red Handed for remembering to bring a camera<br/>
and being our photographer.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There was one official event stamp, one roaming event stamp, and<br/>
three absolutely awsome surprise event stamps brought by Team Red<br/>
Handed.  The Blue Dog roaming event stamp raised $40 for hurricane<br/>
relief at this event.  There were boxes placed by 5 different people<br/>
for this event, all but two of them permenant.  Those of you who<br/>
couldn't make the gathering, be on the lookout for clues to these<br/>
permenant boxes sometime in the next week or two.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This was my first experience hosting a gathering and I hope that<br/>
everyone enjoyed attending as much as I enjoyed hosting!  Thanks again<br/>
to all of the people who made this event a success.  I will post<br/>
pictures to the pictures section as soon as Ruth sends me some.  See<br/>
you on the trails!<br/>
