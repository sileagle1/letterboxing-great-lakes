                    <div class="plaintext-content">I, too, have been interested in this thread.  I am inclined to follow WI Hiker and <br>
SpringChick's lead on this one.  I googled and found an information bulletin effective date <br>
Jan. 1, 2005 for geocaching activities in Indiana.  I put a copy in the files for future <br>
reference.  I didn't see any direct reference to letterboxing; back in the middle of 2004 <br>
there were less than 100 boxes in the entire state.  LB'g was probably far under the radar <br>
at that time.  Knowing where boxes have been placed and finding a number of active <br>
boxes, I think we would be better served by showing the powers-that-be we are <br>
responsible and sensitive to the environment.  But when change comes, I believe we will be <br>
resourceful enough to find a better mousetrap.  I feel for SpringChick and all of her MI <br>
boxes, so I better get up there before the game is over.  I think it is only a matter of time <br>
before one of the "big-town" stations here discovers this great secret.  A local reporter <br>
does local interest stories and outdoor activities now and then.  I have even seen him in <br>
the building where I work doing features on local artists and other interesting pieces.  I am <br>
not tempted to tell the secret, but since my stamp is all over the area, a savvy investigator <br>
may seek me out.  I am cautious.<br>

PS - WI can claim this letterboxer.<br>
