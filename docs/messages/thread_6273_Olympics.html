I'm also having a hard time juggling my time with work right now, so I haven't been able to really catch up on the posts for the Olympic thing.  I'd love to take part, however.  I might have to wait till next time though.  I don't know.  I guess I should just be glad I have a job instead of complain that I'm too busy to take part.<br>
