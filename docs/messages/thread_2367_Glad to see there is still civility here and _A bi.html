Ever since the beginning of this particular group, we have always <br>
taken great strides to be a very civil list.  In fact, one could say <br>
this is one reason this particular group was started, as many of us <br>
were disenchanted with the "flaming" going on on the "big list".<br>
<br>
I am sure I am speaking for many, if not all, of the older and newer <br>
members of this group when I say "thank you" to all of you wonderful <br>
people, including BindleBabe.  You have remained steadfast in <br>
keeping this group free of anything even remotely close to what may <br>
be considered "flaming", even with a wonderful BINGO April Fools' <br>
joke fooling many of us.  We got a great thing going here - let's <br>
all give ourselves pats on our backs and continue to do whatever we <br>
can to build this group up and never tear anyone or anything down.  <br>
I'm proud to be a member of one of the greatest groups to be <br>
involved in!!!<br>
<br>
To BindleBabe, you are always welcome here.  I hope that someday <br>
your ship finds safe harbor here once again.  Sail on!<br>

It's spring!  Let's all get out and box!<br>

I dropped off the big board a long time ago because of that stuff. Wisconsin<br>
Hiker still monitors it and I hear the stories about the latest "flame" war.<br>
The other regional boards are pretty civil too. The Mid-Atlantic board is<br>
hilarious and the folks on the Pacific Northwest are a decent group as well.<br>

PS: We just got through watching "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Got the<br>
DVD for my birthday. Wisconsin Hiker forgot how lame the ending was. Great<br>
bits in there, though. Love the rabbit.<br>

wonderful encouraging messages recently ... my heart is bursting! I<br>
can't tell you all how much your kindness has meant to me.<br>
<br>
I think it's wonderful how SpringChick (our list owner) has set the<br>
pace in keeping this list "flame free" ... it has encouraged all of us<br>
to follow her example. The members of this group truly are a great<br>
collection of terrific people that I'm happy and proud to be<br>
associated with.<br>
<br>
I'll have more about about some of the good email that has come in<br>
recently but that'll be in another post with another subject line.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your kindness, support and encouragement everyone.<br>
