<br>
Our family is new to Letterboxing.  <br>
We also read about this awesome hobby in Family Fun Magazine.<br>
Believe it or not, it was just recently published in the Sept 2006 <br>
issue.  I see by reading the threads on the board, that it has been<br>
in a few family magazines.<br>
A few years ago, I went on a few Geocaching adventures with my <br>
brother in law.  It was great.<br>
Then I read about Letterboxing and thought .. WOW... this sounds <br>
great for us as a family... <br>
3 kids, ages 10, 7 and 4  years old.  We bought a notebook and a <br>
stamp for each kid.  The notebooks as journals is an awesome way to <br>
have the kids work on their reading and writing skills.. something <br>
they all need to keep sharp on.<br>
My Fiance, Rob is currently working on making our own "The Jeep <br>
Creep" stamp.  I can't wait to see how it turns out...  <br>
We have found 3 Letterboxes so far.  One of them had an original <br>
carving stamp.. Rob and I thought that was so cool.  We get at real <br>
kick out of reading all the journal entries left in the letterboxes <br>
we have found.<br>
We look forward to reading and writing here in the letterbox group.<br>
Hopefully we will get to attend some events too.<br>

  I have to giggle at the notes about all the "Jeepster" that are members here.<br>
  How awesome is that?!<br>
   <br>
  We live in Adrian, Michigan<br>
  Rob my fiance is a HUGE jeep fan.  He owns a Full Size Jeep - yes one of those<br>
  legendary "Woodies" LOL - Grand Wagoneer, yes the darn thing still has the wood grain.hee hee hee..  I also have a Limited Grand Cherokee.(No wood grain attached) ;)<br>
   <br>
  We do adventure up to Silver Lake (Mears) Michigan to get on the Sand Dunes - ORV style.  Next year when we take our kids, we will be doing letterboxing in the West Michigan area when we head to the Dunes.  We think this will be a great combo.<br>
   <br>
  Peace, Bren & Family<br>
