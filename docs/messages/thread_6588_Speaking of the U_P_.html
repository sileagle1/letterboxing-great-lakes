My new goal is to do a virtual hike to Lake of the Clouds at the Porcupine Mountains State Park.  We have photos of many generations standing at the overlook.  Hopefully this summer I'll get to get an updated one of my family there - and our first LB find in the park!  I have a box to plant in the area honoring my grandfather, who used to run Brownie's Cab in little ol' Bergland.<br>

A different scenario from a lot of parks, that's for sure!  We found them in the fall of 2008.  I don't think they're on AQ, but are on LbNA.<br>
