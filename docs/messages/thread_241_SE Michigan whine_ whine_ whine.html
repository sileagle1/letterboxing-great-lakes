So here I am, on a Friday night, carving stamp number three for an as-yet-unplaced-box-number-three (I mess up a lot), and it hits me.  We in SE Michigan, home of the Motor City, Proud Jewel in the Crown of the Automotive Industry, etc. etc., are getting STOMPED by those Michiganders from the west coast.  Just LOOK at the list on the letterboxing.org.  K-Zoo and Muskegon are KILLING us.  <br>
<br>
COME ON, ALL YOU PROUD SUBURBAN DETROITERS!  Where are our new letterboxes?  Where are OUR mystery boxes?  WE NEED MORE BOXES!  And I say this not only because summer vacation is coming, and, as a teacher, that means I have a lot of time freed up for letterboxing (which is v. v. true), but also because it just doesn't seem right.  I challenge all those SE Michigan letterboxers out there to help me show up those west coasters.  Let's make Detroit number one in something other than most violent city in the nation!  Let's make the Detroit area the most laden in letterboxes!  <br>
<br>
And to put my money (or stamps) where my mouth is, I will follow Spring Chick's example ('cause I know it lit a fire under my butt), and award a handcarved stamp to the family or individual who places the most new letterboxes in the SE Michigan area between now and Labor Day. <br>
<br>
And it won't even be the pathetic "The Sorriest Stamp Ever" stamp I just carved.  THAT one is so sad, my husband forbid me from placing it in anything other than an April Fool's Day box.  *grin*<br>

Cheers,<br>
