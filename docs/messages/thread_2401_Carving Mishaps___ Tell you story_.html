<br/>
I figured I'd start a new thread here for a little fun -- Carving mishaps! I'm sure there are <br/>
some real good ones out there! Here's my latest letterboxing woe....<br/>
<br/>
I'm fairly new at letterboxing... and have only placed 3 boxes, and carved 6 stamps (this <br/>
includes my own personal stamp, an event stamp, and the next box I'm working on.)  I just <br/>
realized this morning that I have to start my new stamp over again:<br/>
<br/>
My mistake... and I knew eventually there'd be times that I'd have to start over on a <br/>
stamp... was that I finished a beautiful one (IMHO, lol!) -- got it all ready to place -- and <br/>
realized I had misspelled the word "chickadee" on it!!!!  ARRRGGGHHHHH!  I spelled it <br/>
'chicadee' instead. I searched in vain on the web to see if perhaps it can be spelled both <br/>
ways <i don't="" i="" know,="" know;="" laugh=""> but no luck there. So I'm off to start this one over.<br/>
<br/>
The one other stamp I carved once which almost bit the dust was a smaller baseball stamp <br/>
that my 3-year-old found on my table. I'm sure he wanted to imitate mom and decided to <br/>
try his hand at the hobby. He took a pretty good chunk out of it, (and yes, I'm lucky the <br/>
chunk wasn't out of his finger,) but with a bit of glue and a day or two under some weight <br/>
it was saved. For that stamp I learned NEVER to leave my carving box any lower than 5 feet <br/>
off the ground!<br/>
<br/>
My lesson I learned today (duh!!!) is to always check and double-check the spelling if I'm <br/>
using words in my stamps!!!<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice weekend, everyone!<br/>
