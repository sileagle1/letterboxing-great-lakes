<br/>
My non-boxing (boo!) husband and I are going to be driving from Denver <br/>
to Cleveland and back next month and I am looking for some drive-by <br/>
boxes to break up the trip.  I used the AQ trip planner, but I was <br/>
hoping that I might get some tips from you guys about boxes not listed <br/>
on AQ.  Ideally, I'm looking for boxes planted at rest stops, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, before today I did not realize that we'd be driving through <br/>
earthquake country. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions!<br/>
Amy<br/>

If you didn't already, post on the Ohio board on AQ, they are really <br/>
active over there and could probably offer a lot of help.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are several in the Toledo/Maumee area near i-75/i-80 <br/>
that would suit your needs.<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to be around long enough to have a mini meet?  It'd be <br/>
great to see you again! I'm not that far from Cleveland and I'm sure <br/>
some boxers in that area would love to meet up.  Or, even while <br/>
you're passing through the Toledo area on your way to/from the wedding.<br/>

The ones at rest areas I could point you too are "Underground RR" by Goose  <br/>
Chaser (Cedar County, IA) that is Eastbound. Westbound you have Goose Chaser's  <br/>
"Old Man River Series: Paddle Wheeler" in Scott County.<br/>
<br/>
Eastbound in IL you have my "Welcome to Illinois" stamp in Rock Island, Co. <br/>
<br/>
Boxes you could get going either west or eastbound are, my "Welcome to  Iowa" <br/>
stamp in Scott County, IA &amp; Goose Chaser's "Stray Dog" stamp in Rock  Island, <br/>
County.<br/>
<br/>
There are many many more boxes to get if you are willing to go up to 5  miles <br/>
off the interstate, however, all the boxes I just listed would be very  easy <br/>
and quick finds right off the interstate.<br/>
<br/>
Please drop me a line as to when you are coming through the area and  perhaps <br/>
we could meet up for a quick exchange and "how ya do". <br/>
<br/>
hope you have a great trip,<br/>
Hart x6<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the tips!  I will definitely post on AQ - I didn't realize <br/>
that the board there was active.  In my region, almost all of the <br/>
activity is on our Yahoo list.  I'd found a number of possibilities, <br/>
but I'd missed some of those that Hart x6 mentioned, so I appreciate <br/>
all the suggestions!<br/>
<br/>
A mini-meet is definitely a possibility.  I am actually the maid of <br/>
honor in the wedding, so I think my sister will be keeping me hopping <br/>
when I'm in Cleveland, so maybe Toledo might be a better possibility.  <br/>
Speaking of mini-meets, Beth, will you be coming back to visit us <br/>
again?  It would be great to see you again in either place.<br/>
<br/>
I notice that the one state without many suitable boxes is Indiana, my <br/>
home state!  I may need to leave another box behind when I pass <br/>
through. ;)<br/>
