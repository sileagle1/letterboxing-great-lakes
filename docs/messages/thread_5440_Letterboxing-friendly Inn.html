checking on a future availability for a conference we are attending.  We had to chuckle <br/>
because in our inquiry for reservations we never mentioned that we were coming out to <br/>
letterbox, but in the return subject line they had written "Jeremiah Inn Welcomes <br/>
Letterboxers."  <br/>
When we first stayed there we told them about letterboxing, but we thought it funny that they <br/>
recognize us by our hobby.   We could only imagine their conversation probably went <br/>
something like ... "those crazy letterboxers are coming to stay with us again!"<br/>
If you are going to Tucson they are a great B&amp;B and the area has some wonderful letterboxing <br/>
opportunities!<br/>

BTW..We just bought our 24 and 27 year old "kids" their chocolate advent calendars...couldn't <br/>
miss a year!  We found them at Sam's Club!<br/>
