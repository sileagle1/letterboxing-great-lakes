                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW!  What a blast!  We had a lot of fun at the gathering!  We never <br>
made it out to do any real boxin' until about 5pm!  I had such high <br>
aspirations of things we would find.  I printed about 20 boxes in the <br>
area, not to mention the tons and tons that were planted specifically <br>
for this even.   I printed another 20 or so to find to & from the <br>
park on the drive down.  I had spreadsheets, I had flowcharts, I had <br>
maps, I had clues and I apparently had pipe-dreams from here to the <br>
moon!  I figured we'd find 4-5 on Friday night, lots and lots on <br>
Saturday and even more today.  In reality?  Not even close!  We found <br>
absolutely zero on Friday.... the 5 Disney stamps, 2 Lucy Stamps and <br>
1 Lego stamp on Saturday, and 3 other boxes on our way home today in <br>
Bowling Green and Perrysburg.  Grand total 10!  Boy, was I way off in <br>
my estimated count!<br>
<br>
I did manage to fill up 34 pages in my log, though!  So, I still put <br>
in a lot of effort and no carpal tunnel pains in my wrist <br>
either!  The stamps are all fabulous!  It's so fun to go back and <br>
look at them all together.   Yesterday was such a whirlwind of <br>
activity and it all went by way too fast!  It's hard to even remember <br>
everyone we talked to and met, but looking at the stamps helps bring it back.<br>
<br>
Many, many  thanks to Jim & Stacy for the awesome event.  You did a <br>
fantastic job!  That would have stressed me out to no end and I don't <br>
think I could have done it.  But, you pulled it off marvelously with <br>
not a glitch in sight!  Oh, and I'm not bitter that I missed the <br>
grand prize drawing by 3 numbers... really, I'm not.  Really, I <br>
swear!   Where do you live again?  ;-)<br>
<br>
Thanks to Mr. The Doctors B for the wonderful bagpiping a the end of <br>
the night, too.  It was fantastic!<br>
<br>
I had a blast meeting everyone and putting names to faces!  There are <br>
so many people I never did meet up with, though.  I'm glad I had a <br>
couple boxes there so I could see their stamps even if I didn't see them!<br>
<br>
Our only real mishap of the weekend was that we forgot to put the <br>
garbage in the van last night and we had a raccoon fight/picnic at <br>
our site at around 1am!  They didn't do much damage, but they sure <br>
put up quite a ruckus!  RedRoxxieRaccoon was at the camp site next <br>
door with WhereTheWildThingsR.  She swears she wasn't involved in the <br>
squirmish, but you never can tell!<br>
<br>
Oh, BTW, do you Ohio-people germinate and grow Poison Ivy in your <br>
spare time or for extra cash or as a social experiment or <br>
something?  I've never seen so much in my life!  If I don't break out <br>
with it, it may just be a minor miracle.  PoPoBullyGirl was chicken <br>
(or would that be smart??) and she wouldn't go sauntering off the <br>
trail for some of those elusive boxes.  But, I kept up my mantra of <br>
"don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me" while I was trying <br>
to pick my way through patches of it!  Let's hope that Ivy listened <br>
to my demands!<br>
<br>
I've got a mild sunburn, several sore muscles, moderate dehydration <br>
and literally ink from head to toe (anyone know how to get permanent <br>
ink out of clothes?)... but I had the best time!  I can't wait for <br>
the next one!<br>
<br>
Oh, I only managed to take one picture!  I see some are posted on AQ <br>
already, but those of you who did manage to take pictures, please, <br>
please share!<br>

attacking....<br>
<br>
Don't feel too bad, though - we had left a bag of<br>
trash with 2 apple cores in it on our picnic table<br>
Friday night.  Luckily no banshee cries resulted from<br>
that, just a trail of apple foam leading away and a<br>
very torn trash bag...<br>

(kat) were actually sitting around the fire, freaking out while Sadei<br>
slept thru the ruckus!!! We were armed with our metal marshmallow<br>
roasting sticks, a fire, and the protection of an ohio native i went<br>
to college w/ that just happened to be camping also!!! Although i<br>
think they freaked him out too!! <br>
<br>
The Kat and The RedRaccoonRoxxie are innocent we swear!!!!!!<br>

marshmallows, an entire box of graham crackers and all but three<br>
chocolate bars......smores anyone???<br>
