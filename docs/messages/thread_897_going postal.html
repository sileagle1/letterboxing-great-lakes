I'm just going a little postal, meaning...Armadillo Jo<br/>
is gonna be gettin' her first PLB from the Kranks!<br/>
Whoot! <br/>
<br/>
This last weekend was the first weekend in who knows<br/>
how long that I haven't been out seriously<br/>
letterboxing. I only found one box (thanks,<br/>
speedsquare, for the Life of Riley...I was the first<br/>
finder!) on my way to the Purdue/IU game. After we<br/>
scored 42 points in the first half, I almost decided<br/>
to call the game quits, get my bag, and head to Indy!<br/>
Ah well....might just need to take a rest for the<br/>
winter and start carving some new stamps. Lord knows<br/>
that the NE part of this state is in bad need of some<br/>
boxes....<br/>
<br/>
I will be planting one in Peru this weekend sometime.<br/>
Not the country....but the town that is near Chili,<br/>
Denver and is located in Miami County. <br/>
