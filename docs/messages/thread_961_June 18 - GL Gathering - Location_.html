Has a location been chosen for the June 18th Great Lakes Gather?  We <br>
are making some other plans on that side of the state for Sunday and <br>
I was just trying to figure where would be a good mid-point to look <br>
for lodging.<br>

Hi boxers,<br>
<br>
Sue and I have a vacation we are planning to Michigan this<br>
spring/summer. We might plan our vacation around this gathering if it<br>
is in the general area of our end destination.<br>
<br>
Would someone please contact me offlist as to where this gathering<br>
might take place. Thanks,<br>

Can someone help me out here? I know I'm scatter-brained sometimes,<br>
but I thought the one who was working on this moved out of state. Is<br>
anyone actually working on this or rather; is anyone planning to be<br>
the new contact person for it?<br>

I'm pushing for the baby to be born on Michigan soil, but my husband tells me that's just freaky and sort of like how people from Texas speak.  Go figure.  So it seems unlikely that I will be able to con my way to the Gathering this year, as much as it breaks my heart to admit.  Something about those maternal sacrifices....?<br>

Well, if my website hadn't deleted on me a few weeks ago, we would<br>
have a website for the June gathering already....<br>
<br>
Yes, Team Rabbit is in charge and I am helping them, though nothing<br>
too extensive has been done yet.  I have suggested parks, and that's<br>
about it.  Hopefully I'll have the webpage back up soon, but this is<br>
the last weel of the semester and I'll be busy for a bit yet.<br>
<br>
And, Delerium, if you're already "pushing for the kid to be born"<br>
shouldn't the kid be on it's way since you're in labor?!?  Congrats!<br>

I believe that Team Rabbit had agreed to work on it with Delirium.  Del<br>
had<br>
said she was still planning to come, but with all going on for her,<br>
don't<br>
know if that will even be.  Wondering if somebody else over on the East<br>
side<br>
of the state may be interested in teaming up with Team Rabbit to work on<br>
this?<br>
<br>
Just as an FYI, I heard rumors that there is another LB gathering being<br>
planned for mid-May in Central / North Central MI (I believe around<br>
Roscommon).  There is a Dog Scouts gathering up there and they will also<br>
be<br>
doing a LB gathering that weekend.  I will try to pass along more info<br>
on<br>
that when I can get it.<br>

Two things...  First -- who is Nicholas?  Is this a new dog or a new little<br>
bundle of boy joy?  Did I miss a previous posting?<br>
<br>
Secondly, it would be great if you could lend a hand with the Gathering,<br>
since you are in that neck of the woods.  You may want to drop an e-mail to<br>
Team Rabbit.  I know Dragon is reading this list, but haven't seen Team<br>

Hello everyone!<br>
<br>
Sorry if we've been MIA for some time - the holiday season ate up <br>
more time than planned this year (what with the baby, my extended <br>
christmas work schedule, and a couple sicknesses), but Team Rabbit is <br>
back, and ready to answer ALL of your Gathering questions!  <br>
<br>
Congratulations to both Del & Mr. Del and Tom & Jill on the <br>
new 'boxers!  Wow!  Also, thanks to everyone for the offers of help <br>
with the Gathering.  We certainly appreciate it!  Now, question time!<br>
<br>
A Mr. Dragon from Wisconsin writes, "I've heard that the Gathering is <br>
going to be held on June 18.  Is that true?"<br>
<br>
Why, yes, Mr. Dragon, what you've heard is absolutely correct!  This <br>
is the date decided upon at the last Gathering...<br>
<br>
Our next question comes to us from a Ms. S. Chick from Muskegon, who <br>
asks, "Just where exactly will the 2005 Gathering be held?"<br>
<br>
Well, Ms. Chick, that hasn't actually been decided upon yet.  Our <br>
best rabbits are ready to scout locations (as soon as it warms up a <br>
little, and they get a sitter for the baby bunny).  <br>
<br>
The top criteria for deciding on a prime location are:  no entry fee, <br>
easy access from main roads, and (very important) some sort of <br>
pavillion under which we all CAN GATHER.  Interestingly enough, we'd <br>
also like the location to be further west than our "territory" (since <br>
we're practically in Canada), which could place it near what was <br>
(until just recently) known as Delirium-town.  <br>
<br>
Any other questions?  Yes, D. Bug?  "I understand that this year's <br>
theme will be Mo' Boxing in Motown, right?"<br>
<br>
Also correct!  I've already got an event stamp in mind too!<br>
<br>
So, please let us know any further questions any of you may have.  We <br>
would also REALLY appreciate any suggestions, ideas, hints, etc...  <br>
I'm sure that many things will arise that we can't ever foresee at <br>
this time.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My suggestion (since it's going to be closer to my old stomping grounds) is Hines Park.  Those of you not familiar with the park (and between there and Kensington, I don't think I'll ever have a love affair with a piece of earth like those), it's a long strip of riverfront along the Rouge.  Yes, the Rouge.  As in, "Wasn't that the river that set itself on fire in the 80s?"  It's a lot cleaner now.  And there are plenty of little park areas with pavillions, trails, and no entry fee.  However, if the 18th is on a Saturday (and I think it is), the park is closed to car traffic from Ann Arbor Trail to Outer Drive from 7-2ish.  This isn't that big of a problem, since there is a big pavilion at the Ann Arbor Road (Nankin Mills) entrance, with wooded areas, and a parking lot reserved for people who got themselves a permit for the pavillion.  Thus, some degree of privacy.<br>
 <br>
Or there is Crosswinds Marsh, which has a big covered pavillion area and lots of trails.  This one would probably be less populated on a nice June day.  Also free entry.<br>
<br>
Websites follow:<br>

http://www.waynecounty.com/parks/nankin_park.htm (info on Nankin Mills, part of Hines)<br>
http://www.waynecounty.com/parks/pickpark.htm (general info on Hines Park areas)<br>
 <br>
Ok, all this brainstorming is leaving me mighty homesick.  Hope that gives you a jumping off point.  WAYNE COUNTY RULES!<br>
 <br>
Cheers,<br>

<br>
If we'd like to contribute a "box" for the gathering....is that an option??<br>
Do we hide it ourselves??<br>
If not, where do we send it??<br>
Do we box it up like a regular LB??<br>
