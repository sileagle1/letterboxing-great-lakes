I started out boxing along the Hennepin Canal and found 16 of the Wizard of Oz boxes.  hartx6, Shorty and Pitties put in an incredible amount of work and talent ... you don't want to miss it!!<br/>
<br/>
The gathering was fantastic: fun, friends, fierce weather, food, fabulous boxes ... more fabulous boxes!  Again, hartx6, Shorty and Pitties put together a terrific event.  Thanks also to Nitrocat for planting; to HowD Girls and Lampwick for the Pre-Gather; to all the people who brought food; to whoever had the great idea to go to Buffalo Wild Wings on Saturday night; and a BIG thanks to Mr. Peabody and SunnySideUp for being my boxing buddies all day.<br/>

During this weekend, I've had my share of "incidents" and Leapin Lizards suggested that these vignettes might make for some pretty good letterboxes.  So, I'm seriously thinking about makig a series entitled: "What you missed at the 2010 GLG."  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday, I picked up a couple of boxes at the park and discovered/hiked through a flooded trail (hmmmm ... this has happened to me before ....) On the way home, I stopped in Mason City and found a box that hadn't been found for 2 years - that was gratifying.  Got home at 10:30 pm - that's a long drive.<br/>
