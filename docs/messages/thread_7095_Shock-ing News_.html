<br>
Nicole (aka Shock) has been working toward ordination as a minister in the Presbyterian Church, beginning with her decision to attend seminary in the fall of 2004.  During the last year in particular, she's been meeting with several churches about ordained positions that were open, looking for that right mutual fit that would result in a call, or as we secular folk would say, a job offer.<br>
<br>
Recently, we got word that Nicole has in fact received a call from First Presbyterian Church of Waukesha.  She'll be their new pastor, beginning effective June 1.  And she'll be officially ordained as a minister during a special ceremony on Sunday, June 5.<br>
<br>
So it's an exciting, busy time in our house.  But Nicole asked me to pass along the news to the group, and to extend an invitation to any and all who'd like to share in the ordination ceremony.  The details are as follows:<br>
<br>
When:  Sunday, June 5 at 5:00 PM<br>
Where: Wildwood Presbyterian Church, 18630 West Old Gages Lake Road, Grayslake, IL 60030<br>
<br>
And to those of you who've offered your support and encouragement over the last few years, Nicole asked me to extend her sincere thanks.  It's been a long road to get here, and now she finds herself at the start of a new journey on a new path.<br>

And to those of you who've offered your support and encouragement over the last <br>
few years, Nicole asked me to extend her sincere thanks. It's been a long road <br>
to get here, and now she finds herself at the start of a new journey on a new <br>
path.<br>
<br>
(Kind of sounds like a good letterbox hunt, eh?) :)<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>

Y'all didn't have to take jobs in WI just so I could finally get those pin-up sized logbooks to you!  <br>
<br>
Don't y'all have relatives in Delafield?<br>
<br>
Wow-o-wow-o-wow!  This news really made my day!  After being so majorly bummed about probably not being able to LB on the islands off Door County this year (long story), to have my spirits lifted by LB news is great!<br>
<br>
We live 9.7 miles from the church.  When I told Mr. Peabody that WH and MM live 7 miles away, he jokingly said, "Are we going to be living in their shadow all of our lives?"  As LbGLKers know, you two are in a class all by yourselves!<br>
<br>
We feel blessed to live in the vicinity of so many great planters of LBs - WH/MM inspire us to be challenging with clues and hikes; Dragon challenges us with math and detailed carvings;  Lizards inspire us with amazing carvings and to use a few choice words when trying to find their boxes; and LSB, whose carvings have really inspired us to try more intricate images.  Maybe I should actually plant the Rosie the Riveter stamp soon.  :)  Thank you, all!<br>

Sorry for the late reply, the messages in my in-box have been adding  up.<br>
 <br>
Congrats on the accomplishment! May God bless you in your service to him  <br>
through the years to come.<br>
 <br>
I can't promise to make the service in Wildwood, though, that just maybe  <br>
the excuse to get back to Lake County and see some old friends from that  <br>
church.<br>

<br>
  <br>
Actually, it's not shocking at all, but I wanted to let everyone in the group know about some exciting news in the Lock, Shock and Barrel household...<br>
<br>
Nicole (aka Shock) has been working toward ordination as a minister in the Presbyterian Church, beginning with her decision to attend seminary in the fall of 2004. During the last year in particular, she's been meeting with several churches about ordained positions that were open, looking for that right mutual fit that would result in a call, or as we secular folk would say, a job offer.<br>
<br>
Recently, we got word that Nicole has in fact received a call from First Presbyterian Church of Waukesha. She'll be their new pastor, beginning effective June 1. And she'll be officially ordained as a minister during a special ceremony on Sunday, June 5.<br>
<br>
So it's an exciting, busy time in our house. But Nicole asked me to pass along the news to the group, and to extend an invitation to any and all who'd like to share in the ordination ceremony. The details are as follows:<br>
<br>
When: Sunday, June 5 at 5:00 PM<br>
Where: Wildwood Presbyterian Church, 18630 West Old Gages Lake Road, Grayslake, IL 60030<br>
<br>
And to those of you who've offered your support and encouragement over the last few years, Nicole asked me to extend her sincere thanks. It's been a long road to get here, and now she finds herself at the start of a new journey on a new path.<br>
