Tiptoe and Tonto mentioned earlier lost glasses.  We went back to the park on Sunday and searched the area but did not find them.  Gram Judy even tried to lose her glasses to a branch in the same area, we thougt we could track hers and find the others, but no luck.  If you are out in the park boxing in the next week please keep a look out for them.<br>
<br>
I lost a retangular serving utensil.  It has a heavy metal blade and a wooden handle and is one of my favorite kitchen tools, so it would be great if it could find its way home.<br>
<br>
I brought home a stapler labeled Christmas Elves (let me know how you want to get that back), a rain poncho (thanks to putting up the canopies we didn't need those!), and a folding stool with a camo seat.   If any of this is yours let me know and we will arrange returns.<br>

Is the folding stool part of a broken backpack seat perhaps? It might belong<br>
to HowD Girl's daughter Diana Dolphin. I don't think they belong to this<br>
group. If no one else claims it, could you send me a picture and I'll see if<br>
I recognize it?<br>

I'm in no hurry for it since I have my Boy Scout stool backpack, so I can just get it the next time I see you aimlesst. Thanks for finding it though  =)<br>
<br>
And thank you so much for an awesome gathering!! The boxes were well placed and abundant, that's for sure. It was so great to see some old friends and meet some new ones as well. Thank you for all your hard work. <br>
