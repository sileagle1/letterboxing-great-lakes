                    <div class="plaintext-content">My wife is so great, earlier this week she said" Why don't you get an enclosed shelf thingy for all your letterboxing stuff"? I thought it was a great idea and promptly found an AWESOME enclosed computer armoire/desk/whatchamacalit on Craigslist. I had previously been storing all my boxing stuff in various drawers and cabinets. Now I have everything in the same spot. No more searching for the right tool or piece of carving material. I no longer have to dig through layers of stuff to find what I need. I created a photo album called "Creation Station" for everyone to post the area/setup they carve with. So everyone...where do you do your creating?<br>
<br>
P.S. My daughter couldn't help "modeling" for me. Enjoy.<br>

Well I'm not so sure my area is "picture worthy" by any means, I have a "nook" off of the dining room that has built in shelves and a desk area (we call it the office).  So I have slowly been taking the shelves over with letterboxing STUFF!  Your nice organized picture spurred a cleaning venture on my part and I just got a bit more organized!!  Maybe after another hour or so of organizing and cleaning i'll get it the way i want and post a pic :)<br>
