                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today was a beautiful day, and enjoyed it by going out boxing.  For our<br/>
efforts, we had our first big boxing adventure in awhile.  Although the clue<br/>
did mention things about streams, thickets, as well as a decent hike length,<br/>
we decided that we would give it a go with the baby and her stroller.  As we<br/>
left the main trail, we started discussing if other folks would consider<br/>
this trail stroller friendly.  Coffee Beans said no, but I came up with a<br/>
stroller-friendly ranking system: 1=easy, paved path, 2=nice dirt/gravel<br/>
path, 3=off-roading for sure, and 4=why did we bring the stroller?!  I<br/>
initially gave it a ranking of 3, but then we got to the stream mentioned in<br/>
the clue and the trail quickly became a 4!  We had to remove the baby from<br/>
the stroller and carry her and it separately across the 3ft-wide, ankle deep<br/>
water before climbing the 10ft embankment, but we made it, whew!  After<br/>
hiking further, we got to the key part of the clue (aka where the box was).<br/>
However, the compass bearing pointed down a hill towards some iffy looking<br/>
tree trunks.  After a quick search there, I turned and went off in the OTHER<br/>
direction.  Ahh, this looks better, and there is a SPOT.  Yea, GREAT HUNT,<br/>
we found the box!  However, this is where the hike got more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As we read the clue for how to get back to the car, we couldnt decide Do<br/>
we trust the compass directions in the clue or do we go 180 degrees in the<br/>
opposite direction (like how we found the box)?  Ok, lets follow the clue<br/>
based on the compass bearings.wander through the woodsugh, a big road.   Hmm,<br/>
that cant be right.  Ok, lets go back and go the OTHER way.  Wow, this<br/>
woods is very bignice hikewow, havent seen anyone in a long time.huhare<br/>
we still going the right way?  OK, after about 20-30min hike, we reached a<br/>
small stream.  Hmm, this stream is bigger than the first stream mentioned in<br/>
the clue, but the clue doesnt mention this one.  So I ran ahead and left<br/>
the Coffee and Baby Beans to wait before we all crossed the water again.  As<br/>
I wandered ahead, the trail seemed to consist of a stream bed through some<br/>
thorns and brush.  I also noticed at this point that I was far out of<br/>
shouting distance of the rest of the familyand if we got separated, wed<br/>
never find one another.  So, I went back to rendezvous with them.  Maybe we<br/>
missed something back at the road?  Ok, so we wandered back the way we came<br/>
and back to the road.  Nope, this is just a road in the middle of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At this point, we threw in the towel and called the planters for some help<br/>
the day was getting late and we were getting a bit tired and frustrated.  The<br/>
planters were helpfulin suggesting that we did want to go back the other<br/>
way.  Ugh, dont you hate it when you start to question the clue, and you<br/>
only later realize you should just have kept going?  Ok, so back we<br/>
went.back to the water.   Ok, so that was only an extra hour.it was a nice<br/>
day so no big deal.  As we climbed over the stream and up the riverbed, I<br/>
wont say it was easy, but it was a lot more manageable that I first through<br/>
it would be, although we did have to pick up the stroller and carry it (with<br/>
baby inside) for a few paces.  As we approached the place where I had first<br/>
turned around, we did finally find something that looked like a trail again.<br/>
WHEW!  Crisis averted.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the clue, this all makes sense nowjust need to wander through what<br/>
the clue called thicket.  Oh funny, the thicket has been completely mowed<br/>
down and all that remains is a field of twig/trunk remnantsuh, which way<br/>
did the trail go?  Fortunately, the trail must have just gone straight<br/>
across the thicket, and we did find where the trail started again.  Soon<br/>
we were back to a BIG trail (much more stroller friendly, a 2 based on our<br/>
previous scale), and after a bit more hiking, we came to our car.  Wow, that<br/>
was a FUN and GREAT hike!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and we have since realized that the clue was rightsomehow our compass<br/>
broke and now its N is actually S. (our apologies to the planters for<br/>
initially blaming them)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We hope you had as much fun today as we did!<br/>

We too had a letterboxing adventure today.  Fortunately we didn't have to ford any streams with a baby filled stroller over our heads!  Our hats go off to the Atomic Beans!<br/>
<br/>
Tonto had work in Springfield (IL) yesterday, so Tiptoe decided to go along with the hopes of maybe getting in a few boxes today before heading back home.  It stormed all night long and we were certain the trails would be water logged.  They did prove to be a bit soggy, but nothing resembling GLK 2010!  <br/>
All was fine except... (hard as this may be for some of you to believe), Tiptoe left her glasses at home and couldn't read a thing.  But worse, she left ALL of her letterboxing gear at home as well!<br/>
Tonto had an old pair of glasses in the glove box that she could at least make out some things, a quick stop at Hobby Lobby for new markers, sketch book, and a piece of rubber...she was carving away in the car in route to the first box.  It is about the worse thing any of you will ever see!  Blame it on the bumpy car ride, shortness of time (minutes), shovel gouge, and blurry vision!  But with the quick carve of "TnT" , we had a "hand carved" sig stamp and we were ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
We were enjoying the beautiful spring day finding the boxes, but as we were finishing up one longer trail, we were striping down to the bare essentials...it had reached 85 degrees!  Our bodies were just not used to hot humid weather!  We went from winter to summer in a flash!  <br/>
<br/>
We found a few drive by's as we blasted the air conditioner in the car.  Headed for another box in a lakeside park, but it was swarming with so many people that there was no way we could grab the box without half of the people in central Illinois witnessing two very strangely "undressed" folks poking around their picnic/fishing activities.<br/>
<br/>
We also made the observation that LOVE must've been in the air...around many bends in the trails we ran into young (and old couples) embracing/kissing etc....we could hear Old Owl telling  Bambi, "Yes. Nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the springtime. For example: You're walking along, minding your own business. You're looking neither to the left, nor to the right, when all of a sudden you run smack into a pretty face. Woo-woo! You begin to get weak in the knees. Your head's in a whirl. And then you feel light as a feather, and before you know it, you're walking on air. And then you know what? You're knocked for a loop, and you completely lose your head!" <br/>
<br/>
We also saw a bald eagle soaring right overhead, white pelicans, red bud and magnolia's blooming!  Take heart all of you further north...Spring is coming!  (or should we say Summer!) FYI.....Beware that HOT &amp; Humid stuff is headed north toward Chicago tomorrow (Sunday)...with possibilities of storms that could turn tornadic!<br/>
<br/>
A good drive back up to Chicago following old Route 66..eating at Palm's Cafe (a throw back blue plate special restaurant in Atlanta), picking up some Funk's Grove SIRUP..and a few more drive by's before heading home, made for a great day....but now too tired for any twitterpating on our part!<br/>
