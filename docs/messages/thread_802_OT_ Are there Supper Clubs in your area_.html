This past weekend, Tom and I traveled to the UP for a combination <br/>
family visit and letterboxing trip.  On the way home, we drove past <br/>
a Supper Club -- a common sight in the UP.  It started a discussion <br/>
about how far-reaching the term "Supper Club" really was.  <br/>
<br/>
We know they exist in the UP and in NE Wisconsin.  We also know that <br/>
the term isn't common in the SE Michigan area -- a discovery made a <br/>
few years ago when we got odd looks and comments from friends down <br/>
here after seeing our wedding reception was held at a Supper Club up <br/>
north in our hometown.  ("Do you have to be a member?" "What about <br/>
lunches?")<br/>
<br/>
So is the concept of a "supper club" something limited to the UP/NE <br/>
Wisconsin?  We figured this list would be a good geographic sample <br/>
for our unofficial, completely off-topic poll :).<br/>

<br/>
My guess would be yes.  How long have "supper clubs" been around?  In all my years growing up and roaming the country with my parents (Navy brat) I have never heard of this.  And I've lived in 5 states and visited/drove through at least 15 other states.  However, Wisconsin is not one of those states.  Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever been to WI.<br/>

Well, we've got a few here in Milwaukee, and I've heard the<br/>
term used since I was a little kid, so it extends at least as<br/>
far as SE WI.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't know it was regional. Also didn't know until recently<br/>
that the term "Polish Flat" was a local Milwaukee term for <br/>
a specific style of house, so I may not be the best one to<br/>
ask about this. :-)<br/>

Oh, and for those of you unfamiliar with them, a "supper <br/>
club" is a kind of combination restaurant &amp; nightclub. You<br/>
know -- have yourself a nice big steak and watch a lounge<br/>
singer. Maybe do some dancing. That kind of thing. Think "1950s."<br/>

I'm in Indiana now, but I heard of Supper Clubs growing up - mom from St. Louis, and <br/>
Dad, Muncie, IN.  While living in Wisconsin and driving all over, I saw supper clubs in <br/>
several parts of Wisconsin, and even around NW Illinois and Iowa.<br/>

colloquialisms.  Using sliver in place of splinter is the one that stands out in my mind the <br/>
most now.<br/>

I learned the hard way that Sheboygan has its own language!  Terms I grew up with, and EVERYBODY used, got me VERY strange looks when moving just 65 miles north to Green Bay.  Let me share a few:<br/>
<br/>
Bubbler = water fountain (people do say this even in GB, though)<br/>
Hot tamale = sloppy joe<br/>
Fry out = grill out or BBQ<br/>
Cooler = popsicle<br/>
Bakery = sweet rolls<br/>
Sliding Board = slide<br/>

My grandparents belonged to it.  The more you spent, the higher<br/>

The Playboy is now the Grand Geneva, and in winter we go skiing there every <br/>
Sunday afternoon--not sure I'd spend every Sunday there if it was still the <br/>
Playboy club ;-&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I've seen supper clubs in southern Wisconsin--maybe Delavan--I don't pay <br/>
much attention unless I'm on vacation and famished. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; This past weekend, Tom and I traveled to the UP for a combination<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; family visit and letterboxing trip.  On the way home, we drove<br/>
&gt; &gt; past<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a Supper Club -- a common sight in the UP.  It started a<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about how far-reaching the term "Supper Club" really was.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We know they exist in the UP and in NE Wisconsin.  We also know<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the term isn't common in the SE Michigan area -- a discovery made<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few years ago when we got odd looks and comments from friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; here after seeing our wedding reception was held at a Supper Club<br/>

Wow, I don't check the list for a couple of hours, and suddenly <br/>
STACKS of messages, and lots of fun discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Now to supper clubs: I recall first hearing the term when I was <br/>
invited to a place in Great Falls, Montana. I asked the same <br/>
questions that have arisen here. Did I have to be a member? Were <br/>
there dues? And, how about a secret handshake <g>?<br/>
The place turned out to be just a regular restaurant, nothing special.<br/>

I don't recall ever hearing about supper clubs in the five years I<br/>
lived in Madison.<br/>
<br/>
"Parking ramps" instead of "parking structures" was one of the<br/>
stranger changes for me when I made the move from southern CA to WI. I<br/>
figured out bubblers, pasties, brats, butter burgers and pop quickly<br/>
enough, but the parking ramp thing tripped me up for months. I still<br/>
find myself using that term now, though, and we left WI six years ago.<br/>

I remember the Playboy Club. They had a whole resort setup<br/>
out there, including riding stables. My mom used to give<br/>
horseback riding lessons out there when we lived near Elkhorn.<br/>
While she was coaching, my brother &amp; I would hang around <br/>
with the stable hands who would occasionally let us take the <br/>
reins on the Clydesdale hitches. That's a HUGE thrill when <br/>
you're 8 years old, let me tell you.<br/>

I remember seeing lots of supper clubs in western Wisconsin in the<br/>
lakes area north of I-94. But they don't really cross the border into<br/>
Minnesota. These places were more like steakhouses, just a nice<br/>
restaurant at a country crossroads. Don't think I ever went to one,<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
One Wisconsonism I heard this summer: "stop and go light" where I<br/>
would say "stoplight".<br/>

Aha! Apparently supper clubs are not just a Wisconsin/<br/>
Midwest thing. I was reading a Time Out travel guide this<br/>
weekend &amp; they mentioned supper clubs, which means<br/>
that at least some folks in England are familiar with the<br/>
concept. <br/>
<br/>
Hmm. Or maybe supper clubs are a Dartmoor<br/>
thing, too. ;-)<br/>
