week's topic seems to have gotten stale, I will be really busy with <br>
other things next week, and just because I am longing for some <br>
positive, productive letterboxing discussion to remind us all of the <br>
reason we love to do this ;-)<br>
<br>
This week's topic:  What really excites you about a letterbox?<br>
<br>
We all have some boxes that stick out in our mind as our favorites <br>
or those "must finds" and we all get a rush from different things.  <br>
I am not necessarily looking for names of specific letterboxes -- <br>
this is not a popularity contest, but if you want to mention one in <br>
example, it certainly is allowable.  So...  are you tickled by a <br>
really artful stamp? A devious clue? Being the first-finder? The <br>
thrill of tracking down boxes by certain people? An awesome hike or <br>
location? A good mystery? What makes you look back and say "now that <br>
was an awesome letterbox?"<br>

My favorite box- or rather- BOXES are "The Mighty Mac" and "Top O' The Pickle" both in St. Ignace.  <br>
<br>
Why?  Because the location.  One of the reasons I love letterboxing so much is because it really highlights those hidden gems a city has to offer.  I'm mentioned how pretty the parks in Rochester Hills and Kalamazoo are, but for sheer breathtaking-ness, I have to pick those two.  <br>
<br>
Mighty Mac I visited with my husband, daughter, neice, sister and brother-in-law.  The view from the overlook showed the bridge in all its steely wonder (sorry, but it really is a sight that carries you away).  In fact, a picture taken of the three of us there is the only photo my husband keeps on his desk at work.  But even beyond the man-made views, when we visted in June, we were overwhelmed by the wildflowers.  Trillium!  Marsh Poppy!  Lady Slippers!  I could swoon with delight.<br>
<br>
Top O' The Pickle was another great one, because it is literally hidden in a road side rest stop that spits you out right on the beaches of Lake Michigan.  After the box was found (not so exciting for a one-year-old), there is the added bonus of sand and surf.<br>
<br>
So there it is.  While I always love finding a goregous stamp, it's the parks that really do it for me.  It lets me look at cities and see their beauty instead of the sprawl.<br>

Just visited the "Intrigue at Aiden Lair" series today, and talk about reinforcing my earlier statement.  That park is something wicked awesome.   Those bridges!  Those chimney trees!  Brilliant!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
What else but letterboxing would allow my husband to gallavant over an hour away just for a park??<br>

Weathertop, Parker's Ranch and Just Above Par in the<br>

#1 is probably the artfulness of the stamp.  Since<br>
we're new to the stamp carving, we esp. love seeing<br>
all the artful stamps in the boxes we find.  The<br>
coolest stamp series so far that we found, however, is<br>
the Giddyup Series in Olmsted Township, OH.  Make sure<br>
you find stamp #1 first, no matter how tough the<br>
search, for the experience to be complete ;)<br>
<br>
#2 are good clues.  We've been stumped on some of our<br>
hunts (including one today) but when we finally find<br>
the box we have our "ah-ha, that made sense after<br>
all!" moments.  The most enjoyable clues so far,<br>
though, were for one of the boxes we found today,<br>
which were written in rhyme.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just plain being able to FIND one is exciting!  I remember the first box I<br>
found (Deb Rock's Bass Ponds)...the excitement of after reading up on the<br>
topic for a while, preparing my journal, printing out clues, getting<br>
directions from the hotel shuttle driver to find the area, and finally<br>
actually getting out on the trail.  First landmark...Yes!  I'm on my way!<br>
Next one...next one...yowsa!!!  I found it!!!!  No longer a crazy abstract<br>
concept...I'm now a LETTERBOXER!<br>
<br>
I'm disappointed that the two boxes nearest my house (other than my<br>
self-placed!) are MIA.  My free time is limited(as anyone with a<br>
too-young-to-drive teenaged daughter in the house will attest) that I can't<br>
pick up and drive far to find more distant boxes.  I'm doing my best to hide<br>
my own...which brings me to the other thrill...going back to a placed box<br>
and checking out how many people have come to find it.  As said on the other<br>
list, "If you place it, the WILL come!!"  (Not as much fun as finding them,<br>
but ya gotta do what ya gotta do...whatever works to get your kicks...)<br>

Par. I don't believe that Weathertop was in place at the time I was <br>
out that way. I really enjoyed the hike for Parker's Ranch -- it <br>
was my favorite in the Cleveland area. The Giddyup Series was not <br>
around then, so looks like I have a reason to swing through <br>
Cleveland again on my next trip out to the East Coast. Your <br>
comments on that one have piqued my interest!<br>
<br>
Congrats on the 10th box!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have given some thought to this one, both before and after posing <br>
the question.  There are so many things that make a letterbox stand <br>
out in my mind...  A beautiful hike -- wildflowers, beach, river, <br>
waterfalls, old-growth forest, tropically lush greenery; interesting <br>
and/or historical places, buildings, stories; challenging clues -- <br>
puzzles, codes, cryptic, unique, creative (recent example: Lemony <br>
Snicket); a hand-carved stamp -- skillfully detailed or childishly <br>
primitive; a handbound logbook; a unique container...  But these are <br>
all topical things.<br>
<br>
What really excites me is the spirit of the game -- when I come <br>
across another individual who by conversation, clues or letterbox <br>
exemplifies the legacy of the game.  The thing that has always <br>
captured my attention is the way the game was played when I first <br>
learned of it -- mystery, elusion, clues in odd places, things left <br>
unspoken, secret souls, odd fellows and old masters, paying one's <br>
dues -- having to earn the trust of fellow-boxers, mystery boxes <br>
(tough ones that only a few had ever solved), unpublished clues, <br>
secrets and surprises...<br>
<br>
Unless you have experienced this level of play, it is difficult to <br>
explain the rush one gets when all of the pieces of an elusive, much <br>
sought-after box fall into place.  I can compare the feeling only to <br>
the "flow" an artist achieves when thoroughly engrossed in <br>
creativity.  Unfortunately this is not something that can be taught, <br>
it is learned only by experience, and even then, not quickly.  In the <br>
chase for numbers, black and white answers and the quick and easy <br>
way, many involved with the hobby today will never understand or <br>
experience this.  True, they will still have found an enjoyable hobby <br>
of searching for little plastic containers in the woods, but that is <br>
only a fraction of the game of letterboxing.<br>
