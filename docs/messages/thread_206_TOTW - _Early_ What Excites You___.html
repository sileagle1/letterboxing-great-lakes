This week's topic:  What really excites you about a letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
We all have some boxes that stick out in our mind as our favorites <br/>
or those "must finds" and we all get a rush from different things.  <br/>
I am not necessarily looking for names of specific letterboxes -- <br/>
this is not a popularity contest, but if you want to mention one in <br/>
example, it certainly is allowable.  So...  are you tickled by a <br/>
really artful stamp? A devious clue? Being the first-finder? The <br/>
thrill of tracking down boxes by certain people? An awesome hike or <br/>
location? A good mystery? What makes you look back and say "now that <br/>
was an awesome letterbox?"<br/>

My favorite box- or rather- BOXES are "The Mighty Mac" and "Top O' The Pickle" both in St. Ignace.  <br/>
<br/>
Why?  Because the location.  One of the reasons I love letterboxing so much is because it really highlights those hidden gems a city has to offer.  I'm mentioned how pretty the parks in Rochester Hills and Kalamazoo are, but for sheer breathtaking-ness, I have to pick those two.  <br/>
<br/>
Mighty Mac I visited with my husband, daughter, neice, sister and brother-in-law.  The view from the overlook showed the bridge in all its steely wonder (sorry, but it really is a sight that carries you away).  In fact, a picture taken of the three of us there is the only photo my husband keeps on his desk at work.  But even beyond the man-made views, when we visted in June, we were overwhelmed by the wildflowers.  Trillium!  Marsh Poppy!  Lady Slippers!  I could swoon with delight.<br/>
<br/>
Top O' The Pickle was another great one, because it is literally hidden in a road side rest stop that spits you out right on the beaches of Lake Michigan.  After the box was found (not so exciting for a one-year-old), there is the added bonus of sand and surf.<br/>
<br/>
So there it is.  While I always love finding a goregous stamp, it's the parks that really do it for me.  It lets me look at cities and see their beauty instead of the sprawl.<br/>

Just visited the "Intrigue at Aiden Lair" series today, and talk about reinforcing my earlier statement.  That park is something wicked awesome.   Those bridges!  Those chimney trees!  Brilliant!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What else but letterboxing would allow my husband to gallavant over an hour away just for a park??<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just plain being able to FIND one is exciting!  I remember the first box I<br/>
found (Deb Rock's Bass Ponds)...the excitement of after reading up on the<br/>
topic for a while, preparing my journal, printing out clues, getting<br/>
directions from the hotel shuttle driver to find the area, and finally<br/>
actually getting out on the trail.  First landmark...Yes!  I'm on my way!<br/>
Next one...next one...yowsa!!!  I found it!!!!  No longer a crazy abstract<br/>
concept...I'm now a LETTERBOXER!<br/>
<br/>
I'm disappointed that the two boxes nearest my house (other than my<br/>
self-placed!) are MIA.  My free time is limited(as anyone with a<br/>
too-young-to-drive teenaged daughter in the house will attest) that I can't<br/>
pick up and drive far to find more distant boxes.  I'm doing my best to hide<br/>
my own...which brings me to the other thrill...going back to a placed box<br/>
and checking out how many people have come to find it.  As said on the other<br/>
list, "If you place it, the WILL come!!"  (Not as much fun as finding them,<br/>
but ya gotta do what ya gotta do...whatever works to get your kicks...)<br/>

Actually, another of the things we've come to love about letterboxing is reading through the journals when we find the boxes.  We've found ourselves doing a lot of, "Oh, I recognize this name, they placed the so-and-so box," or, "I really wonder why this person picked that trail name...." or "I recognize their name, they've posted on the list before!"<br/>

Sounds like a nice day! I have done Parker's Ranch and Just Above <br/>
Par. I don't believe that Weathertop was in place at the time I was <br/>
out that way. I really enjoyed the hike for Parker's Ranch -- it <br/>
was my favorite in the Cleveland area. The Giddyup Series was not <br/>
around then, so looks like I have a reason to swing through <br/>
Cleveland again on my next trip out to the East Coast. Your <br/>
comments on that one have piqued my interest!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on the 10th box!<br/>

&gt; Well, Deedle &amp; I just got back from an afternoon of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, and being that we're still kind of new,<br/>
&gt; our answer is all of the above! :) (side-note, last<br/>
&gt; find of the day for us was find number 10! <br/>
&gt; Weathertop, Parker's Ranch and Just Above Par in the<br/>
&gt; Cleveland area are all in good condition)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #1 is probably the artfulness of the stamp. Since<br/>
&gt; we're new to the stamp carving, we esp. love seeing<br/>
&gt; all the artful stamps in the boxes we find. The<br/>
&gt; coolest stamp series so far that we found, however, is<br/>
&gt; the Giddyup Series in Olmsted Township, OH. Make sure<br/>
&gt; you find stamp #1 first, no matter how tough the<br/>
&gt; search, for the experience to be complete ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #2 are good clues. We've been stumped on some of our<br/>
&gt; hunts (including one today) but when we finally find<br/>
&gt; the box we have our "ah-ha, that made sense after<br/>
&gt; all!" moments. The most enjoyable clues so far,<br/>
&gt; though, were for one of the boxes we found today,<br/>
&gt; which were written in rhyme.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Got to clean the mud off my sneakers now! :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; This week's topic: What really excites you about a<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We all have some boxes that stick out in our mind as<br/>
&gt; &gt; our favorites <br/>
&gt; &gt; or those "must finds" and we all get a rush from<br/>
&gt; &gt; different things. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am not necessarily looking for names of specific<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes -- <br/>
&gt; &gt; this is not a popularity contest, but if you want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; mention one in <br/>
&gt; &gt; example, it certainly is allowable. So... are you<br/>
&gt; &gt; tickled by a <br/>
&gt; &gt; really artful stamp? A devious clue? Being the<br/>
&gt; &gt; first-finder? The <br/>
&gt; &gt; thrill of tracking down boxes by certain people? An<br/>
&gt; &gt; awesome hike or <br/>
&gt; &gt; location? A good mystery? What makes you look back<br/>
&gt; &gt; and say "now that <br/>
&gt; &gt; was an awesome letterbox?"<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have given some thought to this one, both before and after posing <br/>
the question.  There are so many things that make a letterbox stand <br/>
out in my mind...  A beautiful hike -- wildflowers, beach, river, <br/>
waterfalls, old-growth forest, tropically lush greenery; interesting <br/>
and/or historical places, buildings, stories; challenging clues -- <br/>
puzzles, codes, cryptic, unique, creative (recent example: Lemony <br/>
Snicket); a hand-carved stamp -- skillfully detailed or childishly <br/>
primitive; a handbound logbook; a unique container...  But these are <br/>
all topical things.<br/>
<br/>
What really excites me is the spirit of the game -- when I come <br/>
across another individual who by conversation, clues or letterbox <br/>
exemplifies the legacy of the game.  The thing that has always <br/>
captured my attention is the way the game was played when I first <br/>
learned of it -- mystery, elusion, clues in odd places, things left <br/>
unspoken, secret souls, odd fellows and old masters, paying one's <br/>
dues -- having to earn the trust of fellow-boxers, mystery boxes <br/>
(tough ones that only a few had ever solved), unpublished clues, <br/>
secrets and surprises...<br/>
<br/>
Unless you have experienced this level of play, it is difficult to <br/>
explain the rush one gets when all of the pieces of an elusive, much <br/>
sought-after box fall into place.  I can compare the feeling only to <br/>
the "flow" an artist achieves when thoroughly engrossed in <br/>
creativity.  Unfortunately this is not something that can be taught, <br/>
it is learned only by experience, and even then, not quickly.  In the <br/>
chase for numbers, black and white answers and the quick and easy <br/>
way, many involved with the hobby today will never understand or <br/>
experience this.  True, they will still have found an enjoyable hobby <br/>
of searching for little plastic containers in the woods, but that is <br/>
only a fraction of the game of letterboxing.<br/>
