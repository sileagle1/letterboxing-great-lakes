                    <html><body><p>Well, here we are, slippin' into December already! The weather is turning chilly and soon our favorite trails will be covered with snow, making outdoor letterboxing a less attractive entertainment option – some will brave the cold, others will travel to sunny locales in search of unfrozen boxes, and still others will occupy themselves with postal letterboxing... but here in the Great Lakes region, we play Letterbox Bingo!<br/><br/>The 2017 game will be the 12th go 'round at Great Lakes Letterbox Bingo! I am happy to be hosting the game again, after a few years hiatus – huge thanks go to Familyof6 and Wisconsin Hiker for keeping the game alive and providing everyone with daily thrills that rival the joy of watching snowflakes accumulate on the back deck.<br/><br/>The general premise of the game has not changed, but I have made a few modifications, just to change it up a little (further details are outlined in the FAQ):<br/><br/>- I've added a few places/parks to the list... hopefully this will increase the number of words you can use.<br/>- I've changed the interim games, including the addition of what I am calling 'U-Pick 'Em Lucky 7'.<br/>- A poll was taken last year in regards to continuing with letterboxing-related Booty items, or due to the rising cost of postage, going to all gift cards. While several people were in favor of gift cards, I cannot bring myself to completely eliminate the Booty prizes, so I've come up with a compromise that I hope will work for everyone.<br/><br/>All of the information and files you need to participate can be found in the Files section of the LB Great Lakes Yahoo message board. Locate the Great Lakes Letterbox BINGO! Folder and then open the '2017 BINGO Game' subfolder to find the necessary documents. The game is open to anyone who wants to play, regardless of where you live – the only requirement is that you must be a member of the Great Lakes Letterbox Yahoo group, so if you’re not a member and you want to partake in the Bingo fun... get yourself joined up to the group ASAP.<br/><br/>Files:<br/>Bingo 2017 FAQ<br/>Bingo 2017 Word List<br/>Bingo 2017 Grid (2 versions)<br/><br/>Dates you need to know:<br/>- Your completed grid and your Booty item must be received by me no later than December 30, 2016 – no exceptions! It’s the holidays, give yourself enough time for mailing!<br/>- The first word will be called on January 1, 2017 and every day thereafter until the game is done.<br/><br/>Please feel free to post any questions or comments!<br/><br/>SpringChick</p></body></html>
