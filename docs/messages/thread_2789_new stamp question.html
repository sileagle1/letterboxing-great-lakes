                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some of the smoother carving materials do not take ink real well on the <br>
first few stamps.  I have noticed this with PZ Kut and also the pink <br>
stuff -- some pieces more than others.  This will clear up once the stamp <br>
has been used a bit.  I have found that if you use a pigment ink or a chalk <br>
ink and stamp a few times, this tends to *stick* better and make a better <br>
base on the stamp than the dye inks or markers.<br>
<br>
The boxes that lock on the sides are lock and lock boxes.  They can usually <br>
be found at WalMart, Target and Meijer stores.  There are also off-brand <br>
imitations that can be found at discount and dollar stores, but be sure to <br>
test the locking edges as I have had problems with some of these staying <br>
closed.<br>
<br>
Good luck with your placement!<br>

find in the area!<br>
<br>
I've found the smaller size Lock'N'Lock boxes in some Target stores, so you<br>
might want to check there if you haven't already.  (I'm not surprised you<br>
couldn't find the camo tape now.  I think it will be another month or two<br>
before the Wal-Mart near my office stocks it, since they place it in the<br>
"hunting" area in the fall.  I'll just have to stock up enough to last me<br>
for a year.  Luckily haven't run out of what I bought last year.)<br>
<br>
A simple logbook is spiral bound index cards.  You can decorate the BACK<br>
cover if you want, and people will then be able to stamp onto the blank<br>
side, rather than the lined side of the pages.  Sturdy paper stock so you<br>
wouldn't have bleed through of ink.<br>
<br>
What type of carving media did you use, how did you put the design on the<br>
media, and what type of ink are you using?  I think all can have some affect<br>
on how well it stamps.<br>
<br>
I'm also excited to hear about a box in another WI county.  Atom 118 emailed<br>
me to let me know they had placed a box in Lincoln county earlier this<br>
month, so that will be two more counties with boxes and only 25 counties<br>
still waiting for a box.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Master Carve can be a little slippery to start.  We use an eraser on<br>
it before we start to carve.  <br>
<br>
We agree that the type of ink can be a factor, too.  We have more<br>
consistent results on all types of carving material with markers than<br>
with stamp pads.  A marker bonus is that they usually leave less ink<br>
behind after stamping, so it's easier to wipe off the stamp.  We use<br>
Marvy Brush markers.<br>
