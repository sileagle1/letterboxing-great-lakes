It seems to me I read here that someone else let it be known they were cancelling a reservation and were willing to coordinate the timing so another GLG'er could snap it up.  Our site is #56, for Friday and Saturday nights.  If you'd like to try coordinating cancelling and making a new reservation, let me know via private message/email.  Hope you all have a great time!<br/>
