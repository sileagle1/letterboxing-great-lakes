  I would suggest the boxes in Pigeon Creek Co. park -- this park is for the most part flat, with only slight inclines.  And Hemlock Crossings has tons of boxes, and this park is fairly flat.<br>

You might try looking for boxes that are more of the 'drive-by' type or <br>
very short hikes.  This information can sometimes be figured out by the <br>
clues.  A quick note to a placer might also garner you some terrain <br>
information.  Many placers will not or cannot accurately respond to 'is <br>
your box still there' but will respond and let you know of terrain or <br>
length of hike if the information is not posted, especially if you <br>
explain the situation.<br>

I'm sure the "old school" letterboxers would probably frown on this, <br>
but...oh well.<br>
Our family went on vacation recently and wanted to do some <br>
letterboxing along the way. <br>
One particular one that we wanted to get was down a very hilly trail. <br>
It was hot and muggy, and mosquito infested. The kids were cranky and <br>
wanted to stay in the car to watch DVDs. So my husband grabbed one <br>
walkie-talkie and the back pack and hit the trail. I stayed in the <br>
car with the clues, the kids and the other walkie-talkie. I read him <br>
the clues while he looked for the box. I didn't get the full effect <br>
of the journey, but I still felt like I was contributing to the hunt. <br>
When he found the box he stamped in for the both of us. <br>
We continued doing this for many of the letterboxes on our trip, <br>
alternating who had to stay in the car. <br>
You might want to try doing that for the boxes that are too much for <br>
your wife. (It also is nice for those really long hikes from one end <br>
of a park to the other. You don't have to walk back to the car. Just <br>
have the other person drive around to pick you up!)<br>

times either my wife or I would be down a trail that ends up at a road and  <br>
we can communicate this via Walkie talkies and have the other drive around for  <br>
pick up.<br>
 <br>
Also, when the kids are really cranky, I especially feel guilty, so the  <br>
quicker I can say "FOUND IT" the better, then my loving wife knows I will be  back <br>
soon.<br>
 <br>
One funny story we just got back from a near 6,000 mile trip out to the  west <br>
coast (including all side trips). I wanted to find a box on Expedition  <br>
Island in Green River, Wyoming. <br>
 <br>
The sprinklers were going, and I was dodging the water shooting into the  air <br>
trying to find my way with a spot light. It was about 1 am.<br>
 <br>
My wife got me on walkie talkie saying that a car was pulling into the lot.  <br>
I started making my way back to the car so she would feel safe when she said,  <br>
"it's a cop".<br>
 <br>
When I got back to the car the cop was standing at her window talking.  <br>
Believe it or not he never asked what we were doing there or why I was dodging  <br>
sprinklers with a spot light.<br>
 <br>
He just asked if we had plans of camping out or sleeping in our car. We  said <br>
no and he said that if we had he would have an extra patrol car swing by  <br>
during the night to make sure we were safe. Didn't even ask to see our  <br>
identification!<br>
 <br>
It was a great trip, even though we came up empty in our search for this  <br>
particular box.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hart x6---what a delightful narrative of your game of dodging the water <br>
drops and cops!  It sounds like you all had an outstanding summer <br>
vacation with your family!  Very glad you didn't get "busted"!<br>
<br>
To you and M&8X both---I'm so glad you have mentioned using <br>
walkie-talkies to share boxing with someone who isn't able to hit the <br>
trail for one reason or another.  On several occassions---I have had <br>
someone on my cell phone box with me---either at my request or theirs <br>
where they are the only ones who had the clues.  The first time it <br>
happened, I was in another state and suddenly realized that I was in the <br>
VERY location where a box was and did not have the clues.  So I asked my <br>
friend to get online and look up the clues.  THAT in itself was a hoot <br>
for someone who had never been letterboxing.  I felt like it was a mild <br>
version of me telling them how to land a plane over the phone, but then <br>
it reversed as the clues were being read to me.  So when WE finally <br>
found the box, I wrote both our names in the log.  I've also had my <br>
middle son use his high-powered satallite at Ohio State University to <br>
help me with one of your extremely tricky and well-done boxes too, <br>
M&8X!!  Doing those together definitely takes your communication skills <br>
up a notch and adds a wonderful dimension to this game! <br>
<br>
It's great that it can be done!!<br>
