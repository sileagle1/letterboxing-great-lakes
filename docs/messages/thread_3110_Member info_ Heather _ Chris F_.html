Chris is my husband.  We are based in Lansing, Michigan.  We started  <br>
letterboxing in February '05 after I accidentally Googled a clue  <br>
sheet while looking for information about the Catoosa Blue Whale (a  <br>
Route 66 landmark).  We have planted four boxes plus two hitchhikers,  <br>
and we have found somewhere around 55 boxes including hitchhikers.<br>
<br>
We always go letterboxing together -- neither has ever gotten a box  <br>
without the other.  Nevertheless, we have two separate (and  <br>
thematically unrelated) signature stamps, and we keep separate  <br>
logbooks.  This means that for the most part our logs are the same,  <br>
but we have the freedom to choose different colors of ink, and  <br>
sometimes where one person failed to get a good impression, the other  <br>
succeeded.  Thus it provides useful redundancy.<br>
