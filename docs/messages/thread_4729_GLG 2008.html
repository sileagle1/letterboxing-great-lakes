Ah, you pollsters &amp; media types!  The voting's not over yet - right now a mere 4 votes separates the two choices...<br/>
<br/>
Either choice is fine with me.  If anyone still wants to vote or follow the "down to the wire" voting, this link should take you to the polling booth:<br/>

stamp.  I would love to do something with Como Zoo in St Paul.  My <br/>
grandfather use to take me there all the time when I was a young'n.  <br/>
We'd go on his motorcycle with me strapped in the side car.  Ahhh the <br/>
memories.  If this is the theme and I can't make the gathering can I <br/>
send the stamp to someone. I'm thinking maybe Sparky or the <br/>
conservatory - depends on how ambitious I feel. If someone has some <br/>
good pictures of the Sparky statue I could they send them to me for <br/>
reference (using my email through here)I live in Green Bay, WI now so <br/>
can't take them myself :(.  Now you've got my mind all excited about a <br/>
new carving project.  <br/>

Letterboxing.  I like the name that someone (I forget who) suggested:<br/>
Land of 10,000 Letterboxes.  Now, I know there aren't really 10,000<br/>
letterboxes in Minnesota (yikes-can you imagine!), but I think it's a<br/>
catchy title, so I'm going to go with it.  I'll post the event on AQ<br/>
for those who want to sign up over there.  If you are bringing kids,<br/>
please let me know how many and what their ages are.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes can be on anything Minnesota, which is a lot! Please let me know<br/>
if you plan on carving a stamp and what you'd like to carve. I know<br/>
there is already a lutefisk stamp in the works and a Peanuts stamp,<br/>
but there's so much more!  Prince is a MN native, Post-Its were<br/>
invented by 3M (Minnesota Manufacturing &amp; Mining), "The State of<br/>
Hockey", etc, etc.  If you get stuck and really want to send a box,<br/>
just let me know and we can brainstorm.  I'm going to ask that if you<br/>
live in the Twin Cities area that you plant   your own boxes, but if<br/>
you live outside of the area, you can contact me<br/>
(the_red_cat529@yahoo.com) for an address to send them to.  The<br/>
deadline for getting them to me is May 1st.  <br/>
<br/>
If you live in the area and want to help, please let me know!  I've<br/>
had several people offer already (thank you!) and I'll get in touch<br/>
about planning and stuff like that.  <br/>
<br/>
Look for more information soon!<br/>

Just want to add our thoughts on the gathering too. <br/>
It was great!  Great people, great letterboxes, great<br/>
hiking, great hiking, and great food. We did miss<br/>
being caught in the rain...sat in the car in the<br/>
parking lot watching it flood.  Had no idea anyone<br/>
else was there when we, Dragon, and Wisconsin Hiker<br/>
and Martini Man left!  Great story Gooble Gobble.  We<br/>
had so much fun we went back the next day...and since<br/>
we had a six hour drive home and couldn't get to all<br/>
the boxes we'd missed, we have made plans to go back<br/>
next week!  Just trying to extend the good times. <br/>
Thank you to Red Cat and everyone else who organized<br/>
this.  We can't imagine the amount of preparation that<br/>
goes into it.  Looking forward to 2009!<br/>
