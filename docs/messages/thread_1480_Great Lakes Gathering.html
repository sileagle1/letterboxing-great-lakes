                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too would like to thank everyone who made this weekend's gathering possible.  It was our second gathering (my son's first) and I must say it was incredibly well put together.  Every where we looked there were boxes to stamp into, letterboxers to exchange with, presentations to listen to, and clues to be found.  It was amazing!  We counted up over 50 new stamps in our books and know we probably got only about half of those available.<br>
<br>
The kindness everyone showed us 'out of towners' was overwhelming, especially to my children.  My son felt incredibly important when everyone kept coming up to him for his personal traveler.  He now speaks of you all as if you're old dear friends.  Wait until our next gathering, I can guarantee my daughter will have a personal traveler by then as well.<br>
<br>
Thanks once again to all.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is never going to be a date that will work for everyone.  Having it on a consistent day each year allows people to plan in advance rather than having to wait to find out the date for a particular year.  It also eliminates the hassle of annually trying to find a date that will work for as many people as possible (that is a debate I personally don't care to see every year).  It is set to be the Saturday after Memorial Day because going later into the summer is bound to conflict with graduations, weddings and summer vacations and holidays for many people, not to mention park shelters are much more difficult to reserve once you get into June, July, etc.<br>
<br>
Most people I know don't go to school on Saturday so I'm not sure I see the problem with having it before school is out, rather would think that since school is still in session, people would tend to be home and available for a gathering rather than off on vacation and other summer pursuits.<br>
<br>
It only stands to reason that as the gathering moves from one state to another, it is going to be more difficult for some to attend due to distance and the necessity to stay overnight, etc.  But as it becomes more difficult for some, it will inevitibly become easier for others who may have experienced that difficulty in a prior year.  It all evens out over time.  Fortunately there are many, many gatherings throughout the region during the year so those who are not able to make the annual GL Gathering one year or another have other events to consider.  Many states have started their own annual gathering to make it easier for those in their area to attend (i.e. the annual Michigan Fall Gathering).<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd just like to remind everyone that anyone can plan a gathering <br>
anytime that is convenient for them.  If other dates in the spring or <br>
summer work better, go for it!  I'd love to see more gatherings in WI <br>
and northern IL, since it's close to home. The event doesn't have to <br>
be a big affair. I wouldn't worry about having multiple events close <br>
to each other in terms of dates, it will spread the attendence out <br>
and have a more manageable group size.<br>
<br>
As an example, the Mid-Atlantic region has lots of gatherings.  Here <br>
is what they have coming up in the near future:<br>
<br>
MAY 19 - NJ<br>
JUN 2 - VA<br>
JUN 8 - MD<br>
JUN 23 - VA<br>
JUN 30 - PA<br>
JUN 30 - VA<br>
<br>
If we have more events, it won't be so important to make it to the <br>
one scheduled for the first Saturday after Memorial Day.  Everyone <br>
would have a lot more opportunities to meet other boxers if we had <br>
more than one single big event.<br>
<br>

<br>
P.S.  I think having events on 3-day weekends such as Memorial Day or <br>
Labor Day are great, since it gives more people time to travel.  <br>

Having it on a consistent day each year allows people to plan in <br>
advance rather than having to wait to find out the date for a <br>
particular year.  It also eliminates the hassle of annually trying <br>
to find a date that will work for as many people as possible (that <br>
is a debate I personally don't care to see every year).  It is set <br>
to be the Saturday after Memorial Day because going later into the <br>
summer is bound to conflict with graduations, weddings and summer <br>
vacations and holidays for many people, not to mention park shelters <br>
are much more difficult to reserve once you get into June, July, etc.<br>

I see the problem with having it before school is out, rather would <br>
think that since school is still in session, people would tend to be <br>
home and available for a gathering rather than off on vacation and <br>
other summer pursuits.<br>

But as it becomes more difficult for some, it will inevitibly become <br>
easier for others who may have experienced that difficulty in a <br>
prior year.  It all evens out over time.  Fortunately there are <br>
many, many gatherings throughout the region during the year so those <br>
who are not able to make the annual GL Gathering one year or another <br>
have other events to consider.  Many states have started their own <br>
annual gathering to make it easier for those in their area to attend <br>
(i.e. the annual Michigan Fall Gathering).<br>

I like WI Hiker's suggestion...more gatherings within the region.  Perhaps instead of the Annual Gathering, we need to declare June the Annual Gathering Month?  A set of event stamps could be carved and sent from gathering to gathering.......... <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I really do agree with a lot of what is being said about the annual gathering date.  Many good comments and observations have been made, but only go to demonstrate that there is no date that is going to work for everyone every year.<br>
<br>
Case in point -- it was mentioned that the weekend after Memorial Day is *prime* graduation day.  It is apparent this varies by state or perhaps even region within state as here in West Michigan I have never been to a H.S. graduation this early, rather they tend to start around June 7 -10, with open houses claiming weekends throughout the month.  College graduations tend to be earlier but are so scattered that you cannot even attempt to plan around them.  I do realize that this is an inconvenient time of year for teachers and it is not intentional.  While mid-summer would be much better for them, this would create conflicts for many others who take advantage of the time their kids are out of school to vacation, etc.  I realize that it is difficult for people when the gathering is not in your home state and you have to travel or even stay overnight.  Consider this -- what about people who usually work on Saturdays?  Should we then vary the day of the gathering to accommodate them?  And what about those who live in MN or MI - UP or even the eastern areas of OH?  I daresay attending the gathering is an weekend/overnight trip for them every year.  Not to mention, as life goes on, situations change and what may have been a workable date for some, now is not -- or vice versa.  Personally, the first Saturday of June could not be a worse date for me in the job I am now in and hope to be in for many years.  But, I am only one person.  There are many people who attend the gathering each year, regardless of their situation -- some are able to make it work, some are not.  And so goes life...<br>
<br>
It is true the gathering seems to have grown from a one-day get-together to an all-weekend event, and this is great that letterboxers from across the region are able to spend this time together, but it only makes it even more difficult to accommodate attendees as rather than shooting for a *day* that works for everyone, we now are shooting for a *weekend* that works.  <br>
<br>
I think you have to go into it with the attitude that you may not be able to attend *every single year* and that is okay.  Letterboxing is not life and sometimes life takes priority, that is just the way it is.  Again I stress that there are many regional gatherings throughout the year and this is a good thing because it offers different dates and locations and makes a letterbox gathering accessible to more people.  If later in the summer is a better time for you, plan a gathering for that date.  Judging by the attendance at some of the regional gatherings (Haunted Harvest, St. Nick's, etc.) I am sure there will be a great turnout.  There are many people who even prefer the smaller gatherings over the huge crowd at the annual GLG. <br>
<br>
I honestly do not think there is a better solution without going through a chaotic voting process every year, and even then, half of the people would not be happy with the outcome.  This is the date that was chosen and for consistency, it will remain.<br>

wouldn't be in this mess every year, but then maybe not.<br>
<br>
Considering everything that has been said, I suggest that the best<br>
solution is this:<br>
<br>
1) The date for the official gathering be as it is set now -<br>
essentially the beginging of June.**<br>
2) That it be established that all the boxes for the GL gathering,<br>
both permament and temporary (those listed in the gathering clues<br>
packet, i.e. other than WOM, PTs, etc.) remain at the gathering site<br>
until at least the end of June (4-5 weekends).  Temporary boxes would<br>
then be picked up and sent back to their owners.<br>
3) That the gathering clues packet be distributed on the GL site on<br>
the day of the gathering or there abouts for all to print out as<br>
needed during the month of June.<br>
<br>
This way, if someone cannot make it "the ONE weekend", they can still<br>
get most of the boxes on another weekend that they CAN go on and know<br>
that they will be there (aside of muggles).  If teachers or some other<br>
group wanted to have one of those other weekend be a special weekend<br>
for them to gather - great!  If the MN boxers wanted to carpool to OH<br>

whether they want to rent a shelter or meet at a restuarant or<br>
whatever so there would be no additional work for the host of the<br>
official gather.  It wouldn't exclude others from coming to the site<br>
again for exchanges, to get boxes they missed on the official date,<br>
etc.  In a sense, we'd have a month of weekend gatherings, with only<br>
one being the "big one".  (I'm still debating in my mind Azobox's<br>
concern about too much traffic as to whether this idea would help or<br>
hurt or make no real difference as far as that is concerned.  I'm<br>
thinking it'd be about the same, maybe not so much damage happening on<br>
one day...)<br>
<br>
Considering much of this idea is already done, just establishing it as<br>
policy would at least allow those who can't make it on THE day that<br>
year to know we can still plan a trip there in June to get the boxes.<br>
 I would love to know that this year's gathering boxes would be<br>
available until the end of June this year.  I would go in mid-June at<br>
the drop of a hat, maybe carpooling with the Lizards!  (Of course the<br>
whole new house thingy is interferring now...)<br>
<br>
*I still think having it on one date limits both those who can host<br>
(who really want to) and the locations available to host.  I still<br>
would rather see us say that the gathering is on a Saturday in June to<br>
be determined by the host before Nov. 1 of the previous year.  In my<br>
senario, the boxes in the clues packet would still be hidden and the<br>
clues packet up on the GL site for at least the entire month of June.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, it comes up every year, which quite frankly is getting old.  Of course not everyone is going to be happy and it will be questioned, but if you will notice it is a very small number of people who are opposing the current practice.  To me, that does not necessarily indicate that the current practice is inadequate, only that it is impossible to please 300+ people with one solution.<br>
<br>
I understand your proposals but they are certainly from the perspective of a gathering attendee, not a gathering host.<br>
<br>
Whether or not the boxes stay in place is typically the decision every planter has a right to make when they send their box to a gathering and it is my feeling this should remain such.  Likewise, hosting the gathering, getting all of the boxes planted and clues written is a huge undertaking in itself and I do not feel it is fair to require a host to go back to the gathering site at some later date to retrieve boxes.  If they choose to leave the boxes in place for a certain length of time, that is certainly their perogative and that is great, but to require it, I think is asking a bit much.  I know the times I have hosted gatherings, they have generally been at location several miles from my house and just getting everything in place requires a few trips there and back.<br>
<br>
There are hundreds of letterboxes in our region alone, I doubt that anyone would be at a loss for boxes to hunt if they couldn't make the gathering and the boxes were not left in place afterward.<br>
<br>
If a group wants to host another gathering later in the summer, that is fantastic, but it seems they should then solicit and hide boxes specifically for that gathering.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents, for what it is worth.<br>

be indicated as a gathering day only box in the packet.<br>
<br>
Good grief!  Let's look for solutions to make things work!  If the<br>
tenent is to "get out there and box" why look for ways to defeat this<br>
purpose rather than help it!<br>
<br>
I also must disagree with your assumption that most people are happy<br>
with the current situation.  I have heard MUCH otherwise and little in<br>
support.<br>
<br>
Actually, in these situations, I believe the next best step to take is<br>
that a committee of volunteers be formed to study the situation and<br>
come up with recommendations for the group to vote on.  That is if<br>
this is a democracy...<br>

is a difficult time for not only teachers, but anyone with children still in<br>
school.  If the gathering is a distance away, the end of the school year is<br>
not usually a good time to take them out of school for traveling, or even<br>
away from home on the weekend.  Not only may there be graduations, but also<br>
various concerts, award ceremonies and studying for end of year tests.<br>
<br>
If SpringChick is adamant about keeping the date, she can do so since she<br>
initiated the annual "Great Lakes Gathering" in 2003.<br>
<br>
One suggestion I have is for people to create an "Alternate Great Lakes<br>
Gathering" and then solicit hosts and dates based on a group process as<br>
described in some previous messages.  This might be a better idea than<br>
arguing about the current event that SpringChick established.  Who knows,<br>
more people might make it to the Alternate event sometimes.<br>
<br>
On the other topic, I don't think there should be any restrictions on how<br>
someone hosts an event.  Boxes can be there as short or as long as<br>
individual placers and hosts would like.<br>

I disagree. I have been a host and an attendee. I don't see any<br>
problem with what I am proposing. I have heard from other hosts and<br>
some that want to host that my idea is worthy of consideration.<br>
Frankly, the level of illogic cantered about is really getting to this<br>
math teacher.<br>
<br>
If constraining a host to a specific date for the gathering not of<br>
their choosing is ok, then why should the date the boxes are picked up<br>
be? It is always said that if the host knows in advance what is<br>
expected of them, including the mandatory date, then they should not<br>
ask to host in the first place. Since most boxes are already left out<br>
for weeks after the event, what's the trouble with mandating it? If a<br>
box creator doesn't want their box out that long, let them hide it and<br>
pick it up as a WOM or one-day only box! If it is a travelling event<br>
box, it doesn't need to be part of the gathering clue book or it can<br>
be indicated as a gathering day only box in the packet.<br>
<br>
Good grief! Let's look for solutions to make things work! If the<br>
tenent is to "get out there and box" why look for ways to defeat this<br>

that who ever wants to host a gathering at another time should go <br>
ahead and do it if that is what they want.   But, I like that the <br>
gathering is scheduled in the first weekend of June every year.  I <br>
like the tradition of keeping it that weekend.  There is absolutely no <br>
reason that someone else can't have another Great Lakes Gathering some <br>
other time and if they are the host, they can set the rules.  <br>
Personally, if I contribute a box and feel like taking it home with me <br>
at the end of the retreat, I will do that.  I think it is going too <br>
far to set time periods for boxes, it is up to the owner to do that.<br>
I really appreciate what the past hosts have done for the Great Lakes <br>
Gathering - they did a tremendous amount of work.  I feel a lot of <br>
gratitude for what they did.  If someone thinks another time is better <br>
and different rules should be established, then set up another <br>
gathering.  There are enough people to attend a number of events - <br>
even one each month. <br>

I agree!  As I noted before, VA has THREE events scheduled for June <br>
alone.  Letterboxing has grown in popularity in our region in the past <br>
few years and I think it is harder to find a location where 100-200 <br>
people can be accommodated (last year we had 140 people signed up and <br>
this year I think it is about 180).  There's no way we ever have time <br>
to meet all the attendees at the large events. Generally we only talk <br>
to 30-40, even if we spend the whole day at the gathering and don't go <br>
looking for boxes.<br>

<br>
<br>
Perhaps the reason that this comes up every year is because this is not <br>
a static group.  New members are constantly being added, who may <br>
not "like" the standing date and aren't aware of discussions in <br>
previous years (and forgot reading the archives--there have been 2000+ <br>
messages just this year so far, and 370+ messages when I put in a <br>
search for "great lakes gathering"). <br>
<br>
Or it is not static, because the circumstances of peoples' lives <br>
change.  What worked a few years ago may no longer work because you now <br>
have kids in school or a work conference that takes place that weekend <br>
every year or......<br>
<br>
It could be a testament to the success of the Great Lakes Gathering <br>
that the issue comes up every year.  People really want to come to the <br>
gathering and may be frustrated that the scheduled date in very early <br>
June locks them out every year because of school schedules (whether <br>
attending or teaching).  If you can't travel far that particular <br>
weekend because of school, then you have to wait until the gathering is <br>
close by (but that may only be once every 4-5 years if the gathering <br>
travels around alot).<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would agree about an alternate gathering and have no problem with <br>
there being another regional event.  Anyone is free to plan an event <br>
anywhere they want for any date they want.<br>
<br>
Given there are over 400 people on this list, all with unique jobs <br>
and situations, there is not going to be a date that works with <br>
everyone.  Having another gathering will not only give people date <br>
options, but may also decrease the size of the gathering a little as <br>
numbers in the hundreds does make for a very chaotic and unmanageable <br>
gathering.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, the reason the date was chosen that we have is <br>
because at the time of the original gathering, the majority of people <br>
agreed that it was best to have the gathering before school was out, <br>
before people were headed off on vacations and other summer plans.  <br>
And now I am hearing that people want it after school is out.  Seems <br>
there is no pleasing everyone, which is why I have been adamant about <br>
keeping it where it is.  Given that is really is a very small number <br>
of people who object to the date, year after year, I have to think <br>
that it is still okay with many people.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While we do really like having the Gathering on a set date each year, <br>
(so nice for planning) I guess we don't really understand why it is <br>
set on a date that seems to exclude the same group of people year <br>
after year. We understand that there isn't going to be a date that <br>
works for everyone, and sure, as you get further into the summer <br>
people will have graduations, vacations and weddings etc, but these <br>
types of events don't happen for every person every year. Whereas, <br>
under our current schedule, teachers/those with kids in school seem <br>
to be automatically excluded from every annual Gathering. (unless it <br>
happens to be close to home) Why not begin with a date (perhaps later <br>
in June)that includes the entire Great Lakes Group, and then <br>
individuals can set their schedules accordingly? <br>
We love the idea of having smaller local Gatherings, but it is kind <br>
of cool to be able to get the whole region together once a year. We <br>
just really enjoy getting to meet with others from the Great Lakes <br>
area, and would hate to miss out on seeing anybody. <br>

opportunities to attend gatherings in our region.  The designated date<br>
will conflict for the next 2 years with dh's high school graduation, but I<br>
will make a commitment to be involved with an Indiana event on the GLG<br>
weekend.  I am reminded that whether 30 or 300 attend, it is still a party<br>
/ good time / success ... in my logbook.<br>

I am taking notes and scoping out potential gathering sites near me.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I will also go on record and say that I like it the<br>
Saturday after Memorial day -- it's a good weekend for<br>
us to plan ahead...and we don't mind taking the kids<br>
out of school for one day...I mean they are in school<br>
7 hours a day for 35ish weeks a year -- I, personally,<br>
don't think it's going to hurt them to miss one day. <br>
(my own opinion of course).<br>
However -- is the gathering is just to far away, we<br>
just won't go.<br>
<br>
When we first joined this group -- I remember asking<br>
(whining really) if I had to wait until the next June<br>
to go to a gathering...it was suggested by many that I<br>
host one of my own if I'd like to go to a gathering.<br>
I've hosted 2 now, and they were a blast!  I think<br>
I'll have to try my hand at a little bit bigger one...<br>
 ; )<br>
<br>
I do like Wiconsin Hikers idea -- an alternate Great<br>
Lakes Gathering...one that could take place in<br>
individual states at whatever date chosen by the host.<br>
 That sounds like a fantastic idea!<br>

first.  Do we think that it will change if we just scream loudly <br>
enough.  Not everyone can be there.  Fine.  This year.  <br>
Graduations... well, you don't graduate every year.  This is an <br>
ANNUAL event people.  t will happen again. and again. and again.  <br>
<br>
The calendar changes.  Look at easter.  some years it is in March, <br>
and others April.  It changes, but we still celebrate it when it is.  <br>
Do we scream and moan and call the Vatican because it doesn't fall on <br>
the right day?  No, we don't. <br>
<br>
The location changes.  The date is the same.  All the crying in the <br>
world will not change that.  Now, I agree an alternate event is a <br>
great idea and would be willing to help get one going.  <br>
<br>
I am asking everyone to please email me off list with a  good idea of <br>
a date.  Let's make this happen.  I will have the location details <br>
planned out by the end of the week and if anyone is willing to Co-<br>
host, please let me know.  <br>

I just feel bad for those getting flamed because someone elses' <br>
personal opinion was more important than thier feelings.<br>

This will be another gathering, with its own theme, its own time, and <br>
anyone is welcome to attend.  Attend one.  Attend both.  Attend none. <br>
Its all up to you.  I don't want this to be considered taking away from <br>
the regional event.  But WI hiker had the haunted harvest a couple of <br>
years back and it was a large group same as this one will be.  <br>
<br>
To me, a gathering is a gathering.  A chance to get together and <br>
letterbox and mingle.  Let's not forget our purpose!<br>

the gathering can't. Everyone, like you say, knows when Easter is <br>

graduations we are talking about people who are teachers who are <br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">The date of the gathering does change from year to year, just as the <br>
date of Easter moves around.  Likewise, they are both determined by <br>
the date of another event.  In the case of the gathering, it is the <br>
Saturday after Memorial Day (not always the first Saturday in June, <br>
but often it will be). In the case of Easter, it has to do with the <br>
spring equinox and full moon and can be determined according to this <br>
calculation:<br>
<br>
http://www.jimloy.com/math/easter.htm<br>
<br>
I am sure there are a lot of people who would like to change the date <br>
of Easter so they could actually wear those cute little spring <br>
dresses and hats without freezing their butts off, but it is when it <br>
is and we work with that.<br>
<br>
Some folks have singled out teachers, claiming they are being <br>
excluded.  I do realize it is a busy time of year for them as they <br>
are getting ready to tie up loose ends and end their work year.  But <br>
we all have jobs -- many of us work at them year-round and some even <br>
on weekends, each with their own busy seasons and days and each with <br>
their own level of stress and commitment, etc.  There are many <br>
teachers who have been coming to the gathering year after year; there <br>
are many people who normally work weekends who make it a point to get <br>
to the gathering; there are many people with kids who come.  I'm <br>
tired of hearing that one group or another is being excluded.  <br>
Granted, it may be a more difficult time of year for teachers than <br>
for snow plow drivers, but there is no intentional exclusion -- they <br>
just happen to be a group impacted by this date.  If we change the <br>
date, there will likely be another person or group of persons <br>
affected by that date and feeling excluded.<br>
<br>
Some people want it before school is out so the kids are still home <br>
and not tied up with band camp or cheerleading camp or soccer camp or <br>
summer camp and visits to grandma and vacations, etc.  Other people <br>
want it after school is out so they don't have to take the kids out <br>
of school to come for the entire weekend festivities.<br>
<br>
I honestly feel like a broken record saying this yet again, but there <br>
is not a date that is going to make everyone happy.  There are many <br>
things we could do differently -- we could put this up for vote to <br>
change the overall date, we could rotate the weekend from year to <br>
year, we could vote on it every year, etc.  I am not convinced any of <br>
the above would bring us to a better solution -- better for some <br>
people perhaps, but inevitably worse for others.  Not to mention, the <br>
last time we attempted the democratic route, it dragged on for a <br>
couple of months of sarcastic e-mails back and forth with nothing <br>
being resolved.  I am not up for that again so I have no intention of <br>
doing that.<br>
<br>
The annual Great Lakes Gathering is held the Saturday after Memorial <br>
Day and as long as attendance is up in the hundreds, that appears to <br>
be an okay date with many people, so it shall remain.  Anyone is <br>
welcome to host an event that would stand on its own as another <br>
regional event, at any time that works better for them.<br>
<br>
The end.<br>

flamed and was very interested in the discussion that followed.  I <br>
think discussion of alternatives is what any group is all about.  <br>
When deciding where the Great Lakes Gathering was this year, I was <br>
given a vote.  Whether it came out my way or not I felt a part of <br>
this group and I felt good about it.<br>
<br>
I understand not everyone is going to be happy with the date choosen <br>
for 'the big one' each year.  After reading all the discussion I <br>
still don't understand why it has to be a set weekend every year and <br>
why it's not put up for a vote like the location.<br>
<br>
That being said, I accept it for what it is, apologize if I've upset <br>
anyone by bringing this up again, and wish you all a fantastic time.<br>

the back! You did a fantastic job with this gathering.  It was so nice <br>
to meet new boxers, and get caught up with the ones we've already met.  <br>
To everyone who contributed, whether it was a carved stamp, a prize <br>
donation, food for the pot luck.........thank you!  Everyone's efforts <br>
made it a great time for all.  And wow the booty in that prize bag was <br>
great.  I can only imagine what was in the grand prize bag.  We have a <br>
few pics that I'll try to get posted this week, if I can find a <br>
wireless internet connection while on vacation.  If not I'll do it when <br>
we return.  The camera is currently burried in one of the drawers in <br>
the camper and I'm too lazy to go hunt it down at the moment.  Again <br>
thanks everyone for a very very enjoyable weekend!!!! Becky Tom & Bryan <br>
