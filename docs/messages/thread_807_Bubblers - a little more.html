Having been raised in Il and then exported to<br/>
Wisconsin (after Marriage) and yes, I do mean Pilot<br/>
exported me!  :) I have come across an actual old<br/>
fashioned bubbler! It was in a funeral parlor<br/>
(attending the funeral of a distant family member of<br/>
Pilot) and the water did NOT arch like they do in<br/>
public parks or department stores.  The water bubbled<br/>
up out of the middle of the fountian bowl and only<br/>
came about two inches above the place where the water<br/>
exited.  The Funeral Parlor director explained that<br/>
part of the reason that these "bubblers" were<br/>
discontinued is because too many people put their<br/>
mouths right on the spiggot and they spread germs too<br/>
easily!<br/>
<br/>
(And it IS Pop and I cross the street, not go acrosst,<br/>
and oh yeah, I say melk too!)<br/>
