                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone!<br>
I just had to let you all know that I dragged my<br>
hubby, Kirby aka Pilot, (pouting and complaining, I<br>
might) to go 'boxing today!!  <br>
We found our first 4 boxes - starting with the<br>
"Stampin' Kitty" box, the "Burlington Chocolate"<br>
series (Chocolate bar and Sundae) and then we got the<br>
"Simon Says" box!!<br>
All of the boxes were in great condition and we re-hid<br>
them better than they were before - Heck, we even<br>
cleaned off the stamps that were all mucky :)<br>
I know I'm looking forward to getting out and finding<br>
more, altho Kirby says that he may go again just to be<br>
spending time with me - he's not really all that in to<br>
it .. I think with enough boxes he'll like it more ;)<br>
Well, I'm off to the clues to see if there is<br>
something close that I can find tomorrow!!<br>
Have a great evening everybody!<br>
Thistle (Anna)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congrats!  And four on your first day too!  I think it was our fourth trip before we managed to find that many (actually it was more...) even though the second and third adventure was searching for a series of four.  We only ever found two of that series.  Maybe we need to go searching early this spring, at the one year anniversary of when the series was placed, to find the other two.<br>
