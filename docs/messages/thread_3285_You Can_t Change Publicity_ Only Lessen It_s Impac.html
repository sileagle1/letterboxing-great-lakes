                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've read all of the posts about the article in Livingston county.  <br/>
While I agree that the article was irresponsibly written, isn't that <br/>
the nature of the media?  They are always going to look for a scoop -<br/>
- try to find the story under the story, look for the unsuspecting <br/>
newcomer or glory-seeker rather than formulate their story from <br/>
the "media information page" on the web site.  I don't think we can <br/>
change that.  As the hobby grows and strays further and further from <br/>
what is was even a couple years ago, publicity is only going to <br/>
continue to be the fuel on the fire.<br/>
<br/>
What it comes down to is making your letterboxes less vulnerable to <br/>
threats such as irresponsible, uninformed newbies, publicity <br/>
recruits and vandals.  How?  Well at the risk of sounding like a <br/>
broken record...  longer hikes, more difficult clues and less <br/>
accessible clues are all ways to put a buffer between your boxes and <br/>
the casual letterboxer.  I know there are those who cannot do long <br/>
hikes and there are those who don't want to "figure out" clues, but <br/>
this is letterboxing.  If you take a look back at the earliest boxes <br/>
in the U.S. and the clues of the early players like Mapsurfer and <br/>
Der Mad Stamper -- you will find no gimmes or drive-by letterboxes.  <br/>
Rather you find cryptic clues, puzzles, brain teasers and hikes up <br/>
the side of a mountain -- and what's more -- many of those early <br/>
boxes are still in place, unharmed, unaffected by publicity and <br/>
careless new letterboxers.  The gimme clues have evolved over time <br/>
as people want more boxes, quicker, easier...  I am sure there will <br/>
always be an abundance of drive-by and follow-the-direction boxes so <br/>
the hobby will never exclude folks who look for that, but if you are <br/>
a serious letterboxer and really want to protect your boxes, there <br/>
are ways to better the chances of survival.<br/>
<br/>
Most people who read an article and jump up off the sofa to go look <br/>
for a letterbox do not set out on a 3 mile hike or spend a week <br/>
figuring out a cryptic puzzle clue before heading out for that first <br/>
box, rather they grab the clues that give quick fixes -- drivebys, a <br/>
short walk in the park type boxes.  Take this one step further -- if <br/>
95% of the clues out there were longer hikes and puzzles, etc. a lot <br/>
of people who think it sounds like "a really fun thing to do with <br/>
the family" but "only want to do quick and easy boxes so the kids <br/>
don't get tired or disappointed" would probably never even bother.  <br/>
We as a letterboxing community encourage a casual, irresponsible <br/>
attitude by casually planting boxes that took little thought in the <br/>
first place.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are always going to be exceptions, but if somebody <br/>
does take a week to figure out a puzzle clue before they rush out on <br/>
a 2 mile hike for their first box, I am thinking this person kind of <br/>
gets it from the start.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the answers are found in history...<br/>
