"Good News! Talked to Tom at the park- all shelters same size - they hold  <br/>
well over 100 people. All are 1st come 1st serve, but the Quail Meadow <br/>
shelter.  It is centrally located in park . . . he said to call in December and  <br/>
he will send paperwork- we send $25.00 check (full cost to rent) and he will <br/>
 make sure we get the date of June 5th. I explained letterboxing - he is <br/>
very  familiar with caching. Said we could get a short activity temporary <br/>
permit to  place the boxes . . .He was very positive and seemed very <br/>
accommodating."<br/>
<br/>
There is camping on site, cabin rentals nearby &amp; hotels in  Peoria.<br/>
<br/>
I will update AQ with information in the coming days.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like we are now firm on date/location--  unless something unforeseen <br/>
arises.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great news!  I'm glad to see the cooperative park personnel.  I'm not sure why I'm getting only some of the group emails in my mailbox, but I came to the group to figure out what folks are replying to.<br/>
<br/>
I've selected an image to carve and as soon as I get my magnifying lamp set up, I'm going to attempt this - a very small stamp carved while wearing my new bifocals.  Or maybe just the lamp only.  I went online to see what world coin(s) I wanted, and I ended up selecting one I have from my year abroad.  I found some very old German coins, one from the area of my ancestors.  I might attempt that second.<br/>
<br/>
I hope all the talk about size &amp; inks doesn't discourage anyone.  I'm glad the 2009 theme, All Things Green, lent itself well to monochromatic designs.  I'm also happy that it was well received.  Not having frequent access to the park made it a little more challenging in determining distances between boxes, and hoping a good balance would be found.  I suggested a size, primarily for ease of planting, and possible reuse after the event.  Those who attended will recall all stamps were not all the same size.  Had I more access, I would have likely had more intriguing quests, but as it turned out I think each box was exactly where it was supposed to be planted.  How many of you remember The Minnesota Icon looking over his garden?  It was too perfect IMO and each box was planted as I pulled them from my bag.  Serendipity.  As for multi-colored stamps, I like having a few available    "at the shelter/table" which take a little time to work on, and give me the opportunity to chat with others.  I like them to complement the trail/themed boxes.  I think the biggest challenge for planners is to get the mix of trail boxes and shelter boxes right, so that no one feels stressed.<br/>
<br/>
As a carver, I like to have some suggested guidelines.  I tend to fret over every detail before I proclaim my work satisfactory.  Did I miss a post about logbooks?  I am prepared to send an entire package - stamp, ink, logbook, container, etc.  If the boxes are only temporary, I'll send a little extra to have it mailed home. <br/>
<br/>
A question for clarification - I think it was Acorn who mentioned the surprise of what we will find.  Rather than listing the name/country of each of our coins in a table or at AQ, would it be better to email you off list with the exact title, and let us all be surprised with the clue packet next June? I will refrain from listing my box; you can list it however you wish.  I plan to start carving soon and have it sent within a month or so.<br/>
<br/>
I am really looking forward to being a participant in 2010!<br/>
