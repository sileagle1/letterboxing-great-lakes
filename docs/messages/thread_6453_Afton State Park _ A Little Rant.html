Hello fellow boxers! Lighthouse Keeper here! So recently One Love Journeying<br>
and I have moved into the Twin Cities area; We have been exploring the metro<br>
boxes recently but seeing that it's such a beautiful day we wanted to do our<br>
first full day of boxing at a nearby State Park, we chose the site of the<br>
2008 Great Lakes Letterboxing location, Afton State Park. However we heard<br>
that there have been some problems with the Rangers at the park. Wondering<br>
if there were any further status updates on any of the other boxes?<br>
Additionally, we were wondering if anyone knew the clues to ArtGekko's<br>
boxes, since they are not posted on AQ.... any updates would be appreciated!<br>

my phone for clues anyway. ;) thanks again<br>

Some park districts DO realize that and ENCOURAGE boxing. I had a box that was discovered in the state Horicon Marsh vicinity by maintenance/mowing people. They took the time to contact me via the email in my box and they really encouraged me to replant it and keep it in the park. They had enjoyed reading the logbook and knew it had brought people to the area. The same thing happened many years ago at one of our local county parks.

I agree with you WiHi. That's why I tightly control who has access to my clues. It's my letterbox and I'll plant it wherever I damn well please : ) State Park or not, if people would be more careful where they post their clues, or how they write them, their boxes would last A LOT longer! <br>
I guess a lot of it depends on how you feel about your own boxes. Do you plant so that many people can easily find it? Do you try to make things challenging? Nothing wrong with drive-byes in my opinion, but unless you do some creative clue writing drive-byes usually don't last for too long.

The series of 6 I planted for the gathering last fall still aren't posted anywhere and probably will remain W.O.M. It doesn't matter to me if only 1 person a year finds them, I want them to LAST. How many of you have had the awesome experience of opening a box that's been planted for 2, 3, 4 or more years and been the 3rd, 2nd, maybe even FF! I absolutely love the idea of the box sitting unopened, untouched for a long period of time and then one special day there you are seeing something that hasn't seen the light of day for years. Think of what has gone on in your life during that span of time and how long a year really is, or more for that fact. That box has been a silent<br>

Hello fellow boxers! Lighthouse Keeper here! So recently One Love Journeying<br>
and I have moved into the Twin Cities area; We have been exploring the metro<br>
boxes recently but seeing that it's such a beautiful day we wanted to do our<br>
first full day of boxing at a nearby State Park, we chose the site of the<br>
2008 Great Lakes Letterboxing location, Afton State Park. However we heard<br>
that there have been some problems with the Rangers at the park. Wondering<br>
if there were any further status updates on any of the other boxes?<br>
Additionally, we were wondering if anyone knew the clues to ArtGekko's<br>
boxes, since they are not posted on AQ.... any updates would be appreciated!<br>

Some park districts DO realize that and ENCOURAGE boxing.  I had a box that<br>
was discovered in the state Horicon Marsh vicinity by maintenance/mowing<br>
people.  They took the time to contact me via the email in my box and they<br>
really encouraged me to replant it and keep it in the park.  They had<br>
enjoyed reading the logbook and knew it had brought people to the area.  The<br>
same thing happened many years ago at one of our local county parks.  The<br>
ranger took the time to look up letterboxing on-line, contact me, send me a<br>
photo of the box in his office, and then REPLANTED it for me.  He thought it<br>
was a neat hobby and appreciated the type of people it brought to the park.<br>
Too bad MN doesn't have the same attitude...<br>

I learned a lot from your email, especially having just had a box disappear<br>
over the winter.<br>
<br>
However, I think park districts, etc. are really dumb--letterboxing brings<br>
the people out to the parks and forest preserves and that helps keep them<br>
open!<br>
<br>
Happy boxing,<br>

I agree with you WiHi. That's why I tightly control who has access to my<br>
clues. It's my letterbox and I'll plant it wherever I damn well please : )<br>
State Park or not, if people would be more careful where they post their<br>
clues, or how they write them, their boxes would last A LOT longer! <br>
I guess a lot of it depends on how you feel about your own boxes. Do you<br>
plant so that many people can easily find it? Do you try to make things<br>
challenging? Nothing wrong with drive-byes in my opinion, but unless you do<br>
some creative clue writing drive-byes usually don't last for too long. Also,<br>
posting the name of the park in your clues or TITLE of your clues is a dead<br>
giveaway to park rangers, etc., who might be savvy in finding letterboxes.<br>
I'm not pointing the finger at anyone or saying they've made a bad choice,<br>
it's their box, but stealth means more to me than just making sure no one is<br>
looking while I retrieve a box. Some of my favorite boxes are in places<br>
where THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE! That is half the fun. The series of 6 I<br>
planted for the gathering last fall still aren't posted anywhere and<br>
probably will remain W.O.M. It doesn't matter to me if only 1 person a year<br>
finds them, I want them to LAST. How many of you have had the awesome<br>
experience of opening a box that's been planted for 2, 3, 4 or more years<br>
and been the 3rd, 2nd, maybe even FF! I absolutely love the idea of the box<br>
sitting unopened, untouched for a long period of time and then one special<br>
day there you are seeing something that hasn't seen the light of day for<br>
years. Think of what has gone on in your life during that span of time and<br>
how long a year really is, or more for that fact. That box has been a silent<br>
sentinel waiting for you to open it up and look back in time so to speak.<br>
Who was there last? Do they even still box? Have you ever heard of them?<br>
Hopefully they left a little message for you to read. <br>

Good to hear from you!  We're pretty sure rangers stole our boxes and never<br>
had courtesy to contact us (unlike WI park personnel).  Afton is not a very<br>
friendly place in our opinion.  MN parks in general seem pretty uptight &<br>
controlling.  If by any chance you find our boxes (on trail or in ranger<br>
office), let us know!<br>

With a little creativity you can make your boxes last a long time in the wild. Some of my favorite finds are boxes where the clues were hard to decipher or the hike was grueling for one reason or another. For instance, Leapin' Lizards has a box in Southern MN that requires you to, well, I don't want to spoil it for others, let's just say that your legs will BURN when you get to the top of a certain bluff (I think I rested at least 5 times and did it in 90 degree weather in July).<br>

Do you mean the parks or the boxers? : )<br>

Some park districts DO realize that and ENCOURAGE boxing.  I had a box that<br>
was discovered in the state Horicon Marsh vicinity by maintenance/mowing<br>
people.  They took the time to contact me via the email in my box and they<br>
really encouraged me to replant it and keep it in the park.  They had<br>
enjoyed reading the logbook and knew it had brought people to the area.  The<br>
same thing happened many years ago at one of our local county parks.  The<br>
ranger took the time to look up letterboxing on-line, contact me, send me a<br>
photo of the box in his office, and then REPLANTED it for me.  He thought it<br>
was a neat hobby and appreciated the type of people it brought to the park.<br>
Too bad MN doesn't have the same attitude...<br>

I learned a lot from your email, especially having just had a box disappear<br>
over the winter.<br>
<br>
However, I think park districts, etc. are really dumb--letterboxing brings<br>
the people out to the parks and forest preserves and that helps keep them<br>
open!<br>
<br>
Happy boxing,<br>

I agree with you WiHi. That's why I tightly control who has access to my<br>
clues. It's my letterbox and I'll plant it wherever I damn well please : )<br>
State Park or not, if people would be more careful where they post their<br>
clues, or how they write them, their boxes would last A LOT longer! <br>
I guess a lot of it depends on how you feel about your own boxes. Do you<br>
plant so that many people can easily find it? Do you try to make things<br>
challenging? Nothing wrong with drive-byes in my opinion, but unless you do<br>
some creative clue writing drive-byes usually don't last for too long. Also,<br>
posting the name of the park in your clues or TITLE of your clues is a dead<br>
giveaway to park rangers, etc., who might be savvy in finding letterboxes.<br>
I'm not pointing the finger at anyone or saying they've made a bad choice,<br>
it's their box, but stealth means more to me than just making sure no one is<br>
looking while I retrieve a box. Some of my favorite boxes are in places<br>
where THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE! That is half the fun. The series of 6 I<br>
planted for the gathering last fall still aren't posted anywhere and<br>
probably will remain W.O.M. It doesn't matter to me if only 1 person a year<br>
finds them, I want them to LAST. How many of you have had the awesome<br>
experience of opening a box that's been planted for 2, 3, 4 or more years<br>
and been the 3rd, 2nd, maybe even FF! I absolutely love the idea of the box<br>
sitting unopened, untouched for a long period of time and then one special<br>
day there you are seeing something that hasn't seen the light of day for<br>
years. Think of what has gone on in your life during that span of time and<br>
how long a year really is, or more for that fact. That box has been a silent<br>
sentinel waiting for you to open it up and look back in time so to speak.<br>
Who was there last? Do they even still box? Have you ever heard of them?<br>
Hopefully they left a little message for you to read. <br>

Good to hear from you!  We're pretty sure rangers stole our boxes and never<br>
had courtesy to contact us (unlike WI park personnel).  Afton is not a very<br>
friendly place in our opinion.  MN parks in general seem pretty uptight &<br>
controlling.  If by any chance you find our boxes (on trail or in ranger<br>
office), let us know!<br>

Hello fellow boxers! Lighthouse Keeper here! So recently One Love Journeying<br>
and I have moved into the Twin Cities area; We have been exploring the metro<br>
boxes recently but seeing that it's such a beautiful day we wanted to do our<br>
first full day of boxing at a nearby State Park, we chose the site of the<br>
2008 Great Lakes Letterboxing location, Afton State Park. However we heard<br>
that there have been some problems with the Rangers at the park. Wondering<br>
if there were any further status updates on any of the other boxes?<br>
Additionally, we were wondering if anyone knew the clues to ArtGekko's<br>
boxes, since they are not posted on AQ.... any updates would be appreciated!<br>
<br>
Lighthouse Keeper and One Love Journeying<br>
<br>
p.s. my email (and these posts) go directly to my phone, so feel free to<br>
respond any time! Due to a lack of ink in our printer, we will be relying on<br>
my phone for clues anyway. ;) thanks again<br>
