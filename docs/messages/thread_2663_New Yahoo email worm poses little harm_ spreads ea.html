Security teams at Symantec have identified a relatively benign, but <br>
unconventional worm that can exploit a vulnerability in Yahoo's web <br>
mail service without any user initiation.<br>
<br>
<br>
JS.Yamanner@m spreads to the user's email contacts when he or she <br>
opens an infected email, according to a Symantec advisory issued <br>
today. In order for the worm to propagate, the user does not have to <br>
click on any attachments.<br>
<br>
Despite its ability to easily spread, the worm  sent as part of an <br>
HTML email containing JavaScript  poses little threat, the advisory <br>
said. Symantec defined its containment and removal as "easy" and <br>
named it a Level 2 threat, the second least severe.<br>
<br>
"This worm is a twist on the traditional mass-mailing worms that we <br>
have seen in recent years," said Dave Cole, director of Symantec <br>
Security Response. "Unlike its predecessors, which would require the <br>
user to open an attachment in order to launch and propagate, (the <br>
worm) makes use of a previously unknown security holein order to <br>
spread to other Yahoo users, and (it) harvests user information for <br>
possible future attacks."<br>
<br>
Once the email is opened, the worm exploits a flaw in Yahoo Mail to <br>
run a script normally blocked by the service, according to the <br>
advisory. The user's browser is re-directed to display the URL <br>
http://]www.av3.net/index.htm, not believed to be malicious. The worm <br>
then copies itself to other addresses in the user's Yahoo email <br>
folders if the addresses end with "@yahoo.com" or "@yahoogroups.com."<br>
<br>
The infected emails contain a subject that reads "New Graphic Site" <br>
and a body that reads: "this is a test." The messages come from av3<br>
[at]yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Because there is no patch available, users are advised to keep their <br>
anti-virus software updated and to block any emails originating from <br>
the bogus sender.<br>

A Yahoo spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment <br>
today.<br>
