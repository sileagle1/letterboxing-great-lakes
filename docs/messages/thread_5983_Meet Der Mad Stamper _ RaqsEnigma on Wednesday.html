Der Mad Stamper was one of the very first involved in the hobby and he was instrumental in establishing the letterboxing.org site.  RaqsEnigma is from Illinois, but relocated to Oregon two(?) years ago. Some of you may have met her at the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering in WI or when you visited Portland.  They are in currently in IL to visit Raq's family and attend a wedding. <br/>
