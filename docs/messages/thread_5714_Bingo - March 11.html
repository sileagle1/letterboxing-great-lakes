As I suspected, the General Terms are running ahead of the average expected.  Letters are fairly evenly distributed at this time.  I'm hoping that more Exchanges get called (hint to SC!)<br/>
<br/>
If you are running even with the calls, you should have 13 words are your cards.  Of course that means you won't win until ALL the words are called if that's the case!  However I think that there are some players that are ahead of the power curve.<br/>

Main point is that 53% of words have been called.  General terms are ahead of that with 62% already being called.  Events are even, but Letterboxes and Exchanges are below the overall average.<br/>
