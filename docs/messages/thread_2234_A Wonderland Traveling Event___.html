                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have them packaged up with a logbook I made ready to go out if anyone asks for them.  I listed them at the Event Boxes site and at this site in the Event Stamps file.  I'm hoping now that spring is around the corner and gathering will start back up, somebody may be interested.  I do think though that part of the fun of doing a series like that is carving the stamps around your own theme, so I'm not really sure if it will take off or not.  Back a few years when there were many areas holding their first gatherings and there were not enough carvers to provide event stamps, it was more common to send them from another area.  Now most events have more stamps than they know what to do with just from attendee contributions.<br>
<br>
We'll see...<br>
