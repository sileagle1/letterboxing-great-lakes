such a good day!!!  On our first "quest" (as the kids put it), we got <br>
to meet Wormy Wander!!!  It was so cool!!!  We did 5 letterboxes that <br>
day, and found a hitchhiker as well!!!  This was so awesome!!! By the <br>
4th one we did, we finally agreed on a trail name... "Brat Pack".  My <br>
mom has been printed stacks and stacks of clues for anywhere and <br>
everywhere and we plan on doing several on the weekends.  The kids love <br>
it so much, and each have their own stamp.  I thank Wormy Wanderer for <br>
letting us know about this group, and we are looking forward to meeting <br>
you all either through gatherings or even out and about!! =)  Happy <br>
letterboxing!! =)<br>

I were when we found our first few boxes.  Oh heck,<br>
we're still excited when we find boxes.  If only we<br>

everything! :)<br>
