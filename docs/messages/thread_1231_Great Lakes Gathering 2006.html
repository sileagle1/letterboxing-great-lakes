With all the talk about gatherings, I thought I'd better get my foot <br>
in for the 2006 GL Gathering...<br>
<br>
Since we're bouncing back and forth across the GL region, I'm <br>
presuming somewhere west, say like WI, would be next in line to host <br>
the gathering.  (Sorry IN or OH, you're in 2007!)  So I'm proposing <br>
that the 2006 GL gathering be in West Bend, WI in late June 2006.  <br>
There are a TON of areas to hold the gathering, a TON of spots to hide <br>
boxes, lots of camping and hotel space, and TONS of boxes already in <br>
the area!  We got so much here, many of you would probably want to <br>
make it at least a 3-day stay!  I already got a theme too, but I'm <br>
open to suggestions.  My idea is "Letterboxingfest!" or <br>
just "Boxingfest!" to add to all the "fests" we have here in Milwaukee.<br>

~Themes?  Summerboxfest 2006?  I will do my very best to get to this one.  I might know <br>
in a couple of weeks if we can make the GL 2005 Gathering.  Keeping my inky fingers <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This definitely sounds like one possibility and the offer is <br>
appreciated, but I would like to open it up to the entire group to <br>
see if there might be others also interested in hosting the 2006 GL <br>
Gathering in their area.  In order to allow some of the newer folks <br>
who may not have attended a gathering in the past to get a feel for <br>
what is involved, I would like to suggest holding off with a <br>
definitive plan as to location and date for 2006 until after this <br>
year's June gathering.<br>
<br>
When I began the annual GL Gathering, the intention was that it would <br>
move around within the region from one geographic area to another, <br>
hoping that it would end up near everyone at one time or another.  I <br>
realize that the state of WI has not hosted the gathering in the <br>
past, but last year's IL gathering was just over the border -- just a <br>
little over an hour from the Milwaukee area.  I am also considering <br>
that for some time now there have been enough letterboxers in WI to <br>
support intermediate gatherings throughout the year, giving <br>
opportunity for people who are not able to travel to attend an <br>
event.  In other areas where there are not as many boxers, the only <br>
opportunity to attend an event is the annual GL Gathering.<br>
<br>
If I remember correctly, at last year's gathering the 2005 event was <br>
put up for discussion, looking for location and host volunteers, and <br>
the reason it came back to MI a second time is because Delirium is <br>
the only one who volunteered.  But letterboxing within the GL region <br>
has grown a lot since that time and there may be others interested in <br>
hosting the annual event in their area.<br>
<br>
It was also the intention that various people would take turns <br>
hosting the annual regional event.  As much as I enjoyed hosting the <br>
2003 gathering and would have been willing to do so every year, I <br>
felt it would foster unity and involvment within the region if <br>
various people hosted the gathering from one year to the next.  This <br>
is the reason that I handed over the reins after hosting the first <br>
gathering and the reason I did not step in this year when Delirium <br>
had to bow out.  I think it is only fair as we look forward to the <br>
2006 gathering to open it up to anyone who might be interested in <br>
taking a turn.  Of course, if there is nobody else interested, I am <br>
grateful that some of the veterans are willing to step up time and <br>
again to share their experience.<br>
<br>
As for the date...  there is never going to be a date that works for <br>
everyone.  When the original gathering was held the Saturday before <br>
Memorial Day, it had been the intention that would become "the <br>
weekend" on an annual basis and people would be able to plan on that <br>
date.  For whatever reason last year's event was moved to the 2nd <br>
week in June and now this year we are at the 3rd week in June.  The <br>
original premise behind holding the gathering at the end of May was <br>
to avoid the flurry of activities that typically vie for June <br>
weekends.  Graduations, weddings and Father's Day are all big June <br>
weekend events that typically cannot be rescheduled, and which most <br>
people would give priority over a letterbox gathering.  While it is <br>
certainly a possibility to put the date up for a vote on a year-by-<br>
year basis, it is easier for people to plan ahead if there is an <br>
established weekend that stays consistent from one year to the next.<br>

I'm thinking that we should maybe hold off a decision for 2006 for a<br>
couple of months. There are so many new letterboxers in our midst who<br>
have not had the Gathering "experience" and I suspect that after they<br>
attend one or more of the many events both large and small that are<br>
planned for the next several months they will have some good ideas and<br>
a better handle on what goes into planning events like these.<br>
I think we may see some new volunteers emerge who can take the group<br>
in even different directions re format and activities.<br>
And it may evolve into a series of smaller gatherings in scattered<br>
locales which could more easily draw boxers who cannot drive great<br>
distances but who might be interested in being involved on a small scale.<br>
<br>
Anyone else with thoughts on this?<br>

There are some great stories over the past few years of events like<br>
that to which you allude taking place with associated letterboxing<br>
activities.<br>
Creative engagement opportunities certainly come to mind.<br>
