I was winter camping on Fri. evening through Sun. morning.  I was prepared to drive down to Urbana with Fungus Woman.  The weathermen were issuing a hazardous driving condition warning.  In our area, the snow was melting and then refreezing; black ice conditions perfect for spin outs.  There was limited visibility on the roads.  We just didn't want to end up in a ditch or one of many fatalities in one of those multi-car pile ups.  <br>
So, we let common sense prevail, but common sense isn't fun!  From the photos, it looks like we missed a good time. <br>
