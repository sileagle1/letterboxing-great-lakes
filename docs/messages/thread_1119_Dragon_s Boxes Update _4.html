Again, for those interested (esp. Speedsquare):<br>
<br>
Triangles! Triangles! Everywhere! is now fully operational.  Check out<br>
the updated webpage now!  For those of you thinking you might never be<br>
able to do this series - here's your best chance!  The box to box<br>
(letterboxer) clues are the easiest they've ever been! Even LL John<br>
could do them ;-)<br>
<br>
Weapons of Math Instruction - now all cleaned up and in much better<br>
shape than the mushy trails you have to walk on to get them!<br>
<br>
County Cross Country - ditto (I wonder why?)<br>
<br>
Environmental Classroom - the rock that was frozen in place so you<br>
couldn't get to the box has now thawed!  Go for it!<br>
<br>
One very surprising item worth mentioning was that I was finally able<br>
to check on the report that Mathman 11 was missing and I actually<br>
found everything in place!!!  The only problem is that it relies on<br>
some park features that the park changed right after the box was<br>
placed, so plans are underway to compensate for the changes in the<br>
park so this great box can be activated again.  In the meantime, if<br>
you think you know where it is located, or tried to find it in the<br>
past and thought it was lost, the box itself, now camouflaged taped,<br>
is right where it should be.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I changed my log-in name on the LBNA site from Tim to The<br>
Dragon so you can search for my boxes without wondering which Tim I am<br>
(apparently the one with P103).<br>
<br>
Get out and box!<br>
Dragon<br>
(who's wishing he had another week off of school like this one!)<br>

Thanks, Dragon!  I printed the "easy" clues last night.  I am bringing my protractor, but I <br>
cannot seem to find my calculator to follow the student clues.  Since I'll be pretty busy <br>
getting 8 boxes (1 on Saturday and 7 on Sunday)  I'll have to skip playing in the sandbox.  <br>
I will be back to get the Weapons of Math Instruction and Mathman boxes, and of course, <br>
many others' boxes.<br>
<br>
speedsquare, heading out the door for some fun ...<br>

Uh oh!  You're gonna need a scientific calculator!  Maybe I should but<br>
one of those in the boxes too....<br>
