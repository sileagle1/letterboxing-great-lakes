                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all! (Feel free to offer advice on this if you wish)Anyhow, I have<br>
placed several boxes in the last six months and have been noticing<br>
that nearly everyone finding them are part of a group of people from a<br>
small town south of where I live (a group of nearly 50 people in<br>
teams). Apparently, they are doing some sort of a letterboxing<br>
contests. Fine. However, I have been feeling uneasy for about two<br>
months now. My clues have ranged from really easy to difficult, but<br>
the same people keep finding my boxes. At first I thought it was a<br>
coincidence, but then had a nagging feeling that my clues and<br>
locations were being shared amongst these peoplew when I would have<br>
groups finding my letterboxes in two days/ same day, week, and<br>
everyone got the clues perfectly. I have also received many emails for<br>
 from some of them. Today, I found out that this group is sharing<br>
clues, locations, and exactly where the boxes are, and they have even<br>
posted a phone number hotline to help find boxes. Nearly all my boxes<br>
have been compromised, as well as almost all of the boxes in the<br>
mid-Michigan/Lansing/ Grand Rapids, MI locations. To make matters<br>
worse, it has been posted on the internet and in the town paper with<br>
contacts and phone numbers.<br>

this breach and lack of honesty involved. My wife thinks we should<br>
pull all of the boxes and clues and let them know why. In addition,<br>
should I directly contact these people. I'm really frustrated as I<br>
have already had several stamps and logbooks ruined from these groups.<br>
Any ideas how to approach this? I don't want to stop carving and<br>

I think it might be a good idea to pull the boxes until this little contest ends and the whole thing blows over.  I wonder where they got this idea?  Hope it doesn't happen in our area!  It seems like more and more our beloved hobby is taking unfortunate hits.  I don't want to be selfish and I want other people to enjoy letterboxing as much as I have, but I just wish that discretion and respect would be practiced more frequently.<br>

Maybe some national magazine published a letterboxing article with bad<br>

Any trail names associated with this group we should be on the lookout<br>

the beginning of the clues to tell people what is inappropriate.  A<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The current situation in CT, and this (continuing?) episode in<br>
mid-Michigan call attention to the changing face of letterboxing.<br>
<br>
It isn't the same pastime that captivated many of us over the last<br>
several years.<br>
<br>
I'm among the holdouts who clung to the 'good old days'. But, in spite<br>
of that longing for what 'was', I am resigning myself to the realities<br>
of the new letterboxing.<br>
What does this mean? More and more boxers are taking their clues<br>
off-line. Word-of-mouth distribution becomes a safer way to<br>
disseminate special box information. Subscription to limited<br>
distribution cluebooks is another emerging option.<br>
<br>
I have archived boxes -- although some of the actual boxes are still<br>
in place. I have pulled clues. I have retired boxes. And I find myself<br>
less inclined to spend time carving and creating stamps and looking<br>
for special places when a quick read of this board and others tells me<br>
that some newer seekers are playing a different game than the one I<br>
understood.<br>
<br>
Contests, team-boxing, and sponsorships are closer to the norm than we<br>
ever might have expected. But, that's what we're seeing.<br>
<br>
Is it bad? It depends on your point of view, of course. But, make no<br>
mistake, it is not the same.<br>
<br>
If I were in mid-Michigan, I'd probably pull the boxes. The seekers<br>
are playing just half of the game, if that. And they're not using the<br>
same rules that were generally followed in the past.<br>
Frankly, I can't imagine that it's particularly rewarding to be led by<br>
the hand to a box. But as I said, I'm old school.<br>
<br>
Like our friends in CT who are enduring a rash of vandalism, we can<br>
hope that the thrill of gang-boxing will fade when there are no longer<br>
any new boxes to find. Perhaps then we can see some semblance of an<br>
earlier brand of letterboxing. Don't hold your breath.<br>
<br>
Yes, the times are a-changing.<br>

 Maybe some national magazine published a letterboxing article with bad<br>
 info.<br>
 <br>
 Any trail names associated with this group we should be on the lookout<br>
 for?  Other than pulling your clues, maybe you could put a message at<br>
 the beginning of the clues to tell people what is inappropriate.  A<br>
 letter or phone call to the paper might help too.<br>

is <br>

Letterboxing has brought our family much closer together. We spend <br>
more <br>
time together now and have seen some amazing places that we didn't <br>

make them available only through special means, as soon as one of them<br>

<br>
If you want to hide your clues, the easiest and most effective way<br>
I've seen is to force seekers to use the "contact the placer" link to<br>
request the clues from you.  When we had the scare over the boxes<br>
around Livingston Cty with the news article, this is what I did and it<br>
worked well.<br>

3) I would suggest putting an opening paragraph to all your clues<br>

wording, I'll post it here.<br>

I know some of you have participated in giving interviews, so don't <br>
take this personally...  I really think the first step is to quit <br>
encouraging all the publicity.  I know some people think it is better <br>
to have an experienced person participate in an article, but an <br>
alternate approach that I've used is to explain why I WON'T <br>
participate in an article someone is writing.  I have taken the time <br>
to tell the reporter why many think publicity is a bad idea, what has <br>
resulted from some articles and that if they DO insist on writing an <br>
article that they should stress the secrecy and discretion aspect.<br>
<br>
I agree with what Beetle wrote recently - letterboxing is something <br>
that started in England as a challenge for adults, so I am <br>
disappointed to see this turning into a "kid's activity", with <br>
articles (and now even corporate ads!) appearing almost quarterly in <br>
Family Fun magazine.  We have taken our nieces and nephews out <br>
several times, but it is not as a kid's activity, but an adult <br>
activity that they get to do with us.  They have learned compass <br>
skills, problem-solving, etc.  We have created boxes that families <br>
with kids can easily do, but I've had at least 2 boxes visited <br>
by "Play Groups" consisting of 3-4 adults and 15-20 preschoolers.  <br>
Yikes!<br>
<br>
One easy way to take your clues off-line, is to list them in the <br>
Files section on this message board.  Another more involved appraoch <br>
would be to start your own website or blog using one of the free <br>
sites available (or start your own Yahoo group to host your clues), <br>
and link to it from this site.  You can also then give the link to <br>
whoever you are comfortable sharing it with.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry to see this happening, since I really like the convenience <br>
of finding almost all clues on the letterboxing.org site, no matter <br>
where we travel (although in the past year or so we've also had to <br>
check AQ, for the people that won't use the original letterboxing <br>
site).  I plan to keep my clues on the LBNA site until a problem <br>
develops in our area.  If it does, I'll move them to a private <br>
website that I already have developed. However in addition to <br>
excluding the troublemakers, that tactic will most likely also <br>
exclude people that may be traveling through the area.<br>

This is part of the Sunfield SPY's program in Sunfield, MI. I believe that Fish's Card Room is responsible for this, so you might want to contact them through the LBNA sight. Anyhow, I am not sure if clues to your excellent boxes are being shared, its just that I know mine are (and some others). I'm sure the group is not malicious, but I have been finding my boxes left carelessly in the open by group members, some have been damaged, and info is being published in the Sunfield Sentinel. In regards to this group, there has been some good, however, the articles being written, the hotline, and the large groups being taken out to find boxes alarms me.<br>

<br>
Letterboxing isn't "exclusive", nor should it be.  But it is becoming <br>
more well-known, and with that comes the increased chance of negative <br>
things happening, same as anything else that has increased publicity.  <br>
Chances are, the hype will die down after a while and it will go back <br>

  How unfortunate! That really stinks! I agree with your wife. I think it<br>
might be a good idea to pull the boxes until this little contest ends and<br>
the whole thing blows over. I wonder where they got this idea? Hope it<br>
doesn't happen in our area! It seems like more and more our beloved hobby is<br>
taking unfortunate hits. I don't want to be selfish and I want other people<br>
to enjoy letterboxing as much as I have, but I just wish that discretion and<br>
respect would be practiced more frequently.<br>

  posted a phone number hotline to help find boxes. Nearly all my boxes<br>
  have been compromised, as well as almost all of the boxes in the<br>
  mid-Michigan/Lansing/ Grand Rapids, MI locations. To make matters<br>
  worse, it has been posted on the internet and in the town paper with<br>
  contacts and phone numbers.<br>
<br>
  It appears we have some unscrupulous letterboxers out there with<br>
  disregard to the rules.I have thought about confronting them about<br>
  this breach and lack of honesty involved. My wife thinks we should<br>
  pull all of the boxes and clues and let them know why. In addition,<br>
  should I directly contact these people. I'm really frustrated as I<br>
  have already had several stamps and logbooks ruined from these groups.<br>
  Any ideas how to approach this? I don't want to stop carving and<br>
  planting but this just rips!<br>

Atom, since you are in communication with someone perhaps this would be  more <br>
for you.<br>
 <br>
I remember way back in Junior High and High School that I loved scavenger  <br>
hunts. I partook in many and many different kinds and things always got heated  <br>
to see who could do everything on the list -- the fastest.<br>
 <br>
This sounds like a giant scavenger hunt where things can get carried away  <br>
(ie someone shredding his pants and having to throw them away). <br>
 <br>
Perhaps the organizers just didn't think this one out to its fullest (as  <br>
when I was in junior high we were handed disposable cameras and had to take our  <br>
picture with or doing different things. One thing, "have your picture taken <br>
with  a grandmother" sounds innocent enough until we were asking every 30 and 40 <br>
 somethings if they were a grandmother. That didn't go over to well  either).<br>
 <br>
As this has a time limit of "all summer" I would be asking if they are  <br>
planning on doing this every summer or if this is a one time deal.<br>
 <br>
IF they are planning it again ask that they plant their own boxes  (which it <br>
sounds like they have) but have the kids limited to ONLY their  boxes. They <br>
WILL NOT get points for boxes that is not their  own. <br>
 <br>
If they are truly into letterboxing outside of this scavenger hunt they  <br>
could find a Spring Chick box or a Familyof6 box but it would not count  towards <br>
their total tally in the game. Therefore they wouldn't be as prone to  rushing <br>
from one box to another compromising its whereabouts.   <br>
 <br>
If the kids or teams are not limited to finding only their own boxes, or  <br>
only boxes in this county or that then there are no limits to where or how many  <br>
or whose boxes could be collected for "first place" I mean there are 32,000  <br>
boxes on LBNA you have to have some parameters.<br>

before jumping to conclusions. This is not a bunch of kids running<br>
around trashing all these boxes and leaving them in discourse. This is<br>
a very respectful group of adults having a good time getting into<br>
something we could stay into for a long time. My father<br>
(JustHappy2CYa) had gotten so addicted to letterboxing he has found<br>
over 100 boxes in 3 months, he has also placed up to 4 boxes (he won't<br>
tell me about his new project). We all do everything in accordance to<br>
all letterboxing standards. I see no problem with a group of 10 new<br>
letterboxers from the same area starting at the same time. We have<br>
done nothing wrong in my eyes.<br>
