Doglvrs, the skull, Spartan fans, the hoot owl, pale puppy posse and <br>
Billy Bad Boy were all in attendance. Spartan fans brought an <br>
additional package which made the trails a little harder for them but <br>
the hunt was on! <br>
<br>
We found two stamps hidden in honor of the event as well as tackling <br>
Azoboxes "Breakfast Elves". "Too the rescue" will have to be rehidden <br>
as Ms. Doglvrs informed me that it was in the middle of a poison ivy <br>
patch! It didn't look like any I had ever seen before but she assured <br>
me it was. But Spartan fan had pants on so she took the plunge! Bird <br>
dog was a delight to everyone. These clues will be put on the LB <br>
sight for everyone to enjoy soon.  The Breakfast elves had a little <br>
different spin. Snap was safe but his house was damp. We wiped him <br>
out as best as possible and returned him. We didn't notice on the <br>
clues that Crackle was MIA but because we didn't know we searched for <br>
him anyway and some how found him and rescued him for the jaws of a <br>
toothy creature. The monster ate part of his hat! Pop's house was <br>
completely flooded! Azobox please contact me off line so I can return <br>
them home to you. <br>
<br>
It was really great to see my old friends and meet a few new ones too!<br>
