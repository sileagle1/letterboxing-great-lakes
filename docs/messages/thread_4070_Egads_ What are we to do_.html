lashing. When you said she posted on the big site, I thought "ohhh she <br>
don't know what she got into!". Those people can be nasty! Well I <br>
guess it is a lesson for us all, don't leave anything valuable in the <br>
car! Travel light when you go out so you can put your purse in your <br>
backpack, and make sure your cell is charged before you go out. It's a <br>
nasty world out there, but you can't sit in your house with the shades <br>
drawn forever. I do feel sorry that her first time out was so <br>
horrible. <br>
