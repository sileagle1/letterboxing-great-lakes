                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a coincidence . . . I just emailed this same person about this same box.  My husband and I will be headed to Orange Beach, AL in late April/early May and have started planning what boxes we will find when there.  <br>
<br>
The boxer did email me back (via AQ) and told me that they couldn't locate the clues, but would keep searching and would email them to me when found. I would just send another message thru AQ and hopefully you will get a response.  <br>
<br>
If/When I get a copy of the clues, I would be more than happy to share.  When are you planning to be in Gulf Shores?<br>
