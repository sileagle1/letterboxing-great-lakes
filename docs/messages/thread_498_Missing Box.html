Timbertoes, I know EXACTLY how you feel!!  I was so proud of my first <br/>
carving attempt and first box placement.  It really upset me when <br/>
FOOW1 disappeared...the only thing left behind was the pencil that I <br/>
had put into the box (which, BTW, was not even hot pink or <br/>
anything...just a plain white rubbermaid lid).  I must have gone back <br/>
a half a dozen times thinking someone would replace it.  After <br/>
my "period of mourning" I decided I wouldn't let a box thief have the <br/>
upper hand, so I went back and replaced it.  So far, so good.  I <br/>
still feel bad, though.<br/>
