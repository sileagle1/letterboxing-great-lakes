I know this topic has passed through the either recently, but I just <br/>
got back from the store and was overwhelmed by the choices.  Who can <br/>
recommend a specific brand of wipe that can be used to clean off <br/>
stamps?  Do they come individually wrapped?  Can any be purchased at a <br/>
dollar store?  Some say scented and some say unscented and some say <br/>
neither.  And I don't need to buy a thousand of them anyway.  <br/>

I have found that a wet paper towel in a zip lock bag works just <br/>
fine!  They can be changed as they need to be and and they take up <br/>
very little space in a back pack!<br/>
