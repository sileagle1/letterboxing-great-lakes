  From Wikipedia:<br>
<br>
  A fish boil is a Great Lakes culinary tradition in areas of Wisconsin (USA), <br>
  with large Scandinavian populations, particularly Door County, Port Wing and <br>
  Port Washington, Wisconsin. The meal consists of Lake Michigan or Lake <br>
  Superior whitefish (though lake trout can be used), with other ingredients.<br>
<br>
  The fish is typically caught by local fishermen, cut into small chunks and <br>
  cooked in boiling water with red potatoes. Some boilers add onions as well. <br>
  Salt is the only seasoning used, and used only to raise the specific gravity <br>
  of the water.<br>
  The cooking of the fish is an elaborate presentation. Restaurants typically <br>
  ask that patrons arrive a half hour early to witness the boiling. The fish <br>
  and potatoes are placed in a cast-iron kettle. When the water comes to a <br>
  boil the potatoes, kept in a wire basket, are lowered in.<br>
<br>
  The fish are then placed in another wire basket and lowered in. When the <br>
  fish oils rise to the top of the pot, the boiler will add a small amount of <br>
  kerosene to the flames. The increase in flames causes a boilover, the fish <br>
  oils spill over the side of the pot, and the fish is done. <br>
