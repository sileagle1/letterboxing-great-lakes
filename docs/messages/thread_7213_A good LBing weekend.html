Took the train up to Chicago yesterday, but no boxing involved, just a fun day in the city!<br>
Maybe this coming weekend...<br>

It must have been a good weekend for letterboxing all over the country.  I got a report that someone found one of the boxes that I planted in Texas in 2006, I got a report that someone was first finder on a box I planted in Florida earlier this year and Martini Man got a report that our recently escaped zombies were tracked down in Wisconsin!<br>

We had a good day too.... we more than doubled our box find count of all of October in one day!!<br>
<br>
As Clark Griswold told his son after jumping the car 50 feet, "nothing to be proud of russ." As we only found 2 boxes in the entire month of October -- and 5 today!! UGH it's been a slow couple of months.<br>

It must have been a good weekend for letterboxing all over the country. I got a report that someone found one of the boxes that I planted in Texas in 2006, I got a report that someone was first finder on a box I planted in Florida earlier this year and Martini Man got a report that our recently escaped zombies were tracked down in Wisconsin!<br>
