P.S.  Make that 68 months for us after today.  We attempted a 9-boxes series and although we found all 9, only could stamp into 7.  The icy grip of old man winter had securely entombed 2 of the boxes, so we'll have to return after the spring melt.  We were sinking up past our knees in snow at some points, but it was good to be out on a sunny, "warmish" day (temperatures in the 30s).<br/>

&gt; Well I think either planting or finding counts as "keeping <br/>
healthy".  Planting is actually probably even better!<br/>

&gt; P.S.  Make that 68 months for us after today.  We attempted a 9-<br/>
boxes series and although we found all 9, only could stamp into 7.  <br/>
The icy grip of old man winter had securely entombed 2 of the boxes, <br/>
so we'll have to return after the spring melt.  We were sinking up <br/>
past our knees in snow at some points, but it was good to be out on a <br/>
sunny, "warmish" day (temperatures in the 30s).<br/>

&gt; &gt; We have been pretty good about finding at least one box per month <br/>
since we started in January 2006, but alas we too didn't get any <br/>
finds in December 2008. :(  The only other month we have zero <br/>
finds is November 2007, which is when we hosted our Letterboxing <br/>
Wedding event.  But we did plant boxes in both of those months, <br/>
so they weren't completely letterboxing-free...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We went out yesterday and enjoyed the "warm" temps outdoors.  <br/>
Unfortunately, there's still quite a bit of snow, and we were <br/>
thwarted on a few boxes.  We still managed to find 3 though, and <br/>
apparently just missed Gibson Girl up in Grayslake by a couple of <br/>
hours at one box!<br/>

&gt; &gt; 67 months in a row.... WoW!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I really thought that we would have 26 in a row. However, in <br/>
going back and <br/>
&gt; &gt; looking at my records I see we had 2 months without finding a <br/>
single box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; January 2008 &amp; December 2008.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Though I did plant 5 boxes in December.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The sad thing is December 2008 was just last month!! I have to <br/>
start all <br/>
&gt; &gt; over :-(<br/>
