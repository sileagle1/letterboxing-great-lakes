P.S.  Make that 68 months for us after today.  We attempted a 9-boxes series and although we found all 9, only could stamp into 7.  The icy grip of old man winter had securely entombed 2 of the boxes, so we'll have to return after the spring melt.  We were sinking up past our knees in snow at some points, but it was good to be out on a sunny, "warmish" day (temperatures in the 30s).<br>

The icy grip of old man winter had securely entombed 2 of the boxes, <br>
so we'll have to return after the spring melt.  We were sinking up <br>
past our knees in snow at some points, but it was good to be out on a <br>
sunny, "warmish" day (temperatures in the 30s).<br>

finds in December 2008. :(  The only other month we have zero <br>

Wedding event.  But we did plant boxes in both of those months, <br>
so they weren't completely letterboxing-free...<br>

Unfortunately, there's still quite a bit of snow, and we were <br>
thwarted on a few boxes.  We still managed to find 3 though, and <br>
apparently just missed Gibson Girl up in Grayslake by a couple of <br>
hours at one box!<br>
