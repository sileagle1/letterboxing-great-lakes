It was lovely that the weather cooperated last weekend.  I'm sending this to the event list as well, so sorry if you see it twice.  I am going out to the park this morning.  We already retrieved the Twilight Zone series.  I am going to move 2 boxes that had locations that I was not happy with to new locations.  I will post clues up later tonight and put notes in the boxes before the ones that we move.  I am moving Jedi Weapon and Flash Gordon.  I plan to post the clue packets for the event on the Boxacon website and on the Great Lakes board hopefully this weekend, once I get updates and corrections taken care of.  Hope you all had a great time, the feedback I have gotten so far has been really positive.  Just a reminder that the Lost series and Simak will only be out until the end of October.  ALso the area where the trails run together for the Simak box is down by Picnic Area 3.  Hopefully this weekend I"ll also get back to answering all my emails, there is an amazing amount after the event!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We must've been just ahead of you on the trail!  I think we left the parking area around 9am.  Luckily we bumped into OLJ and LK over near the dog exercise area, and they confirmed that Jedi Weapon was indeed going to be pulled, and that we shouldn't try looking for Flash Gordon either.  We also couldn't find Shards of Honor, just as WiHi had reported, but all the others on that loop were doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
Just want to add our thanks for all the work in organizing Boxacon.  It was a ton of fun, a great location choice, and I'm sure it'll take us a few more trips to eventually find all the boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Today's highlight was, as we hunted the last few boxes, our 3-year-old (after gaining confidence in "finding" and "replacing" the earlier boxes under my supervision) insisted on all the rest of us staying on the trail while he headed in himself to "find" each box!  No matter that he had no idea which particular tree or log to look near.  He also did the same for "replacing"... so then Dad had to think quickly and make up a random excuse as to why I needed to re-enter the woods as soon as he came back out, just to be sure that each box was properly placed and covered!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Aimlesst and your whole crew of helpers!!<br/>

We were out from about 7:30 to noon on the trails, then another hour and half at the shelter trying to warm up with hot chocolate, holding our hands over a propane warmer and hot dog coals while we ate lunch and did a few exchanges!  My toes were almost totally frozen, but luckily finally thawed at the church later in the afternoon.  It wasn't deep snow, but there was sme on all the trails and the paved trail was icy in spots.<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice event and we're hoping to return to the park tomorrow to find more of the boxes.  Today we only had time for the series Gooble Gobble planted and 2 others (plus a few right near the shelter).  Unfortunately we missed seeing a lot of people since they were out on the trails during lunch.<br/>
<br/>
There was a cool "severed finger" dish at the potluck and Gooble Gobble had assembled an impressive haunted house that contained new hitchhikers for the first 14 people/groups that finished his series.  I'll post photos later.<br/>

I'm sorry will missed you guys at Harvest and Haunts.  I was looking forward to seeing you again.  Steve (S1 of SZSRocks) got called in to work Saturday am, so we didn't make it to the park until later.  Hope you guys had fun at the event and at the wedding.  Red Cat does such a nice job organizing events for the frozen northland that is Minnesota!<br/>

Just got back from wedding reception, so only a short note.  It was FREEZING on the trails today!!  We were out from about 7:30 to noon on the trails, then another hour and half at the shelter trying to warm up with hot chocolate, holding our hands over a propane warmer and hot dog coals while we ate lunch and did a few exchanges!  My toes were almost totally frozen, but luckily finally thawed at the church later in the afternoon.  It wasn't deep snow, but there was sme on all the trails and the paved trail was icy in spots.<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice event and we're hoping to return to the park tomorrow to find more of the boxes.  Today we only had time for the series Gooble Gobble planted and 2 others (plus a few right near the shelter).  Unfortunately we missed seeing a lot of people since they were out on the trails during lunch.<br/>
<br/>
There was a cool "severed finger" dish at the potluck and Gooble Gobble had assembled an impressive haunted house that contained new hitchhikers for the first 14 people/groups that finished his series.  I'll post photos later.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Red Cat for organizing the event!<br/>

&gt; TJM - must have just missed you - we got there just after noon.  We boxed a bit Twila and Little Bitty Pretty One.  We seemed to have hit boxes that Dramagoon had just hit.  I had my better half with me again today, so we had much success!  17 boxes.  :) By dint of some gonzo letterboxing, we did find Shards of Honor.  It was not anywhere near where we expected it to be.  We were able to find Jedi and Flash - be glad Jedi is being relocated - very thorny there.  The last box was Jurassic Park by cell phone light - kept expecting raptors to swoop in, but Peabody said they can't see well in that light, plus the cold would slow 'em down cause they're cold-blooded.  It did flurry briefly, but the sun did come out! <br/>

That<br/>
raises an interesting question.  This box (GREAT movie reference, by<br/>
the way!  I remember going to the theatre for this one!) now has<br/>
permanent clues, but is listed on AtlasQuest as an Event Box.  That<br/>
means it won't ever appear in any typical letterbox searches or<br/>
listings of the Waukesha area; it can only be found by perusing the<br/>
Boxacon event listing and clicking on 'Event Boxes'.  AQ expects event<br/>
boxes to be "a stamp or box brought to an event or gathering for just<br/>
the duration of the event. Many event stamps are tabletop boxes, but an<br/>
event stamp generally won't have clues, may not have a logbook, and<br/>
will only be available for the duration of the event or perhaps the day<br/>
or two after the event has ended."<br/>
<br/>
I'm not picking on you,<br/>
ArchaeoFrog, just pointing out a subtlety of box listings that affects<br/>
any event plants which are going to turn into permanent letterboxes. <br/>
Perhaps we all (myself included) should have listed these as<br/>
"Traditional" boxes rather than "Event Boxes" if they are going to be<br/>
in place long-term.  After all, they have clues, are going to be there<br/>
a while, are in the woods, have logbooks, etc.  If not, future finders<br/>
are VERY unlikely to stumble across the clues... who would ever think<br/>
to look at the listing for a past event and read the clues for what are<br/>
supposed to be temporary, mostly tabletop, boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Again, just<br/>
bringing this up for discussion to see if there are thoughts from the<br/>
group.   I'm not at all opposed to having all these plants at a single<br/>
park... it'll be kinda like our own slice of Connecticut here in<br/>
Wisconsin!... but would like to see if we can come up with a standard<br/>
approach for clues to make them most enjoyable and useful for future<br/>
finders. <br/>

I've had this same dilema on occassion.   A box might start out as a semi-convention box and I post it, but if it's for a limited time and I want to change the status, I can't...unless I list it twice and change the listing.  So I took Ryan's posted advice and I'm retiring the first time listings and then relisting them at different locations as it occures.  But sometimes people don't check the active or retired status when they see the clue.  Not sure what the best solution is.  Anyone have some recommendations?<br/>

Couldn't you just "retire" the event box and then enter a new listing for a traditional box.  Perhaps put a note at the beginning of the clue that this was at such-and-such event so that previous finders don't go searching for it again.  <br/>
