                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
We were out boxing in Waukesha County (our home county) today and in addition to finding some newer boxes, also checked on several boxes at Lapham Peak.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who didn't attend the Great Lakes Gathering in 2006, Lapham Peak is home to nearly 30 letterboxes.  In March we checked on some of them and today we checked on a few more.<br/>
<br/>
I am very sad to report that we could not locate MY box, Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum. Since there are so many of the Alice in Wonderland boxes remaining, I will recarve &amp; replant so these characters are not missing.  I'll post again when I've replaced the box.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, we did find these other boxes in good shape:<br/>
<br/>
White Knight<br/>
Humpty Dumpty<br/>
DRINK ME bottle<br/>
Mad Hatter <br/>
March Hare <br/>
Cheshire Cat<br/>
<br/>
When we hosted the event, a few of the boxes were only in the park on a temporary basis.  If anyone still has their temporary boxes and hasn't planted them anywhere else, we'd be happy to replant them again in Lapham Peak so they can rejoin their friends in Wonderland.  You could bring them to the OCT event in Waukesha or mail them to me if you're interested in having them back at Lapham Peak.<br/>

Key words for DRINK ME are "near the tree".  I've attached a copy of the<br/>
original clue packet which may provide some guidance on how to group your<br/>
box hunts.  There are some other boxes in Lapham that were in place before<br/>
the event and a few other Pin-ups that were added after the event.  You'll<br/>
definitely need to cross-check this w/the LBNA listings to see if any clues<br/>

Granted, that was over two days (although we got most of those boxes the first day) and we were at the park past closing on Saturday...we were very relieved to find that the gates open automatically to let you out if you try to leave the park after 9pm! By the time we got out of the car to go after the last box on Sunday both of the dogs just gave us this look that said, "you have GOT to be kidding me!" Ok, so maybe all of the boxes in the park in ONE day is a little ambitious. But probably not entirely impossible.<br/>

                  Lighthouse keeper and I were out in Lapham State Park boxing for these stamps on the 3rd. Hahaha! I think we bit off more than we could chew, so to speak, as we'd hoped to find them all. ;) Alas, we have another trip (or two) to make out to Delafield before we can say we've conquered the "Wandering thru Wonderland" event series! <br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We were out boxing in Waukesha County (our home county) today and in addition to finding some newer boxes, also checked on several boxes at Lapham Peak.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those of you who didn't attend the Great Lakes Gathering in 2006, Lapham Peak is home to nearly 30 letterboxes.  In March we checked on some of them and today we checked on a few more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am very sad to report that we could not locate MY box, Tweedle Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum. Since there are so many of the Alice in Wonderland boxes remaining, I will recarve &amp; replant so these characters are not missing.  I'll post again when I've replaced the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the bright side, we did find these other boxes in good shape:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; White Knight<br/>
&gt; Humpty Dumpty<br/>
&gt; DRINK ME bottle<br/>
&gt; Mad Hatter <br/>
&gt; March Hare <br/>
&gt; Cheshire Cat<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When we hosted the event, a few of the boxes were only in the park on a temporary basis.  If anyone still has their temporary boxes and hasn't planted them anywhere else, we'd be happy to replant them again in Lapham Peak so they can rejoin their friends in Wonderland.  You could bring them to the OCT event in Waukesha or mail them to me if you're interested in having them back at Lapham Peak.<br/>
