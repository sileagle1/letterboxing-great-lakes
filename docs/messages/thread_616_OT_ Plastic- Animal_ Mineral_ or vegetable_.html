The debate goes like this:<br>
<br>
I say plastic is animal, because it's made from oil, which is, in turn, made from the gooey remains of dinosaurs and such.<br>
<br>
D.H. says it's mineral, because if I'm going to break things down to their genesis to name them, then I have to go back to the source, which is mineral, because we're all just a heap of minerals (he's very romantic).  <br>
<br>
I then tell him that he's not made of minerals, he's made of something that rhymes with "loop".<br>
<br>
He tells me then there's something fundimentally wrong with someone who would choose to spend time with a person who really WAS composed entirely of said substance, and then we're off and bickering.<br>
<br>
And so, the answer is, ANIMAL!  Plastic is an ANIMAL!  <br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
