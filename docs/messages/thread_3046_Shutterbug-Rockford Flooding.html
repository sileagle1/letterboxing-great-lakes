  Subject: [LbGLK] Rockford Flooding<br>
<br>
<br>
  Just a quick note to those of you who may not have seen this on CNN or <br>
  the Weather Channel after Labor Day. Rockford had some pretty serious <br>
  storms run through...tornado spottings and everything. Well, we <br>
  basically got 10 inches of rain within 3 hours...worse than a <br>
  hurricane, the weatherman said. Some areas of Rockford and Cherry <br>
  Valley were under several feet of water (check rrstar.com for some <br>
  crazy photos...search for labor day flood). If you are planning on <br>
  coming to the area to find any boxes, you might want to check with the <br>
  owners to see if the area was flooded or not. I'm hoping to find time <br>
  to run out to Bauman Park to check on my CV boxes and then doing some <br>
  others as well. Hopefully all are there! :)<br>
<br>
  How are the other Rockfordians? Are you all okay out there?<br>
