of the autumn Great Lakes gathering circuit.  I think I have stamps from<br/>
close to half the group's membership between the two of them!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone missed the Blue Dog, signup to receive her as a postal is still<br/>
open on AtlasQuest.  (Just be sure to search for her as a postal, or you<br/>
won't find her.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jack, on the other hand, is joining some of his fellow characters from "The<br/>
Land of Oz" in a future traveling event series.  Watch for them all at a<br/>
gathering near you (or request them through She_Who_Plants' traveling event<br/>
stamp yahoo group).  (Hint, hint - they'd love to visit Minnesota in the<br/>
springtime!!)<br/>
