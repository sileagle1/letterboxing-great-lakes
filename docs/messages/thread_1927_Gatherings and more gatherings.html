In all likelihood we will be moving within the year.  My better half is commuting 120 miles <br/>

I would be willing to help with a big gathering in 2007 or whenever The BIG gathering <br/>

willing to help too.  Right now I just can't make many commitments.  I would do my <br/>

bring some friends along.  I'm just sorry I have missed at least 4 gatherings since last May, <br/>

<br/>
By asking for volunteers and suggestions for the 2006 GL Gathering, <br/>
I am not by any means dismissing Dragon's proposal to host the 2006 <br/>
event in WI (per msg. #3306).  As previously stated, that is <br/>
certainly one of the locations that will be presented in the poll.<br/>
<br/>
However that was at the time, a proposal -- there has never been a <br/>
determination that the 2006 Gathering would be in WI or that IN or <br/>
OH or any other state would have to wait until a later year.  At the <br/>
time of the WI bid, reply was made that the 2006 Gathering location <br/>
would be put up for suggestions/volunteers later in the year, which <br/>
is what is presently being done.<br/>
