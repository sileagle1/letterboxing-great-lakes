I get the announcement thing everyday that shows what letterboxes <br/>
have been planted that day.  I usually get one digest a day, if <br/>
that.  Today, I've had three!  I was thinking, Wow!  Must be a great <br/>
letter box planting day.  Everyone is so busy!  I just started <br/>
reading the latest one and it makes The Dragon look like a super hero <br/>
or a boxer with a Lear jet.  The Dragon has new plants in IN, OH, MI, <br/>
WI, etc!  WOW!  That's a lotta plants and distance to cover in one day!<br/>
