You don't have to post clues, just an alert that hey, there's a new box in such and such an area....and maybe a quick note about the placement if it was a particularly exciting adventure.<br>
<br>
As for carving kits, as WI Hiker suggested you may need to look in the artist or calligraphy section of the store for carving materials. Another option if you have one in your area is a scrapbooking store (or a stamping store if there is one...although these are less common than scrapbooking).<br>

www.stampeaz.com I like the grade B white, too.  But, I just bought a <br>
"sampler pack" of carving materials so I could try out some of the <br>
other stuff.  The sampler pack is a tad cheaper than buying the same <br>
things separately.<br>
