Anyway, "Fish Out of Water 5: Swinging Bridge" has a new improved<br>
hiding place, and you even get more exercise for your effort (longer<br>
hike, though still not a very long one).  (The stamp has not been<br>
changed.)  The revised clues are posted in the Files.  <br>
<br>
The clues to "FOOW9: Hoffman Tower" have also been slightly modified<br>
since landmarks have been destroyed.  They may need to be modified<br>
further. I wanted to check them for accuracy today but had to turn<br>
back after Hershey and I got stormed by angry yellowjackets.  Next time!<br>
