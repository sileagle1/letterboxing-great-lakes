Geez oh pizza! Here I was all ready to do whatever it took to<br/>
discombobulate my molecules and go poking about in space worm holes to<br/>
get this box.  Sigh ... ok, I'll just have to settle for these measly<br/>
Earth-bound boxes then. (snicker)  But I am glad that Cari doesn't<br/>
have to carry around a load of guilt any longer. (Guilt can take up<br/>
too much room in the backpack and you might not have enough room for a<br/>
box maintance kit!)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

sub-space wormholes.  That was an exaggeration on my part. <br/>
