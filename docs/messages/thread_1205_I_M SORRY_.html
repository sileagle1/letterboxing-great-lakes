Just wanted to apologize to West MI. Letterbox Placers.  I have been<br>
using "Color Box" Ink Pads to stamp in your log books and they really<br>
are quite evil!<br>
At home they provide a beautiful stamp image but on the trail they<br>
take so long to dry and smear and just...YUK!<br>
I promise to go buy a better-for-boxing stamp pad!<br>
FORGIVE!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As long as we're talking about inks...my personal favorite is the VersaFine instant dry pigment ink.  It's an oil-based pigment ink that dries about as quickly as my dye-based inks.  I am absolutely head-over-heels in love with this ink!  It's a little more expensive than some of the other inks out there (around $8/pad I think) but it claims to last something like 5 times longer than other pigment pads and it doesn't take much to get enough ink to make a good impression.  It's also water resistant.  Really..  I accidentally spilled water on a logbook that I had stamped and it didn't even smudge the ink.  Unfortunately it only comes in 6 colors right now.  And it claims to wash off with water which I haven't exactly found to be the case with stamps (it does come off of hands pretty easily).  Although, it doesn't seem to leave much residue to gunk up the stamp either.  Anyway, just thought I'ld share in case anyone else was looking to try something new.<br>
