shower, and you think you have enough time to stop before the shower, so<br>
you go boxing in your dress/pantyhose/heels.<br>
You show up at the shower with leaves in your hair, mud on your heels,<br>
runs in your pantyhose, and scratches all over your arms and legs.<br>
And, HA HA HA, this was Tiptoe & Tontos Slow Growth Oak box this fall.<br>
<br>
Then there are those days when a new box is announced, and it's REALLY<br>
CLOSE BY, and you can't wait until after work, so you run out during lunch<br>
to go find the box, and return to work with leaves in your hair, mud on<br>
your shoes.........<br>
<br>
And you think that by now I would have LEARNED to keep an extra pair of<br>
sneakers in the car.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
