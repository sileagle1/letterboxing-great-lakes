Hi all,  <br/>
        Our family just started letterboxing at the end of Aug 2006.  We have friends who had read the Family Fun article and asked us to join them.   I loved the idea from the first moment I heard it.  Two of our daughters loved it the moment they found their first box.  Our two sons and my husband loved it the moment they joined their sisters on their second box hunt.  Our littlest daughter is too small to know what she's missing, but some day,  Hmmmm!?  <br/>
       We are heading to Canada to visit family this weekend and have already introduced them to the idea.  We plan on doing two hunts in a big park near their home.  <br/>
       What a fun way to experience the outdoors!  It's great to see how delighted the kids are to work together to solve the clues!  We are making our way through all of the various aspects of letterboxing.  We look forward to many more hunts! <br/>
<br/>
  Fondly, Mama Elph<br/>
