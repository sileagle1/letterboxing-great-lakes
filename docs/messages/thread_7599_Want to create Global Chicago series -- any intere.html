I would like to create a series of stamps celebrating Chicago's global status, highlighting our diverse neighborhoods and the immigrant communities that made us what we are today. Pilsen, Greektown, Little Italy, Devon Avenue, Albany Park -- these are just a few gems I would love to feature!<br>
<br>
Here is some background on how immigrants have shaped this city:<br>

<br>
These will be planted over the summer 2013 and used to help welcome and acclimate our new students in August 2013.<br>
<br>
I'd welcome any and all feedback on the idea, not limited to locations that you think would be good points for placement (or awful ones, for that matter).<br>
<br>
In addition, if you have any interest in helping to carve, plant, or anything else, I'd be most grateful!<br>

I've been debating if we should make the stamps to be a standard size.  I don't think many of our new or current students will run out to buy logbooks, so I've been considering having my office create and print "passport" books where they can collect their stamps and see the ones they're missing.  Too cheesy?<br>
<br>
And, yes, I do love my job! I can't deny that I get very jealous of my students who go abroad each term, but a study abroad experience is such an integral part of a college education.  I love hearing their stories when they get back.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great!  I've found your boxes, and seen your carving.  I'd be honored to have you involved.<br>
<br>
I have gotten great feedback on the Chicago Park District system and the possibility of losing boxes. Has anyone ever asked permission from the Park District or any other organization to plan? I've been debating asking the Chicago Department on Cultural Affairs or World Chicago with help in reaching out to immigrant groups or ethnic organizations for help with recommending great places to plant, or at least protection from removal by grounds crews. I didn't know if that would be a no-no, by revealing the hobby to "noxers" or by being shot down altogether and making the crews more vigilant in looking for boxes.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?<br>
