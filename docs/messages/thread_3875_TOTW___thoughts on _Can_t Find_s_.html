those that plant, an equal amount of contacts saying the box was <br>
elusive and has to be missing.  Both accounts conjures up <br>
frustration....sometimes leading to sheer madness!  We've been the <br>
recipents and the accusers.  <br>
<br>
We had a tendency early on in our letterboxing "careers" to be very <br>
quick at coming to the conclusion that the box was indeed <br>
missing...We were certain we covered every angle, nook and cranny.  <br>
We dutifully contacted the placer expressing the regretable <br>
news...sometimes leading to a box being noted as missing.  We did <br>
this more than once only to find out that humble pie doesn't taste <br>
too good.  The boxes were eventually found safe and sound.  <br>
<br>
This is when we contemplated changing our trailnames to the "Pathetic <br>
Boxers" (which we still use as a nickname to our trailname!)...But, <br>
instead we decided that this is just a fact of life with <br>
letterboxing...We now may let a placer know we attempted it but <br>
couldn't find it, but never use the word "missing"...We have learned <br>
to always give the box the benefit of the doubt...not sure about you, <br>
but quite frankly our searching skills can be questionable.<br>
<br>
We say all this, having found over 500 boxes in the wild.<br>
We've missed some of the basic and easiest (in others opinions) <br>
boxes...and yet there have been boxes (like Funhog's Happy Javelina <br>
in Tucson) that very few (except Pete & Wanda) were able to find that <br>
we were able to find with ease.  It all depends... As more seasoned <br>
letterboxers, we still get stumped....and rewarded.<br>
<br>
We have found that the higher our letterbox count goes, <br>
our "letterboxing ego" becomes less...I guess one could say that the <br>
letterbox has put us in our place.<br>
<br>
We are wondering how the rest of you see it?  What is your default? <br>
The box is missing or ...are you missing...it?<br>

If we are searching for a box, we still usually default to a "THE BOX IS <br>
THERE".... however, when we were newbies we would wander around in <br>
circles for a long time (and maybe throw a few fits) before <br>
giving-up...now, we look around and suck-it up after a shorter while <br>
(although we probably do a more efficient search that we did when still <br>
newbies).  When a trip proves unsuccessful (and particularly later when <br>
we  find that the box WAS there), we find it helps to remember some of <br>
the tricker boxes that we HAVE found.  Oh, and we still manage to miss <br>
some 'easy' boxes...sometimes our experience works against us as we <br>
over-think an otherwise straight-forward clue.  I must agree with Doodle <br>
Bug...we feel much better if others report a box missing that we <br>
couldn't find.<br>
<br>
If the box is ours, we tend to default to "IT MUST BE MISSING"....and we <br>
are overjoyed if we find that it is actually still there. (BTW, please <br>
don't tell us a box is missing just to make us happy!)<br>

<br>
"This *has* to be the spot"...therefore, since *I* can't find it, the<br>
box *must* be missing.<br>
<br>
There is a growing humility that parallels one's "F" count, I believe.<br>
Another factor to consider is one's state of mind at those moments of<br>
failure. More than  a few of us, when coming up empty at the site,<br>
have taken a break, had a bite to eat, or even just took a needed<br>
water break, only to find ourselves with clearer heads and a new<br>
perspective on where the box might be.<br>
Lo and behold, suddenly the clues seem much more concise, the<br>
landmarks make sense, and (sometimes) 'There's the box'.<br>
<br>
I was recently corresponding with a friend in the East who, with<br>
others, was a first-finder on a box that had been in place for six years!<br>
I'll bet more than a couple of previous seekers just figured it was<br>
missing.<br>
<br>
My default is most often, "I guess I just can't find it."<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In addition to what Atom has said, I wanted to add that we often just <br>
jump to conclusions with the clues.  For example, as soon as we see "a <br>
stump on the right side of the trail next to a pile of sticks" like the <br>
clue says, we assume that we're at the correct stump and the correct <br>
pile of sticks.  However, the clue might also say something like "just <br>
after a slight incline in the trail," which we've overlooked (hey, it's <br>
hard to hike and read at the same time! :P)  So we'll be digging around <br>
in totally the wrong spot for about 10-15mins, and just when we are <br>
ready to give up, one of us will reread the clue and be like, "hey, the <br>
trail has to incline first and look up ahead -- it's inclining!"  So <br>
then we run ahead and find the real stump with the real pile of sticks <br>
AFTER the incline.<br>
<br>
Reading and rereading the clue is key since many times the clues are <br>
subject to interpretation.  What one person refers to in the clues as <br>
"sacrificed trees spanning the river" might be a couple of logs that <br>
fell/were chopped down and now lie across the water, OR it might <br>
actually mean the wooden bridge that's up the trail a bit further.  Even <br>
if the clue isn't that detailed, things still might sound totally <br>
perfect where you're at, but if you walk ahead another couple hundred <br>
feet (or even half a mile), you might find an even BETTER place that <br>
also matches the clues perfectly.  Another thing I've noticed to keep in <br>
mind is that the distances between reference points in clues can vary <br>
quite a bit depending on the planter and/or just the length of the hike <br>
-- sometimes reference points are every 100 feet, but other times they <br>
can be every quarter mile.<br>
<br>
All in all, as we've found more boxes, we've gotten much better at <br>
reading and interpreting clues and therefore finding more boxes... now <br>
that's a great cycle to get stuck in! :)<br>

So my Buggy friends, are you talking about one of my boxes? I know <br>
those were your last finds, but can't picture any creek beds you <br>
might have been in. If so, can I get pictures of that instead of my <br>
hiding spot! :o) <br>
<br>
BTW, I'm very impressed that you got Woodland Creatures with all <br>
this mud! Try letterboxers. That would have been a great picture <br>
too; of you perched on the hillside trying not to slide or look <br>
conspicious!<br>

<br>
As a relative newbie (about 50 finds), there have only been about 7 <br>
boxes we haven't found.  Most of those we just assumed that we were <br>
missing something and couldn't find them. 2 we were sure were <br>
missing..  But, in all of the above, when we've contacted the placers <br>
we've never stated "We can't find it!  It MUST be missing".  We <br>
generally describe where we were, tell them we couldn't find it and <br>
ask if it sounds like we were in the right place.<br>
<br>
Turns out, the couple we were sure were missing are.  Of the others, <br>
it's about half & half.  Half were missing, half weren't, oh and one <br>
was "checked out by someone else at the time", we think.  But, <br>
generally speaking, we assume that were screwing it up and the box is <br>
there mocking us.  LOL.<br>

missing the first landmark you call out in the clues<br>
and thinking that the second landmark was actually the<br>
first.  This would have been an even better Kodak<br>
moment - we actually climbed up that hill by the<br>
second landmark (that we thought was the first<br>
landmark) to try to find your Buzzard Box, saying,<br>
"Well, I don't see a trail but it's still awfully snow<br>
covered so maybe it's just hidden right now, I do see<br>
a pine tree so let's head towards that...."<br>
<br>
After we attempted not to slide back down to the<br>
trail, we kept walking.  And then you know how you'll<br>
pass something that you remember reading about in the<br>
clues, and you pause and say, "Wait a sec, give me<br>
those clues," and then realize that you walked right<br>
past the hiding spot?  That's what we did next.  Boy,<br>
were we out of practice!  <br>
