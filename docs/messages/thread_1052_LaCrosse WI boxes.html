<br/>
I will be traveling to LaCrosse WI  next weekend and am interested in<br/>
finding a few boxes in both WI MN and IA if there are any near the tristate<br/>
area.  As I am traveling with a non-boxer and her babe, I am looking for<br/>
easier hikes!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who have responded already!  Just trying to get my ducks in<br/>
a row so to speak as time is unfortunately limited!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, for those of you familiar with the Angel box in LaCrosse (which<br/>
I understand has gone missing); I am traveling to host a mother blessing for<br/>
Tami, who placed the box in honor of her second child.  She is expecting her<br/>
third babe any day now!  (And plans to become an active boxer once she is<br/>
out and about again)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, I enjoy lurking on this list and am hoping to make it to<br/>
the GLG  this summer!<br/>
