                    <div class="plaintext-content">My understanding is that in order for the acetone to work well, it is <br>
best to have an image that was made with "toner".  This is the media <br>
that is in many photocopy machines (although I hear some new copy <br>
machines don't use toner).  Laser printers also use toner, so you <br>
could print an image on a laser printer, then use the acetone <br>
approach.  You can get a big bottle of acetone for not much $ at most <br>
drugstores.  Cheaper than buying little bottles of nail polish <br>
remover.  I place the image from the photocopy machine upside down on <br>
the PZKut, then use an old washcloth to put a small amount of acetone <br>
on.  I then press FIRMLY on portions of the imagage, rewetting with <br>
more acetone as required.  It is best not to rub the image, just move <br>
around pressing down firmly in each area.  You can then slowly peel a <br>
corner back to be sure it has transferred well.  If not, just <br>
continue with more acetone and pressing hard.<br>
<br>
Other people have good luck with an iron for transferring images, but <br>
I never could get it to work for me.  I think Merlin uses a combo <br>
approach of acetone AND heat.<br>

<br>
This is the method I used for The Rose Gardeners.  I had to make a couple<br>
copies of my image to test each side.  I got the first try to wet and so<br>
the acetone blurred the image.  Second try was much improved.  Added to<br>
the mix was a nice magnifying lamp and exacto knife.  I might add it was<br>
my first attempt on PZKut, first carving with exacto, and first with the<br>
magnifying lamp.<br>
<br>
If you goof up, the acetone will wash the toner/pencil away.  Just try<br>
again.<br>

I use the combo of acetone and heat and it is amazing how clearly the <br>
image is on the PZ Cut--now if I could just carve it exactly as I see <br>
it.  I use an old copying machine to make a copy (I too have discovered <br>
that some new machines don't use the toner to make this work).  I use a <br>
cottonball to rub acetone on the surface of the PZ Cut.  Then I <br>
immediately place the image face-down and use a hot iron to really <br>
transfer the image.  It transfers so well that the paper is almost <br>
sticking to the PZ Cut.  I put a piece of paper between the iron and <br>
the paper with the image--I ironed the PZ Cut itself once and that <br>
isn't the best thing for my iron (just gives me another excuse not to <br>
iron!).  The only drawback I have noticed is that the dark ink of the <br>
toner transfers a little when I first start inking the stamp--esp. with <br>
light-colored inks.  It doesn't seem to last, but does anyone have any <br>
suggestions for dealing with that?<br>

Now everyone is recommending using acetone to transfer images and also to  <br>
clean off excess toner. Is acetone harmless to the carving material? or does it  <br>
hold some of the same downfalls as alcohol?<br>
 <br>
I ask out of ignorance, I truly don't know. <br>
 <br>
Thanks,<br>

It is not harmless to the carving material, but if used carefully it's<br>
still an excellent method.<br>
The acetone will dissolve/melt the carving medium but you'd have to<br>
use way more than necessary or to scrub on the block to cause a<br>
serious problem.<br>
So it's just the opposite of alcohol. The alcohol dries the stuff; the<br>
acetone can make it squishy<br>
Someone in an earlier post suggested using a bit of well placed<br>
acetone to remove toner that clings to the stamp when you're finished.<br>
However if there is *very* fine detail on the stamp -- crosshatch for<br>
example --  the final dose of acetone may blurr the detail.<br>
It's just a case of using care.<br>
