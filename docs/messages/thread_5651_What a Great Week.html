me wrong, I love my job and have many good weeks. However, when a get <br>
to take an extra long route and snag a box on the way -- well, that <br>
makes a great day.<br>
<br>
This week I had 4 great days!!<br>
<br>
Monday was nice and warm. I decided to check on a couple of my <br>
boxes "A Scramble in the Dark" series in Milan -- last logged find <br>
was WiHi & MM in October, 2007.<br>
<br>
It was sureal to walk without a coat on and feel warm. We had a huge <br>
wind storm this past summer and trees had fallen over the path... it <br>
was some bushwacking time. I made it to where I thought the box <br>
was... turned out I was off a few feet. It turns out that the wind <br>
knocked over a tree, that dominoed into another tree.... then another <br>
tree. 3 trees down and my box was sitting pretty in a sweet spot <br>
right in the middle of all the carnage.<br>
<br>
On to box #2. The dead log it was hidden in was 100% decayed and <br>
gone. My box was just sitting there right in the open.... nothing <br>
left of the log at all. Everything was safe and dry and ready to go <br>
with this series.<br>
<br>
TUESDAY I got to drive to Earlville . . . east of Mendota. I picked <br>
up Maude's contribution to a Teddy Bears Picnic and attempted <br>
Questar's " Kakusha" no luck on that one. This day was VERY warm and <br>
very muddy.... I left a mess!!<br>
<br>
Wednesday I drove up to Dubuque and hiked 3.5 miles and planted a new <br>
box, "A Portrait of Julien Dubuque". This was a struggle with all the <br>
snow, ice & mud but I got it in place.... not quite the 4 miles round <br>
trip I was hoping for, but I was happy with 3.5 miles round trip.<br>
<br>
Thursday -- nothing :-(<br>
<br>
Friday -- I hiked 4.5 miles in Dixon, IL and scouted out tons of <br>
hiding spots for future boxes. The trail was paved and had markers <br>
telling you how far you walked.... I made it 2.25 miles before time <br>
told me to double back. The trail was 3.0 miles total so I fell .75 <br>
miles short of my endevour. <br>
