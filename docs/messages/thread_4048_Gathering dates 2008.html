Since I believe the goal was to attempt to alternate between east and <br/>

someone volunteered to host.  Then next would be Indiana, since that is <br/>
the only other state that has not hosted yet.  (MI hosted twice since <br/>
no one from any other state volunteered).<br/>

Actually any state that has not previously hosted the event is eligible, so next year volunteers from either MN or IN would be encouraged.  Once all states have hosted, then it will proceed from year-to-year based on the rotation that was established (without the double MI of course).<br/>
<br/>
Once we get past the 2007 Cluez-In event, the discussion will be opened up for volunteers for 2008.  But, those of you from MN and IN, be thinking about it!<br/>
