You know you're addicted when...<br>
<br>
  ... you drive several hours to do a series and can't find one of the <br>
boxes. So you go home, think about it, and realize you CANNOT live as a <br>
functioning human unless you have the entire series. So you drive <br>
another couple hours back the next weekend. <br>
<br>
And pick up a few more boxes while you are in the area...<br>

* You plan one of your yearly vacations around new places to letterbox -<br>
like this past June's trip to Michigan - and you change the week to coincide<br>
with the gathering! And plan to visit Oregon next June to - that's right -<br>
letterbox!<br>
* You convince your friends that letterboxing is the best hobby ever so when<br>
we get together with them we can letterbox instead of all those stupid<br>
things like playing cards or going to the movies  - what a waste of<br>
daylight!<br>
* You spend every free moment from work reading (and responding!) to the<br>
talklists!<br>
* You are constantly thinking of new and innovative ways to hide, carve and<br>
clue boxes.<br>
* Everyone is work knows about your hobby and refer to it as "that cult that<br>
walks in the woods."<br>
* You become a ringmaster for a traveling stamp circus and change your name<br>

...  you discover you're only slightly more upset about the fact that <br>
your house caught on fire as you are upset that you've lost 3 weeks of <br>
planned letterboxing, the clues and work done towards the around the <br>
world boxes and missed all the long planned gatherings.<br>
<br>
Sidenote: It was a kitchen fire with no major structural damage just <br>
extensive smoke damage and only a few "irreplaceable" items were lost. <br>
So being the positive people we try to be when we think about what we <br>
could have lost compared to what we actually lost it's hard to be too <br>
upset.<br>

are you saying that the mn gathering will be a three day event or that you<br>

yet?  looking forward to heading that way.<br>

Oh, this one is great!<br>
<br>
Isn't it amazing the things that run through your mind while you are <br>
sleeping?  When I was in college, I used to joke that I debugged my <br>
COBOL programs in my sleep...  never failed if there was one that was <br>
giving me fits, it would come to me while I was sleeping.<br>
<br>
Reminds me of this summer when we were in the U.P.  I spent a couple <br>
of hours trying to figure out a LB and was making a really stupid <br>
mistake (really, very stupid).  It was 1 of a series of 3 and I had <br>
got the other 2 boxes, so I really wanted to find this one.  But, <br>
finally after walking around the entire park a couple of time (a few <br>
miles), I gave up.  We were about 45 minutes up the highway en route <br>
to the Porcupine Mountains when I suddenly realized where I went <br>
wrong.  I blurted it out, but thought it best not to ask to go back <br>
as we were already way behind schedule due to the time I had already <br>
spent looking for that box.  Imagine how thrilled I was when Old Shoe <br>
turned the truck around and headed back down for it! (What a guy!)<br>

I've had a couple of very vivid dreams, or nightmares, about the<br>
frustration of knowing a box's whereabouts, but not being able to get it. <br>
Then I wake up.  And can't get back to sleep.<br>
<br>
... when I lose my ability to count to 10!  Now that the box is retired,<br>
does anyone want to know how many visits to the Zoo it took for me to find<br>
Otterness Bear?  At least three, could be four (but who's counting?).  I<br>
couldn't count the number of urns, and I HAVE enough fingers to help me!<br>

Subject: A future TOTW?<br>
<br>
I don't think we're done discussing our obsessivness, but as I came in out<br>
of the wind and <br>
cold and spitting snow, I am thinking of my winter activities.<br>
<br>
I'd like to propose the next topic - How do you keep warm on long, winter<br>
hikes? <br>
<br>
Specifically, clothing that allows you do move and stay warm in the more<br>
northern states.  <br>
I am trying to provide "no excuses not to box" to my silent boxing partner.<br>
This year I <br>
want to be prepared and not look like the Michelin Man.<br>
<br>
I need to have warmer socks (what should I look for ... ?), warmer outer<br>
wear, etc.  I don't <br>
want to rely on the advice of some high school kid who hasn't a clue<br>
(literally).<br>

You know you are addicted when attending a morning out-of-town wedding <br>
where you offer to drive guests to the airport between the ceremony <br>
and the reception because you know that there are lertterboxes close <br>
to the outlying airport.  You drop off your passangers and make a <br>
quick costume change right there in the car...a little difficult for <br>
6'3" Tonto, but boxes are calling.<br>
The boxes prove to take more bushwhacking than expected, and after <br>
another quick change back into those stuffy dress clothes, you return <br>
late to the reception.  You are greeted with disgust and horror as the <br>

This is hard to beat.  Maybe there should be a twelve step program <br>
in the works.  Although they say the first step is admiting you have <br>
and problem, and to that I say, "What problem?"<br>

.when you submit your yearly vacation schedule at work (in January) and it<br>
is based on all the gatherings you are aware of to date.  And when one comes<br>
up later, you beg your coworkers to swap weekends (sometimes at a<br>
two-for-one rate!) so you can attend it!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Or you begrudge the fact that you miss a gathering because you have to pick<br>
up your daughter from the airport after she is gone for a week on a school<br>
trip out of the country (still mad about that one!!!).....   Or you have to<br>
leave one early because it's her Homecoming Dance that evening.....<br>

<br>
This is exactly the "bad rap" (and I appreciate you mentioning this CCB - I<br>
mean no insult to your response) I was reading on the big list when I<br>
started boxing myself that made me such a crusader in the way I teach girls<br>
about boxing.  Yes, indeed, we preach a GS leaves a place better than she<br>
found it, and I pound it into their newbie boxer heads that they are to do<br>
the same with letterboxes!!  I can't speak for Michigan area GS, but I must<br>
say those here in Illinois who I've dealt with are very responsible.  I'm<br>
sure those who have learned from leaders taught by Beetle are also just as<br>
responsible.<br>

BirdWoman, CMoon is right, the award is only at the Teen level (an Interest<br>
Project, not a badge), but your girls can work on it as a bridging activity<br>
once they're ready to move up out of Juniors!<br>

<br>
If anyone is involved with the Girl Scouts, we would ask you to stress <br>
<br>
the importance of rehiding a letterbox after it has been found.  We <br>
<br>
have recently found several letterboxes basically out in the open, and <br>
<br>
the last stamp-ins were from Girl Scouts.  The Scouts have a slogan <br>
<br>
where they always leave a place in better condition than when they <br>
<br>
found it.  Apply that to letterboxing.  Always hide a letterbox better <br>
<br>
than when you found it.  Or at least just as good.  Is this part of a <br>
<br>
written letterboxing code of ethics somewhere?  <br>

All of these stories makes me think there ought to be a logo ... "it's a<br>
letterboxing thing; you wouldn't understand" that we could put on our<br>
packs. Or a T-Shirt.<br>

<br>
Are there state gatherings? I mean anyone can come, but it is always <br>
in MI for primarily MI boxers? I think it would be neat to have a <br>
weekend event maybe at a campground. The woods are there and the <br>
sleeping accommodations are cheap. There is stuff to do for kids. Well <br>
just a thought.<br>

Has anyone seen my hitchhiker (Just Married) around? It was last <br>

By the way I highly recommend going to that box very beautiful setting!<br>

We did, indeed, pick it up the HH Hostel and sent it on its way a few <br>
days later! I am pretty sure that we set it loose several hours away <br>
(without giving too much away) in a less frequented box. You may have <br>
to wait until it gets warm again to get another update! :-)<br>
