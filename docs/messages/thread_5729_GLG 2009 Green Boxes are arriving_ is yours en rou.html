                    <div class="plaintext-content">I apologize for not responding to each post about deadlines and receipts.  I received several in February and set them aside.  I was afraid to open them individually and have them migrate around my house.  I received quite a few last week.<br/>
<br/>
I opened and inventoried each contribution and WOW!  This will be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Early thanks to Pugnasties, Dartmoor Dreamer, Lock Shock &amp; Barrel, Red Rose, Katy, Atomic Beans and the Boston Terrorists.<br/>

I have not received all boxes that were planned.  I marked the Database with all the boxes I've received to-date.  The deadline is not super strict, so if you are still working on your stamp and need a little more time, just let me know.  I will have a little more time to organize the first week of April (spring break for DH) and I wanted to use that week to make extra logbooks, find some containers as needed, and general planning for the planting of the trail boxes.<br/>
<br/>
There are some available slots in the database for shelter boxes.  Just look at the database and any line with a "?" in the first column is open.  If you need my addy, just ask.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be back shortly.<br/>
