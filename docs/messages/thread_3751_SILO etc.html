Don't put down your stamps!  No one starts out as an experienced carver.  Besides, I thought your Great Wall in particular was pretty impressive, considering you used an ordinary eraser.  Once you try a "regular" carving medium, you'll really see things take off.  Another thing to keep in mind was that some of those stamps were carved as Event stamps.  As such, the artist often tends to put a little more effort than for something placed in the wilds.  Not to mention that some were created by long-time carvers, known to be some of the best in the country.    <br>

I apologize if I seemed dazed and confused. This was our first Gathering  and <br>
I was SO overwhelmed. I truly didn't mean to be so quiet and to myself -- I  <br>
just wanted to get as many stamps as possible -- without loosing Skeeter ("has <br>
anyone seen my daughter?") I must say that my puny stamps where put to  <br>
shame!<br>
<br>
Thank you for such an enjoyable day. Look forward to seeing you all again  on <br>
the trail or at another gathering!<br>
