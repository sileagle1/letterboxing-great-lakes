                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well put.  I too lurk on the fringes of letterboxing mainly because I tend to enjoy the anonimity of letterboxing and the fun of using an old nickname as an alias to hide behind.  I dove in head first when I got hooked 3 years ago and spent all my spare time looking for and placing boxes.  Now a days, I'm lucky to get out boxing once or twice a month, but I do read the postings to keep up with the hobby.  However, I too have noticed a certain "indignation" from the royal "we" when a new interpretation of the "rules" surfaces.  I say try to educate new boxers on the fundamentals like protecting the environment, stealth in finding &amp; rehiding boxes, and respecting the contents of the boxes you have found.  Take extra baggies along to repair compromised boxes, write to the placer when you find a box to inform them on the status of the contents etc... But remember that each of us brings unique personalities and expectations to and from letterboxing and with that comes variety! <br/>
 If every box I find or plant has to conform to certain standards this hobby would quickly loose my interest.  I hope that as a group we can be tolerant of others "mistakes" or differences and accept that there are risks involved.  Sometimes a box is going to go missing or unfound.  To me that means that I have to adapt my clues or rethink my placement.  <br/>
<br/>
  I'm not criticizing anyones decision to remove their clues from the sites or for limiting their clues to WOM, that is their right to do so,  but for me this is not what the hobby is about.  I plant a box knowing that if it goes missing then its time was up.  I may or may not replace the box.  I feel sad that the history is gone (the log book) but take that as a challenge to find a better spot or make my clues tougher.  When I look for a box, if it is not where the clues point then I try to enjoy the hike back or make extra time to enjoy the spot I was lead to by the clues.  Yes it can be disappointing not to have another find to add to my count, but all is not lost because after all it is a game and you win some and loose some at that makes it fun!  Stamp or no stamp / Store bought or hand carved / drive by or long hike / tough clues or easy directions / mystery box or exact starting location they ALL add variety that makes this hobby diverse and yet universal at the same<br/>
 time.  <br/>
<br/>
  Just my $0.02 and I too will retreat to lurking!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While you will hear over and over again that there are no "rules" in letterboxing, that isn't exactly correct.   It is true that there is not a tidy list of *written* rules, but there are many *unwritten* rules.  The fact that they are unwritten makes it a little unclear what exactly they are and you could talk to 100 letterboxers and get 100+ different answers to the question.<br/>
<br/>
As you point out there are a lot of things about letterboxing that are based on personal preference, which is why it is so appealing to so many people.  Things such as whether to do look for boxes on short hikes or long hikes, whether to use hand-carved stamps or purchased stamps, whether to leave a note in the logbook or contact the placer, whether to log online or not, whether to include a first finder certificate in a box, etc. are all things that each person can decide for themselves based on their interests and limitations.  In the same respect, there are other things that aren't really open for interpretation, such as what minimally goes inside a letterbox.  The letterboxing FAQ, which is as close as there is to any written *rules* very clearly specify that a letterbox is to contain a stamp and a logbook.<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of what is written in e-mail has to be taken in the context it is being posted.  During these types of threads, people can often get quite opinionated, but when you read the posts, you also tend to put your own tone into it.  Reading an e-mail is not like talking face-to-face with somebody.  Often people who are very direct and to the point come across in e-mail as being harsh and rude simply because because they aren't sugar-coating or are standing firm on their opinon.  Without the benefit of hearing somebody's tone, assertiveness often comes across as aggressive, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that really I consider uncalled for and going too far is when people call names in their e-mails.  As for comments, opinions and such -- don't let it get to you.  Read them or not, and let them go.  Most of the letterboxers you will ever meet, including those whom you may have thought very rude based on talk list posts, are very nice people.<br/>
