We're really sorry we missed the WI Gathering - we definitely would <br/>
have liked to meet some of the new boxers in the area.  Our nieces &amp; <br/>
nephews would also have enjoyed actually seeing some other LBing KIDS <br/>
(there were none at the first WI Gathering).<br/>
<br/>
Congrats to those of you who just reached (or are almost at) the F100 <br/>
mark!  It wasn't long ago (April) that we were thrilled to reach the <br/>
triple digits.  Since then we've been lucky to take several trips <br/>
that have included letterboxing.  Last week we were in California <br/>
hiking, boxing, and wine tasting (that's why we missed the <br/>
Gathering).  While in CA we were excited to reach our F500 <br/>
milestone!  Our count is now F552 plus 28 Hitchhikers (We don't count <br/>
HH in our regular F count).  It's been a lot of fun finding boxes in <br/>
different areas (Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan, Maryland, <br/>
Connecticut, Wyoming, California, Hawaii and Scotland) and the thrill <br/>
of the hunt hasn't worn out yet - as a matter of fact it just seems <br/>
to get more and more addictive....<br/>
<br/>
Changing the subject once more: I saw a few recent posts about multi-<br/>
colored signature stamps and thought I would mention something we <br/>
noticed at the Monster Mash Gathering in Connecticut last month.  <br/>
Many people that had multi-colored signature stamps had PRE-STAMPED <br/>
their image on adhesive backed paper. They had several sheets of <br/>
their stamp, with each sheet containing multiple copies of an <br/>
appropriate "label/sticker" size to match the size of their signature <br/>
stamp.  When doing an exchange, all they did was peel off a "sticker" <br/>
with the pre-stamped image and place it in our journal. Not sure if <br/>
this would appeal to you, but it is an option to save time at <br/>
Gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
To answer another question - quite early on we decided to stick with <br/>
green as the color we use for our signature stamps and don't plan to <br/>
vary the color.  It's gotten to be "part of our signature".<br/>
