My system so far is using a  6-ring daytimer-type binder, which I've filled<br>
with cardstock punched to fit.  Unfortunately, I've been using texturized<br>
stock (the kind with corduroy-type ribbing), which can make it difficult to<br>
get a good image sometimes, but what I like is the portability of the pages.<br>
I make a mistake...out it comes.  I don't want to risk message up existing<br>
images on the road...I take them out.  This week I want to sort<br>
chronologically...next week I want to sort by Finds, Places, Exchanges,<br>
etc...no prob!  (Which BTW is my current system).  I've even taken some<br>
pictures which I've punched and included amongst the pages.  I have a little<br>
pouch that fits in it to hold my stamps and cats eye pads, and it has a loop<br>
for a pen.  Best is that it zips shut, so it all stays neat and together.<br>
Tuck a FF certificate in and it doesn't get lost.<br>
<br>
What do I actually DO with the saved images...nothing much.  Just look at<br>
them and reminisce, and as others have said, show them off to those worthy<br>
of appreciating them and becoming Converts to the Cause(!).<br>
