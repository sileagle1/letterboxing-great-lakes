for it soon.  We hope to re-place it in a few days with updated clues. <br>
<br>
 We had received a missing box report telling us that the tree hiding <br>
the box had been chopped down--with the sawn logs and sawdust <br>
littering the site.  That indeed was true, as we discovered when Do-Re-<br>
Mi Gal and I went to look for it today.  After heaving one of the sawn <br>
logs to the side and digging through the muck, we were able to find <br>
it!!  It would have been impossible to find without knowing its exact <br>
location since it was thoroughly buried.  We had to rush off to a <br>
cross country meet (Ball Magnet finished 9th!) so we didn't have time <br>
today to find a new spot.<br>
<br>
I had been feeling down a week or so ago, after getting a number of <br>
missing box reports so I was glad to find this one wouldn't need to be <br>
recarved.  We found another of our missing boxes in a nearby <br>
geocache.  I don't know why someone took it from its hiding spot and <br>
tossed it into the geocache, but it is back in its rightful home.  Now <br>
if we could just head to Florida and check on those missing boxes--not <br>
so hopeful there.<br>
