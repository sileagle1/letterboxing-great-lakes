                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Fungus Woman for hosting another great micro (or is it macro <br>
now?) meet. It was a lot of fun seeing old friends and new friends <br>
and meeting even newer friends. :)<br>
<br>
It was also fun boxing with Mini Mom and Jigsaw, though our <br>
adventures were short. :)<br>
<br>
Photos can be found at my photobucket page here: <br>

I will be adding more once I have a few moments to do so. Right now <br>
just the group photo is there.<br>
<br>
Whoever asked me about the 8th Illinois Calvary box...(was it <br>
Merlin?)...I went and checked on it today and found it in its <br>
rightful spot. There were some plants growing around it that looked <br>
like they could be posion ivy, so I moved them with a stick to see <br>
if the box was in place. I noticed the pile of trash, but the box <br>
isn't at that spot. If you would like a hint, email me and I will <br>
help you out as best I can. :) Oh...and for those who searched for <br>
the Old Pump box...it is missing. :(<br>
<br>
Goodnight all!<br>
