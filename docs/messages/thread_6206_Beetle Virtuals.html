  While I'm recooping and limited as to my ability to hike and look for traditional letterboxes, I've discovered how to create and post virtual boxes. Not the same 'rush' as finding a traditional box hidden in a hollow tree deep in the woods, but virtuals are serving my need to do something letterbox related while I'm about to go back for more physical theraphy. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! When you are hiking down a beautiful trail, think of me. ---Beetle<br>
