 I got my booty box today!!! Some great items in there!  Whoever donated the "new and improved Make your own hitchhiker kit", including a piece of PZ cut...love it!  I also love the 3 handy safety whistles, although my ears are telling me different, now that the kids found them!  <br/>
I think i got enough fixings to make at least 4 boxes!<br/>
Definitely got me in the mood for boxing!!!<br/>
Thanks everyone for the great winter fun!<br/>
