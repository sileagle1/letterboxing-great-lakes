The game's afoot<br>
In letterboxing, players search for clues, leave their marks<br>
Phil Kloer - Staff<br>
Saturday, August 7, 2004<br>
<br>
Go past the granite marker with a red arrow, across the railroad <br>
tracks, alongside the stone wall, across the road, down the winding <br>
dirt path, around the boulder on the right, up to the pine tree. <br>
Reach into the hole in the rotting log nearby and Bingo! There it <br>
is, a little Tupperware container. <br>
<br>
On the lid is written "This is not trash! This is a letterbox." <br>
<br>
Letterboxing is like treasure hunting for a treasure with no <br>
intrinsic value. The idea is to follow clues posted on the Internet <br>
(which range from easy to diabolically hard) and find boxes that <br>
other letterboxers have hidden. It's a small but rapidly growing <br>
subculture of hobbyists in metro Atlanta and scattered worldwide, <br>
who sing the praises of hiking outdoors, participating as a family <br>
and solving a puzzle. <br>
<br>
"You get exercise. You get a nice view. You complete a quest," says <br>
Mark Britt, 32, of Stone Mountain. <br>
<br>
"My husband calls it hiking with purpose," says Beverly Matoney, who <br>
home schools her two children in Alpharetta. "I'd get out and walk <br>
in the woods anyway, but this is a treasure at the end of a hike. <br>
It's definitely something for the whole family." <br>
<br>
Britt and Matoney will be among the first gathering of letterboxers <br>
in Georgia today at Stone Mountain Park. More than 50 letterboxers <br>
from nine states are expected to attend, and they'll be scouring the <br>
park for the 10 boxes hidden there. More than 100 letterboxes are <br>
hidden around Georgia, from one near the Newton County Courthouse in <br>
Covington to one near Emory University. But Stone Mountain Park has <br>
the highest concentration of letterboxes in the state. <br>
<br>
Most of the people attending the gathering have never met but have <br>
corresponded through e-mail. Although letterboxing itself is a <br>
somewhat solitary pursuit, hobbyists connect on the Internet, <br>
sometimes forming online communties in places like Yahoo Groups. <br>
<br>
"This might not exist if not for the Internet," says Britt, who <br>
edits catalogs for an automotive restoration company but calls <br>
letterboxing "almost like a second job, but one you don't get paid <br>
for." <br>
<br>
Letterboxing is about more than hunting. Most letterboxers create <br>
their own hand-carved rubber stamps (some buy them in stores, but <br>
that's considered less classy) and make their own personalized <br>
logbooks. When a box is found, it will have its own unique stamp and <br>
book inside. The finder prints his or her own personal stamp into <br>
the box's book, then adds the stamp from the box to his or her <br>
logbook. Then the box is resealed and carefully returned to its <br>
hiding place for the next person to find. <br>
<br>
Leafing through a letterbox's book, which may be the size of a deck <br>
of cards or a paperback book, reveals a history of everyone who has <br>
been there, using their "trail names": Silent Doug, She Who Plants, <br>
Poison Ivy, Psycho Mommy, Amyrica, Town Crier. Some homemade stamps <br>
are simple; some are like little masterpieces of folk art. <br>
<br>
There's no competition in letterboxing per se, but there is <br>
certainly prestige for finding or planting lots of boxes. Finding <br>
100 boxes is generally considered a milestone. <br>
<br>
"Some people are famous, because they've found so many boxes," says <br>
Mike Fairman, a Salvation Army administrator from Loganville. "When <br>
you see a stamp like 'Wanda & Pete,' it's like seeing an autograph <br>
of someone famous." <br>
<br>
Fairman and his family's immersion into letterboxing is typical. He <br>
and his wife, Carol, heard about the activity in late December. <br>
Three days later, they tramped through more than 11 miles of trails <br>
in Stone Mountain Park, collecting and stamping. <br>
<br>
"We were hooked," says Carol Fairman. "At 35, I never would have <br>
seen myself running through a cornfield to get a stamp." <br>
<br>
Letterboxing is said to have begun in 1854, when James Perrott hid <br>
his calling card in a bottle near a pool in Devon, England, inviting <br>
others to add their cards. Eventually, people began leaving <br>
postcards ("letterbox" is the British word for our "mailbox"), <br>
although there appears to be a long interval between Perrott and the <br>
revival of letterboxing in England in the 1980s and '90s. An article <br>
in Smithsonian Magazine in 1998 seems to have jumped letterboxing to <br>
North America, and while the Northeast and Pacific Northwest regions <br>
were stronger at first, now the South is playing catch-up. <br>
<br>
Unlike many activities, letterboxing has no organization or <br>
association. There are no rules, although there is a system of <br>
etiquette that includes caring for other people's boxes and not <br>
damaging nature. <br>
<br>
As a result, there's no way to know how many people are into <br>
letterboxing. Britt guesses there might be no more than 100 in metro <br>
Atlanta, but the number of boxes and hunters is growing rapidly. <br>
<br>
"In January, there were 38 letterboxes in Georgia, and now there's <br>
over 100," says Britt. <br>
<br>
There's a fair amount of ambivalence about the activity becoming <br>
widespread and attracting masses of new hunters because of the <br>
respect and care needed to protect the system of hiding and finding. <br>
<br>
"It's starting to really blow up," says Fairman. "When it's a small <br>
number of people, you can trust them. But the more people you have, <br>
the less trust you have." <br>
