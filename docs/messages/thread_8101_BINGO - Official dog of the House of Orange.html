    I've not been paying good attention this yea, and after seeing this
    email and comparing my progress, I took a second look at the the
    list of calls...'hoping for just one more'...and surprisingly I
    found one I had missed!...well, I'M happy!<br/>

<p>Well, here I thought you might be calling a 4-Corners
              BINGO since today's word was in the "O" column.  I guess
              you need more than "4eyes" to keep track of this game!
               The 10-spot Bingo was called over 3 weeks ago, so you are
              way too late.</p>
<div><br/>
</div>
<div>But speaking of 10, there are currently 10 players that
              are more than half way to a Full Card.  </div>
<div><br/>
</div>
<div>But I suspect the next Bingo called will be 4-Corners,
              and if we ever start getting more "N" words, someone will
