<br>
I think I know who you are, but until I verify that w/ a personal  <br>
email, I'll take a moment to thank you here first and let everyone  <br>
else have a cyber-peek at my goodies:<br>
<br>
Before my goodies arrived, my Santa had sent me about 1-2 postcards a  <br>
week from various locations in the US... all mentioning good  <br>
letterboxes to find in the area. Very neat! (At last count, I think  <br>
there were 6 postcards.) All with the snowflake stamp (see below) on  <br>
it... so I knew immediately who it was from :-)<br>
<br>
Then, after all that anticipation....<br>
<br>
My package arrived Wednesday afternoon, and had some of the most  <br>
awesome things in it:<br>
<br>
The contents of the entire package were all S*N*O*W*F*L*A*K*E  <br>
themed!!! There was an awesome carved stamp of a snowflake, with a  <br>
great silver ink pad!<br>
<br>
Also, the coolest little hitch-hiker kit that I've ever seen. (Did  <br>
you make that yourself, Santa??? You should sell those online  <br>
somewhere if so, I'm sure you'd get takers :-)<br>
<br>
Then there was the cutest little white christmas letterboxer bear  <br>
tree ornament... complete with back-pack, tiny rolled up clues  <br>
sticking out from the back-pack (and thank you for THAT clue,  <br>
hehehe!) and the bear also holds a stamp and logbook in his hands!  <br>
Absolutely so cute.<br>
<br>
Next was a winter mini - scrapbook/logbook... I'll surely use that!<br>
<br>
And a box of yummy hot chocolate (I've already hid that in the back  <br>
of the pantry; with 3 growing boys at home, that won't last otherwise!)<br>
<br>
And (if I'm not missing anything else,) the really, really special  <br>
gift: A beautiful hand-knit dark red scarf, with a beautiful  <br>
snowflake pattern throughout! It is so, SO nice!!! I just love it!  <br>
I'll be wearing that while I trek the trails this coming Fall.<br>
<br>
Santa, you really out-did yourself! And you also gave me WONDERFUL  <br>
ideas for next year's Santa exchange! I've never participated in this  <br>
before, and the idea of a whole set of "themed" gifts was so  <br>
wonderful to discover in the great box of goodies you sent me :-)<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
<br>
