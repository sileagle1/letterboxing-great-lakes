Doodle &amp; Deedle, Congratulations!!  Having just celebrated our 6th <br/>
anniversary, we'd like to impart a personal observation (trust us, <br/>
you'll get lots of unwarranted advice in the months to come):  Don't <br/>
let the planning drive you nuts.  It's such a relief once the <br/>
wedding's over and you can start your new adventure together!<br/>

Oh, me! Me!  And it's gonna seem like a whole lot less than 3 weeks for me since those are busy and over-stimulating weeks between now and then.  I'm gonna be exhausted by the end of June!  See you all at the gathering!<br/>
