I-55 south to I-80 west to I-39 south (okay, so far so good....)<br/>
Then they have us taking:<br/>
IL-18 W/N13th Rd for 14.2 miles<br/>
left at IL-26 S/Prairie St. for 6.5 mi<br/>
right at IL-17 E/5th St. for 1.6 mi<br/>
left at IL-29 S/Railroad St. for 16.1 mi<br/>
right at IL-6 S for 7.2 mi<br/>
right at US-150 W/W War Memorial Dr for 8 mi<br/>
blah, blah, blah into the park<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It looks to me just taking I-80 a bit further to I-190 south and merging into IL-29 seems a bit more straightforward.  It only adds about 5 minutes to the total mileage.  What do you guys who live down in those parts suggest?<br/>

The route listed below is the one we use from Princeton. Another option if you prefer interstate driving all the way is take I-55 South to Bloomington IL and get on I-74 West. The park is right off of Route 150 and very close to I-74. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are a few entrances to the park, but the easiest for our locations (camping/our shelter) is to enter by the Historic site - turn north off of Rt. 150 onto Jubilee-Princeville Rd. after a short ways you'll see a sign for the Jubilee College historic Site. Turn left west here to enter site. At the end of the road is a gate blocking enterance to the site. Turn right here and enter the park. Follow the road around and you'll see a signs for Quail Meadow Shelter (turn left/then right). To reach the camping host area to check in to camp, don't turn towards the shelters, just continue on and you'll come upon the camping area. There is a site map of the park in the files section of this group under Gatherings/GLG 2010. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am still trying to find out what the check in/check out times for the campground are. Stay Tuned!<br/>

I-39 south then exited at Hwy 24 heading west into Peoria (Hwy 24 merges<br/>

We got stopped by a friendly police officer on Hwy 24 for speeding (quite a<br/>

similar to the one I took last week.  However, I think I just took <br/>
TrailTrolls route of I80 out to I180 which turns into IL29 to IL 6 and <br/>
then US 150...<br/>
<br/>
On the way back I took Hwy 24 east to cut over to I55 and I57 (I was <br/>
driving through Bourbonnais to check on our boxes....which, <br/>
surprisingly, one was still there!)<br/>
<br/>
Of the routes, both kinda lead off the main drag for a bit, and both <br/>
were easy drives.  A note...get water and supplies before you get close <br/>
to the park.  I was surprised to find that the nearest gas station <br/>
wasn't very nearby.<br/>

trying to save you from a fate similar to mine.  :-)<br/>
