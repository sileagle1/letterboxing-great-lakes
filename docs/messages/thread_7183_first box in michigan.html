                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll start the guessing, and see if anybody can come up with an older one.  Fumee Lake and Presque Isle Park were both planted 10/17/2000 by Yoopers.  They were last found 11/26/10 and 8/13/11, respectively, so both may still be active.  Better plan for a road trip since I think they're both in the U.P.  <br>
<br>
The oldest one I could find below the bridge is Birthday, in Saugatuck.  It was planted 8/26/2001 by 2 Bent Riders, and was found 8/5/11, so it's probably still there too. <br>
