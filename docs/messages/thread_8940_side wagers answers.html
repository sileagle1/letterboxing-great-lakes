<p>Bingo is a game we like to play.</p>
<p>It helps us while the winter away!</p>
<p>There are winners with their full cards.</p>
<p>And losers with their poems like bards.</p>
<p>And with any other game, match or set,</p>
<p>we players, and watchers, like to bet!</p>
<p>Side wagers is our friendly side pot,</p>
<p>to bet on when we will see the top spot.</p>
<p>Players pick their favorite date.</p>
<p>and then we sit around and wait.</p>
<p>Occasionally I send a cryptic clue,</p>
<p>to let you know who’s in the queue.</p>
<p>ASLGirl, Fungus Woman and MamaStork</p>
<p>are hoping they get to pop a cork!</p>

<p>The side wagers game continues along.</p>
<p>ASLGirl guessed the date wrong.</p>
<p>Fungus Woman is next in line.</p>
<p>I’d bet she’s not feeling fine.</p>
<p>Coming up next is Mama Stork!</p>
<p>I think she’s done, where’s the fork?</p>
<p>The Gamer Ruettens following after.</p>
<p>Will it have them swinging from rafters?</p>

<p>Side Wagers keeps on rolling</p>
<p>When will the winner’s bell start tolling?</p>
<p>FungusWoman has been kicked out</p>
<p>I hope she eats a waffle and doesn’t pout!</p>
<p>Up next is a Stork named Mama</p>
<p>She’s losing hope to win this drama!</p>
<p>The Ruettens like the gamers,</p>
<p>But it’s not likely they’ll be hall of famers!</p>
<p>Martini Man is coming up a little later</p>
<p>He will probably say later alligator!</p>

<p>MamaStork did not pick the right date</p>
<p>Her math did not quite equate</p>
<p>The Gamer Ruettens are up quick</p>
<p>Probably not too happy with their pick</p>
<p>MartiniMan follows right behind</p>
<p>It is way too late to change his mind</p>
<p>Next in the queue is getn froggy </p>
<p>Their chances seem a little soggy</p>

<p>What’s with all these coded sayings?</p>
<p>They’re for the side wagers game we’re playing.</p>
<p>Gamer Ruettens’ day has gone by</p>
<p>May oh my, time does fly.</p>
<p>Martini Man picked this very day.</p>
<p>Getn froggy wants tomorrow to go their way.</p>
<p>After that, many dates unoccupied</p>

<p>Did yesterday’s make you say ON NO!?</p>
<p>For some help, search for the Navajo.</p>
<p>MartinMan just lost his pick,</p>
<p>Time for him to grab a hiking stick.</p>
<p>Getn Froggy wants today to score</p>
<p>They better start looking for the door.</p>

<p>AtomicBeans have smiles on their faces!</p>

<p>A better date might be picked by a doggy.</p>
<p>You won’t hear from me for a while,</p>
<p>Atomic Beans are sitting with a smile.</p>
<p>Angel Winks sits not far behind.</p>
<p>A winning date is on her mind.</p>
<p>A little while later we have Mich Kathy.</p>

<p>The bingo game goes on and on!</p>
<p>Along with it, Side Wagers tags along.</p>
<p>Atomic Beans must be really sad,</p>
<p>almost two weeks for a win to be had!</p>
<p>They were almost on the brink,</p>
<p>but gave up their spot to Angel Winks.</p>
<p>She would like to see the cards get filled,</p>
<p>so she can head out on the trails and hills.</p>
<p>Then, MichKathy coming up soon.</p>
<p>A win would put her over the moon!</p>
<p>If she can’t get in on the fun,</p>
<p>next in line is Party of Six plus one.</p>

<p>Oops, I got busy and missed some dates!</p>
<p>MichKathy and Partyof6plus1 were bested by fates.</p>
<p>I hear the closest card needs five words.</p>
<p>To me, that sounds really absurd!</p>
<p>But spring has been sprung!</p>
<p>And bingo is nearly done.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Hiker has a few days to win.</p>
<p>Her hopes are looking fairly thin!</p>
<p>Next are HowD Girls and TJ Mich.</p>
<p>Will either of them get their wish?</p>
<p>-used backwards (reversed) text</p>

<p>Wisconsin Hiker picked her birthday.</p>
<p>Sadly things didn’t go her way.</p>
<p>Today belongs to Girls a la How D</p>
<p>not looking like they’ll have a party.</p>
<p>Tj MIch looking for a win tomorrow.</p>
<p>I wonder if it’ll bring cheers or sorrow.</p>
<p>Next on the list is the prairie dog.</p>
<p>Maybe they could celebrate with a grog?</p>

<p>TJ Mich hoping for the seventh.</p>
<p>Will today bring him presents?</p>
<p>Prairie dog has chosen the eighth.</p>
<p>For a win, they’re keeping the faith.</p>
<p>Then right after, we have Hartx6</p>

<p>For side wagers, TJ MIch is forlorn.</p>
<p>Prairie dog has a small amount of hope,</p>
<p>But is probably hanging by a rope.</p>
<p>HartxSix has their day coming</p>
<p>A win would have them humming.</p>
<p>Next up, we see the Northstarr. </p>
<p>If they win, we’ll have some caviar!</p>

<p>Is tomorrow looking good for Pastor’s Wife?</p>

<p>Dancing Dolphins Jennifer did not have success. </p>
<p>Let us all wish her the best! </p>
<p>Packer Backers won this game last year.</p>
<p>Her hope for a repeat is running out, I fear.</p>
<p>Behind her Dawnkey is waiting for glory.</p>
<p>A win would add to her letterboxing story.</p>
<p>If things don’t go her way, TrailMark is behind.</p>
<p>If there's a win on
Saturday, he surely won’t mind.</p>

<p>Looking for a winner tomorrow is TrailMark.</p>
<p>After a win, he’d take the family to a park.</p>

<p>They lost their days, my oh my!</p>

<p>He didn’t pick the correct spot.</p>
<p>Following up soon is the NorseGnome.</p>
<p>I hope she wins, or this game is doomed.</p>

<p>Well, this is unprecedented,</p>
<p>And it has me a little demented!</p>
<p>The side wagers game is done.</p>
<p>But, yet, no one has definitively won!</p>
<p>Norse Gnome’s day has gone on by.</p>
<p>And no one claimed a bingo win, oh my!</p>
<p>No one picked any days in May.</p>
<p>Who thought that things would go this way?</p>
<p>I will wait two days for someone to claim</p>
<p>April 30 as their bingo day of fame.</p>
<p>If not, I guess I will pick a lucky winner</p>
<p>On my random number spinner.</p>
