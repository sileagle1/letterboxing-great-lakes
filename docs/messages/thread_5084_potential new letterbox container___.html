Ball (the canning jar company) has a new line of plastic freezer jars. The smallest size is 8 oz, and comes in a package of 4 for $2.99. They are round, with a screw cap lid which screws into the jar itself (not onto the jar, like a conventional lid). Unfortunately, the lid is a lovely shade of orchid (nice for hiding in a dense patch of violets!!), so it would need some camo tape. They seem sturdier than the disposable food storage containers, but lighter thanthe conventional kind. Being freezer jars, they should hold up to the winters. And the label says "Keep your creations fresh"! Maybe they even intend them for letterboxes! (-:<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think my main concern is the way the lids fit into the jar, that <br/>
someone may not set them in straight and may screw it on at an angle, <br/>
making it less waterproof or even stripping the threads.  I also <br/>
wonder if dirt or grit might more readily get in there, also <br/>
affecting the seal.  I've used screwcapped plastic jars and <br/>
centrifuge tubes before, but with conventional lids, and haven't had <br/>
problems.<br/>
