                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all! I've had a series planted in a local National Park (I actually <br/>
thought it was a Metropark at the time). One of the boxes was <br/>
confiscated so I yanked the last three. <br/>
<br/>
A cranky Ranger left me a message and we've talked. I gave him my name <br/>
and he said I can pick up my box, but that he needs a copy of my <br/>
drivers license! Is this normal; has anyone else had this happen.<br/>
<br/>
Advice? Thanks, Travel'n Turtle<br/>
