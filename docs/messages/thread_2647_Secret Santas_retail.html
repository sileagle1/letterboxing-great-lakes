find a dress, but I went to the mall on the other side of town from <br>
me (at mine, there was nothing unless you are under a size 12 - and <br>
that, I am not - have not been since I was 22, LOL).  Anyway, I found <br>
a wonderful dress at 60% off AND matching shoes for half off.  I <br>
spent less than $50 on the set!  You have to love that!  But the fact <br>
that the retailers think I am done shopping for summer (which does <br>
not even start for another week or 2) in early June, well - there are <br>
a whole lot of us out there shopping for things as we need them, <br>

It is not the store it is the clothing manufacturers-- that is what they  <br>

stripping winter coats and sweaters.  Dread that this year.<br>

The kids are just getting out of school and starting to enjoy their summer vacations, and the stores start to clear the shelves for school supplies.  My husband still gets sick when he walks into a store and smells notebook paper, pencils and crayons.  He never really like school.  <br>
<br>
But Christmas....that's a whole different thing!  There are actually year round Christmas stores.  I know that some people think that's weird too.  <br>
<br>
I just wish the spirit of Christmas, people thinking about others, people celebrating, people coming together, would last longer than those few busy weeks before Christmas and then....tear it all down!  <br>

It doesn't even phase me anymore.  Sometimes people want out of season items because of vacation plans.  Trying to meet customer needs is a hard job.  <br>
