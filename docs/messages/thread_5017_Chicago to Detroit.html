                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
I thought that there was a listing of boxes along i-94/i-80 in our <br>
database or files section, but I can't seem to find it now.  But, <br>
poke around in there on Yahoo, there may be something I missed.<br>
<br>
On Atlasquest, you can do a "trip planner" search and select highways <br>
and map them out.  It's a cool feature.  But, it'll only show up <br>
boxes that are on AQ, which only seems to be about 1/2 in this area <br>
(SE Michigan).  To do this, click on Lettterboxes on the main menu, <br>
then advance search.  On that page over on the top right, use the <br>
little drop down thing to select trip planner.  Then you just go from there.<br>
<br>
I know there are several boxes in the Dearborn/Allen <br>
Park/Wyandotte/Taylor/Trenton/Livonia/Redford areas that should be <br>
pretty accessible to you when you're here.<br>
<br>
I have a box in Jackson County, MI that's not too far off i-94.<br>
<br>
Good luck to your daughter and have fun!<br>
