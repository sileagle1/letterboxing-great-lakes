there is a new sexton, and they are there ALL the time -- which is good <br>
for the grounds, but bad for my sweet little piece of heaven.<br>
<br>
I have not had the chance to check on all of these yet this <br>
summer...and LPOH #1 is the one that always seems to go missing, so <br>
I'll be checking it on my way home today.<br>
<br>
If you haven't found these boxes yet (clues to be found in the files <br>
section of this group) -- make a plan to this summer, but I'll be <br>
retiring them in November of this year.  Have no fear, I have another <br>
plan in mind...I'll keep you posted.<br>

Ack!  I have figured out all the locations but haven't made it over <br>
to that side of the state yet to actually find them!  Thanks for the <br>
warning!  I'll have to make a point of getting over there soon!<br>
