June.  Our pile of donated stamps has grown to six gorgeous carves, and <br/>
we still encourage the rest of you to carve a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, we are going to follow the model developed by last year's <br/>
GLK gathering, and we are now welcoming cash donations in advance of the <br/>
gathering. While we will still put out a donation jug at the event (to <br/>
defray the costs of some of the food, shelter permits, boxes, clues <br/>
sheets...), we encourage you to DONATE EARLY! Anyone who donates by May <br/>
1 will get the clues early (rather than Saturday morning, you will get <br/>
them around Wednesday) and will receive clues to a baker dozen <br/>
"supporter series".<br/>
<br/>
The suggested donation is $10/adult or $25/family.  You can mail your <br/>
donation to the address listed on the stamp submission form (please <br/>
include your email address), or contact me to arrange some other <br/>
electronic method.  Just a reminder, IL parks do not require you to pay <br/>
on entry...so kick a few of those dollars our way!<br/>
<br/>
See you in June!<br/>
