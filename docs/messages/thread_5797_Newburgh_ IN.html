Dogs can go letterboxing, too!  My two adore boxing with me.  And it would be a good way to wear the new dog out a little so it behaves better (i.e. sleeps) on the car ride home.  What are you getting, BTW?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We did take our previous dog on many letterboxing trips.  He loved to hike - and except for getting foxtails and burrs in his coat, it was great fun.  He was a papillon - and he died during a dental procedure in February, due to a problem with the anasthesia.  We've been devasted.  I really didn't know how hard it would be to lose a dog - he was my baby.  So, noving on, we are looking at a new papillon.  Hopefully the breeder will like us and we will like the dog!  She looks cute!  And is an active girl.  Her dad is a champion agility dog.  Good for hikes and letterboxing!  Here she is:  <br/>
