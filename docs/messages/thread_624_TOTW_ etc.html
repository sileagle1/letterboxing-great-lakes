                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, i've already posted my "get-up"...a tie-dyed<br>
shirt in yellow, purple, and green (the Mardi-Gras<br>
shirt, as I call it), olive green cargo pants that<br>
roll up, a tan visor, and hiking shoes, sandals.<br>
Sometimes I vary the shirt and will wear a red ringer<br>
shirt with UTAH on it.<br>
<br>
I am surprised with the number of backpacks...I tried<br>
that, but decided that the bigger the area, the more<br>
crap i'll try to stuff into it. I carry an old<br>
messenger purse in olive green I got off the clearance<br>
rack at Old Navy. It's already got the obligatory ink<br>
stains from my markers and is ready for some patches.<br>
It's big enough to carry the essentials (log, markers,<br>
stamp, ink pads, compass, kleenex, bug spray, extra<br>
ziplocs, pen, cell phone, beach glass from Lake<br>
Michigan) and small enough to prevent me from carrying<br>
everything but the kitchen sink, which I would do if I<br>
had the space. <br>
<br>
Also in the news, the International City letterbox I<br>
just planted is out of commission for the time being.<br>
The Lorain County Metro Parks is requiring permits for<br>
letterboxes now, so they pulled all letterboxes<br>
without permits. French Creek has definately been<br>
pulled and probably One Hundred Acres Wood series as<br>
well. I'm in contact with Polly, placer of French<br>
Creek, and hopefully both boxes will be back shortly.<br>
