made today enjoyable as I look out my window and wonder what I am doing <br/>
inside working!<br/>

At 11:35 AM 4/25/2005, you wrote:<br/>
&gt;For a month we'd planned this trip to the Pike County<br/>
&gt;area of Ohio to letterbox.  It was going to be April,<br/>
&gt;the weather was supposed to be nice, on Wednesday<br/>
&gt;weather.com said 60-degree weather.  And then, as I<br/>
&gt;lamented last week, the forecast changed to cold and<br/>
&gt;rain and snow!  But we still persevered.  For anyone<br/>
&gt;who wishes to hear of our adventures, here's the<br/>
&gt;recap:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once we got south of Columbus, the rain let up for the<br/>
&gt;most part.  It was still drizzely, but the temps<br/>
&gt;weren't too bad.  Here's a tip we discovered for<br/>
&gt;'boxing in the rain.  If you forget to bring a sheet<br/>
&gt;protector for your clues, a gallon-sized storage<br/>
&gt;baggie works beautifully for keeping those clues dry<br/>
&gt;and mud-free.  I don't think we'll ever use a sheet<br/>
&gt;protector again....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We first stopped in Circleville (Pickaway county)<br/>
&gt;where we found both the letterboxes hidden in Ted<br/>
&gt;Lewis Park.  This was around lunchtime on Friday.  We<br/>
&gt;started searching for the Ted Lewis Park box, and then<br/>
&gt;two women showed up to spend their lunch hour right in<br/>
&gt;the area we needed to be.  So we played on the<br/>
&gt;playground equipment for a bit, found Torch of<br/>
&gt;Freedom, and then hung out under another picnic<br/>
&gt;pavilion until they finally left.  The clues for Ted<br/>
&gt;Lewis were driving us crazy, though, and we were about<br/>
&gt;to give up and headed back to the car when I started<br/>
&gt;being nosey and found that here we'd parked right in<br/>
&gt;front of the hiding place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So with our count being F2 and the drizzle pretty much<br/>
&gt;having stopped, we headed to AW Marion to look for<br/>
&gt;Drew Landmark &amp; Pandamonium.  We found Drew, and then<br/>
&gt;started out on the path to find Pandamonium.  Dragon,<br/>
&gt;you're in good company - just like you wrote in the<br/>
&gt;Drew logbook, we walked the entire 5 mile path around<br/>
&gt;the lake, too.  The clues to find Pandamonium say that<br/>
&gt;it's an easy find, and it is - if you take the path in<br/>
&gt;the right direction!  Sadly, this logbook was soaked,<br/>
&gt;so we did what we could in the way of First Aid and<br/>
&gt;we're going to try to contact the placer to let them<br/>
&gt;know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At least, with walking 5 miles, we wouldn't feel<br/>
&gt;guilty about the Elephant Ears we were planning on<br/>
&gt;eating at the Pike County Dogwood Festival the next<br/>
&gt;day.  And at least it hadn't been raining as we hiked<br/>
&gt;around the lake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After AW Marion, we continued south, stopping at the<br/>
&gt;Logan Elm Memorial to eat dinner.  What a quiet,<br/>
&gt;peaceful spot!  And, by now the sun was also actually<br/>
&gt;shining!  We only found 1 of the 3 boxes that had been<br/>
&gt;planted at Logan Elm, though (that being Jack).<br/>
&gt;Someone had given us a head's up that they couldn't<br/>
&gt;find Untie The Ribbon this past fall, and sure enough,<br/>
&gt;its hiding place had at least 5 inches of standing<br/>
&gt;water.  More contacting the placer to do...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We by-passed Chillicothe, saving that for on the way<br/>
&gt;home on Sunday.  We stopped at Canal Park in Waverly<br/>
&gt;to look for Rocky, but couldn't find that one.  It was<br/>
&gt;almost 7 PM now, and after much sweet talking I<br/>
&gt;convinced Deedle that we needed to go to the rest area<br/>
&gt;on Route 23 just past the Pike County border to look<br/>
&gt;for the 2 boxes hidden there before the sun set around<br/>
&gt;8.  We went 1 for 2 there, finding Jester but not<br/>
&gt;Passenger Pigeon (although it's listed that someone<br/>
&gt;found it on April 4th of this year, so hmmmm).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Alas, the sun that had visited us briefly that day<br/>
&gt;departed and during the night the thunderstorm came.<br/>
&gt;The next day it did rain the whole entire day, but<br/>
&gt;we'd travelled so far to search for boxes, we weren't<br/>
&gt;going to let cold rain stop us.  And most of these<br/>
&gt;sounded like they'd be fairly easy finds.  To those of<br/>
&gt;you who hide boxes close to picnic pavillions, we<br/>
&gt;thank you for giving us dry places to spread out and<br/>
&gt;stamp in! :)  Makes it much easier than trying to hold<br/>
&gt;an umbrella...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First stop of the day was a little town called Jasper<br/>
&gt;to look for a box hidden around this sad, abandonded<br/>
&gt;church on a hill.  We climbed the steps to the top,<br/>
&gt;looked around, and just as we were ready to begin<br/>
&gt;searching, we heard barking.  We looked up.  The<br/>
&gt;property next to the church, which was down a slope<br/>
&gt;and a decent distance away, had 2 dogs in the yard.<br/>
&gt;As Deedle put it, 2 junkyard dogs that he named Kujo<br/>
&gt;and Black Shuck once we were back in the safety of our<br/>
&gt;Jeep.  They started barking, and then they started<br/>
&gt;running towards us.  Now, we're from the city, where<br/>
&gt;dogs are supposed to be chained up, but this is the<br/>
&gt;big, wide open country where their post office was<br/>
&gt;literally a trailer.  As soon as we saw those dogs<br/>
&gt;start running and that they didn't have chains to hold<br/>
&gt;them back, we flew back down those stairs, jumped in<br/>
&gt;the jeep, and took off.  I've created a new stats<br/>
&gt;category, M, for Mission Aborted, which we will use<br/>
&gt;when our letterboxing efforts were abruptly ended for<br/>
&gt;fear of life and limbs.  (Hopefully this will have<br/>
&gt;been the only time we'll need to use that category.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To add insult to injury (ok, avoiding an injury from<br/>
&gt;dog bites), I checked letterboxing.org just now and<br/>
&gt;the box we'd been searching (Morgan's Raid #1) for by<br/>
&gt;that church is listed as missing.  Was that listed<br/>
&gt;when I printed off the clues??  Luckily, our second<br/>
&gt;venture for the Gingko box was much more succesful<br/>
&gt;(and dog-less).  Next stop was Pike Lake State Park,<br/>
&gt;where we found Autumn Leaves and were the First<br/>
&gt;Finders of Munch, Munch!  (Of course, this was after<br/>
&gt;our 8-mile round trip side trip up a narrow mountain<br/>
&gt;road because the clues as to where we needed to start<br/>
&gt;the search for Autumn Leaves were misinterpretted.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We then drove to Lake White State Park to find Rubber<br/>
&gt;Duckie, and ended the day in Beaver, Ohio, where we<br/>
&gt;found Morgan's Raid #3 (with another very soaked<br/>
&gt;logbook).  We then wanted to find Ohio's Most Perfect<br/>
&gt;Tree (which also has a letterbox hidden there).  Yes,<br/>
&gt;our government has declared this tree the Most Perfect<br/>
&gt;Tree in the state.  Evidently it's so perfect, though,<br/>
&gt;that mere mortals cannot find it, or at least, we<br/>
&gt;couldn't.  Per the clues, it was 3 &amp; 1/2 miles south<br/>
&gt;of the Route 335 &amp; Route 32 intersection, on Route<br/>
&gt;335.  Sounds simple enough, a sign was supposed to<br/>
&gt;mark its location.  We drove up and down that stretch<br/>
&gt;of road twice and although we saw some fairly perfect<br/>
&gt;trees to our eyes, we couldn't find THE perfect tree!<br/>
&gt;Deedle kept grumbling that there should be an address<br/>
&gt;for it, to which I replied, "It's a TREE!  Trees don't<br/>
&gt;have addresses!"  The only thing we could think of was<br/>
&gt;that Govenor Taft had the tree cut down and sold for<br/>
&gt;firewood to help solve Ohio's budget woes....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When we got back to the hotel, we asked about The Most<br/>
&gt;Perfect Tree at the front desk.  The woman had no idea<br/>
&gt;what we were talking about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was now dinner time, and our plan was to eat fair<br/>
&gt;food at the Dogwood Festival.  Poor festival - it was<br/>
&gt;almost as deserted as that old abandoned church.  Half<br/>
&gt;the booths had packed up and left; of what was still<br/>
&gt;there, only a handful of food booths were open.  We<br/>
&gt;did get our elephant ears, though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The next day we woke up to snow.  At least it wasn't<br/>
&gt;really accumlating, though.  We started to drive back<br/>
&gt;north and stopped in Chillicothe.  Of those 50-some<br/>
&gt;boxes hidden in the city, thanks to the weather we<br/>
&gt;were only able to search for 2.  We found Lonely Rock<br/>
&gt;and Pooh Trail #1 (both with wet logbooks :( ) before<br/>
&gt;Deedle declared that if we searched for any more he<br/>
&gt;would get pneumonia.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So thus ended our weekend down "south."  Evidently we<br/>
&gt;drove into some time machine that took us back to<br/>
&gt;February once we reached Cleveland.  Ick, ick, ick!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope everyone is keeping warm,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
