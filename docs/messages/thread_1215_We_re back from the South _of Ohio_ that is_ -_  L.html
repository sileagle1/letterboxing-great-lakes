><br>
>We then drove to Lake White State Park to find Rubber<br>

>our government has declared this tree the Most Perfect<br>
>Tree in the state.  Evidently it's so perfect, though,<br>

>335.  Sounds simple enough, a sign was supposed to<br>

>Deedle kept grumbling that there should be an address<br>

>that Govenor Taft had the tree cut down and sold for<br>
>firewood to help solve Ohio's budget woes....<br>
><br>
>When we got back to the hotel, we asked about The Most<br>
>Perfect Tree at the front desk.  The woman had no idea<br>
>what we were talking about.<br>
><br>
>It was now dinner time, and our plan was to eat fair<br>

>almost as deserted as that old abandoned church.  Half<br>
>the booths had packed up and left; of what was still<br>
>there, only a handful of food booths were open.  We<br>
>did get our elephant ears, though.<br>
><br>
>The next day we woke up to snow.  At least it wasn't<br>
>really accumlating, though.  We started to drive back<br>
>north and stopped in Chillicothe.  Of those 50-some<br>
>boxes hidden in the city, thanks to the weather we<br>
>were only able to search for 2.  We found Lonely Rock<br>
>and Pooh Trail #1 (both with wet logbooks :( ) before<br>
>Deedle declared that if we searched for any more he<br>
>would get pneumonia.<br>

>So thus ended our weekend down "south."  Evidently we<br>
>drove into some time machine that took us back to<br>
