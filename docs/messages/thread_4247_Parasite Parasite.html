 I have a parasite called 'The Lady wears polka dots' in my old trunk box.? I picked it up a couple months ago.? There is no reference to any other parasite in the logbook, someone must have put it in and taken it out Friday during the 2 hours it was at the garage sale.<br>

 That one was carved by Livb4idy@aol.com.  The first stamping in the paper supplied where from 8/06 in the Ashland, Ohio area.  Both stamps are from a gum eraser, each about 1 inch square.  I don't think it is the same.  The parasite is in a gum-ball machine style capsule.<br>

The Parasite we're referring to was in the same baggie<br>
<br>
with "all thumbs" as I recall. They were both carved<br>
<br>
from erasers. There was no name or email to report<br>

Being brand spankin' new to letterboxing, I thought this group was here to answer questions and was kind of put off by the "look it up" answer that Doug got.  So, here is the information from Wikipedia that Leapin' Lizards recommended.  I hope this helps :)<br>
Wendy<br>

Parasites <br>
These are much like cuckoos, except instead of traveling from letterbox to letterbox, they travel from letterboxer to letterboxer in Personal Travellers. In the US they have become known as Cooties and are intentionally planted on letterboxers (or their unattended bags) on the trails or at gatherings. Most people are subtle about planting them  but not all. <br>
Cuckoos <br>
A travelling letterbox, it is placed in a traditional letterbox for another boxer to find. When found, it is stamped just like a traditional letterbox, but is then carried with the boxer to the next box they find. The Cuckoo's stamp should also be recorded in the host box's log, and vice versa. In the US, Cuckoos became known as Hitchhikers<br>
<br>
Personal Travellers <br>
Much like a traditional box, but instead of being planted, the box is kept with the creator at all times. If another boxer is met on the trail or at a meet it is attainable if requested. In the US this box is usually only attainable if the other letterboxer knows the password or passphrase which is sometimes cryptic, sometimes straightforward, sometimes almost non-existent, and sometimes simply silly.<br>
 <br>

Teach a letterboxer about new sources of information, and you have opened up his awareness to all sorts of new letterboxing possibilities!<br>

Hello :)<br>
Being brand spankin' new to letterboxing, I thought this group was here to <br>
answer questions and was kind of put off by the "look it up" answer that Doug <br>
got.  So, here is the information from Wikipedia that Leapin' Lizards <br>
recommended.  I hope this helps :)<br>
Wendy<br>
Milwaukee, WI<br>
Parasites <br>
These are much like cuckoos, except instead of traveling from letterbox to <br>
letterbox, they travel from letterboxer to letterboxer in Personal Travellers. <br>
In the US they have become known as Cooties and are intentionally planted on <br>
letterboxers (or their unattended bags) on the trails or at gatherings. Most <br>
people are subtle about planting them — but not all. <br>
Cuckoos <br>
A travelling letterbox, it is placed in a traditional letterbox for another <br>
boxer to find. When found, it is stamped just like a traditional letterbox, but <br>
is then carried with the boxer to the next box they find. The Cuckoo's stamp <br>
should also be recorded in the host box's log, and vice versa. In the US, <br>
Cuckoos became known as Hitchhikers<br>
<br>
Personal Travellers <br>
Much like a traditional box, but instead of being planted, the box is kept with <br>
the creator at all times. If another boxer is met on the trail or at a meet it <br>
is attainable if requested. In the US this box is usually only attainable if the <br>
other letterboxer knows the password or passphrase… which is sometimes cryptic, <br>
sometimes straightforward, sometimes almost non-existent, and sometimes simply <br>
silly.<br>
 <br>
Words to live by!<br>
 <br>
In the end, our society will be defined not only by what we<br>
create, but by what we refuse to destroy.<br>
