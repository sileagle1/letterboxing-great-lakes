                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, I would like to thank all of those out there that helped<br>
with the Fairies of the Forest Event. First and foremost, a HUGE thank<br>
you goes to Springchick, who guided me through my first event ever,<br>
kept me informed, and helped to plant and clue boxes. Also, a BIG<br>
thank you goes out to JustHappy2Cya (Bill and Patti) who equally<br>
offered to help with planting and cluing of boxes, and to Derby Dude<br>
as well. This was overwhelming, and I can honestly say I am drained,<br>
drained, drained! <br>
<br>
Also, an additional thanks goes out to the following boxers who carved<br>
a stamp/box for the event: Springchick, JustHappy2Cya, Doglvrs, Derby<br>
Dude, Midlandtrailblazer, Wild Dreams, Littlmoon, Celtic Clan,<br>
JBanana, and Double Dragon. Excellent stamps and great hiding spots!<br>
<br>
Furthermore, everyone that came were just wonderful and I can tell had<br>
a good time (despite the cold). Many of you had wonderful comments and<br>
suggestions, and it was GREAT to meet so many of you. <br>
<br>
As a clarification goes, I was not disappointed with comments or<br>
suggestions. To set the record straight, I had one small group of <br>
boxers at the event who thought it just to personally attack and<br>
criticize me through email, basically just to be mean. I was saddened<br>
by the lack of etiquette this one group posed as they pounced me all<br>
over, chewed me up, and then ripped again. Disheartening? Yes. Cruel?<br>
It was. Will it turn me off to this great sport? No. Some people are<br>
just happier when they tear others down.<br>
<br>
Let the boxing begin! Thanks for a great event everyone!!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh dear, I hope Familyof6 didn't take our post about the TOTW as a personal one!  We <br>
actually wrote that post to clarify that we thought they did a GREAT job with the clues!  We <br>
had heard/read a few comments that seemed to indicate that the clues were too difficult.  <br>
We were wanting to shine the light on the fact that difficult clues are part of the game and <br>
welcomed by many.  You did an awesome job!<br>
<br>
That led us to wonder if there might be ways to make gatherings in general easier to enjoy <br>
all aspects - boxing with children, exchanges & finding boxes in a limited time.  We felt it <br>
was a good topic to see how others felt.  Please don't think that we meant to attack you or <br>
the Fairy event in ANY way. We loved the event and all that you did!   It just so happened <br>
that it was this gathering that triggered the topic and some of the examples were made as <br>
references because they were so fresh in our minds.  We should have posted the TOTW in <br>
a separate post as to not associate a negative feeling toward you.  Actually the only <br>
negative we felt was toward ourselves for not being able to find all of the wonderful <br>
stamps!<br>
Please accept our apologies if our message came through as an attack.  It certainly wasn't <br>
meant that way at all.  We will have to work on our communication style!<br>
