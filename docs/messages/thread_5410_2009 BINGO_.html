                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of Bingo...  I was just thinking about Bingo the other day!<br/>
I'll be out on the east coast for the next week, but once I get back,<br/>
I'll be starting to gear up for 2009 Letterbox Bingo!<br/>
<br/>
Just so everyone can plan ahead a little...  The game will begin on<br/>
January 1st and run until we have the winners.  The entry "fee" will<br/>
again be one item for the "Bingo Booty" and $1 to help cover the cost<br/>
of mailing the prizes.  I haven't decided on an exact date yet, but I<br/>
will be needing to have entries in my hands sometime around Dec. 26th.<br/>
 Watch for exact details right around the 1st of December.<br/>
<br/>
So, start thinking strategy, watch for sales on camo tape and other<br/>
good booty items, fish out your lucky charms...  and if anyone has any<br/>
suggestions for ways I might consider changing the game up a little,<br/>
please e-mail me off list with your ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the anticipation...<br/>
