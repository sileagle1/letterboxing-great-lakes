Definition from letterboxing.org GLOSSARY:<br/>
<br/>
cootie - A small letterbox that is passed surreptitously from letterboxer to letterboxer. As created by Pandora and Camp Fire Lady, cooties originally began as an activity for kids at letterboxing gatherings, in which kids recorded their thumbprints in a cootie and secretly passed it along to another child or adult. Cooties have evolved into a very small letterbox that can be hidden in a pocket or backpack of another letterboxer, and thus travel from individual to individual.  <br/>
