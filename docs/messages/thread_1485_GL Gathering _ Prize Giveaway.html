                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, it was great getting a chance to meet everyone at the gathering. It <br/>
was so good to put faces to the names. First of all I would like to say <br/>
thank you to everyone for making this such a great gathering. Everyone <br/>
helped make this gathering so much fun. There was tons of great boxes, <br/>
fun workshops and I loved hearing about dartmoor letterboxing. I cant <br/>
forget to mention the never ending circus! I thought I had all the <br/>
stamps and than another bag would come along it was great! For those of <br/>
you who may have left early, the winner of the letterboxing prize pack <br/>
was the Jacks.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day and happy letterboxing<br/>
