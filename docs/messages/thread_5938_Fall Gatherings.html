*Ok, I'll admit I am considering a Circus Parade Gathering now that it is returning to Milwaukee in July.  Unfortunately, they'll be hauling the wagons in by truck and not by train.  Even if I don't have a gathering, I would encourage you to come and see the parade (http://circusworld.wisconsinhistory.org/Events/EventDetail/Event1642.aspx)<br>
