I just returned from a short, but relaxing vacation.  I checked my out of state boxes and I have decided to 'pull' all 5 boxes in the Door County, WI area.  Why?  Vandalism....plain and simple.  The last entries in the logbooks were first time letterboxing families with young, obviously unsupervised children.  Stamps were damaged, boxes left open, contents tossed on the ground.  YIKES!  I may replace these boxes in the future.  Just wanted to give you the update change on the status of my boxes in WI.  <br/>

Two of my boxes that I spent a lot of time carving were destroyed (and both times the last person there was the same person, and they had older kids!) It's too bad, because my family and I were planning on coming over from Michigan in two weeks and planned to find your boxes. :(<br/>

(Member Services - Your Letterboxes - Choose Archive for the box in <br/>

available on the website.  This would be a considerate way of <br/>
removing a lost LB and still maintaining the "P" count - is that's <br/>
important to the placer.<br/>
