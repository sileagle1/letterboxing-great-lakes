                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is only one person I know of who "had" the clues to the original boxes<br>
before they disappeared -- the clues (it is believed the boxes may still be<br>
there).  I tried getting the clues from her when we were heading up to the<br>
U.P.last and didn't get any response.<br>
<br>
If anyone else by chance has these clues, I too would be interested in<br>
getting my hands on them ;-)<br>
<br>
BTW -- Mackinac or Mackinaw?  The city is spelled Mackinaw, all else is<br>
Mackinac (the bridge, the straits, the island).  But...  no matter which way<br>
you spell it, the pronunciation is Mackinaw.<br>
