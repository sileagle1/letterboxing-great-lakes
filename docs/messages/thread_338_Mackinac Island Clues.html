If anyone else by chance has these clues, I too would be interested in<br/>
getting my hands on them ;-)<br/>

BTW -- Mackinac or Mackinaw?  The city is spelled Mackinaw, all else is<br/>
Mackinac (the bridge, the straits, the island).  But...  no matter which way<br/>
you spell it, the pronunciation is Mackinaw.<br/>

&gt; I was going to ask "YOU HAVE THE CLUES TO THE MACKINAW ISLAND<br/>
&gt; BOXES????!!!!" thinking you had a copy of the ORIGINAL clues to the<br/>
&gt; ORIGINAL boxes there.  It sure would be nice for a couple of you MI<br/>
&gt; boxers to do some hunting down of the original boxes/clues.  There<br/>
&gt; is a huge mystery and interesting history to delve into!  If<br/>
&gt; interested, do a search of the messages on the "big" list concerning<br/>
&gt; Mackinaw Island.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Travel plans for the summer really revolve around one event- what<br/>
&gt; has been dubbed "Ken's Folly", our triathlon in Mackinaw City in<br/>
&gt; August.  We try to spend a week in Cheboygan camping each summer,<br/>
&gt; and this race thingie worked perfectly.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So should we manage to crawl out of our tent the day after the<br/>
&gt; race, we'll probably go check out the three or four boxes on<br/>
&gt; Mackinac Island- one is located right on the pier!  Anyone else<br/>
&gt; found those boxes?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We've found the two in St. Ignace, so I'm pulling for a new lower<br/>
&gt; UP box to pop up before hand.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Other than that, we're mostly homebound for the duration of the<br/>
&gt; summer months.<br/>

&gt; &gt; p.s. Who, being a true Michigander, knows the difference between,<br/>
&gt; and snorts with disgust when outsiders misspell "Mackinaw"<br/>
&gt; or "Mackinac".<br/>
