                    <div class="plaintext-content">After "talking" with CMoon and Timbertoes about the Metra Rail Letterbox<br>
Crawl, we've decided to expand things a bit.  First, the hiding place<br>
doesn't have to be a food establishment, though we think it best we stay<br>
with independent (non-chain) establishments.  First we figured they'd<br>
probably appreciate the patronage of their places more, and dealing directly<br>
with the owner is probably easier than a manager who has to consult with<br>
higher-ups concerning company policies.  Plus it's often more fun to<br>
discover lesser known places!<br>
<br>
We also thought we should include any box within reasonable distance from a<br>
train station.  That would, for instance, include CMoon's History Tower, and<br>
my Hurray for Hollywood (can't get much closer to a station than that one!).<br>
What do you think...within a half mile?  Mile for the fast walker?  Which<br>
brings us to our next idea...<br>
<br>
We think prefixing the box title with the initials "MRLC" would help<br>
identify the box as part of the crawl.  So Sit-Sip-Stay-Box would become<br>
MRLC: Sit-Sip-Stay-Box.  A statement to the effect "Part of the Metra Rail<br>
Letterbox Crawl" can also be included in the clues, as well as distance from<br>
the station (assuming of course it wouldn't compromise the clues<br>
themselves.)  Of course, designating a box part of the crawl would entirely<br>
be at the discretion of the placer.  But as we all know, the more boxes are<br>
identified in a region, the more likely they will come looking for them!<br>
<br>
We also thought of having a link cross-referencing a file or something<br>
explaining the concept of the crawl might be helpful to boxers not part of<br>
this group who wouldn't know what we're talking about.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any opinions on this or other ideas??  As I told the two of<br>
them...I am not claiming ownership of this project or anything like<br>
that...just starting a game we can all play together!<br>
