Does anyone know where I can get cheap lock n lock boxes or a brand <br>
like it?  I've been using Rubbermaid containers, which I like, but <br>
sometimes they're too big.  I went to QVC.com because they sell LNLs, <br>
but you can't buy them singally by size.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

I have been buying them from Heritage Mint.<br>
 http://www.heritagemint.com<br>
They seem to be the source and sell all sizes and shaped individually.<br>
I like the 1.9 "2" cup size for a smallish box which has room for a<br>
stamp, log, and pad while the 6oz makes a nice mini box.<br>
