                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally!!!! after an 18 day streak i get to mark off a box.  I was <br>
beginning to think that one of the requirements for a word being <br>
called was that it wasn't on my card.  LOL.....<br>
Well, that's my first I.  still only have  1 in B & N  and nothing in <br>
O.  G was my only hope, but since the reg. bingo has been snagged <br>
that's not of much use anymore. <br>
Oh well, Just gives me more time to get out there and box.  <br>
<br>
Hoping to plant two tomorrow!  and then maybe find the new one around <br>
here.    <br>
<br>
Good luck on those Bingo's everyone, You sure don't have to fear me <br>
and my card!<br>

here's to our luck changing! <br>
I'd send you some luck, but it seems i don't have much more than you <br>
do.  maybe i can find one of those old wish trolls my daughter had....<br>
