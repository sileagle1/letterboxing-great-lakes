Here's another box in a sporadic attempt to commemorate some <br>
holidays. <br>
<br>
All Fool's Day, also known as April Fool's Day, is celebrated <br>
annually on the first day of April. It is a time for the traditional <br>
playing of pranks upon unsuspecting people...the victim of such a <br>
prank being called an April Fool. The origins of this custom are <br>
somewhat uncertain, but may have initially been related to the <br>
arrival of Spring in late March, at which time Mother Nature is said <br>
to "fool" the human race with sudden and fickle changes in the <br>
weather...showers one minute and sunshine the next. <br>
<br>
The commonly accepted origin of April Fool's Day involves changes in <br>
the calendar. At one time, the New Year celebration began on March 25 <br>
and ended on April 1. However, in 1582, King Charles IX of France <br>
adopted the Gregorian calendar and accepted the beginning of the new <br>
year as January 1. Those who refused to acknowledge the new date or <br>
simply forgot received foolish gifts and invitations to nonexistent <br>
parties. The butt of such a prank was known as a "poisson d'avril" <br>
or "April fish." <br>
<br>
The day is now generally observed by playing a practical joke on <br>
a "victim" who soon becomes known as an April Fool. This custom is <br>
thought to have started in France during the 16th century but the <br>
British are credited with bringing it to the United States. The <br>
primary force behind April Fool's Day jokes and pranks are that they <br>
should not be harmful but able to be enjoyed by everyone...especially <br>
the person upon whom the joke is played. <br>
<br>
To start OUR foolishness, did you know we forgot our compass when <br>
hiding this box? At least the sun was up, but planning on setting <br>
soon, so we had a GENERAL sense of direction. This means you<br>
won't <br>
have any compass bearings to follow, but also means you need to take <br>
our directional info with a grain of salt. OK - are you feeling <br>
Foolish? Foolhardy? Well, you're here, so you might as well get <br>
going <br>
<br>
Head north toward the yellow sign. Follow the west shore of the pond <br>
and cross a concrete "bridge". Continue curving along the<br>
shore, <br>
ducking under a fallen tree. At the "Y", head left. Pass a<br>
large oak <br>
on the right, then dip down and up on the trail. At the next fork, <br>
head left again and pass through some fallen trees. You'll be<br>
heading <br>
up an incline with the remnants of an old fence on your left. Soon <br>
you'll come to a clearing. Head west to the top of the hill,<br>
enjoy <br>
the view, then head north down the hill, hugging the east treeline. <br>
You should pass two oaks on your right and then find a path going <br>
into the woods. You may also notice an old barbed wire fence in the <br>
woods on your right when you find the path. Take this path until you <br>
reach a fork near a large oak. At this point turn left and continue <br>
onward, passing under a low tree branch along the way. Eventually you <br>
will reach some rusted fencing and lots of rusted materials. This <br>
seems to be a dumping ground for an old farmyard or something. It is <br>
interesting to try to figure out what some of this stuff was. As <br>
you're exploring, find the rusted car seat springs and look in<br>
the <br>
flattened bin leaning against the back of the seat to find your <br>
reward. Use caution when retrieving and replacing it so you don't<br>
get <br>
hurt. Please be sure to replace it so it is not visible from any <br>
angle. <br>
<br>
To make your way back, head east to reenter the clearing. If it is <br>
too overgrown, which it may be in the summer, you could instead <br>
retrace your steps on the path to return to the clearing. Once in the <br>
clearing, go to the top of the hill and then turn left and head <br>
towards the hospital building you can see in the distance. Find the <br>
same path you came on and take it into the woods and down the hill. <br>
You'll pass the same fallen logs, then turn right at the fork. At<br>
the <br>
next fork take a left and follow the shoreline back to the parking <br>
lot. <br>

appreciate an update on the status of the box if you find it.  <br>
