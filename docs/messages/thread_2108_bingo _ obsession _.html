Oh, ho!  The lengths the obsessed boxer will go to, even if it isn't exactly<br>
for a box.  The promise of that boxing booty is enough!  Very funny story,<br>
hope you at least got some samples in the shop...<br>
<br>
We'll be mailing out our lists and booty items tomorrow.<br>

have been saying I was going to find that box for the last three <br>

the list that I have found, so I had to get creative when I picked <br>
the items for my list. Two of my planted boxes were on the list <br>
though. :-) Good luck to everyone playing!<br>
