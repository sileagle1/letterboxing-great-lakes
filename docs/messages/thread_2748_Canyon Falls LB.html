   <br>
  My hubby and I are doing a four day trip to San Antonio.  Anyone ever do any boxing there?  We'll be staying on the Riverwalk, so anything near there would be great.  We will not have access to a car.  <br>

Dragon - we are going up to the UP for vacation Aug 11-20. If no one <br>
else has checked on it by then and if we are in the Alberta vicinity, <br>
we will stop and check on it for you. <br>
