You'll have to pick from the general terms at the bottom to fill in <br>
your sheet.  Last year, I had no boxes, events or exchanges, so I had <br>
all general words.   It really won't make much difference which words <br>
you pick once the calling starts, it's all random.  The different <br>
categories just add some fun and make it so the words get spread out <br>
and not everyone picks the same 15 words.<br>

There are the same number of MI lower peninsula boxes as there are boxes from IL, OH, WI and then there are a few additional boxes from the upper peninsula.  When you consider the geographic size of the 6-state GL region, and that there were only a total of 45 boxes included, don't be surprised that there may be only 1 or 2 boxes within a reasonable distance from where you live.
