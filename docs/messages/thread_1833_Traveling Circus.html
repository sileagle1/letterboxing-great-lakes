I am pleased to announce that a select group from Phineas Boch's Traveling<br>
Circus has arrived in Wisconsin!  I've been busy getting them settled in<br>
their new temporary quarters, although we had some difficulties in the park.<br>
Many of the areas we explored seemed to have an eerie feel and tended to<br>
spook the animals.  And given the nature of circus performers, the humans<br>
were similarly uneasy and complained of a "haunted" feeling.  We eventually<br>
found an area that seemed safe and I'm sure they'll be practicing their acts<br>
soon.<br>
<br>
Our opening performance will be on October 1 at Menomonee Park and we expect<br>
to remain in the area for two full weeks. A program outlining the various<br>
venues and stages that you will need to search out to witness these amazing<br>
artists will be available at the local Gathering.   If you're curious as to<br>
what the circus will include, I've created a poster to publicize our show.<br>
You can view it here:  http://hauntedharvest.homestead.com/circus.html<br>
<br>
To be sure you have a ticket for the performance, please RSVP by September<br>
28.  I'm looking forward to the day when I meet you, our esteemed audience!<br>
