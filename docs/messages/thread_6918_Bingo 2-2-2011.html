It just took an hour to shovel 1 path, shovel wide, across the porch, down 6 stairs and around the corner for the dog.  Snow days are not as much fun with responsibility as they were when I was a kid.  Although it is beautiful.  Already pulled Tat2Bob out of a ditch once this morning.  Hope everyone has a great day inside safe at home.  I will be carving stamps and baking today.  <br/>
