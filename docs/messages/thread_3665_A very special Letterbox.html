My husband and daughter took a drive to Moline a couple weekends ago, shopped, stayed overnight, and returned home the following day.  I was at Girl Scout camp that weekend.  But if they return to the area to do more shopping and I'm not working or camping, I'll definitely print out some letterbox clues and look for your boxes.  There is never enough time on the weekend to do all the things we'd like to do.  I'm looking forward to warmer weather soon.  <br/>
