That pesky Dragon always has to be first.  I guess it's good that <br>
he's delayed his Ohio trip, so now he can put up a new virtual <br>

<br>
For those of you who haven't even had a chance to look at the <br>
challenge yet, I am leaving it up and will carve a stamp for those <br>
who complete it.  I'm not sure yet if I'll transmit the stamp to the <br>
winners electronically (most probably) or if I'll mail it via snail <br>
mail (less likely). Look for an announcement soon.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

Dragon is doing the "Happy Happy Joy Joy" dance that he DIDN"T get to<br>
do for another box this week because SOMEONE ELSE beat him to it!<br>
