We absolutely agree...we do have some boxes...several that are outside our<br/>
normal traveling range.  It's awesome to have people who can check up on<br/>
boxes and do any light work on them..changing torn or broken bags or<br/>
replacing a box that has been cracked, etc. We have had people do this for<br/>
some of our boxes and it's a great help to not have to drive 100 miles to<br/>
replace a bag.  Even when boxes are close, we have found that it's just<br/>
better to repair a box...notify the owner.  We're already there...no sense<br/>
in having someone else who's busy have to run around too.  We tend to think<br/>
that things will become more like this in the future...locals who don't<br/>
really adopt the boxes, but take care of them as if they had....It takes a<br/>
village to raise a letterbox. :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
We led a hike for our hiking club today that followed the same route <br/>
as our Norwegian Woods series (5 boxes on a 9 mile hike).  Since the <br/>
weather wasn't too good today (i.e. almost constant rain), we had a <br/>
small turnout for the hike, but on the bright side, this made it <br/>
easier for us to check on our boxes. 3 of the 5 boxes were in great <br/>
shape, but 2 had a bit of moisture which we tried to dry out.  If you <br/>
haven't done the series yet (EVEN THOUGH SOME OF YOU WERE NEARBY TO <br/>
PLACE/FIND THE TROJAN RABBIT), rest assured that all 5 boxes are <br/>
still in place and in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
Unbeknowst to us, this was the same weekend that there was a 50-mile <br/>
run on the Ice Age Trail and a shorter 18-mile run on the Nordic <br/>
Trail circuit.  As we were walking the 9-mile blue loop, we passed <br/>
some of the same people twice that were running.  We were amazed when <br/>
one hardy runner asked us "Are you letterboxing?".   We answered in <br/>
the affirmative, but didn't have a chance to find out who this astute <br/>
runner was.  The parking lot had cars from several states, so we have <br/>
no idea who asked us this question.<br/>
<br/>
The 9-mile hike was the easy part.  While doing box maintenance we <br/>
found a HH that had it's own box and was the largest HH package we <br/>
have ever seen.  We brought it home with us and will be placing it <br/>
somewhere later this month.  Just goes to show that there IS a <br/>
benefit to checking on your boxes....  <br/>
<br/>
After the hike we went to find the Trojan Rabbit (Great stamp!). <br/>
Replacing the TROJAN RABBIT box was a horrible exercise in <br/>
frustration.  It just so happened that we arrived at the cemetery on <br/>
the same day that 2 guys were doing grounds maintenance, even though <br/>
it was raining.  We had no problem retreiving the box, but waited 30-<br/>
45 minutes before we could replace it because these guys were too <br/>
nearby hoeing &amp; seeding.  Drove us crazy!!!!<br/>

Martini Man &amp; I decided to check on some of our series that we hadn't <br/>
heard much about, and/or had received "Attempted" messages.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm happy to report that all 4 boxes im my "Christmas Botanicals" <br/>
series (4 mile hike) are in place and in good shape.  Most haven't <br/>
had a visitor since last November.<br/>
<br/>
We were also pleased to find all 4 boxes in Martini Man's "Field <br/>
Survey" series. Many were damp inside, but since the baggies were <br/>
sealed well, the contents were fine.  These were a bit of a challenge <br/>
to find in late summer (trail conditions are quite different now) and <br/>
we saw that some seekers only found some in the series.  However we <br/>
were impressed that someone found all 4 last month.  Martini Man has <br/>
added a brief note to the original clues and may add more updates in <br/>
the near future.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed over to Lapham Peak to give Double Dragon's "White <br/>
Knight" a more watertight home.  After that we checked on my "Tweedle <br/>
Dee &amp; Tweedle Dum" box and SpringChick's "Humpty Dumpty" box.  Both <br/>
were in fine shape.  We ended our loop by checking on Bindle <br/>
Babe's "DRINK ME" box and were happy to find it right where we <br/>
expected and in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
A nice afternoon outside, hiking 7-8 miles and finding all 12 boxes <br/>
we checked to be in good shape!<br/>

It's ALWAYS that time of year for us, longer days mean more time to <br/>
stay out, but it always gets dark eventually!  Those nifty headlamps we <br/>
got as Christmas gifts last year from Martini Man's brother stay in our <br/>
packs year round.  We also have small regular flashlights and made do <br/>
with a keychain squeeze light once or twice....<br/>

But that assumes you have a cell phone with you!  We've been so annoyed by people using them that we don't own one.  Martini Man has one from his office, but we rarely would have it with us out on a trail.<br/>
Call us curmudgeons - we have never owned a TV either!  (but we aren't totally "anti-technology", we do have 3 PCs that we use regularly)<br/>

The last week of March doesn't look very promising either, but we will head out to find at least ONE box next weekend, since we want to keep our record intact of finding at least one box every month since we started letterboxing.<br/>

Yesterday (Saturday) was gorgeous.  Sunny--no wind--temps in the upper 40's.  Today is a totally different matter--cold and gloomy and gusty.  You must have sent this yucky weather down south to us!<br/>

Beautiful Day? It must be a lot different weather "down south" by you! We had originally planned to head down to find your most recent cemetery boxes today, but with this continued COLD weather, and now even more SNOW today, we canceled our plans a week ago.<br/>
<br/>
The last week of March doesn't look very promising either, but we will head out to find at least ONE box next weekend, since we want to keep our record intact of finding at least one box every month since we started letterboxing.<br/>

&gt; It was a beautiful day today, so I decided to hit a few cemeteries to do maintenance. Found 7--all in decent condition. One was missing (#8: Chicago's Titanic). That is the second time it has gone missing--wonder if someone is taking it???. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One I couldn't get too. This girl must have wandered through that section of the cemetery for 45 minutes, all the time carrying a bouquet. Guess she couldn't find the grave?? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And my bonus for doing maintenance.........I found one hitchhiker. And I saw a pair of hooded mergansers, a pair of bluebirds, and the first brown creeper of the season.<br/>

I've never used restrictions before, but if someone has found just one of our boxes (and logged it of course) then they would be able to see the clues for that one.  Although our boxes get lots of finders in the logbooks who never log online so they would be affected.  We'll see.  <br/>
