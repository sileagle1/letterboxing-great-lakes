                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey everyone,<br>
Right now I am really excited about these trading cards, so I thought <br>
I'd host a swap myself.  As the title says, it would be New Years <br>
themed.  You can carve any stamp that has to do with New Years and <br>
then design your cards around that.  It would probably also be a good <br>
idea to include "2008" somewhere on the card.  Then if everyone likes <br>
the idea, maybe we could do one each year.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking the due date will probably be at the end of January, so <br>
everyone has enough time to make their cards, but it would still be <br>
relatively close to New Years.  Also, it will most likely be a set of <br>
20.<br>
<br>
Anyone interested?  Once I get a few replies, I will post a tracker <br>
on Atlas Quest.<br>
