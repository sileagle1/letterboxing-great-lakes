                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Ann Arbor, MI Team Red Rose has completed the "Around the World in<br>
80 Days" series just before the snow began flying around Michigan. <br>
Completing the journey before their footprints could be tracked on the<br>
ground at the fifteen ports of call, Team Red Rose appears to be the<br>
final finishers of the 80 Days series.<br>
And TRR did the trek in time to qualify for the bonus box.<br>
Congratulations, Team Red Rose.<br>
<br>
As noted earlier, the Passport Office has closed. The Travel Staff has<br>
packed, and the fifteen `foreign' city's sites are shutting their<br>
gates as well. Thanks to all who participated.<br>
<br>
Congratulations to Team Red Rose and the many other successful visitors.<br>
