                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny you should mention next time.  We noticed last time we met was early<br>
January, now early March.  Astutely we noticed the pattern and decided our<br>
next get-together will be May, so I have just made the executive decision<br>
that our next meeting at the Paw will be May 7th.  Everyone's invited!  Time<br>
TBA, so feel free to add your two cents on that issue.  Being Mother's Day,<br>
I will carve a themed "event stamp", "I love my Mommy".  But now comes the<br>
question:  should it be "I love my Mommy more than Letterboxing" or "I love<br>
my Mommy almost as much as Letterboxing"?   As you've probably noticed, I've<br>
entered a poll.please respond with your vote!<br>
<br>

We had a good turnout today!  Nuts4Mice and her sister, new boxer HopsBaby;<br>
CMoon and Kookaburra, Buckaneer, and SquEEK!.  Buckaneer's mom has been<br>
christened "The Reluctant Boxer".  Her mission is to have a stamp carved by<br>
May.  Also joining us today were P.Granola and Nature Nerd, KissMeKate and<br>
BarefootAnkh.  And just after everyone left, I heard from one of the<br>
managers that there were more boxers in the Cyberdog, Laura and her three<br>
sons.  I just sent them a message with the address to join this group.  The<br>
managers of the Paw are just tickled to have us over there.  They think it's<br>
so cool and love having us there.<br>

it, so I'm not surprised though that they weren't aware of its existence.  I<br>

There's another box not far from Meadow Walk, Little Box on the Prairie.   A<br>
reminder to everyone that although my full clues are not posted on LbNA,<br>
they are posted in this group's files section, so you don't have to ask me<br>
for them.  Yes, folks, another perk of belonging to LbGLK!!!  (Okay, okay,<br>
I'll get over myself now.)<br>

There is a very fine line between "hobby" and "mental illness."   (Dave<br>

Does a clean house indicate that there is a broken computer in it?  (or<br>
better yet, "Does a clean house mean I've run out of letterboxing<br>
supplies?")<br>

Myself (Grapevine Girl, Carfreek, and Monet Mama) just want you all to know<br>
that the "Paws" letterbox is alive and well.  We hit that one, the<br>
Historical Tower in Western Springs and one at the Bob Mann preserve in<br>
Lagrange Park this past weekend (great weekend for it). <br>
<br>
I DO love that when we asked for the "red bull" or whatever the code was, an<br>
obvious new employee wrote it down on the meal ticket form. <br>
<br>

couches and noshed.  Very cute spot!<br>
