originally thought. so I probably won't have time to check my email <br>
again if anyone sends me box reccomendations for while i'm in town. So <br>
instead I thought i'd offer to do an exchange with anyone willing to <br>
meet me at the Masonic Temple at... let's say... 3pm. There's only <br>
going to be an extra two or three hundred people hanging around that <br>
day, so just ask someone to point you towards the "troll" booth nd <br>
i'll meet you there. I have a brand new personal traveler that I'd <br>
love to share. it's called "are you in a play?" and if you come down <br>
to visit you'll understand why. <br>
