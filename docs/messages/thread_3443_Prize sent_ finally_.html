I mailed your prize today for being the first placer in the last <br>
county to be covered in Michigan!  Be on the look out for it.  Sorry <br>
it took so long and I hope it makes all those miles you drove a <br>
little bit worth it! LOL<br>

was my inner demon driving me all over the state, but it's exciting <br>
anyway.  I'll let you know when it arrives.<br>
