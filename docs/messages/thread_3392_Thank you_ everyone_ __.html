but today was seeming WAY colder than yesterday, so we scrapped our<br>
letterboxing plans. <br>
<br>
I should have known to check my messages one last time before leaving<br>
the house! :)<br>
<br>
I'll come and get the stamps any time tonight or tomorrow night if<br>
possible. Just send me an email to any of my addresses. I'm online<br>
tonight. :)<br>
