                    <div class="plaintext-content">One of my first boxes placed was in Glendalough State Park.  At that <br>
time, I was unaware of the state park rules--my bad.  I had heard from <br>
another boxer that one of theirs had been taken by the manager, but now <br>
the rules were changed, and it was allowed, so I placed mine.<br>
<br>
After about 6 months, I got an e-mail from the manager that I had not <br>
filed an application, and if I didn't contact him by July 1, it would <br>
be confiscated.  I immediately wrote an apology e-mail, asking what the <br>
next step was.  He never bothered to answer.  In the meantime, I found <br>
the DNR site and printed an application, intending to submit it and <br>
have the box approved.  Then I thought better, and pulled it from the <br>
park entirely.  Evidently, letterboxes are not welcome.  (I do notice, <br>
though, that there is at least one Geocache there.)<br>
<br>
I thought I could help draw people to the state park system, and <br>
particularly to this gem of a park, but I guess I'll be placing this <br>
box elsewhere, as well as more in the planning.<br>

Here is the problem, unlike geocashing, which has gone through the process of getting a state wide land use permit for DNR land, letterboxing has no permit. I'm not sure what the process would be but letterboxing should do the same. Other wise you have to go through the process of getting permits on a park by park basis, and to be honest, most people working in the field don't like stuff being hidden in the parks. People on the government end, in michigan thats the DNR folk who work in Lansing, often see things differently and would probably grant a statewide permit. I know that if my manager knew there was one in my park it would be removed. It would be a great way to draw business to the parks but there is not enough letterboxers that its going to make a huge difference either way. The bottom line is that if you want to hide boxes on state land it would be to the benifit of all<br>
 letterboxers for a group to work out a deal with individual state governments to get a statewide land use permit. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I am glad to hear you have had a good experience.  I just <br>
started letterboxing after hearing about it last fall.  My boss and i <br>
both learned about it last fall and he though about having me remove <br>
them from the park (this park has the most boxes in SW Michigan).  <br>
Luckily he forgot about the whole deal and i sure don't plan on <br>
reminding him. <br>
<br>
Letterboxing is similar to geocaching in that you hide stuff in <br>
public spots (atleast thats my understanding, i don't geocash).  I <br>
thinks thats why they get lumped together.  But your right, if you <br>
going to lump letterboxing with geocaching with the bad (removing <br>
boxes not liking it done) lump it with the good as well (let it fall <br>
under geocash land use permit). <br>
