Hello!  Someone at the Silo handed me a piece of paper with your name and phone number, but no message.  I found it in my pocket this afternoon.  I guess the message was that you would not be attending.  In the ditch?  Yikes!  As for the tire problem, been there.  Last week, I drove over a RR track and one of my new tires blew out! <br/>
Sorry you weren't able to attend our Silo event.  Happy Chinese New Year to you.  Check out the photo files.  All those people dressed in red!  We must have really been a site!  <br/>
