                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I went ahead and called Alum Creek Camp Grounds today about what<br>
campers can and cannot do regarding wood used to build fires at the<br>
Columbus Cluez-In event this coming weekend.  Here is what I found out:<br>
<br>
No wood can be brought in from another state at all. No (random) wood<br>
can be burned that is laying on the ground in the woods or near the<br>
camp sites. Wood from Ohio can be brought to the camp site to be burned. <br>
<br>
There are private people who sell wood in the area just outside Alum<br>
Creek grounds for $4 per bundle. Any wood brought into the camp site<br>
either must be burned or cannot be taken back out once brought in. <br>
<br>
I thought this might be helpful to know since not everyone is under<br>
these same current restrictions.<br>
<br>
Won't be long now!  :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for your post.  No worries at all--more than once I have done <br>
the same thing!!<br>
<br>
I do want to let everyone know that I went and checked out the campsites <br>
today.  The tent camping and the camper ones are all very nice and clean <br>
and well-maintained.  They each have a picnic table and fire ring.  Many <br>
of the tent camping ones have some larger chunks of partially burned <br>
logs in them so that is good!<br>
<br>
I am going to bring firewood so if anyone needs some, I would be more <br>
than willing to share---and/or share my campfire too.  I am right on the <br>
end of the M row of tent campsites and there is plenty of room if anyone <br>
wants to pull up a chair.<br>
<br>
I was also thinking that it would be nice to put a sign with our <br>
trailname, signature stamp and what state we are from--at our <br>
campsites.  We don't do that very often when we post messages here and I <br>
would love to associate what state folks are from with trail names.  <br>
Just a thought--if anyone else would like to do this too.  I printed off <br>
the suggested GLK 2007 logo and will just draw a line to the state of <br>
Ohio with my other info.<br>
<br>
Last---and perhaps I'm the only doofus that would do this, but for those <br>
of us who are camping---we are at the regular campsites---and NOT the <br>
group campsites off Lewis Center Road?!  (Can you guess what I did <br>
first???) :P  The entrance to our regular campsites is off Old State <br>
Road and it says "Campground Welcome Center" on the park map.   (Yes!  I <br>
do this on occasion with hunting letterboxes too!)<br>
<br>
The restroom facilites were clean at the campsites as well---but I did <br>
not see any showers.  I have not checked to see if there are any <br>
elsewhere. <br>
<br>
Are we there yet??<br>

That comment reminded me of the map that Doodle & Deedle created a <br>
while back.  I checked in the "Links" section of our Yahoo board and <br>
the link was still there.  Perhaps more people would like to add <br>
their name to the map...  Here's a direct link:<br>

P.S.  I think I posted this a while back, but will repeat it again <br>
since I had an email or two.  I WILL have some Great Lakes <br>
letterboxing patches with me at the event.  The new price is $2 per <br>
patch if anyone is interested in purchasing one.<br>

Thanks for the info trailtracker!  The website says they have <br>
showers!  I was just looking at the campground map and there are a <br>
couple "latrines" in area one and on "washhouse" for the whole area. <br>
The washhouse is way over in the K section!  I'm assuming that's <br>
where the showers are!  There better be a lot of shower stalls in <br>
there!!!!  I was all excited that we were 2 sites away from the <br>
bathrooms, but I didn't realize the showers weren't in there.  Weird setup!<br>

I just got done searching to be sure there were showers too...but had <br>
not found exactly where they were---so thank you for that!!  Whew.  <br>
Showers are good!!!  I was starting to think they might be at the beach <br>
or something?!  I bet you're right---that they are in the K section.  I <br>
started to look in the other areas in the campgrounds but was afraid I'd <br>
never find my way out in a reasonable time as I was "just visiting".<br>
<br>
Does anyone else have their piles of stuff to take blocking the door???<br>

Anyone who knows me, knows that my hubby isn't into letterboxing.  Well...he might be starting to come around.  Last night he suggested I give him a list of all the camping gear I planned to take with me and he would check it all out and get it ready for me.  What's up with that!!<br>
