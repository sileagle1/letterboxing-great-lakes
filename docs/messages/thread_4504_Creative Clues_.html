We just went to Bald Bluff yesterday and when I came home to log our <br/>
find I noticed this "box" that you mention added to the LbNa website. <br/>
When I read it I didn't think it was a real box though. I thought it <br/>
was in reference to the teacher that went missing, and was later found <br/>
dead, in that same area back in September. <br/>
