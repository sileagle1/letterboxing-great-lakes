Welcome Deb!  We certainly have very loose boundaries here -- the more the<br/>
merrier.  I can relate to your frustration over lack of letterboxes in your<br/>
state.  It was the same in Michigan only two years ago.  Believe me, "if you<br/>
plant them, they will come."<br/>

On that same topic - We've taken our young nieces &amp; nephews with us<br/>
letterboxing on several occasions and this past weekend we told them about<br/>
the new "Great Lakes" message board and asked them to guess what states were<br/>
included.  They did well, but being smart 5th graders, also guessed "New<br/>
York".  They were certainly correct in that NY does border TWO Great Lakes,<br/>
but we told them it didn't seem to be included in the board (perhaps because<br/>
the board has a more Midwest focus??)<br/>

I'm with you there Spring Chick. I love the North Shore of Lake <br/>
Superior! For those of you who haven't ever been, it's gorgeous! <br/>
Worth a trip even without boxes. I'll be getting up there a couple of <br/>
times this summer. Hopefully, placing several boxes. Added incentive <br/>
to get more boxers on over to Minnesota...<br/>
