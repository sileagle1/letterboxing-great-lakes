 I am fairly new to this group - I do more reading and listing in than<br/>
adding messages and thoughts of my own, but I thought I would share<br/>
the latest news about Price Nature Center here in Bridgeport,<br/>
Michigan.  I thought about Windrose who planted "Cottontail in the<br/>
Cottonwoods" The newspaper notes that there was a body of a 27 year<br/>
old woman found there recently.  The article  gave me the creeps<br/>
because not only is this close to home, but more times than not it is<br/>
myself and my young children Letterboxing together, and that not only<br/>
would be a scary "find" but now I worry about my own protection.<br/>
Either I have been watching too much TV to know this is where creepy<br/>
people lurk, or I am just getting myself worried for nothing. <br/>
Needless to say keep this in mind next time you go searching through<br/>
the fall leaves on the lookout for a box, you never want to flip over<br/>
a piece of bark covered with leaves to discover a body.  Who carries a<br/>
form of protection while Letterboxing?  Is that absurd or what?  I<br/>
didn't think I would ever have to ask that question!<br/>
