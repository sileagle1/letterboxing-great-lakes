Uh-oh!  I'm pretty sure some of those yellow flowering plants along the Hennepin Canal Trail are Wild Parsnip.  I've got some "burns" on my left leg that seem exactly like what is described for wild parsnip.  Here is  a link http://dnr.state.il.us/education/ExoticSpecies/Wildparsnip.htm<br>
and some info adapted from an article about wild parsnip burns by David Eagan:<br>
<br>
Wild parsnip is of concern because humans develop a severe skin irritation from contact with its leaves. <br>
<br>
Once the furocoumarins are absorbed by the skin, they are energized by uv light on both sunny and cloudy days. They then bind to DNA and cell membranes, destroying cells and skin. Wild parsnip burns usually occur in streaks and elongated spots, reflecting where a damaged leaf or stem moved across the skin before exposure to sunlight.<br>
<br>
Wild parsnip burns differ from the rash caused by poison ivy in several aspects. First, everyone is sensitive to wild parsnip and you do not need to be sensitized by a prior exposure to develop burns or blisters. You can brush against wild parsnip plants and not be affected. Parsnip is only dangerous when the plant sap from broken leaves or stems gets on your skin. Lastly, the wild parsnip's "burn" is usually less irritating that poison ivy's "itch." The worst of the burning pain caused by wild parsnip is usually over within a couple of days while the rash and itch of poison ivy can last a long time.<br>
<br>
In cases of mild exposure to wild parsnip, affected areas turn red and feel sunburned. In severe cases, the skin first turns red and then blisters. The arms, legs, torso, face, and neck are most vulnerable and affected areas may feel like they have been scalded. Blisters form a day or two after sun exposure and soon after the blisters rupture and the skin starts healing. But for many people the ordeal is not over as dark red or brownish "scars" remain in the burned areas for several months to years.<br>

Wild parsnip burns usually occur in streaks and elongated spots, reflecting where a damaged leaf or stem moved across the skin before exposure to sunlight.<br>

> Wild parsnip burns differ from the rash caused by poison ivy in several aspects. First, everyone is sensitive to wild parsnip and you do not need to be sensitized by a prior exposure to develop burns or blisters. You can brush against wild parsnip plants and not be affected. Parsnip is only dangerous when the plant sap from broken leaves or stems gets on your skin. Lastly, the wild parsnip's "burn" is usually less irritating that poison ivy's "itch." The worst of the burning pain caused by wild parsnip is usually over within a couple of days while the rash and itch of poison ivy can last a long time.<br>

The arms, legs, torso, face, and neck are most vulnerable and affected areas may feel like they have been scalded. Blisters form a day or two after sun exposure and soon after the blisters rupture and the skin starts healing. But for many people the ordeal is not over as dark red or brownish "scars" remain in the burned areas for several months to years.<br>
