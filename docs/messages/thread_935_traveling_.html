Thanks to letterboxing, what used to be a dull 1.5 day trip is now<br/>
something I view instead as a  2 day LB adventure!  If my luck and the<br/>
weather are good, we should get 5 boxes tomorrow (4 in IN and 1 in OH)<br/>
and then hit the Elba Onion's NY State Thruway series (eastbound, at<br/>
least) on Saturday!  I was so excited when they posted that series.<br/>
<br/>
Does any one have any recommendations for boxes just off I-90 in<br/>
Pennsylvania that the dog and I can go after?  I haven't quite planned<br/>
the return trip itinerary and I think it's the only state we are<br/>
traveling through that we haven't found a box in yet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
