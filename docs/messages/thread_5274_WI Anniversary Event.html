to fit into our schedule and that weekend has been booked for us for a<br/>
long time.  We'll be thinking about all of you on October 4th as you<br/>
celebrate the 10th.  Maybe we'll be able to squeeze in a tiny bit of<br/>
trail time and raise our compass for a quick box that day.  <br/>
<br/>
Other projects and commitments also mean that we won't have a box at<br/>
the event.  Although we haven't tried to confirm it, our permanent<br/>
peninsula plant probably qualifies as commemorating a Wisconsin first<br/>
for those who finish the many temporary event boxes and still have<br/>
time for more exploring.<br/>

Hey, Elves!  I don't see you signed up for the Anniversary event?! <br/>
Hope you can make it.  We have some additional carvings coming in from<br/>
a few out of state contributors which are very nice.<br/>
