We've gotten into a placing groove. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is just as challenging placing boxes as finding them. <br/>
Especially with four kids hanging off of you.  If you ever see me<br/>
smile and wave.  I'll be the one with one in the sling, one skipping<br/>
on ahead, and two more trying to fit into a one person stroller.  I'll<br/>
even exchange provided no one has unpacked our bag and lost all the<br/>
ink and stamps under the bed.  (sigh)<br/>
<br/>
You can check out clues on the LBNA site, under Buffalo Creek.  My 5yo<br/>
daughter helped with the carving.  <br/>

You're a brave woman.  I'm sure most things are more challenging with <br/>
four kids hanging off you!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my two kids and I went to check on some of our boxes that <br/>
they had helped to place.  We took along our 8th grade neighbor boy <br/>
and let him follow the clues to the boxes.  I practically had to hang <br/>
on to the kids' jackets and put my hand over their mouths to keep <br/>
them from running ahead or giving away clues.  They were jumping up <br/>
and down and giggling - it was hysterical!  Our neighbor was a real <br/>
trooper and even said he'd like to help us look for some others in <br/>
the area next time we go out.  Nice kid.<br/>
