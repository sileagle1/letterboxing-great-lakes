<br>
Here is a snipped version of a message sent earlier in the month.<br>
<br>
How long might it take for your BINGO card to fill? Or,<br>
more specifically, for *anyone's* card to fill?<br>
<br>
<br>
If you'd again like to add some excitement to SpringChick's<br>
Letterboxing Bingo game, enter the Side-Wagers Game.<br>
<br>
Email me the date you think the game will end. In other words, when<br>
will SpringChick pull the item that finally and *completely* fills in<br>
some player's card?<br>
Again, I'm talking about the Big Game here, not the interim games.<br>
The date will be determined by the claiming of a successful card by a<br>
BINGO player (and its certification by SpringChick).<br>
<br>
I must have your guess before January 1, 2007.<br>
Mail to jparkerg at Yahoo dot com<br>
(my usual address for this group)<br>
In the subject line, put "Bingo".<br>
<br>
I'll award the winner's prize to the person who comes closest to the<br>
actual day or is closest before the day the Bingo Game ends. If you<br>
choose February 15th, for example, and someone else chooses the 20th,<br>
and the game ends on the 19th, you win. In other words, you'll hold<br>
all of the days until the next guesser hits the calendar. But you<br>
don't know who has chosen which days or how far apart they've fallen<br>
(and neither does SC!).<br>
<br>
Last year there were a couple of players who chose identical dates. I<br>
accepted the first one I received (and offered another shot to the one<br>
who'd doubled up on the date.)<br>
This time around, I will assign the another available date to anyone<br>
who chooses a date already taken. I'll do this by moving out in the<br>
calendar until I find a date between your choice and the next one chosen.<br>
<br>
I'll provide the prize for the lucky winner.<br>
You do not need to be a player in the big game to participate. You do<br>
not need to send a prize.<br>
<br>
For a little more detail, check out the files section of this list<br>
under Side-Wagers.<br>
<br>
There is still time to get into the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>
