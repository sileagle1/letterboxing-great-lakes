are no reported cases of West Nile in humans in WI this year and it<br/>
hasn't been found in any mosquitoes there to date either (it has been<br/>
found in birds, but you don't have to tell them that).  If they are old<br/>
enough to keep a watch on these things themselves, the CDC<br/>
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/) updates their country map<br/>
weekly and the WI Dept of Health and Family Services has information<br/>
including a state map by county at<br/>
http://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/communicable/WestNileVirus/Index.htm<br/>
(I've no idea how often they update their info).  The CDC also has links<br/>
to other's states' websites, if you want to see what's going on elsewhere.<br/>

&gt; Mr. Puddlejumper and I both encountered poison ivy somewhere along the<br/><br/>
&gt; way recently.  Thankfully the kids did not.  I must have<br/>
&gt; unknowingly<br/><br/>
&gt; done enough of the right things to keep it from spreading, but I only<br/><br/>
&gt; had one little spot that is healing.  Mr. Puddlejumper was at<br/>
&gt; urgent<br/><br/>
&gt; care last night and again tonight.  It wasn't until tonight that <br/>
&gt; they<br/><br/>
&gt; diagnosed it as poison Ivy rash.  He has a nasty rash on his<br/>
&gt; lower leg,<br/><br/>
&gt; but since yesterday has been spreading to other areas on his legs,<br/>
&gt; arms<br/><br/>
&gt; and torso.  He thinks even his ears are affected.  We are<br/>
&gt; hoping the<br/><br/>
&gt; prednisone will stop it in it's tracks, otherwise he is in for a full<br/><br/>
&gt; body rash.  There is no way he got poison Ivy oil all over his<br/>
&gt; body, so<br/><br/>
&gt; we are thinking it is a systemic reaction because it all started with <br/>
&gt; a<br/><br/>
&gt; scratch, that he scratched, it opened, became infected and it just<br/><br/>
&gt; seemed to spread like wildfire after that.  I really hope the<br/>
&gt; meds he is<br/><br/>
&gt; on is adequate.  If anyone knows differently please let us<br/>
&gt; know.  He is<br/><br/>
&gt; on an antibiotic and then also the Prednisone.<br/><br/>
&gt; <br/><br/>
&gt; We are going to be out of commission for awhile, partially because Mr.<br/><br/>
&gt; Puddlejumper needs time to heal, but also because we are now very wary<br/><br/>
&gt; of getting back out there.  We had no idea that poison Ivy rash<br/>
&gt; was<br/><br/>
&gt; soooooo bad!  Ironically, we had just been trying to educate<br/>
&gt; ourselves<br/><br/>
&gt; better about poison Ivy and had been reading this website,<br/><br/>
&gt; <a<br>
&gt; href="http://www.poison-ivy.org/index.htm"&gt;http://www.poison-ivy.org/i<br/>
&gt; ndex.htm  There is some scary looking photos<br/><br/>
&gt; and stories on that site and Mr. Puddlejumper could rival some of<br/>
&gt; those<br/><br/>
&gt; photos.<br/><br/>
&gt; <br/><br/>
&gt; Obviously, we don't know how to identify it even after looking at all <br/>
&gt; of<br/><br/>
&gt; those photos.  (that might be a good idea for a workshop at the<br/>
&gt; WI<br/><br/>
&gt; gathering this fall if anyone has any knowledge on this to help us who<br/><br/>
&gt; are ignorant - the dangers of the "wild")  I guess we<br/>
&gt; are just really<br/><br/>
&gt; concerned because we have 3 very active kids and I'm so glad they were<br/><br/>
&gt; not the ones to come home with the poison ivy.......this time!<br/><br/>
&gt; <br/><br/>
&gt; Mr. Puddlejumper's mom is obviously very concerned about our hiking<br/><br/>
&gt; activities now and she began to ask more questions about this<br/><br/>
&gt; letterboxing hobby of ours.  Mr. Puddlejumper"s dad decided <br/>
&gt; to pipe in<br/><br/>
&gt; and tell us that we also  need to be careful of the "timber <br/>
&gt; rattlers"<br/><br/>
&gt; people have seen in the Devil's Lake area.  He said they are<br/>
&gt; found in<br/><br/>
&gt; the rocks.  Is this true?!!!  He said "you'll be fine<br/>
&gt; if you stay on the<br/><br/>
&gt; marked trail", to which we both told him that letterboxing often <br/>
&gt; takes<br/><br/>
&gt; us off the trail.  I personally am officially scared to go<br/>
&gt; letterboxing<br/><br/>
&gt; now!  It is like all of my letterboxing ambitions have come to a<br/><br/>
&gt; screeching halt.  (found info on timber<br/><br/>
&gt; rattlesnakes...<a<br>
&gt; href="http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/land/er/factsheets/herps/timber.h<br/>
&gt; tm)"&gt;http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/land/er/factsheets/herps/timber.ht<br/>
&gt; m)<br/><br/>
&gt; Is that why there are so few letterboxes in the southwest corner of<br/>
&gt; WI?<br/><br/>
&gt; Just kidding.  I read through that DNR info and it does help to<br/>
&gt; easy the<br/><br/>
&gt; fears a abit.<br/><br/>
&gt; <br/><br/>
&gt; Then to top it all off, while we were at urgent care with Mr.<br/><br/>
&gt; Puddlejumper tonight, the kids stayed with Grandma and Grandpa.  <br/>
&gt; At some<br/><br/>
&gt; point in the evening the mosquitos started biting and Grandpa hustled<br/><br/>
&gt; the kids inside right away telling them all about West Nile virus!<br/><br/>
&gt; Needless to say, the kids are afraid now too and told us on the way<br/>
&gt; home<br/><br/>
&gt; that they don't want to ever go letterboxing again!<br/><br/>
&gt; <br/><br/>
&gt; Now Grandpa isn't normally an alarmist, in fact he is an old northern<br/><br/>
&gt; Minn. farm boy himself as well as a jet fighter pilot retiree. <br/>
&gt; Nothing<br/><br/>
&gt; seems to phase him much.  Yet we know he really dislikes snakes.<br/><br/>
&gt; Mosquitos?  I don't know, I thought that was the Minn. state<br/>
&gt; bird?<br/><br/>
&gt; <br/><br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any words of wisdom?  Encouragement? <br/>
&gt; Sympathy?  How do<br/><br/>
&gt; we get the kids back out on the trail?<br/><br/>
