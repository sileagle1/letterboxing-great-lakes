are no reported cases of West Nile in humans in WI this year and it<br>
hasn't been found in any mosquitoes there to date either (it has been<br>
found in birds, but you don't have to tell them that).  If they are old<br>
enough to keep a watch on these things themselves, the CDC<br>
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/) updates their country map<br>
weekly and the WI Dept of Health and Family Services has information<br>
including a state map by county at<br>
http://dhfs.wisconsin.gov/communicable/WestNileVirus/Index.htm<br>
(I've no idea how often they update their info).  The CDC also has links<br>
to other's states' websites, if you want to see what's going on elsewhere.<br>
