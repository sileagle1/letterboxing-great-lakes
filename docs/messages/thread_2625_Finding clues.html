clue sites -- where anyone can go and post their letterbox clues.  In <br/>
addition, you will find clues (this is by no means an exhaustive list):<br/>
<br/>
-  Letterboxers' personal web sites and blogs (see Silent Doug's site <br/>
for a listing of letterboxer sites -- http://www.letterboxing.info/)<br/>
-  Files, Links and Photos sections of letterboxing Yahoo! groups -- <br/>
for instance this group (a list of other LB Yahoo! groups can be found <br/>
in the Links section of the LbGLK group or at Silent Doug's website)<br/>
-  Posts at letterboxing Yahoo! groups<br/>
-  Inside other letterboxes<br/>
<br/>
There are two other places where you can dig through the archives and <br/>
perhaps find references to boxes in your area that for whatever reason <br/>
are no longer listed on the main clue site (but sometimes are still <br/>
active):<br/>
<br/>
-  The old letterboxing.org website...  about 3 years ago, <br/>
letterboxing.org was completely redesigned as the site we know today.  <br/>
At that time it was necessary for all letterbox planters to relist <br/>
their own clues at the new site.  For whatever reason, some people <br/>
never did -- some were no longer actively letterboxing, others just <br/>
didn't take the time to do it or just didn't know they needed to, <br/>
etc.  This site (http://lbna.dyndns.org/index.html) contains a <br/>
*snapshot* in time -- clues as they were before the new web site.  It <br/>
can be fun poking around here -- notice on the home page, there were <br/>
only 4648 letterboxes listed at the time.<br/>
<br/>
-  The letterbox basement...  This is a Yahoo! group <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/) where the <br/>
webmasters dumped unclaimed letterboxes at the time of the transition <br/>
to the new letterboxing.org website.  Each box is listed as a post to <br/>
the list and they are loosely grouped by state, although some are <br/>
randomly floating out of place.  This is a bit more time-consuming, <br/>
but can yield hidden treasures.<br/>
<br/>
It can at times be like looking for a needle in a haystack, but don't <br/>
exhaust yourself over it.  The best thing to do is keep your eyes and <br/>
ears open and you will no doubt stumble across lurking clues every now <br/>
and then.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, some clues are distributed via WoM (word-of-mouth).  This <br/>
is kind of a catch-all for unpublished clues selectively passed from <br/>
one letterboxer to another via U.S. Mail, e-mail, or direct handoff <br/>
verbally or written.  How do you get WoM clues?  It varies from one <br/>
letterboxer to another.  Sometimes it just takes time, participation <br/>
and proving yourself.  People will sometimes plant a box or series and <br/>
then send out clues to other active letterboxers in the area based on <br/>
interactions they have had -- people they have met at gatherings, e-<br/>
mail correspondance and list posts.  I know of one letterboxer who <br/>
sends a little WoM clue out to folks whenever they send him <br/>
informative *contact the placer* messages.  I know of another person <br/>
who does not list their clues on any public clue site, rather <br/>
publishes a small clue book and sends it via U.S. Mail to people in <br/>
her area and remote contacts she has corresponded with.  One person I <br/>
know has a series of unpublished boxes that he selectively distributes <br/>
clues to once he feels a person has reached a certain level in the <br/>
game -- they have proven themselves in his eyes to be discreet and <br/>
conscientious (yes, this is completely subjective, but they are his <br/>
letterboxes and he can elect to hand out clues based on any criteria <br/>
he chooses).  Still others may list the name of an unpublished box <br/>
publically, but indicate that a person must request the clues.  Many <br/>
people hand out WoM clues at letterbox gatherings -- not just for <br/>
boxes at the gathering, but other boxes in the general area or the <br/>
area where they live.  WoM clues are not necessarily meant to be <br/>
exclusionary or *top secret* (although some are), rather placers often <br/>
use this means of clue distribution for boxes in sensitive areas or <br/>
boxes where they otherwise want to know or have control over who is <br/>
searching for their letterbox.  If you have heard of an unpublished <br/>
box that you would like clues for, often just sending the planter an e-<br/>
mail and asking for the clues is all it takes.<br/>
