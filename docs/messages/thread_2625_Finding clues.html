I am sure this subject has already been broached on this board, but <br>
there are 1000's of posts and it would be like finding a needle in a <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing.org (LbNA) and AtlasQuest are the two public letterboxing <br>
clue sites -- where anyone can go and post their letterbox clues.  In <br>
addition, you will find clues (this is by no means an exhaustive list):<br>
<br>
-  Letterboxers' personal web sites and blogs (see Silent Doug's site <br>
for a listing of letterboxer sites -- http://www.letterboxing.info/)<br>
-  Files, Links and Photos sections of letterboxing Yahoo! groups -- <br>
for instance this group (a list of other LB Yahoo! groups can be found <br>
in the Links section of the LbGLK group or at Silent Doug's website)<br>
-  Posts at letterboxing Yahoo! groups<br>
-  Inside other letterboxes<br>
<br>
There are two other places where you can dig through the archives and <br>
perhaps find references to boxes in your area that for whatever reason <br>
are no longer listed on the main clue site (but sometimes are still <br>
active):<br>
<br>
-  The old letterboxing.org website...  about 3 years ago, <br>
letterboxing.org was completely redesigned as the site we know today.  <br>
At that time it was necessary for all letterbox planters to relist <br>
their own clues at the new site.  For whatever reason, some people <br>
never did -- some were no longer actively letterboxing, others just <br>
didn't take the time to do it or just didn't know they needed to, <br>
etc.  This site (http://lbna.dyndns.org/index.html) contains a <br>
*snapshot* in time -- clues as they were before the new web site.  It <br>
can be fun poking around here -- notice on the home page, there were <br>
only 4648 letterboxes listed at the time.<br>
<br>
-  The letterbox basement...  This is a Yahoo! group <br>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/) where the <br>
webmasters dumped unclaimed letterboxes at the time of the transition <br>
to the new letterboxing.org website.  Each box is listed as a post to <br>
the list and they are loosely grouped by state, although some are <br>
randomly floating out of place.  This is a bit more time-consuming, <br>
but can yield hidden treasures.<br>
<br>
It can at times be like looking for a needle in a haystack, but don't <br>
exhaust yourself over it.  The best thing to do is keep your eyes and <br>
ears open and you will no doubt stumble across lurking clues every now <br>
and then.<br>
<br>
In addition, some clues are distributed via WoM (word-of-mouth).  This <br>
is kind of a catch-all for unpublished clues selectively passed from <br>
one letterboxer to another via U.S. Mail, e-mail, or direct handoff <br>
verbally or written.  How do you get WoM clues?  It varies from one <br>
letterboxer to another.  Sometimes it just takes time, participation <br>
and proving yourself.  People will sometimes plant a box or series and <br>
then send out clues to other active letterboxers in the area based on <br>
interactions they have had -- people they have met at gatherings, e-<br>
mail correspondance and list posts.  I know of one letterboxer who <br>
sends a little WoM clue out to folks whenever they send him <br>
informative *contact the placer* messages.  I know of another person <br>
who does not list their clues on any public clue site, rather <br>
publishes a small clue book and sends it via U.S. Mail to people in <br>
her area and remote contacts she has corresponded with.  One person I <br>
know has a series of unpublished boxes that he selectively distributes <br>
clues to once he feels a person has reached a certain level in the <br>
game -- they have proven themselves in his eyes to be discreet and <br>
conscientious (yes, this is completely subjective, but they are his <br>
letterboxes and he can elect to hand out clues based on any criteria <br>
he chooses).  Still others may list the name of an unpublished box <br>
publically, but indicate that a person must request the clues.  Many <br>
people hand out WoM clues at letterbox gatherings -- not just for <br>
boxes at the gathering, but other boxes in the general area or the <br>
area where they live.  WoM clues are not necessarily meant to be <br>
exclusionary or *top secret* (although some are), rather placers often <br>
use this means of clue distribution for boxes in sensitive areas or <br>
boxes where they otherwise want to know or have control over who is <br>
searching for their letterbox.  If you have heard of an unpublished <br>
box that you would like clues for, often just sending the planter an e-<br>
mail and asking for the clues is all it takes.<br>

Springchick, thanks for taking the time to do this post.  I've been <br>
boxing for close to 2 years and didn't know some of the information <br>
written here.  Great Post!!!! :-)<br>
