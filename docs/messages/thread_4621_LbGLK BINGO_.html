                    <div class="plaintext-content">I tried to choose boxes evenly across the region that were planted during the last quarter of 2006 and the first half (sometimes a little later) of 2007, thus giving newer letterboxers more of an even playing field in this section.  But if you haven't been out boxing in a while or have been busy boxing in other alluring places in the world ;-) you may not have visited them yet.  Besides which, when you consider that I chose the 45 boxes fairly evenly across the entire 6-state region, there is probably only one or two boxes within an hour from where you live, so it is quite hit or miss.<br/>
<br/>
I added some additional general terms this year so instead of 7 per column, there are 8 per column, which will hopefully help to spread it out a little -- last year it came down to several people all waiting for the same few words.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing that surprised me the most as I was compiling the list -- were there no events in WI this past year?  I sifted through the AQ event calendar and didn't see any, thus no events in WI.  I realize the one event was held in IA, but there were quite a few boxers from the GL region who attended, which is why I included this one.<br/>
<br/>
The main thing was that I tried to use different boxes, boxers and events than in the previous Bingo games.  Although a few of the general terms are new, many are repeats since there are a limited number of these.<br/>
<br/>
As Azobox noted, in the past, choosing all general terms has not been a disadvantage in the least, so don't be discouraged if you find you don't qualify for many of the boxes, boxers or events.<br/>

On my way to work the radio hosts informed me that today was the busiest  day <br/>
for the post office all year round... that they get over 4 million more  <br/>
pieces of mail today than any other day.<br/>
<br/>
So, I held onto the package until I came to small-town-illinois while at  <br/>
work. I was the only one there -- no lines . . . woo hoo.<br/>
