We are now loading up our circus train - filled with the most <br>
wonderous, dazzling performers and exotic, wild animals that the <br>
district of Michigonia has ever seen! Pardon our excitement, but we <br>
are so proud to serve as the proxy ringmaster for Phineas Boch and <br>
his most colorful assemblage of tantelizing talent!<br>
<br>
Be on the lookout as we set up stakes in the Hudson Mill area for our <br>
one day only performance on Saturday, 18 June.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to performing for you all - <br>
<br>
May all your days be circus days!<br>

was 5 years old - I can't wait for Saturday!!  This is going to be my <br>
first gathering, too, so like some others that have posted recently, <br>
I'm a little nervous about not knowing what to do.  But it's obvious <br>
that this is a friendly, supportive group of people, so I'm really <br>
looking forward to it!<br>
