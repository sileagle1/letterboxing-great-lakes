<br>
We have updated the clues to our What a Scream! letterbox in <br>
Schaumburg, IL.  We had added a note shortly after placing the box <br>
about construction in the area.  The construction is over at last and <br>
Walnut Lane has been re-opened at Schaumburg Road, this makes it a lot <br>
easier to get to our box!!  Just thought we'd alert you to the change.<br>
<br>
We are also very excited about the bingo game and that our box has <br>
been included!!  We can't wait to send in our picks and our booty.  <br>
Thanks Spring Chick for organizing such a cool game!!<br>
