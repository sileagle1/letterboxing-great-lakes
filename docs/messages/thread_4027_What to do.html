<br/>
They have geocaching listed as a sanctioned activity on their website:  http://metroparks.com/activities/geocaching.php  They do have a permit process for planters of geocaches, which requires no fee, but does mandate that cache locations change as of March 1st each year.  http://metroparks.com/images/activities/geo_rules_app.pdf<br/>

Glad to hear it all worked out okay, DD!  Nothing wrong with a little paranoia!<br/>

Which county metro parks are really strict about letterboxes, <br/>

<br/>
I don't know about all Metro Parks here in Ohio, but at least in the <br/>
Cincy area and southern Ohio in general, placing letterboxes is either <br/>
prohibited or the rules are so suffocating that most put their boxes <br/>
elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone does place a box in a metro park anyway (ignoring the <br/>
warnings) the reactions can range from rangers giving a mild scolding <br/>
and warning making you feel like an idiot, to using words like <br/>
"confiscating" and implying that they have the authority to press charges. <br/>
<br/>
Most of us have since stayed the heck away from these parks since there <br/>
are plenty of other places available.  One park very close to me offered <br/>
to let someone place boxes, but the park ranger would pick the location <br/>
and the box had to be checked once every two weeks minimum---and that <br/>
they would check to make sure the box was checked.  Much of this is I <br/>
have been told, is because of drug-running that has been done in some <br/>
similar manner.  :(   Once I heard that, I was more understanding of why <br/>
there are such strict rules in some places.  It's just one more example <br/>
of how some people can ruin something great for others---like Trick or <br/>
Treat having to be so much more limited than before.  Make it stop!!<br/>

I guess you would have to ask Penny Penny but I thought it was 34 <br/>
dollars to place one LB in a park in Oakland. The park I had that <br/>
gathering at was a private park that allowed geocaching. I don't <br/>
even want to talk about the first park I asked at in Oakland, that <br/>
guy flipped out on me when I asked him if I could host a gathering <br/>
there. I almost called it off, that guy freaked me out so bad.<br/>
