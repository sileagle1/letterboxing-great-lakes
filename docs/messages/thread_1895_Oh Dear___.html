vandalized or hear a report like this -- why would somebody vandalize <br>
a letterbox?  I just don't get it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sooo  Sorry your box was lost.  One of my boxes was found in bad shape <br>
when I was taking a little girl out for the first time.  When we got to <br>
the #2 on the Maumee Dog Walk all that was there was the bone and the <br>
log book.  Then we started looking around a found the two stamps and <br>
pads in the bushes.  When we looked in the logbook it appeared that <br>
some youngun' had found it and had stamped the stamps in the logbook <br>
and then done finger prints of her name "Josie".  I'm guessing she <br>
found it, played with it and then someone come by and she just tossed <br>
it.  We got it back together and figured we were lucky!  This was very <br>
well hidden, but the last finder could have left it out.  <br>
<br>
Hope your other boxes stay safe.<br>
