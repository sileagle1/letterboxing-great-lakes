                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to say Hello and what a fun group you all sound like.  <br>
I'm new to letterboxing and am sort of here in limbo in the <br>
Stevensville/St. Joseph MI area.  I am moving to just out of your <br>
area, on the otherside of the Ohio line to the Pittsburgh PA area.  <br>
We've kept a house here in MI for several years but have been hopping <br>
across the country on temp. assignments for my husbands engineering <br>
job.  It's never too late to start, but I am a little disappointed <br>
that I'm just learning about letterboxing.  In the past five years <br>
we've moved between here, WI, CA and AZ.  I could have logged in alot <br>
of stamps.  However I kept pretty busy out west with rock hounding.  <br>
I found a bottle in AZ that contained an old claim for a gold mining <br>
stake.  That was a treasure box!  It was an old green 'Bufferin' <br>
bottle from the sixties with a white plastic cap.  I was struck by <br>
how well things weather out there as opposed to here in all this damp <br>
green stuff.<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough of my rambles.  I came across an LBNA site link from <br>
the "ModernGypsy" website, as one of my hobbies is altering books and <br>
mixed media arts.  I went looking for a box in Kalamazoo and have <br>
been recieving some helpful insights from Azobox via e-mail.  I hope <br>
to locate some more while here and have some places staked out for <br>
searching in PA.  Tis heady stuff, all this adventure business :)<br>
Nice to meet you all,<br>
Milly in MI<br>
<br>
by the way, my compliments on your logo picture, impressive design!<br>

And welcome.<br>
Interesting that you list altered books as another interest. There <br>
are a couple of us (at least!) who are also into AB's and related <br>
arts.<br>
I think you'll find this a friendly and low-key group.<br>
As you've probably noticed, 'tis the season for letterboxing in the <br>
upper midwest and lots of us are eager to get back out there.<br>
<br>
I hope to see your stamp(s) in letterboxes around here.<br>
