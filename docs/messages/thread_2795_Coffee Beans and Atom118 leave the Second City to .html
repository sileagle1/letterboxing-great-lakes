Has your staff been keeping track of the number of travelers who have <br/>
completed the tour? I think when B and I finished in May, we were maybe <br/>
the 5th or so...? And it seems like the numbers have exploded this <br/>
summer! Just curious how many intrepid souls have pulled off this <br/>
tour.... (which, by the way, was one of our favorites ever and got us <br/>
completely hooked on boxing when we started last summer!)<br/>
