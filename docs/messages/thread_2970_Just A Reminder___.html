clues that are not available at one of the public letterboxing clue <br/>
sites (i.e. letterboxing.org and/or AtlasQuest).  While it is a good <br/>
idea to keep a backup copy of your clues for situations when thes <br/>
sites are not available, this should be done on your own computer as <br/>
there is not enough room in the FILES section of the group for <br/>
everyone to keep their backup clues there.<br/>
<br/>
If we ever run into a situation where the site where you have your <br/>
clues (letterboxing.org or AtlasQuest) is not available for an <br/>
extended period of time, like a couple of weeks ago, you are welcome <br/>
to *temporarily* use the FILES section for clues.  But provided the <br/>
public sites are up and running, this area should be reserved for WOM <br/>
clues and other clues not available at a public site.<br/>

With LBNA down for quite a while recently--and even Atlasquest was <br/>
down for part of a day last week--it would be nice to post clues on <br/>
both sites (not just link to the other site).  I used to have my clues <br/>
on one site or the other and would then post the link to the other <br/>
site.  After the recent downtimes, I decided to fully post my clues on <br/>
both sites; therefore, if one is down, the clues are still available <br/>
at the other site. The clues are in a Word document on my home <br/>
computer, so posting the clues takes just a few minutes.<br/>

it another e-mail to keep up with, but I keep folders for each of my <br/>

people send me about them -- it is a nice history to look back on.  As AQ <br/>
mail does not have the ability to forward out of AQ to another mail program <br/>
I wasn't able to file these found reports away with the others.<br/>
<br/>
I use AQ to look for clues sometimes, but for me I find it easier to just <br/>
maintain clue listings at letterboxing.org.<br/>

<br/>
I also deleted mine from AQ recently for pretty much the same reasons.<br/>
I had listed them there as a courtesy (I don't normally use AQ at all) and then<br/>
forgotten about them.  Then a couple of weeks ago I got an email from AQ<br/>
stating that since my account had been inactive so long, if I didn't log in <br/>
within 10 days, my boxes would be listed as available for adoption.  I didn't <br/>
want to run the risk of that ever happening due to my forgetting to log into <br/>
AQ or not getting the warning email or whatever, so I just took the clues off <br/>
AQ.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry AQ fans, but I really just prefer to deal with one site.<br/>
