                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good morning Packer letterboxers! As promised, I am posting the schedule for<br>
locations of the "superbowl XL: Packers vs Steelers" letterbox. To get this<br>
letterbox, simply show up where One Love Journeying and I are, locate us (I<br>
will be wearing this season's Packers knit sideline hat and OLJ will be<br>
wearing a Jennings home game jersey) and ask us if we are members of "the G<br>
Force"! :-)<br>
<br>
Aaaaand!! As a special bonus for ur effort in finding us, we are offering my<br>
"in enemy territory" box (usually only available at enemy stadiums during<br>
the game weekends). All u have to do to gain this stamp is tell us the years<br>
that the Packers have won the Superbowl!<br>
<br>
So... start planning ur Packer Superbowl Sunday! Here is where we will be...<br>
<br>
8a-10a: 1020 firethorn dr, west bend, wi 53090<br>
11a-11:45a: location of OLJ's "for the love of starbucks" box (great time to<br>
pick up this box as well if u haven't yet!)<br>
3p-5p: currently undecided... we may be in search of a clever Chinese<br>
rabbit... will update this time further when we know more<br>
5p-end of game: Bluemound Bowl, Brookfield, WI (note: we are not likely to<br>
be bowling during the game... look hard for us... we will be here<br>
celebrating and probably shouting at some big tv screens with a crowd of<br>
other Green and Gold fans!)<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing/meeting you!<br>
Don't forget to bring ur stamp for exchanges!<br>
<br>
Go Pack Go!<br>

My Dad has invited us to join him for brekky at Perkins in West Bend. :)<br>
Can't pass up free breakfast with the fam! But feel free to interrupt our<br>
meal. We will be there 8:30 till probably 10, given that it is likely to be<br>
busy.<br>
<br>
Hope you can still find us! (We will be a table of 4... 2 young ladies, a<br>
good looking man and his beautiful dark-skinned partner. :)<br>
