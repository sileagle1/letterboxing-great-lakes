Sorry about the jump ahead!  I lost track that today is NOT St. Patrick's Day.  All the news <br>
coverage is talking about the parade today and I completely forgot it wasn't 3/17!<br>
<br>
What does this say about Americans, when we have to move the civic parades and other <br>
public celebrations to Friday instead of Saturday?  School attendance will be very light today, <br>
and I suspect the workforce will be out in big numbers.  Crowds would not be large if they <br>
held the parade on Saturday because that would cut into everyone's "my time."<br>
<br>
Enjoy the weekend!  I'm attending a gathering and demonstrating how to make a book.<br>
