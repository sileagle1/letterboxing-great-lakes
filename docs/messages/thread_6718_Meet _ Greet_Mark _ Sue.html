As some of you know, Mark &amp; Sue Pepe have been planning on coming to Chicago for some time now. As this is their first time in Chicago, they have a packed-full schedule to see all of the sights.  Included in their wish list of things to do, they really wanted to meet as many boxers in our area as possible..and wanted deep dish pizza.  Thus the gathering at Giordano's. (Us killing 2 birds with one SPOR!) <br/>
We will not have any letterboxes planted specifically for this event, but if anyone would like to  carve and plant boxes, (even better yet, with a possible Chicago theme) that would be wonderful.  We plan on boxing in a loose corridor from the heart of the city out to Oak Park - depending on time.  They have shown interest in Waltzing Pigs cemetery boxes, so the best part of the afternoon will be in the River Forest, Forest Park, Oak Park, area.<br/>
Hope to see some of you then...Tiptoe &amp; Tonto<br/>
