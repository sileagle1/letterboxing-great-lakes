getting a nasty "hitch hiker" of a different kind!  TICKS!<br/>
I had the unfortuante luck of picking up such a critter this past <br/>
weekend while out boxing...and I really didn't do that much <br/>
bushwhacking to merit such a beast!<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, Tonto noticed it before I was sucked dry!  But, he makes <br/>
a much better letterbox finder than a tick extractor...as a result of <br/>
his botched attempt at surgery, I had to go to the doctor to get it <br/>
professionally excised!  Not a fun experience!<br/>
<br/>
So, as you enjoy those crisp, autumn days of boxing beware the <br/>
tiny "spoilers"!  Give yourself a good examination once you return <br/>
from the trails...also check those letterbox dogs too!  These creepy <br/>
crawlers are a real "cootie" you don't want to take home with you!<br/>
<br/>
One hurting Tiptoe...and Tonto<br/>
