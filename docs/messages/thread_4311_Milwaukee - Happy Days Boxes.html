Clues<br/>
<br/>
So a last minute change in my Business trip brought me<br/>
to Milwaukee with a weekend to spend. So I went to<br/>
Wal-Mart bought some supplies and carved two stamps<br/>
with a Jack Knife in my hotel in Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
So the stamps are not my best work but a worth the<br/>
walk.<br/>
<br/>
To begin find Back Bay Park. "Woodstock" fans will<br/>
find it quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Once in the park find the lamppost that has a clear<br/>
view of the lake and the playground. Take 14 steps to<br/>
the north.  There you will see a path leading<br/>
downhill. From the edge of the park "lawn" count<br/>
approximately 20 paces down the trail. Stop. On your<br/>
right deep inside a Pisa log is letterbox #1.  Be sure<br/>
to recover it with leaves when you are done, but make<br/>
it look natural.<br/>
<br/>
Back at the lamppost stand on the left and walk<br/>
toward the next closest lamppost. From here head to<br/>
yet another post approximately south. Now grab a seat<br/>
at the nearest bench to enjoy the view.  From the top<br/>
of the nearby stairs, one should take a bearing of 259<br/>
degrees and walk 48 paces (steps) to the tree line.<br/>

day or so I would appreciate it if you would check on/perform<br/>
maintenance on the Happy Days boxes.  I see CG still has the old clues<br/>
and has them listed as unavailable, but they were in place last year<br/>
with the updated clues in the referenced posting below.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that box 1 went missing from the location below, but I<br/>
replaced it.  What I can't remember however is whether I put it in the<br/>
same spot or found a different hole to plant it in.  So if you don't<br/>
find it in the "Pisa" log, look around at other holes in the area nearby.<br/>
<br/>
I thought we should make sure these are up and running with all the<br/>
visitors we'll have coming to Milwaukee to see the new "Bronze Fonz"<br/>
statue going up this month...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We weren't referring to another box listing. Only to having so many boxes in the area that it took us 4 years to get around to using the updated clue for Happy Days box 2 that The Dragon posted on the LbGLK list.  <br/>
<br/>
The original Happy Days clue is still on LbNA (regular clues at http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=8341&amp;boxname=Happy_Days, not archive/basement clues), but it still shows box 2 as being missing so you need The Dragon's LbGLK message from 2007 to find the box 2 replacement (in our message yesterday or search the messages for "Happy Days").<br/>

&gt; So many boxes and so little time!  It's a nice problem to have in our area.  We were pleased to complete our Happy Days adventure this weekend and thought it was time to remind folks that box 2's current location is in The Dragon's message below since Canadian Goose hasn't updated the LbNA clue.<br/>

&gt; &gt; These boxes ARE active (last I knew). Although I have emailed Canadian Goose a number of times with the updated clues to these boxes, she has never changed the clues on LBNA.  In case someone wishes to try to find these boxes here's the clues I sent to Canadian Goose to use:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Clues<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So a last minute change in my Business trip brought me to Milwaukee with a weekend to spend. So I went to Wal-Mart bought some supplies and carved two stamps with a Jack Knife in my hotel in Connecticut.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So the stamps are not my best work but a worth the walk.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To begin find Back Bay Park. "Woodstock" fans will find it quickly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Once in the park find the lamppost that has a clear view of the lake and the playground. Take 14 steps to the north.  There you will see a path leading downhill. From the edge of the park "lawn" count approximately 20 paces down the trail. Stop. On your right deep inside a Pisa log is letterbox #1.  Be sure to recover it with leaves when you are done, but make it look natural.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Back at the lamppost stand on the left and walk toward the next closest lamppost. From here head to yet another post approximately south. Now grab a seat at the nearest bench to enjoy the view.  From the top of the nearby stairs, one should take a bearing of 259 degrees and walk 48 paces (steps) to the tree line.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; From there, spot the fallen tree trunk which in lying diagonally down the hill.  Look under loose bark and other forest debris on the side that is facing you for box #2.<br/>

Sorry, there were too many eyes in the park to check on box 1.  Maybe Sunny Side Up or someone else will be able to give you an update in the near future.<br/>
