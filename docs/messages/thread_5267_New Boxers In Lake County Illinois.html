                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am pleased to report that there are several new letterboxers in Lake <br>
County, Illinois who have recently found some of my boxes and contacted <br>
me about their finds.  They are very much interested in this hobby. <br>
They have a lot of questions, so I don't mind filling them in on the <br>
do's and don'ts. One claims to have accidentally found a letterbox in <br>
the forest preserve, read the label and went home to learn more about <br>
letterboxing. That's how he learned about the hobby.  Also, he rehid <br>
the box properly. Bravo! Another newbie found one of my boxes and we <br>
met by accident. She was trying to be so secretive.  Today, we met <br>
again - I showed her my LTC binder and gave her a LTC and she gave me <br>
her entire collection of 172 Beatles bubblegum trading cards from the <br>
mid 1960s.  WOW!  That's what I call card swapping!!! Thanks Dreams <br>
With Hobbits!  It's nice to meet new letterboxers who remind me of the <br>
excitement of that first find.  They're hooked!  ---Beetle      <br>
