None of my boxes have stamp pads in them (I would never be able to afford to make half the boxes I want to if I did that).  For a while I felt kind of bad about this but after the first four boxes, I don't think I've found one recently that had a stamp pad (none of the ones at either Starved Rock or Turkey Run had pads).  I've also heard of people having problems with animals getting into their boxes that were solved when the ink pad was removed (maybe they were smelling vegetable dyes and thought it was food?).<br>

It seems that in the midwest at least, most boxes do not contain ink <br>
pads. None of mine do. It's probably a combination of local custom <br>
and climate; since most of us didn't start out finding ink pads in <br>
the boxes we searched, we didn't include them in boxes we placed. And <br>
I've heard stories about pads freezing and then making a mess when <br>
they thawed.<br>
<br>
That has lead me to carry a rainbow of pads with me "just in case" <br>
the placer has created an extra special stamp. Colored markers are <br>
also a useful alternative when the stamp warrants. Recently <br>
the "Parrots" and the "Turkeys" made me glad I brought colored ink.<br>
<br>
Now, about books, I take the easy way out. We have a spiral-binding <br>
punch and so I just make my own books and use the plastic coils to <br>
bind them. The coils are available in several diameters and colors. I <br>
don't use fancy paper. Size is variable, depending on the box. <br>
I'll admit they are not elegant, but they get the job done. I do hand-<br>
sew very small books for Hitchers. I'll admit that I do admire some <br>
of the wonderful hand-made books we've encountered (for example: <br>
SpringChick's "Big House", as I recall).<br>
<br>
It's good to revisit these issues as new boxers join the fold.<br>
