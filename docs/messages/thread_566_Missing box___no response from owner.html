One thing I also do, if I'm not sure of a box's status before heading out, is search for the box by name via Google.  Quite a few 'boxers have their own websites and list the boxes they've found and the dates, so this way you could try to gage how recently the box was last found, if the clues don't provide that information.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeh, missing boxes are just a part of the game.  Even when a placer is<br/>
diligent, checks frequently on their boxes, posts status notes on the clues<br/>
and has every reason to believe the box is intact, it could go missing the<br/>
day before you get there.<br/>
<br/>
I realize the more nagging problem are those boxes that have been missing<br/>
for quite some time and the clues still remain, with no indication as to<br/>
status of the box, due to the fact that the placer is no longer letterboxing<br/>
or simply has been pulled in other directions for a while.  In answer to<br/>
your first question about how long it will stay on the clue site -- probably<br/>
for a long time.  The way it works right now, a box is only removed if the<br/>
owner removes it, or in extreme cases, if it has been confiscated by<br/>
authorities and the owner does not come forward.<br/>
<br/>
In answer to your second question, how many are there?  It would be<br/>
impossible to know, especially since seekers often report boxes to be<br/>
missing only to have a subsequent seeker find the box.  Relatively speaking,<br/>
the number of non-existent boxes whose clues are still listed and provide no<br/>
indication that the box is missing is only a small percentage of the overall<br/>
total of boxes listed on letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
It can be frustrating to drive a distance to look for a box and then be<br/>
certain you are at the right place and find no box.  But you are correct -- <br/>
you still found a wonderful new park or city and most likely enjoyed a nice<br/>
hike with family, friends, etc.  If you do know ahead of time where you will<br/>
be headed, especially if it is a distance away, it is perfectly acceptable<br/>
to contact the placer and inquire as to the status of a box.  Most placers<br/>
are okay with this and have experienced the frustration of missing boxes<br/>
themself.  If you do happen across somebody who doesn't care to provide that<br/>
information, you probably just won't hear back from them -- nothing lost.<br/>

Anyway, that usually makes me feel better about long drives with no payoff- if I blame myself it's easier to stomach.  I'm used to my failures!  Besides, that way I don't have to risk the embarassment of emailing a placer with news of a "missing" box only to be informed that it is, in fact, still there.  Boy, do those emails stink.<br/>

the template or perhaps create another list of "retired" or "MIA" so they<br/>
don't show up on the original States Pages.  I don't regret searching for<br/>
this box since it was close to home, but I can understand the frustration<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm new and still learning, but is this accepted as "all part of the <br/>

&gt; box.  I would assume its a nuisance to the owner to get emails from <br/>
&gt; people checking status if they haven't even tried to look, but I'm <br/>
&gt; getting to the point where I'm looking for boxes that a much farther <br/>
&gt; away from home and don't want to waste the drive.  I guess in some <br/>
&gt; ways, I haven't wasted time as I usually find a new wooded area or <br/>
&gt; scenic spot I was not aware of before.  I guess its the compusive <br/>
&gt; completion complex I have that feels frustrated if I don't find the <br/>
&gt; box :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have some of the veteran boxers found this to be a problem (boxes <br/>
&gt; still listed for years after they are lost?) or was I just unlucky on <br/>
&gt; my first box?<br/>

On the LbNA site, any placer can edit or delete a box that he/she has <br/>
placed. Edits can include information like "this box is reported as <br/>
MIA - unconfirmed" or "This box has been removed temporarily for <br/>
maintenance" or anything else the placer wishes to post.<br/>
Or the box can be deleted and it will no longer show up on the list <br/>
at all.<br/>
Many placers use the edit function to update prospective seekers <br/>
about last known findings or other reports that may affect a seekers' <br/>
plans.<br/>
<br/>
Probably I don't understand what the placer of D'ville had in mind, <br/>
but the whole entry can be made to go away with a simple click by the <br/>
placer.<br/>
<br/>
The weak link in this information chain is that some seekers print <br/>
out lots of clues ahead of time and stash them away for a future <br/>
trip. Then the box status changes before the hunt is made.<br/>

new.  When I didn't hear back from the placer within a week, I posted <br/>

I wonder if it would be possible to add a button to the box listing <br/>

confirmed find with the box.  It might track the number of finds <br/>
too.  Might be fun for the placer to know how much traffic the box is <br/>

confirm how recently it was found intact.  <br/>

I continue to impusively just drive and take my chances and at least <br/>
have a nice day in the woods.  I agree that when I start making <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On the surface your idea for a button for a finder to click makes <br/>
perfect sense. In practice it's fraught with pitfalls.<br/>
<br/>
There have furious debates on the big list over the years about the <br/>
collection of data and the appropriateness of anyone other than the <br/>
placer adding information to a clue-based site.<br/>
<br/>
Without going into the minefield of history, suffice it to say, all <br/>
points of these arguemnts have been aired ad nauseum. The gist of it <br/>
is that seeker-based information cannot be supported on clue pages <br/>
because it quickly compromises the placers' intentions. There were <br/>
experiments launched by groups of seekers to classify boxes (by *all* <br/>
kinds of criteria) and the revolution by placers still rumbles <br/>
through the underground.<br/>
Anyway......interesting thought(and not illogical at first glance), <br/>
but simply not feasible.<br/>
<br/>
Your plan to contact placers is your best bet for a positive <br/>
experience. The problem of unresponsive placers will probably always <br/>
be with us.<br/>

Thanks for the history, and I yes, I imagine its not nearly as big an <br/>

alone the organizational change of adding the button.  <br/>

the travelling group, this list and the big list.  I haven't taken the<br/>
time to read the history on all these subject lines; too easy to put in<br/>
two cents' reply.  Maybe I'll spend some time doing just that, but<br/>
probably won't bother ... as others before me obviously have done. <br/>
Getting out there is a better use of my time!  Thanks for reminding me to<br/>
be more thoughtful before responding.<br/>
