When you planted yours, did you include your contact info somewhere in the logbook or the box? I normally include that in my plants, but I'm such a fraidy cat and I worry that if the boxes are found by museum staff, they'll somehow figure out who I am by my contact info (mainly my email), and they'll revoke my membership or something stupid ;o)<br>

I hope to get these carved and planted next week. Thanks!<br>

Do you know which department was asked? I looked at their website and there's not really a "director". There's a CEO and then various VP's of different departments.<br>
<br>
I just sent an email to the VP of Exhibits. Hopefully he'll respond or pass it along to someone else if he's not the right person.<br>
<br>
Thanks for letting me know that permission was given last year. Gives me hope that they'll allow it again this year.<br>
