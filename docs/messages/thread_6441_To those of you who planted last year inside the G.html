When you planted yours, did you include your contact info somewhere in the logbook or the box? I normally include that in my plants, but I'm such a fraidy cat and I worry that if the boxes are found by museum staff, they'll somehow figure out who I am by my contact info (mainly my email), and they'll revoke my membership or something stupid ;o)<br/>

I hope to get these carved and planted next week. Thanks!<br/>

Do you know which department was asked? I looked at their website and there's not really a "director". There's a CEO and then various VP's of different departments.<br/>
<br/>
I just sent an email to the VP of Exhibits. Hopefully he'll respond or pass it along to someone else if he's not the right person.<br/>

Thanks for letting me know that permission was given last year. Gives me hope that they'll allow it again this year.<br/>

&gt; To explain this a little further...  the museum was doing a special event in conjunction with an exhibit they were hosting at the time (about dicovery and exploration) and wanted letterboxing to be a part of it so they contacted us to create and plant boxes for their event.  They have very tight security there and I would definitely contact them before trying to place a box randomly.<br/>

&gt; Actually -- the museum contacted us to place boxes there.  I'm not sure they would be so open to place boxes just because.... the security is very high there.<br/>
&gt; You might try contacting volunteer services to start with.<br/>

&gt; Do you know which department was asked? I looked at their website and there's not really a "director". There's a CEO and then various VP's of different departments.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just sent an email to the VP of Exhibits. Hopefully he'll respond or pass it along to someone else if he's not the right person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for letting me know that permission was given last year. Gives me hope that they'll allow it again this year.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The plants were approved by the museum and they have the location of those boxes. I'd check with them before planting and get permission first. Fof6<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I saw clues for 3-4 (?) boxes planted last year during the MAPS exhibit. That gave me the inspiration to plant some this year for the Big Bugs exhibit. Lulu and I were there this past weekend scouting out good hiding spots and coming up with ideas for clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; When you planted yours, did you include your contact info somewhere in the logbook or the box? I normally include that in my plants, but I'm such a fraidy cat and I worry that if the boxes are found by museum staff, they'll somehow figure out who I am by my contact info (mainly my email), and they'll revoke my membership or something stupid ;o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope to get these carved and planted next week. Thanks!<br/>
