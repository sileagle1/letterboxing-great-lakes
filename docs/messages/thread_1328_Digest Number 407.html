I was half expecting to come back from the weekend and find an email from SpringChick asking why I hadn't placed it yet!  I'm trying, I just haven't had enough time to get out this month.  I have the next two days off but no car, so it's questionable that it will get done this week but I'll try.<br/>

I haven't written or posted the clues, but I finally had an opportunity to<br/>
&gt;place the exchange box I received from Pale Puppy Posse.   Stay tuned for<br/>
&gt;the details!<br/>
