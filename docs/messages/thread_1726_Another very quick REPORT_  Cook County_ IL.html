the "Everything" bag.  I enjoyed the clues to this one.  <br>

3.  Forest Hills, in Western Springs.  Splash, you did a nice<br>

Congratulations on placing your first box.<br>

4.  Softball Anyone?! at Springdale Park in Western Springs.  Rather <br>
than finding this box in the hollow of the tree, it was sitting next<br>
to <br>
the tree, out in plain view.  But box was otherwise in fine shape. <br>
So <br>
I gathered up some extra leaves and such to give it more cover. <br>
Obviously a very popular park with the kiddies.  Interesting chain in <br>
the tree. Nice carving by Splash.<br>
<br>
Was also going to go looking for Where's the Springs? in Western <br>
Springs, but the clues said the box is missing already.  Bummer!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Happy boxing Flash!  A loooong time ago a friend asked me to help her<br>
research that tragedy.  And, except for Cirque du Soleil, circuses aren't my<br>
thing at all.  What happened was pretty awful.  I drop by there often to pay<br>
my respects, so I kind of feel it's another home.  I sort of became attached<br>
to the troupe.<br>
<br>
I could picture right where the box was.  Only problem was avoiding any<br>
questioning glances by the maintenance folks.  Had to go find Field of<br>
Dreams and come back because they were working down the road, and even tho<br>
they weren't close, there are areas in a cemetery where people can draw<br>
attention to themselves just by being in those areas.   I've never met<br>
anybody over at Bob Mann Woods -- nobody two-legged that is.  Plenty of deer<br>
there. So went there first and came back.  And maintenance men had gone<br>
elsewhere happydance happydance.<br>
<br>
That'll be a relatively easy one for your friend to get started with.<br>
