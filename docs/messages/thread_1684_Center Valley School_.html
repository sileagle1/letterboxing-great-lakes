Has anyone found the Center Valley School House box lately?  We ran into a bit of difficulty yesterday, seeing as how it looks like they are remodeling the front of the school, so no address or outside lights were visible (needed to count, do math, and get compass bearing).  We looked all along the line of pines (which we THOUGHT could be the only place it could be hidden, but are perhaps wrong) with no luck.  Anyone have any updates on this box?  --Papeseed<br/>

P.S.  If you haven't found "Home of the Hamburger" yet, DON'T try to get it on Burger Fest weekend (this weekend!)  Swarming with people right where it is.  Although we did see something almost as good: a lady with a skirt that had hamburgers all over it!!!<br/>

Hey, Outagamie County sleuths,<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found the Center Valley School House box lately?  We ran into a<br/>
bit of difficulty yesterday, seeing as how it looks like they are remodeling<br/>
the front of the school, so no address or outside lights were visible<br/>
(needed to count, do math, and get compass bearing).  We looked all along<br/>
the line of pines (which we THOUGHT could be the only place it could be<br/>
hidden, but are perhaps wrong) with no luck.  Anyone have any updates on<br/>
this box?  --Papeseed<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  If you haven't found "Home of the Hamburger" yet, DON'T try to get it<br/>
on Burger Fest weekend (this weekend!)   ...<br/>
<br/>
============<br/>
<br/>
We tried for Center Valley today with same result as you - no box!  Searched<br/>
a lot of places besides the trees (including the outhouse!) with no success.<br/>
<br/>
Since we were out of town this weekend, we didn't check email and of course<br/>
looked for the "Home of the Hamburger" box today.  We got to the museum<br/>
early Sunday morning and needed to "buy a ticket".  We didn't see anywhere<br/>
to do this and assumed it was in the museum, which was closed.  No hours<br/>
were posted for the museum, so we didn't even know when we should return.<br/>
We came back mid-afternoon, thinking it might be open then, but it wasn't.<br/>
However, Lo &amp; Behold!, there was now a ticket booth!!!  Turns out the booth<br/>
had been moved to another location for the big "BurgerFest" yesterday (Tire<br/>
tracks in grass led us to this conclusion), but it had now been returned.<br/>
Luckily the "BurgerFest" was only a 1-day event, not the entire weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We attempted to find all 11 boxes in this series today.  As I've already<br/>
mentioned, we had no luck at Center Valley School.  We also couldn't find<br/>
anything for "Play Ball", even though we were pretty sure we were at the<br/>
right spot.  We did manage to find the other 9, but some were definitely a<br/>
challenge!!<br/>
<br/>
We had a busy and very enjoyable boxing weekend.  Found 2 boxes in Manitowoc<br/>
on Friday night on our way north.  On Saturday we found many of the replica<br/>
boxes Dragon placed in Door County and Green Bay and also found all the<br/>
boxes Papeseed has placed in Green Bay &amp; De Pere.  Sunday we did the<br/>
Outagamie Historical Series plus a couple of others.  Fun. fun, fun!  Thanks<br/>
to all of you who plant boxes!<br/>

Luckily, we had our data from the first attempt. The box is in a good <br/>
place: obvious, but not obvious.<br/>
