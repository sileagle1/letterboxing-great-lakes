I went out today to do some spring cleaning of my boxes.  A few I<br>
pulled so I could put wood backings on the stamps (now that I'm<br>
profficient at it).  They should be back in action by Monday.  The<br>
following boxes are temporarilly unavailable:<br>
<br>
Watery Grave<br>
Sqwished Pennies<br>
