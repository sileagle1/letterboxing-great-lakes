  I don't know how many people are into boxing in the colder weather, however, just a heads up here.  This box is very near the area where the explosion was in Milwaukee today.  I'm guessing that there will be limited access in the area for awhile, I'm not sure how long the cleanup is going to take and how soon I'll be able to get in and check on it.  I think that it should be ok, but figured I'd rather let people know in advance.<br/>
