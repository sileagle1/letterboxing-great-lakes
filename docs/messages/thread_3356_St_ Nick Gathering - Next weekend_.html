It will be homemade chili, but if anyone wants to bring a can of chili along to toss in the pot if things start running low, that might be one idea of something easy to bring.  Also, if anyone has any favorite chili toppings, feel free to bring them along.  We'll be bringing 3 boxes of saltine crackers and some crushed red pepper along, because that's what we usually have with our chili.

And I don't know how many outlets there are around the shelter, but <br/>
does anyone think an electric heater would help?<br/>
