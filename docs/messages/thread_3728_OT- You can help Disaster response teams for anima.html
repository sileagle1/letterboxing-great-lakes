<br/>
What if Tri-State CART earned a penny every time you searched the Internet?  <br/>
Well, now we can!<br/>
<br/>
GoodSearch.com is a new search engine that donates ad revenue, about a penny per search, to the charity its users designate.  Use it just like any search engine, and it's powered by Yahoo!, so you get the same great results.   <br/>
<br/>
Just go to www.goodsearch.com and enter "Tri-State CART" as the organization you want to support in the lower box on the page.  When you click "verify" it will come up as "Tri State CART County Animal Response Teams (Harrison OH)" And you're ready to go!   <br/>
<br/>
Our disaster response group for animals will get money every time you use Goodsearch as your search engine!<br/>
<br/>
Just 500 of us searching four times a day will raise about $7300 in a year without anyone spending a dime!  Please spread the word! <br/>
<br/>
Optional:  download the GoodSearch toolbar - http://www.goodsearch.com/toolbars.aspx<br/>
<br/>
Please help us earn more money by sending this email to all your friends! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for your support of CART! <br/>
