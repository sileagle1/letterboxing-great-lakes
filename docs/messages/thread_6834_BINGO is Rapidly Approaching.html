Maybe they think they used up their luck last year?<br>

package anyways.  :-)  I'm hoping to soon post our bingo cards online <br>
again this year so you can see Mysterina's and Mysteryas' artwork for <br>
the bingo squares.<br>
<br>
For now, I need to get back to work on Clue Tracker...<br>
<br>
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and let the bingo begin!<br>
