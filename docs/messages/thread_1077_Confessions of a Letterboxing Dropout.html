It's a sad, sad story, but it's true, and I can't keep it inside any <br/>
longer.  After four months without a new stamp in my logbook or even <br/>

world and, more importantly, to myself: <br/>
<br/>
I've become a LETTERBOXING DROPOUT.  <br/>
<br/>
Sure, I have plenty of excuses.  My car's been too crappy to leave <br/>
town with.  It's been a particularly nasty winter.  I had a breast <br/>
cancer fundraiser/belly dance show to plan.  And now, to top it all <br/>
off, I just found out that the one and only box I've ever planted <br/>
myself was vandalized beyond repair by forest rodents!  Talk about a <br/>
motivation buster.<br/>
<br/>
So I need to know: is there a Letterboxing GED Program?  The old <br/>
excuses are gone.  I've finally done some big repair work on my car <br/>
(still wouldn't drive it more than 2 hours), the thaw is definitely <br/>
coming, and the show was incredibly successful, but it's over.  I <br/>
want back in!  I just need to find the motivation, the inspiration, <br/>
the downright puzzle-solving need to do so.  Won't someone reach out <br/>
a hand, pull me up out of the despair, and pass me a clue?  I can't <br/>
let those furry critters keep me down!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had to smile when I read this.  The first winter that I was 'boxing, I felt the same way -- I was determined not to let snow or ice or freezing fingers stop me from getting my letterboxing fix!  After sliding around on the icy Mt. Baldy (Saugatuck, MI) steps in January, I concluded I was certifiably insane -- for those not familiar, there are 286 or some steep, rickety wooden steps to get to the top of this huge sand dune where the letterbox hunt takes place.  But as I was between jobs and had the time, I continued to brave snowstorms in search of letterboxes that winter.  I was glad when spring came around, but as I had been actively boxing all along, I noticed I didn't appreciate it with the same enthusiasm as some who had waited the winter out and were starving for a 'boxing adventure.<br/>
<br/>
The past two years as fall faded into winter I felt myself ready for a break and took a hiatus from active 'boxing.  I've still carved a bit and have laid out plans for several new boxes/series, I even went out hiking a few times and checked on some of my snow-buried, hibernating boxes, but haven't really had a passion to get out and grab a new box.  And now as spring draws near, I feel the excitement coming back.<br/>
<br/>
So for me, the winter hiatus is a good thing.  I find that the brief period of rest makes me hungrier and more enthusiastic once spring returns -- and they promise me that it will, even though all of the Easter eggs will be buried in snow banks in West Michigan this year.<br/>
