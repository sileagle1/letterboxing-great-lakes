Sunnysideup had indeed found... and sent my glasses - they looked perfect after their 2 week stay in the wild!  "Frankenstein" must have realized he couldn't see any better with them and tossed them back right where he found them.<br/>
It is such a relief to no longer be visually impaired!<br/>
Much thanks from a very happy and grateful Tiptoe!<br/>
