Secondly, I have a question on listing boxes, as I have never sent boxes to be planted at a gathering before.  While they will be planted in MI for this weekend, they will make their way home to me eventually to be re-planted around here.  I would think it would be good to list them sooner than later, since many people like to record their finds.  So, do I list them now (and update them with clues when they are replanted)?  Or do the event hosts list them--but if they do, how do I relist them when I plant them around here?  <br/>
