  cool topic for discussion. How did everyone choose their trail names? <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My trailname came from a mix of my love for both gardening and genealogy.  Pape was my maiden name (pronounced the German way, like "poppy").  Hence, Papeseed has a double meaning!  My new personal stamp is of a poppy flower.<br/>
<br/>
My husband Mike has begun using the trailname Triclops.  No, his stamp is not of a 3-eyed monster.  The three "eyes" of his Triclops are actually 3 letter "i's" that stand for:<br/>
Intelligence, Individuality, and Imagination -- three things that he values.  He is still working on a design for his new personal stamp.<br/>
<br/>
As for our 5-yr old son, Escher...he is too young to decide on trailname yet.  But his name is pretty unique anyway... so maybe people think it IS a trailname (and yes, he is named after M.C. Escher).<br/>
<br/>
Being new to this list and letterboxing, I appreciate this thread of discussion, as I'm curious how others have chosen their trailnames.  I'm going to try to access the archived posts, but not exactly sure how to do it.  --Papeseed<br/>

  My "spirit animal", or totem if you wish, is the coyote.  The coyote is a trickster in native american lore, so I do love solving riddles and clues to find boxes.  I have a tattoo of a coyote on my right shoulder with a spirit line (an arrow) on it.  <br/>
<br/>
  When I started my newest business, a small dog biscuit bakery, I used a variation of my tattoo as the logo.  The spitit line is shorter, and curves into a smile.<br/>
<br/>
  So for my trail name I chose "Laughing Coyote" and my stamp is a variation between my tattoo and the logo for my bakery business.<br/>
