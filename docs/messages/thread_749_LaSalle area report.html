&gt; Hi All!  Happy Sunday!  Acorn, myself (grapevine girl, monet mama,<br/>
and carfreek) left your HH at Grumpy's.  I can't remember where  we<br/>
picked it up, Either little red schoolhouse or at starved rock.  I<br/>
think it was supposed to go west, but we didn't read ahead.  Felt<br/>
bad, but got it to our next location so we could get it moved along. <br/>
Unfortunately, he's done a little backtracking, but the cinnamon ice<br/>
cream at Grumpy's made it all ok.!   Grapevine Girl  :)<br/>

Hi Grapevine Girl,<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't need to go anywhere in particular, so there's nothing to feel bad <br/>
about.  Glad you found it.<br/>
<br/>
Team Taco and I released the HH in Dragon's honor and in appreciation for <br/>
his services to letterboxing.  While it's good sometimes to have a HH travel far <br/>
and wide, for this particular HH it's sort of nice to have it make the rounds <br/>
among those who appreciate The Dragon here in the Midwest.<br/>
<br/>
As a point of history, Team Taco was very clever about disseminating the <br/>
clues for this hitchhiker initially.  The hitchhiker was placed at the Great Lakes <br/>
Gathering, which the Dragon organized, this summer.  The crafty Team Taco <br/>
wrote mysterious "Mathman" clues (the Dragon has a series of the same <br/>
name in Wisconsin).  At the campground before the gathering, never having <br/>
met the Dragon, they recognized him.  Don't ask me how, it must have been a <br/>
special letterboxers' sixth sense.  Anyway, they placed the clues under his <br/>
windshield wiper while he was in the camp store.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon is pretty wily.  Did he tear off in hot pursuit of this mysterious box, <br/>
a box that used his series name?  No.  Team Taco and I are all rather <br/>
impatient, so they put another set of clues on his windshield the next day <br/>
during the gathering. Maybe the first one blew away?  Nothing.  It wasn't until <br/>
after the gathering that the Dragon found the time to search for this box.  I <br/>
suppose it serves us right for thinking we were being so sneaky.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone finds the Dragon HH, be sure to write your appreciation.  He is one <br/>
of the pioneers of southern Wisconsin letterboxing and one of the inspirations <br/>
that letterboxing has bloomed here in northern Illinois.<br/>
