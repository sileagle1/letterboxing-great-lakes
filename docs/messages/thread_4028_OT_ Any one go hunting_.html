one know of any around SE MI? I think they got to be coming up this <br/>
weekend. It has been 60-70 degrees and not below 40 degrees at night. <br/>
I have never had a morel before but my husband said their to die for. <br/>
I really hope that I get a chance to find some. I love all the neat <br/>
new plants coming up in spring. If your out LBing take the time out to <br/>
identify some of these flowers, you would be amazed at what kind of <br/>
wildflowers grow here (orchids even)! Happy hunting this weekend looks <br/>
like a nice one! Maybe next year we can have a morel mushroom <br/>
gathering, and fry up some mushrooms at the end of the day.<br/>
