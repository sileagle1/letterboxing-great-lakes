Better late than never right? :-)  I had such good intentions of hand making cards this year, but kept putting it off for more pressing things and then it was too late.  I know I won't have time this month to do them either. So, next best thing, a late email with a photo of "our Pack" that I just took today before the tree comes down.<br>
<br>
Probably the last Christmas with our Rottweiler because he's 13 and his age is really showing, but he doesn't act ready to go yet. :-)<br>
<br>
I hope your holiday (which ever one you celebrate) was joyous and that your 2007 is healthy, happy, creative and prosperous.<br>

Look at the wee doggie with the pointy ears! Oh! I just want to<br>
squeeeeze him...oh! so cute!<br>
<br>
What a lovely family!<br>
<br>
See now, next time, just make this digital file, print out a few<br>
copies and mail. All done! :-)<br>
<br>
I like to make my own cards too -- I collect Christmas cards from<br>
people that they are going to toss/recycle, cut them up and reuse the<br>
images on new card backs the next fall. It's fun and low stress.<br>
<br>
Except this year. Too tired, too busy!<br>
