a lot of them get lost and maybe the placer would really appreciate hearing<br/>
about this box.  Since this is not big letterboxing country, it may not get<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My faux pas was literally a "false step."  I had a day off last <br/>
November, and despite the gray, chilly, windy day I was <br/>
exhilarated to be letterboxing.  Although I was far from home and <br/>
had never been to the site before, I had done my homework, and <br/>
I could visualize where the first of the boxes on my list must be.<br/>
<br/>
When I got to my destination, I was a little dismayed to find that it <br/>
must be in that old tree that had fallen into the river.  That <br/>
Tupperware must be great stuff.  Hmmm. . . no convenient <br/>
overhanging branches for support, but I wasn't about to wimp <br/>
out.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, you know what happened.  After my false step, I waded <br/>
through the thankfully shallow water, through the frustratingly <br/>
deep and sticky mud, and up the riverbank to the dry trail.<br/>
<br/>
Despite being wet to the thighs on a cold and windy day,  I went <br/>
on to find more boxes that day. Later, I found I was entirely on the <br/>
wrong track with the first box, but was one of the most entirely <br/>
happy letterboxing days I have enjoyed. <br/>

Happy trails from a wetter but wiser,<br/>

sand dunes, and clues (and, what-the-heck-*are*-clues, anyway??), we <br/>
finally found the box. We were very, very happy; it was, after all, <br/>
the very first letterbox we'd ever even seen. With nothing with which <br/>

I have subsequently listed it as one of our favorite finds because it <br/>
was first.<br/>
<br/>
The second TOTW moment involves the always hoped-for meeting of <br/>
another boxer on the trail. (Ah, the elusive exchange in the wild). <br/>
I'd just read a thread on this subject and had wondered about how <br/>
might I know if another hiker was a letterboxer. The usual <br/>
accoutrements were likely to be the tip-offs. But what to say to be <br/>
certain**? Hmmm.<br/>
<br/>
I was doing a little box maintenance and scouting for another site <br/>
for a  plant when, lo and behold, on the trail approaching me, with a <br/>
sheet of paper visibly in her hand, came a solo young woman. I was <br/>
just sure she was a letterboxer, so I said in my best, cheery, and <br/>
friendly voice, "Are you looking for something?" <br/>
She looked at me with a steely aloofness and said, "no" and kept <br/>
right on walking past me * briskly, I'd say.<br/>
I was left with the clear impression that she wanted nothing to do <br/>
with a "friendly" guy in the woods.<br/>
It wasn't until awhile later down the trail that I met her husband <br/>
and young child and all of the pieces fell together. I think when he <br/>
saw my compass he knew what was what. She showed up shortly and after <br/>
an awkward moment, we all recognized that we were in the same game.<br/>
<br/>
I know that there are suspected apocryphal versions of that story <br/>
going around, but this one is true.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah yes, the "so-so" clues.  Deedle &amp; I fell pray to that misnomer on our first box hunt.  We never found the box, being the inexperienced boxers we were.  There were too many trees and hills and turns to determine which were the trees and hills and turns we _really_ wanted, and much grumbling about these darn vague clues and how _our_ clues when we finally planted boxes would be much clearer ;)  Now, however, with almost a dozen finds under our belts (in our backpacks?) we realize how the clues that we grumbled were so tricky for those first few boxes we found were actually absolutely wonderfully written, and after doing some research on the park where that first elusive box was planted have plans for attempt two sometime in the near future.  <br/>
<br/>
As for a faux pas, our biggest vice is learning how to NOT do the "happy happy joy joy we found it!" dance _quite_ so noticeably.  We're working on it... <br/>
<br/>
And embarrassing moment...more like most sudden mood swing while letterboxing.  We were trapsing through the woods along a bridal path.  We weren't quite sure from the directions wether to go in one direction or the other, so Deedle finally chose.  It had rained the day before, so the bridal path was muddy, and we got to a point where it was _very_ muddy.  But we were determined, so we sloshed through the mud and, well, other stuff (remember, it was a bridal trail).  We finally got through the muck (after it almost sucked off my sneaker), walked a little further, and realized that we had gone in the wrong direction.  To get back to where we came from, Deedle started to lead me through the woods along an unofficial dirt path so we could avoid the muck.  After about 15 minutes and no site of meeting back up with the bridal trail, my temper started up.  I was tired, I was thirsty (we didn't think to bring water with us, doh!) and I really needed to use a bathroom.  I started to snap at<br/>
 Deedle, Deedle started to get offended, and then we finally met up with the bridal trail.  We pulled out the clues to regroup, and as we read the clues realized that we had walked right past where the letterbox was hidden, we had just come from the wrong direction!  Snappishness led way to much hugging, kissing, and the "happy happy joy joy we're going to find it" dance from yours truly as we went back the way we had just come, no longer lost but now knowing exactly what we were doing ;)<br/>

Hines Park is a long stretch of land through which Hines Drive runs.  Along it are little parks in a continuous stream.  Scouting for sites for a BRILLIANT series idea I had ("Bike the Park", where each stamp was a different part of the bike, and you stamped them in such a way to form a finished machine at the end.  It would have been awesome- but I digress), I dragged husband and child along to the first potential site on my list.  Ken and Lotus waited in the car, while I traipsed through the bush to see what I could see.  <br/>
I found some excellent boxing sites.  Really.  However, judging from the gang graffiti and other various objects of unsavory character left behind, someone else had found it first.  <br/>
<br/>
Ug, I think, and wade my way back to the car. <br/>
<br/>
 Once there I see a frantic and wild-eyed husband, sending me surreptitious signals to GET MY BUTT BACK IN THE CAR- NOW! <br/>
Apparently, right before I disappeared into the brush, another car pulled up, and a rather rough-looking man got out.  He started walking into the brush carrying a package, saw me, stopped, and began pacing back and forth.  As soon as I emerged from the brush, the man, package in hand, went in.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to think he was a letterboxer, too, on his way to plant a new box, but paired with the type of litter I saw in the woods, I'm guessing he wasn't.<br/>
So there's my faux pas that almost was- leading letterboxers into gang turf/potential drug drop off site.  Charming, huh?<br/>

anyone who has looked for it knows, you end up pushing your way into a lot <br/>

lot of cherry thickets, many four or five times each.   Turns out <br/>
the  thickets provide privacy for all sorts of activities that require some <br/>
privacy.  There were lots of men wondering in and out of the same <br/>
thickets.  And sometimes when I pushed my way in, the thicket was <br/>
uninhabited, but piles of clothes suggested that they recently had been <br/>
inhabited by people who didn't need all their clothes.  It took me an awful <br/>
long time to figure this out.  In the meantime, I couldn't understand why <br/>
all those men were looking so suspiciously at me and why they didn't just <br/>
leave so I could look for my letterbox in peace.   Ah yes, urban letterboxing.<br/>

&gt; This week's topic -- what was your funniest letterboxing faux pas?<br/>
<br/>
I was after "Eternal Flame" in Western New York.  I won't spoil it by<br/>
saying exactly what The Eternal Flame is, but if you ever get the<br/>
chance to go for this box, do it!  I went through half a roll of film<br/>
in less than two minutes!  <br/>
<br/>
The directions said, "Follow the blue trail, until you get to 'The<br/>
Eternal Flame', you'll know it when you see it..."  Okay, I followed<br/>
the blue-arrow marked trail, and followed, and followed , and<br/>
followed...  After what seemed an incredibly long hike, I found The<br/>
Eternal Flame, went through half my film, stamped in, and started back.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, I had started late in the afternoon.  This was not my first box<br/>
of the day.  The sun was already setting, and my wife was waiting for<br/>
me at our car at the start of the trail.  I started hiking back up the<br/>
trail, following the blue arrows the wrong way when I came into a<br/>
large, open clearing!  One I had *not* passed on the way in!  Examing<br/>
the blue arrow more closely, I realized that the blue trail and the<br/>
green trail crossed somewhere and I was now following the wrong trail<br/>
out.  Thinking about it for a minute, I decided to continue following<br/>
the trail out rather than going deeper into the woods in fading light<br/>
and trying to find my mistake.  I came out at the start of the green<br/>
trail, well after dark and nearly four miles from my car!  It was an<br/>
interesting hike and my wife was very grateful to see me.<br/>
