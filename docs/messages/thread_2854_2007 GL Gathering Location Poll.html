volunteers for hosting the 2007 GL Gathering to be held on Saturday, <br>
June 2, 2007.<br>
<br>
I have created a poll for group members to choose between these two <br>
locations.  To access the poll, go to the group online and click on <br>
*polls* in the left-hand navigation menu.  Each group member may <br>
vote one time.  You can change your vote at any time before the poll <br>
closes on August 31, 2006.  At the end of the month, the location <br>
that receives the most votes will be chosen as the host location.<br>
<br>
A huge thanks goes to both of the letterboxers who have stepped <br>
forward and volunteered to host the gathering.  This is a big <br>
undertaking, but surely a rewarding one.  I know I am not alone when <br>
I say that past gathering hosts are more than happy to answer <br>
questions as you plan the event.  We have been fortunate to have had <br>
several outstanding events over the past few years and it is <br>
certainly something we look forward to each June.<br>
<br>
Good luck to Minnesota and Ohio!<br>
