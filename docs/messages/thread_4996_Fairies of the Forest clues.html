                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was a great event. It was our first and we had lots of fun and LOVED meeting the people we read about on this group. Opposite of others, we spent too much time having fun meeting everyone and not much time out on the trail! Oops. We didn't end up finding the one box we set out for, but we are planning on coming back on anothercamping trip. We did find one at Ionia State Park later that day (that's where we camped for the weekend).<br/>
The stamp was beautiful, the park was absolutely incredible (perfect for the theme)! Thank you for all of your hard work, Familyof6! <br/>
We do have one suggestion...have a couple of boxes geared towards the younger crowd. Our kids love to help, but the clues were too hard for them to follow and they ended up getting bored. It would be great to have a couple easier boxes for them to break up their day.<br/>
BTW, we spent today at the Public Museum. We didn't get there until 1 hour/45 minutes till closing. We were SOOOOO close to getting all 4, but we were kicked out at 5:05. We were looking for our paycheck!!! How long do we have to get back there before it's gone?<br/>
Glad you're feeling better, Familyof6! Thank you to everyone for helping us through our first event! We truly enjoyed meeting you all!<br/>
Looking forward to the next one,<br/>
The K Crew<br/>

it was a great gathering - I'm sorry you weren't feeling better so you <br/>
could enjoy it more.  Thanks so much for all your efforts.  It was a <br/>
great way to get the letterboxing season started, and I got to meet <br/>
some new people as well as seeing some old friends.  You picked a <br/>
wonderful park - very pretty and quite isolated.  Thanks again for a <br/>
great event!<br/>

Dear Familyof6,<br/>
<br/>
Lunagirl and I had a great time at the event.  I usually can't get her <br/>
to go more than 1/4 mile without complaining, but we went a good three <br/>
or four miles on Saturday.  The stamps were beautiful, too.<br/>
<br/>
As as for the clues, although we didn't find, or even attempt, all of <br/>
them, I wouldn't say they were too difficult, but maybe some pace <br/>
numbers or compass readings would have helped.  For instance, our group <br/>
found three or four possible trees by the road, depending on where you <br/>
would have crossed the river, and at least three instances of a rock, a <br/>
a "three", and an arrow or spear, or whatever it was, including one <br/>
outside the park boundaries.  anyway, i know our group had a lot of fun <br/>
tracking down the boxes.  Thanks again for a great event!<br/>
<br/>
