As a school secretary, my mom gets a lot of school supply catalogs.  <br/>
The other day she received one from Dick Blick in Galesburg, <br/>
Illinois.  They have 1 1/2" x 1 1/2" Staetdler carving material <br/>
squares that come in a class pack of 27 squares.  These are great for <br/>
carving stamps for those of you who haven't used them yet.   <br/>
<br/>
Also, Kroger's had some clear plastic containers with lids that had a <br/>
rubber gasket seal on them for sale at 69 cents with the Kroger <br/>
Card.  I picked up about 10 of them for future plantings.   <br/>
