                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am sad. I have turned many ambulance crews on to The<br>
Paw during our trips to Loyola Medical Center.   <br>
<br>
As far as the Matheissen gathering goes, I am still<br>
talking with IDNR to secure the necessary permits. <br>
Let me give you a brief synopsis of working with a<br>
state agency:<br>
<br>
Another civic group I belong to held a Bike Ride along<br>
the I & M canal for Habitat for Humanity.   Well, the<br>
paperwork was filed and we got approved.   The day of<br>
the race a Dept. of Conservation pulled up and asked<br>
one of our checkpoints what they were doing.   The CP<br>
informed them of the bike ride and we were told we<br>
woudl have to cease operations as we did not secure<br>
the permit.   We told them we had the permits.   Well<br>
after researching, Dept. of Conservation sent the<br>
permits to the Morris office and not the Utica office,<br>
who cared for the I & M section we were using.   <br>
<br>
So I am trying to make sure all the ducks are in a row<br>
before I put out an actual gathering announcement.   <br>
