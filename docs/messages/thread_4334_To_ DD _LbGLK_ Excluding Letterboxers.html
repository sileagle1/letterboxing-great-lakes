Usually the gathering event planners will post the boxes as event boxes rather than traditional boxes.  You can always ask around at a gathering.  "FIND" counts aren't necessary; some people count and some don't.  Just have fun.  I once thought that clues with a find count minimum was the way to go to restrict newbies, but I've rethought that idea.  Boxes need to be challenging and the placement needs to be more carefully thought out.  Then, there still needs to be some fast and easy boxes for beginners, or experienced letterboxers who just 'need' a quick fix....so to speak.  LOL!  <br/>
<br/>
Working on new boxes this week.  Watch the postings.<br/>

  Wow, I didn't know that on AQ you could restrict people looking at <br/>
  your clues by the amout of finds a person has. Good to know. May be I <br/>
  should log my finds. I just log my finds on LBNA. How do you log finds <br/>
  that you find at a Gathering?<br/>
