Hi! There are a lot of boxes here in CT, you are correct, but I've never found any blindfolded or behind my back. Maybe you have started a new boxing trend for us here in CT!<br/>

All kidding aside, I must say I'm in awe of how many boxes you CT <br/>
folks have.  You've probably been asked this before, but...  why do <br/>
you think the sport has taken such strong root in your home state?  <br/>

Kind of a symbiotic relationship that really fosters the growth of this pastime. You are correct - we are most fortunate here. Now, I hope I have enticed you all to visit. And - if you do, contact me offline and I would love to meet and box with you all and maybe arrange a little gathering!<br/>
That's another thing we do well in CT - we'll have a gather at the drop of a hat!<br/>

I'd go back to the Pacific Northwest, in a heartbeat! In Feb, I was <br/>
in Portland, OR on business for a week. In the 2 days of free time I <br/>
had available, I was able to meet some really terrific local boxers <br/>
who helped me do some power-boxing; there are more boxes in the <br/>
Portland area than in the entire state of Mich, I think! (grin) <br/>
These wonderful friends also took me on a couple of fantastic hikes <br/>
through old-growth forest... amazing, breath-taking, awe-inspiring <br/>
and I didn't get nearly enough time to indulge in exploration! <br/>
<br/>
2) In the world? Why would you choose to go to that particular area?<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh... tough one.  I think it's a toss up between Dartmoor and <br/>
Costa Rica.  Dartmoor because well, HISTORY and Costa Rica <br/>
because ... one word: sailing! (grin)  <br/>

Without telling my answer to him, I just asked Bindle Bum and he <br/>

Speaking of "rigorous hiking"...if you ever happen to travel down <br/>
toward the Shenandoah valley, you MUST check out a letterbox that is <br/>
in the Shenandoah National Park!  It's called the "Bear Fence <br/>
Letterbox", and is located at Mile 55 in the park, at the Bear Fence <br/>
Rock Scramble.  This hike is AWESOME...It takes you up and down <br/>
twisty paths and huge boulders, and exposes you to mountain views <br/>
that take your breath away!  The terrain made it a challenge, but not <br/>
to the point of wanting to give up...and finding the letterbox was <br/>
such a thrill.  It was planted by a young couple in the spot where he <br/>
proposed marriage to her  (romantic, huh?).  This was--hands down-- <br/>
the very best hike I have ever taken in my entire life.<br/>

plan an excursion to Shenandoah in the near future -- besides of course, the<br/>
breathtaking views and history.  Thanks for the recommend!<br/>

&gt; Speaking of "rigorous hiking"...if you ever happen to travel down<br/>
&gt; toward the Shenandoah valley, you MUST check out a letterbox that is<br/>
&gt; in the Shenandoah National Park!  It's called the "Bear Fence<br/>
&gt; Letterbox", and is located at Mile 55 in the park, at the Bear Fence<br/>
&gt; Rock Scramble.  This hike is AWESOME...It takes you up and down<br/>
&gt; twisty paths and huge boulders, and exposes you to mountain views<br/>
&gt; that take your breath away!  The terrain made it a challenge, but not<br/>
&gt; to the point of wanting to give up...and finding the letterbox was<br/>
&gt; such a thrill.  It was planted by a young couple in the spot where he<br/>
&gt; proposed marriage to her  (romantic, huh?).  This was--hands down-- <br/>
&gt; the very best hike I have ever taken in my entire life.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; This week's TOTW asks where would you go if you had the<br/>
&gt; &gt; opportunity<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to take a letterboxing trip anywhere in the US?  In the world?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why would you choose to go to that particular area?<br/>
