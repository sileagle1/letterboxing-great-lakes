Lock sandwich size boxes already lowered to .99 each!!  I bought all <br>
the ones (7) at our local one 4 days ago, and yesterday, there were <br>
more on the shelf today!  They may not be the same price in your area <br>
yet, but they should be at least 10% off , stated by the store manager.<br>

Just a heads up if this is your favorite box!!<br>
