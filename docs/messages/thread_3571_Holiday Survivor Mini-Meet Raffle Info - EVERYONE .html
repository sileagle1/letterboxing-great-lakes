order to avoid breaking our agreement with the library on taking<br/>
collections/donations.<br/>
<br/>
Prizes include:<br/>
* Set of LePlume II Brush Markers<br/>
* 3 Great Lakes Regional patches<br/>
* Telescopic walking stick (courtesy of MRSHAT)<br/>
* Centrifuge tubes [great for microboxes] (courtesy of Katy)<br/>
* $25 BP Gas Card (courtesy of Basket Case)<br/>
<br/>
- All proceeds will be sent to the administrators of the LBNA website<br/>
to help defray their costs.<br/>
<br/>
- One person will be designated the ticket holder.<br/>
<br/>
- At 3 times during the meet (currently 1:30, 2:30, and 3:15), the<br/>
ticket holder will announce they are either "Going Outside" or "Going<br/>
to Lincoln Square".  They will then head over to where they announced<br/>
and will sell tickets.<br/>
<br/>
- Tickets will be $1 each and will get you one chance to win a prize.<br/>
<br/>
- Each prize will have a container in front of it for tickets.  Place<br/>
the tickets in the container for the prize you wish to win, this will<br/>
eliminate people possibly winning something they aren't interested in.<br/>
 On the flip side, if there are two prizes you want to win, you will<br/>
need to buy at least 2 tickets, one for each prize.<br/>
<br/>
- You can improve your chances of winning an item by putting more than<br/>
1 ticket in it's container.<br/>
<br/>
- The drawing for the raffle will happen around 3:30.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, here's an exciting twist to the auction that is open to all<br/>
members of the Great Lakes group, and anyone else you know who isn't<br/>
on the group.  There will be one item up for raffle that is open to<br/>
everyone:<br/>
<br/>
**** A copy of Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips 2006 ****<br/>
<br/>
This is a slightly used copy (still in excellent condition).  My<br/>
stupidity can be someone's gain.  I thought I had lost this program so<br/>
I went out and bought the 2007 copy, then found my 2006 copy when I<br/>
got home from Best Buy.  I'd had the intention of returning it, but<br/>
have since lost the receipt, so I'm going to keep it.  Which means I<br/>
now have a copy of MS S&amp;T 2006 that I don't need.  Here's the details<br/>
for this one.<br/>
<br/>
- One ticket costs $1 and gets your 1 chance to win this prize.<br/>
<br/>
- For those not attending the Mini-Meet, I will be accepting PayPal<br/>
payments for the tickets (minimum 3 tickets if purchased by PayPal to<br/>
cover the PayPal fees and any shipping costs for the prize).  Requests<br/>
for PayPal purchase are to be made to me through e-mail at<br/>
lcoil79@insightbb.com   I will need a valid e-mail address to send you<br/>
a transfer request.  I will also need your Trail Name to write on the<br/>
tickets.<br/>
<br/>
- Once payment is received, your name will be placed on each ticket<br/>
purchased and that ticket will be placed into the container for the MS<br/>
S&amp;T prize.<br/>
<br/>
- If you are completely against using PayPal I will accept payments by<br/>
cash or money order(preferred).  But it needs to be in my hands by<br/>
Saturday, as such mailing by Monday is advised.  I will not be<br/>
responsible for cash lost in the mail or for mail that doesn't reach<br/>
me before the Saturday deadline.  The address for mailed payments is<br/>
at the end of this post.  If you are sending me payment by mail,<br/>
please e-mail me and let me know so that I can keep an eye on the mail<br/>
for it, stuff tends to sit for a couple of days if I'm not expecting<br/>
it (much to Kimono Girl's dismay).<br/>
<br/>
- Upon request, a picture of your tickets can be provided to prove<br/>
your name has been thrown in to the running.  After the drawing, all<br/>
names for the prize will be logged and signed by at least two other<br/>
attendees as proof of who had how many tickets, kind of a backup<br/>
verification so you'll know things are fair.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and remember it's for a good cause, our continued ability<br/>
to find clues to letterboxes across the country.  Have fun.<br/>
