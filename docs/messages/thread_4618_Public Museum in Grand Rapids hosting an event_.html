                    <div class="plaintext-content">I noticed it just today.  It especially caught my attention because of the e-mail address of the contact person, as she has the same last name as my mother's maiden name -- did she give you her first name?  I e-mailed her this afternoon, but haven't heard back.  I might be interested in participating -- it kind of depends on what she is looking to do -- the focus, etc.  I am a little uncomfortable with the combined letterboxing/geocaching intent that she mentioned to you.  On the other hand -- it's kind of like a newspaper article -- once somebody has decided to do it, it may be better to join them in hopes of having an influence in the right direction.<br/>
