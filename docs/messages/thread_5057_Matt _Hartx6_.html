We're all hoping that the surgery went well and that Matt is out of <br/>
pain. I never like to hear when friends are struggling with medical <br/>
issues.  Then, the bills come later. I hope Matt is resting today.  <br/>
Tell him I hope he feels better soon and that he's back on the trails <br/>
soon. <br/>

<br/>
Yesterday morning was a traumatic one to say the least. I was going in to  <br/>
have 1 kidney stone romoved... after surgery I found out the Doctor went back in <br/>
 and out 4 more times to get 4 large stones out of my right kidney (I still <br/>
have  about 5 stones in my left kidney... but he only operates on one side or <br/>
the  other).<br/>
<br/>
I now have a stint that runs from my bladder up to my kidney that they will  <br/>
have to go in after and remove next Tuesday at 4 pm.... the exact time TTT &amp;  <br/>
SHH are scheduled to meet with me :-( :-( I am so bummed it looks like our <br/>
meet  will be ruined -- though I still have my fingers crossed that slight <br/>
variations  in time will mean we can still meet up.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, this stint he is removing on Tuesday normally stays in an entire  <br/>
week -- Thurs. -- that's the day we leave for MN!!! The doc doesn't want to  <br/>
remove it the day before incase "something goes wrong". (gee thanks).<br/>
<br/>
I'm definitively hurting in the nether regions, and walk like an old man  <br/>
(for all who have witnessed Martini Man on the trail.... well, that's what I  <br/>
look like LOL). <br/>
<br/>
Pray Tuesday goes well and that the soreness goes away..... soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
