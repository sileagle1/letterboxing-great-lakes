The SW side of Chicago isn't known for mega art supply stores.  I was an art student in HS and college, and I use to live on the SW side near Midway Airport.  It was difficult to find quality art supplies.  I use to buy my supplies at The Flax Company in the loop.  It's gone now.  But Hobby Lobby seems to carry a good supply now.  Check them out.  <br/>
<br/>
If you place boxes on the SW side of Chicago, I'll be heading back that direction and I'll look for them. <br/>

  I'm over an hour SW of Chicago and "carving wasteland" is a generous <br/>
  description. I just ordered stuff from Dick Blick Art Supply online.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the suggestion.  The Hobby Lobby that I looked at a couple <br/>
of days ago had nothing, but there is more than one.  I've had good <br/>
luck at Blick online.<br/>
<br/>
I guess by SW of Chicago I meant far SW suburbs.  Newark is about 75 <br/>
minutes from downtown.  Sorry for the confusion.<br/>

I do have eight boxes sitting on the table waiting to be planted when <br/>
it's not so blasted hot out!<br/>
