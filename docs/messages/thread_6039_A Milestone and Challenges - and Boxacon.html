I did meet my challenges - much earlier than expected, I might add.<br>
<br>
In my attempt to plant the Simak box for Boxacon, I accidentally found the Heinlein box.  Great minds think alike, right?  I ended up in a completely different area than I expected to as the park workers were doing lots of work on one trail, including laying lots of chips.  By the way, does anyone know the significance of the cairns I saw in the park?  Does those indicate a box is or will be planted in that area?  On a previous trip to the same park, I saw another type of marker frequently - tree limbs laid up against trailside trees, with rocks at the base.  <br>

No, I don't think I'll be racing through the boxes - though I will want to try to get everyone.  There's ALOT on that list.  Am I reading right that some may be permanent?  That'd take some pressure off.  I'll try to refrain from going to the park to check out likely hiding places - SPORs, SPOLs*, SPOBs**,etc.  That won't be a problem since I am such a goody-two-shoes - but I've got to say that some of the appeal of letterboxing is the secretiveness, stealth and getting away with something.  :)<br>
