I did meet my challenges - much earlier than expected, I might add.<br/>
<br/>
In my attempt to plant the Simak box for Boxacon, I accidentally found the Heinlein box.  Great minds think alike, right?  I ended up in a completely different area than I expected to as the park workers were doing lots of work on one trail, including laying lots of chips.  By the way, does anyone know the significance of the cairns I saw in the park?  Does those indicate a box is or will be planted in that area?  On a previous trip to the same park, I saw another type of marker frequently - tree limbs laid up against trailside trees, with rocks at the base.  <br/>

No, I don't think I'll be racing through the boxes - though I will want to try to get everyone.  There's ALOT on that list.  Am I reading right that some may be permanent?

I'll try to refrain from going to the park to check out likely hiding places - SPORs, SPOLs*, SPOBs**,etc.  That won't be a problem since I am such a goody-two-shoes - but I've got to say that some of the appeal of letterboxing is the secretiveness, stealth and getting away with something.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Congrats on making 400!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Speaking of challenges, I'm growing quite concerned I wont have Orson<br/>
&gt; Wells <br/>
&gt; &gt; done in the next week -- I've spent 4 nights on it (about 10 hrs) and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; have about 15 - 20% done :-/<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Good news? Well, all that is in the smallest details . . . leaving the <br/>
&gt; &gt; larger "easier" spots left -- hopefully they will go faster for me, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; worlds <br/>
&gt; &gt; slowest carver.<br/>
