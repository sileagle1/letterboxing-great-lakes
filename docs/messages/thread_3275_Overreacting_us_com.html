                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd just like to make a few points that seem, at least in part, against the<br>
prevailing winds post-Press and Argus article.<br>
<br>
1. Newspapers/Magazines/Publicity is/are bad.<br>
<br>
Well, now this is just silly. How many of us CAN'T trace our involvement in<br>
letterboxing back to a) an article or "other" website (yahoo featured site)<br>
discussing letterboxing or b) WoM from someone else who can trace themselves<br>
back to this. I really don't see any problem, at all, with articles, etc.<br>
regarding letterboxing, PER SE. Poorly written or flawed articles are<br>
another matter.<br>
<br>
2. We should limit access to clues.<br>
<br>
I can't disagree with this any more strongly. If an individual placer wants<br>
to keeps clues limited/secretive, that is their call. I know many prominent<br>
letterboxers that have some public clues and some more private clues and<br>
some totally secret clues. While I'd like for people to be informed, I don't<br>
want to place artificial barriers to keep people away for the sake of<br>
keeping people away. Furthermore, some of the most careless/obnoxious people<br>
I know are quite blessed with persistence and would be a problem regardless.<br>
<br>
3. We should make people sign a waiver/disclaimer.<br>
<br>
To what end? So that we can yell at them if they breach it? Can't we yell at<br>
them anyway? So we can ban them from clues if they breach it? I'd rather not<br>
be the person spending my leisure time deciding if someone else should be<br>
banned from spending their leisure time letterboxing, thanks.<br>
<br>
4. Kids are a problem.<br>
<br>
Uneducated kids are a problem, just the same as uneducated adults are.<br>
<br>
When Jen and I first came into this hobby, we found it to be totally<br>
accessible and easy to discover what the "rules of the road" were. I think<br>
it's a shame if we make ourselves less newbie friendly, and make less boxes<br>
available out of fear.<br>

<br>
Sending rude or obnoxious email or letters to reporters who have <br>
already printed their stories will not do any good.  They will just <br>
ignor it and block you from further email.  Calls, especially <br>
threatening, may bring negative publiclty or, in some cases - <br>
depending what words were used, the police to your door.  You may <br>
want to contact them after it prints and let them know you saw the <br>
story and you would like to give additional or a view from a seasoned <br>
letterboxer since most of these articles seem to be about newer <br>
boxers, notice I did not say newbie.<br>
<br>
Now as far as contacting the family, be nice.  Polietly explain how <br>
you feel, especially now that you have published their name, address, <br>
and phone number to all of the internet.  Yes I know with a little <br>
googling we all could have found it, but now someone who didn't cool <br>
off first may have already made contact.  You might have well as <br>
printed all the answers to the mystry boxes that are listed.<br>

<br>
I would like to affirm that I do not have children, I am a grown woman, and I letterbox <br>
alone. No one I know letterboxes or had even heard of it before I started doing it [now I <br>
have gotten 3 other people to start as well before I realized it was supposed to be a "secret <br>
society" or whatever].<br>
<br>
And that I do not enjoy nor want to do any kind of search that takes me 6 months to figure <br>
out. Or 6 weeks. A lot of people really enjoy figuring out mysteries or puzzles. I personally <br>
find them annoying, that's just me. And many people like hiking 4 hrs into the woods to <br>
find one box. I would never do that, that's just me.<br>
<br>
But I *do* like walking in the woods, taking scenic photos, and following simple directions. <br>
That is a big source of my enjoyment. I love having a reason to go outside and find new <br>
places and enjoy the fall sunshine. I hope to have reasons to enjoy other seasons as well.<br>
<br>
I know people spend time and money and effort to make boxes -- even easy ones. I really <br>
appreciate it, a lot, and I ignore the "let's keep it a secret" aspect bc I want to share my <br>
appreciation with everyone I know. I like showing my logbook to my family and friends and <br>
they are interested in hearing about my outdoor adventures. <br>
<br>
And I really appreciate anyone who puts out "easy" boxes. It is not just families with little <br>
kids that enjoy them. Some adults do as well. Not everyone gets a kick out of being <br>
stumped and frustrated. <br>
<br>
I'm not saying don't make it hard if you really enjoy that. I am saying THANK YOU to <br>
people who don'tmake it hard arbitraily.<br>
<br>
and also, please, could we just not be so outraged that *gasp* OMG people actually enjoy <br>
they boxes that you create and want to share their appreciation? I am sure this family just <br>
thought the people who placed the boxes would get a kick out of getting "credited" by <br>
them and hearing of their appreciation.<br>
