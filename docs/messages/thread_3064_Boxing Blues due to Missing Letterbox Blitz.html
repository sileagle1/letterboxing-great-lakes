Missing letterboxes are like airplane crashes -- they often come in 3's...  hope the 4th one turns up to be okay.<br/>

  We placed our first letterbox a little over a year ago and now have 11 <br/>
  boxes out there in the world-and thought we were doing pretty good <br/>
  because none had gone missing. In the course of just a week, we have <br/>
  gotten emails telling us that 3 (and possible a fourth) box are <br/>
  missing. I used to enjoy clicking on my letterboxing email, but I'm <br/>
  getting a little leery! Two of the boxes are in Florida, so it will <br/>
  be a quite a while before we can check on them (unless I can convince <br/>
  my folks to go looking for them when they go down this fall). It <br/>
  sounds like the home of UGRR #1 got cut down-maybe we'll find it in <br/>
  the wreckage. Unfortunately, we are in a really busy time right now <br/>
