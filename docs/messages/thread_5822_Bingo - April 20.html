 <br>
What a shame, and here I thought there might be hopes for this group. <br>
 <br>
I do believe you can cure the mystery and the decent hike situation in the sunny south. I will look forward to hearing of your tale. <br>
 <br>
Sincerely, <br>
 <br>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br>

However we still have several days left to toast you in absentia w/some tequila in the sunny south!  We heard it is still rather chilly in our home state and we are therefore in no hurry to return....  we also have some letterboxes to hunt for down here.  I don't think they have many mysteries down here, nor many with a decent hike.<br>
