I am, however, very sad to see that the log the little box was hidden in is completely destroyed by eager searchers.  : (<br/>
I had placed the box in the end of a hollow log, and "plugged" the hollow part with another small piece of the log... and now barely half of this whole 8-10 foot log is gone, broken away and rolled down the ravine.<br/>

I will be re-carving and replacing "Neptune" in a place close by this original hiding spot.... if you are missing this piece, check the clues regularly for updates.<br/>

As a word of caution ~ do be careful to keep nature is as nature was.  If the box isn't where it says it is... maybe it's just best to call it a loss.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's a bummer that it went missing so quickly. I was hoping that you'd say that it really is still there and that the clue is just trickier than we were deciphering.<br/>
<br/>
When we were there this weekend, in 2 different areas of the park, we saw a couple groups of very rambunctious kids, running around, hootin &amp; hollerin in jumping all over logs, piles of sticks, etc. No parents around, so I'm guessing they live close by and visit often and have made the woods their own little exploring territory. I hope that it was someone like that, rather than over-zealous LB searchers, that destroyed the rotting log. Not that I *hope* for kids to destroy things, but I'm guessing that LB'ers are a bit more respectiful of the natural surroundings. With as rotted out as the log in question was, it probably wouldn't have taken much more than a few boys jumping on it to break it apart.<br/>
