Here's another idea.  Rather than a strict gathering t-shirt (still pouting<br/>
here.), how about a Group t-shirt (or even denim?)?  Then perhaps it can be<br/>
customized for the year's gathering with a patch on the shoulder or back for<br/>
those who attend.  Those who don't attend can get the plain style, with<br/>
hopes and dreams of the next gathering.<br/>

I say I'd like a T-shirt too, but I don't think I'll handle it this year<br/>
(sorry).  For those who remember last years fiasco, you probably aren't<br/>
surprized...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would say having someone make the design would be very helpful.  My<br/>
thought that maybe a larger version of the gathering 2005 stamp image and a<br/>
letterboxing phrase like "Get a clue!" would work well.  And having the<br/>
opportunity to have a name on the back was a hit.<br/>
