                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing in the rain, letterboxing in the rain.  We're crazy and we got totally soaked!<br>
 <br>
Deedle & I spent the day letterboxing today in Ohio.  Although the skies were overcast, we had told SpringChick we'd try to do a status check on the Marblehead Lighthouse letterbox, and I realized that unless we went today we wouldn't have a chance to get out there until mid-August.  Besides, threatening weather's supposed to keep the masses away, right?<br>
 <br>
Not in Marblehead!  Although it was raining during our hour & a half drive from Cleveland at varying degrees of drizzle to downpour, once we turned at St. Mary's church (which I squealed quite a bit about when I discovered it wasn't just a church, it was a _Byzantine Catholic_ church, which is my religion and a minority religion in Catholic circles) there were quite a few people wandering around the lighthouse and on the rocks despite the wind whipping our hair.  As we tried to figure the clues out, the drizzle turned to torrentual downpour and people found shelter in their cars.  Except for Jeff & me, who stayed underneath the informational booth shelter because I was convinced that the downpour would soon pass.  Then the tree fell, by the one gravel parking lot where my Jeep was parked.  Seriously, one of the upper branches of a tree, rather heavy and large and full of leaves, cracked & fell down.  We thought it fell in front of the minivan parked there, no harm really done.  I<br>
 decided that, however, if trees were falling and my Jeep has a soft top, maybe I better move it away from there.  As I ran towards my car, I discovered that the tree actually fell on the hood of the minivan, and there were people inside.  A few others were already there making sure the folks were ok, and they were able to back the minivan out from under the branch.  All good on that end in the end, just people a little shaken.  <br>
 <br>
I finally got a chance to move my Jeep, rescue Jeff from the shelter, and then we sat in the Jeep eating our picnic lunch, because I was determined to wait the rain out.  Now, I understand why we were there, because we're letterboxers so we're just inheritently crazy.  What I don't understand is all the other vehicles that kept showing up while this downpour was going on!  Now, as a side note, the lighthouse was not open today, so we got a big kick out of the cars that would pull up, have three or four people without rainjackets, umbrellas, or ponchos run to the lighthouse in this rain, and then run back to the car to report that it was locked and they couldn't get in.<br>
 <br>
So about maybe 45 minutes to an hour later, the rain finally went back to a drizzle and we were able to proceed with the hunt.  We didn't find the box, as we suspected we might not be able to per SpringChick's previous post, but we sent her a separate email detailing the hunt so she can determine if we were even on the right track.<br>
 <br>
While we were in the area, we found the East Harbor Box, all safe and sound, except that as I was looking at the clues to determine how many steps to take into the forest Jeff was able to say, "It's right there" because it was right in the open by its pile of twigs.  We shoved it back into the pile when we were done so that you couldn't see it from the trail.  FYI, logbook's almost filled up so we left some blank notecards.<br>
 <br>
We wanted to find Rest in Peace in Port Clinton, but I haven't been able to figure out where ANY Port Clinton cemeteries are because evidently Port Clinton denies their existence and doesn't list them in the yellow pages....so we'll gather that one once we learn the layout of Port Clinton a little better, since we decided that driving up and down every street looking for the cemeteries wasn't the best way to use the car's gas.<br>
 <br>
And on the way home, we hit the One Hundred Acre Woods series in Vermillion, where alas we only found Piglet because the rain started up again.  There was too much foliage and rain for us to attempt to find Pooh, Eeyore seemed to have relocated and taken the bench we were supposed to look for with him, Tigger apparently bounced on down the creek, and as we tried to head south to find the entire gang I realized that we'd turned sooner than we should have while looking for Eeyore and that's why we couldn't find any of the other boxes - we were on the wrong part of the path.  As we walked the rain kept getting harder and harder, though, so we didn't try to retrace our steps and try again.  But here's where the story gets weird...Jeff had his camera with him, as usual, and on the wrong path (which we didn't know was wrong) we passed this really tall tree with this huge hole in the trunk, almost like a doorway.  The inside of the tree was hollowed out and a person could have fit inside<br>
 there.  I told Jeff to take a picture, because I thought it was neat, and I went next to the tree for a perspective as to how big that opening was.  Once we got back to Jeff's, he downloaded the photos from his camera, since it's a digital.  He had taken 2 photos of me by that tree.  In photo one, almost unoticeable, there's a bit of a white blur in the lower right corner.  But in photo two, there's this huge mist, looking almost like it's coming out of the tree, like you see in ghost hunter photos!  We didn't see any mist-like thing while in the woods, no cold air or odd sounds, but there's something bizarre that showed up in the photo.  Jeff's taken lots of photos in the woods before with his digital camera and nothing like this has ever shown up before.  I've uploaded the photo into the group's photo files, so if anyone can explain for us please do!  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those of you interested in our "ghost hunt," Jeff is in the process of learning more about the park where our photo was taken, and he's trying to contact some local ghost hunter groups to find out if that area has a history of hauntings.  The park is Bacon Woods, which is a part of the Lorain (Ohio) MetroParks.  As far as we can tell, there's no cemetery in those woods, but there's a chance there could be early settlers to the area buried in the area, since the park is named after the Bacon family (we haven't found any degrees to Kevin Bacon yet ;) who settled there in the 1800's.  We'll post an update as we learn more.<br>
 <br>
But...don't let this discourage anyone from finding the boxes hidden in those woods!  It evidently was a nice ghost, since we didn't even know about it until we got home and looked at the photos.  And, if you follow the clues correctly, I'm not sure if you'll even go past that tree :)<br>

find Pooh, Eeyore seemed to have relocated and taken the bench we <br>
were supposed to look for with him, Tigger apparently bounced on down <br>
the creek, and as we tried to head south to find the entire gang I <br>
realized that we'd turned sooner than we should have while looking <br>
for Eeyore and that's why we couldn't find any of the other boxes - <br>
we were on the wrong part of the path.  As we walked the rain kept <br>
getting harder and harder, though, so we didn't try to retrace our <br>
steps and try again.  But here's where the story gets weird...Jeff <br>
had his camera with him, as usual, and on the wrong path (which we <br>
didn't know was wrong) we passed this really tall tree with this huge <br>
hole in the trunk, almost like a doorway.  The inside of the tree was <br>
hollowed out and a person could have fit inside<br>
>  there.  I told Jeff to take a picture, because I thought it was <br>
neat, and I went next to the tree for a perspective as to how big <br>
that opening was.  Once we got back to Jeff's, he downloaded the <br>
photos from his camera, since it's a digital.  He had taken 2 photos <br>
of me by that tree.  In photo one, almost unoticeable, there's a bit <br>
of a white blur in the lower right corner.  But in photo two, there's <br>
this huge mist, looking almost like it's coming out of the tree, like <br>
you see in ghost hunter photos!  We didn't see any mist-like thing <br>
while in the woods, no cold air or odd sounds, but there's something <br>
bizarre that showed up in the photo.  Jeff's taken lots of photos in <br>
the woods before with his digital camera and nothing like this has <br>
ever shown up before.  I've uploaded the photo into the group's photo <br>
files, so if anyone can explain for us please do!  <br>

This sounds almost like my experience 'cept for the rain. It was <br>
beautiful doing these boxes the other day.<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
