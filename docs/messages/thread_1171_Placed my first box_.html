Hello, I have just joined this group.  My name is Heather and my husband Chris and I <br/>
started letterboxing in February.  So far we have found nine boxes and a hitchhiker.  <br/>
Yesterday we placed our first box -- the first in our hometown of Lansing, Michigan.  I <br/>
drew the stamp design and my husband carved it (he's much better at that kind of <br/>
thing).  It had to be a microbox because it's in a well-travelled area with manicured <br/>
grounds that don't lend themselves to hiding boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The box is called "Say Yes to Michigan" and you can find the clue at the LbNA site if <br/>
you want to look for it.<br/>

Hi Heather, nice to see you made it over here ;-)  Congrats on your <br/>
first letterbox placement -- putting our state capital on the <br/>
letterboxing map!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Heather.  We're Wisconsinites who've made repeated trips to<br/>
Lansing to visit family and have visited a number of boxes in the<br/>
area.  "Say Yes" is on the list for the next trip.<br/>

Thanks for the Lansing plants!<br/>
