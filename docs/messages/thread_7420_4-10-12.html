Well, it sure sounds like there might be a big photo finish in Bingo this year in my name is called!  Good thing Baby Bean gets up early... ;)  I'm going to have to start checking first thing now -- it'd be a shame if I didn't win when all I need is my own name!<br/>

<br/>
And regarding the urban boxing thread, we can attest to those extra hard-working Lake Bluff police too!  We got stopped by them several years ago while looking for a box, and we didn't enjoy the experience either.  Therefore, we too have stopped doing urban boxes that we feel are in areas that make us stand out looking suspicious.<br/>

The Bingo game is nearly o'er<br/>
excitement fills the air<br/>
How many words do we each need - <br/>
is one already there?<br/>
<br/>
Our faithful bingo leader calls<br/>
a random word each day,<br/>
delighting or frustrating all<br/>
for that is e'er his way<br/>
<br/>
The winter months were mild this year<br/>
