they can not only find the answer to their current question, but also <br/>
information that they may not even have thought to ask about.  For <br/>
the newer people on the list, here are two good sources of <br/>
information that you may not know about:<br/>

www.letterboxing.info  (lots of good articles)<br/>

&gt; Answer a letterboxer's question, and you have satisfied him for the <br/>

&gt; Teach a letterboxer about new sources of information, and you have <br/>
opened up his awareness to all sorts of new letterboxing <br/>
possibilities!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After all, isn't it all about the journey... whether to a box, or <br/>
through the pages of Wikipedia or letterboxing.org or <br/>

&gt; Hello :)<br/>
&gt; Being brand spankin' new to letterboxing, I thought this group was <br/>
here to answer questions and was kind of put off by the "look it up" <br/>
answer that Doug got.<br/>
