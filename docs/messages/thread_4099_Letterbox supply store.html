it is an exploitation that really has no place in letterboxing.  But to <br/>

It IS letterbox related and though everything seemed to have the  "companies" <br/>

<br/>
Nobody received a reprimand of any kind and messages by this poster <br/>
were not moderated any differently than messages by any other first-<br/>
time poster.  You would be surprised at the amount of SPAM that comes <br/>
through to Yahoo groups and the amount we are able to head off before <br/>
it hits the list by moderating first posts.  If you would like us to <br/>
stop moderating and start letting all this crap come through, just <br/>
say the word -- it would certainly make moderating the group easier.<br/>
<br/>
Other than first-post moderation and a few problem situations we do <br/>
not moderate posts here and are very lenient with chit-chat and <br/>
promotional messages, etc.  It is my feeling that even though this is <br/>
a letterbox list, it is a community and people form relationships and <br/>
there are bound to be things that are not specifically letterbox-<br/>
related and even the occasional promotional heads-up on letterboxing <br/>
supplies, etc.  On the other hand, as moderators of the list, it is <br/>
our responsibility to try and keep conversations pertinent to <br/>
letterboxing and to try to catch SPAM, gimmicks and self-promotional <br/>
messages. <br/>
<br/>
I guess it is another of those darned if you do and darned if you <br/>
don't situations...  there is always going to be somebody who isn't <br/>
happy or thinks it wasn't done the right way.<br/>
