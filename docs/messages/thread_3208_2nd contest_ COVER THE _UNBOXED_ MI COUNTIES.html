"unboxed" MI counties "covered" how could I not sponsor another<br/>
contest!?  LOL ... So here are the details:<br/>
<br/>
PLAYING TIME:<br/>
Now until midnight on Thanksgiving Day (2006)<br/>
<br/>
WINNERS DRAWN ON: <br/>
Friday, November 24, 2006 and posted to the list before 11pm<br/>
<br/>
HOW IT WORKS: <br/>
Each time you are the first one to place a box in one of the 14<br/>
"unboxed" MI counties and email me with the URL for the clues, you<br/>
will get your name added to another drawing ... twice!   NOTE: You<br/>
must email me the URL with the clues for it to count in the drawing<br/>
contest and I will go by the time the email was received.<br/>
<br/>
After an "unboxed" county has been covered, any other box placed there<br/>
will get the placers name put in the drawing one time.  (ie: If you<br/>
are the first to place a box in Jackson county and you place two boxes<br/>
you would get your name in the drawing 3 times. If another boxer<br/>
places in Jackson county AFTER it has already been covered, they would<br/>
get their name in the drawing once for each box placed)<br/>
<br/>
I have prizes, but more could be possible if others would like to<br/>
contribute to the cache kitty ... just email me if you'd like to<br/>
donate.  NOTE: You do not have to mail your contribution to me, you<br/>
could hold it and mail directly to the winner when they are announced.<br/>
<br/>
Ready ... Set ... Get out there and BOX MI <br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>
