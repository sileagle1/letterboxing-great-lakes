                    <div class="plaintext-content">Monday I finally got around to re-carving my missing stamp.  So, today I took my brother (who is home visiting from Iraq) out to show him what I'm talking about when I write to him about letterboxing.  We replaced my missing box and I had him follow all my clues to check up on my other boxes.  I am glad to say that all of them are in good condition, in spite of having been chewed on by critters.  One box has a tiny puncture in the lid, so I'll be keeping a close eye on that one come spring but I'm hoping the log it's hidden under will protect it.  We saw a LOT of deer this time.  I'm so proud of Aina for not turning her brain off when she saw all the deer tails dissapearing into the woods.<br/>
