I work all year for that vacation--LOL  Dh does not like to go  places-- I do <br>
and since our relationship is more of roommates-- I work and the  money I <br>
earn I spend on vacation and things I want that he is too cheap to  buy--<br>
 <br>
Every year I go for 4 weeks to MI/WI for the Chicago Mac Yacht race-- Then  <br>
there is a vacation in March to see my sister in AZ. and a week off in <br>
September  for the Reno Air Races.  Next year I am planning a 3 week cruise to the  <br>
Pacific Panama Canal -- and 3 weeks in MI-- It is nice to be able to do this-- <br>
