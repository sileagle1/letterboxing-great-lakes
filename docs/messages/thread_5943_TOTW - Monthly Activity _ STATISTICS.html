<br/>
==================<br/>
 ...  Just for kicks, I also made a pretty pie chart showing our breakdown<br/>
of boxes found per state. If you check out the<br/>
file, you also might happen to notice that we are nearly at a major boxing<br/>
milestone... hopefully over this weekend or next. :)<br/>
<br/>
Coffee Beans<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
Well, did you make it to F1000????  If not, you must be VERY close....<br/>
<br/>
I wanted a "pretty pie chart" too, so made more graphs with state and<br/>
letterboxing region stats and uploaded the file if you're curious.  Not<br/>
surprisingly the VAST majority of our finds have been in WI &amp; IL, followed<br/>
by MI.<br/>
<br/>
==================<br/>
(We used our own "spread sheet" method - flinging the wrinkled, inky,<br/>
smeared clue sheets<br/>
into either a warm pile or a cool pile.)<br/>
<br/>
Tiptoe &amp; Tonto<br/>
==================<br/>
Great image, but I can't believe that you REALLY have all those clue sheets<br/>
accumulated for 6 years!  What are you saving them for, a "collage" art<br/>
project or maybe wallpapering  a rec room?<br/>
<br/>
==================<br/>
Ok, as long as we are talking stats<br/>
 What is the decent FTP (Found To Planted = boxes found/boxes planted)<br/>
ratio?<br/>
 Or an ideal BPM (Box planted Per Mile = hike distance/number of boxes)?<br/>
 Or a respectable HHR (Hitch Hiker Ratio = hitch hikers released/boxes<br/>
found)?<br/>
 Or worthy MPB (Miles Per Box = miles hiked/boxes found)?<br/>
 Or how high is too high for my ABT (Attempted But There = boxes that were<br/>
actually there but I wanted to mark attempted because I was SURE they were<br/>
missing)?<br/>
<br/>
Atom118 of Atomic Beans<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
FTP - When we first started boxing in 2003 there weren't very many boxes<br/>
around.  We therefore set a goal of planting 1 box for every 10 found.<br/>
However more boxes started appearing and we revised that to 1 for every 20.<br/>
Now we don't have a specific goal - we try to plant to keep things active in<br/>
our area as well as planting in areas we visit while traveling.  Our current<br/>
FTP is 1 box planted for every 26 found.<br/>
<br/>
BPM - We like longer hikes and like finding several boxes along the way.<br/>
We've done 10-mile hikes to find 1 box and planted only 1 box on a 7-mile<br/>
hike with over 2,000 ft elevation gain.  However we generally like to find a<br/>
box every 2 miles or so.  We've planted a 5-box series on a 9-mile hike, 4<br/>
boxes on a 6-mile hike, 3 boxes on a 6-mile hike, etc.  Of course we realize<br/>
that not everyone likes to hike as much as we do!<br/>
<br/>
HHR - We've only released 1 hitchhiker each year we have been boxing.  Still<br/>
need to launch one for this year....   A different hitchhiker statistic that<br/>
is on our spreadsheet is how many HHs we find vs. total boxes found.  We<br/>
don't go to HH hostels, so these only represent HHs that we have found "in<br/>
the wild".  I guess you could call this HHF.  Our current percentage is 4.8%<br/>
(1 HH found for every 21 boxes found).<br/>
<br/>
MPB - see BPM above.<br/>
<br/>
ABT - we quit keeping track of this statistic a LONG time ago!<br/>
<br/>
Other statistics that we track on our spreadsheet are adopted boxes, and<br/>
what we count as "miscellaneous" stamp images (personal travelers, cooties,<br/>
stamps at events that were simply sitting out on a table, etc.)  Our current<br/>
"A" count =1 and our "M" count = 246.  Of course we also track how many<br/>
events we have attended E=36.  Our spreadsheet also tracks how many times we<br/>
were the first to find a box.<br/>
<br/>
Our spreadsheet is pretty straightforward.  We created it many years ago,<br/>
way before on-line tracking started.  For each stamp image, we record the<br/>
name, carver, city, state, date, and type of stamp (P, F, X, E, HH, HP, A,<br/>
M).  We can sort and graph any which way we like....<br/>
<br/>
FUN with statistics!!!   (Sorry Tiptoe, it really IS fun for those of us who<br/>
like numbers!)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ooh, you make me so sad!  I'm in Illinois without my spreadsheet so I can't<br/>
do the math, too.  I'll have to wait until I get home.<br/>
<br/>
As for the numbers Atom118 was asking for:<br/>
When I started boxing, there were 6 boxes within 2 hours of where I lived,<br/>
so my FTP ratio was very low, probably around 5 found for every 1 planted.<br/>
I don't know that I would want every one to have that ratio though (heck, I<br/>
didn't *want* that ratio).  Lately, I just plant when I get an idea, no<br/>
thought of ratios.  I do, however, think that every one should plant at<br/>
least one box.  Ya know, giving back and all that.<br/>
<br/>
Ideal BPM:  I agree with WiHi, I like hiking.  About 1 box every 1-2 miles<br/>
works well for me.  I don't think I've ever hiked more than that to get a<br/>
box but I have contemplated putting on one the 7 mile trail at Kennekuk, and<br/>
it would not at all deter me to hike that far for a box.  Since I like<br/>
hiking more than stopping (and the dogs tolerate stamping in breaks only<br/>
because they get treats), I prefer not to have more than 2 boxes per mile.<br/>
Frankly, I never think to look at the clues for the next box in a series<br/>
until I've hiked for a little while (generally about 1/4 mile), so if the<br/>
boxes are closer together than that, I end up backtracking and make the BPM<br/>
closer to my personal ideal.  And sometimes I think the dogs prefer the<br/>
backtracking, since they get to sniff both sides of the trail much more<br/>
extensively that way.<br/>
<br/>
As for the rest, I hardly ever seem to find hitchhikers, which makes them a<br/>
pleasant surprise when I do, so whatever the current rate is, I think it's<br/>
ideal.  If'm I'm recalling my numbers correctly, I've found roughly 1 HH for<br/>
every 30 boxes, so a little lower than WiHi.  I don't record attempts, so I<br/>
can't add anything there.  I suppose I could add a sheet to my Oo file for<br/>
that....  I keep a separate sheet for plants, finds, exchanges, hitchikers,<br/>
and personal travelers.<br/>

those that find it after us, CB added some very nice fireworks to the <br/>

<br/>
Also, WI Hiker, very cool pie charts.  I like how you have them grouped <br/>
by region.  Have any idea when you'll get all the states?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
For the stats I posted, in actuality, only a few were ones we try to <br/>
consider. We have been aiming for a FTP of about 10 (1 box planted for <br/>
every 10 we find).  It might be a bit high, but we tend to remove alot <br/>
of our boxes for one reason or another.  The current number of our <br/>
'active' FTP is more like 20 (1 box for every 20 we find).  This way we <br/>
can give back a relative amount to those we find, but also do it at a <br/>
reasonable rate to give us time to go boxing.  As for BPM, we shoot for <br/>
about 1 box per mile except for our few drive-bys or other special <br/>
circumstances.  We find this to be sufficient to keep the flow of a <br/>
hike, but high enough to keep people motivated.  For our HHR, I like <br/>
HHs.  I've been shooting for a HHR=FTP, but we've lagged a bit.  Our HHR <br/>
is more like 5 which is oddly similar to our HHF of about 1 HH found (or <br/>
planted) for every 20 boxes we find.  The ABT and MPB may have been a <br/>
bit ill-conceived so I won't consider them....one is higher than we'd <br/>
like and one is probably lower than we expect!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, enough fun with numbers.<br/>
