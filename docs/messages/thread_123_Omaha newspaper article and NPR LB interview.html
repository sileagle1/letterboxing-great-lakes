You can also listen to the NPR Letterboxing interview at<br/>
<br/>
http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1832303<br/>
<br/>
(After listening to the NPR interview, I tend to agree that I wish <br/>
the leterboxer interviewed had picked a better place than near the <br/>
White House to plant the box for the interview. Very short sighted, <br/>
IMHO.)<br/>

&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Being new and all, I wasn't quite sure what to use as a logbook. I <br/>
came<br/>
&gt; across a zippered 6-hole daytimer-like binder.  I punched my own <br/>
sheets from<br/>
&gt; cardstock to fit in it (as a bonus I found a Stickapotomous <br/>
zippered pouch<br/>
&gt; to keep my stamp and a mini-pad in the front of it.  I really like <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; because I can add or remove sheets at will, including my stamped <br/>
pages which<br/>
&gt; I leave at home to keep them clean when I go out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In other news...I heard a local Omaha paper ran an article about<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  Anyone see it??  My friend is going to send it to <br/>
me.  If<br/>
&gt; it's any good should I scan and post it in the files or <br/>
something???<br/>
