For those who are participating in the Letterbox Exchange, e-mails <br>
went out last night with information as to who you are sending your <br>
box to.<br>
<br>
There are 24 participants and I am excited by the cool series <br>
of "Hometown Landmarks" this project will produce.  Each participant <br>
will be putting together a complete, ready-to-plant letterbox -- <br>
hand-carved stamp, logbook and any inclusions you customarily put <br>
into a letterbox.  For further project guidelines and deadlines, <br>
please refer to the file in the FILES section of this list <br>
(FILES/GROUP PROJECTS...).  If you have additional questions, feel <br>
free to contact me.  <br>
<br>
Since the identities of who each person will be receiving a box from <br>
are unknown, I have not posted a list of participants, although once <br>
the project is done I would like to put together a comprehensive <br>
list of everyone who participated and the "landmark" they chose -- I <br>
will be contacting participants directly regarding this.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT:  If you think you are participating but did not receive <br>
an e-mail telling you who you are to send your box to, please <br>
contact me offlist as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
And, just a reminder...  please do not share the real name, address <br>
or e-mail address of the person you are sending to.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who suggested theme ideas and all who were able <br>
to participate!<br>

However, I don't see why you couldn't use a logo for the stamp design.  My stamp design has a logo and a visual representation of the landmark I chose because the landmark itself does not make for a particularly interesting image.<br>

anything of it if I received a box which represented a long-standing local <br>
