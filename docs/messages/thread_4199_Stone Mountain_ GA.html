Mountain.  Imagine our surprise when we were paging through a logbook and<br/>
spotted Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man listed there!  We have never met<br/>
them in person but it seems like they've preceeded us to almost every box<br/>
we've found in Michigan.  We felt like we had just happened upon some old<br/>
friends when we spotted them in the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also thoroughly enjoyed our time there.  It was beautiful and we had a<br/>
great morning finding letterboxes and enjoying the scenery.<br/>

share a report on our most recent letterboxing trip. :)<br/>

Hey, I remember when we boxed in those areas, but it was almost 3 <br/>
years ago! There might be some newer boxes there now...<br/>
<br/>
We're working on a trip report from our most recent trip, but if <br/>
anyone wants to read about our Memorial Day adventures, I'll post it <br/>
below (we originally posted it on the Southeast regional board). <br/>
We'd HIGHLY recommend boxing in the Stone Mountain (Atlanta, GA) <br/>
area - lots of nice hikes and great carvings!<br/>
<br/>
Trip report:<br/>
<br/>
Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
We arrived home yesterday after our 4-day trip to GA. The SE Annual<br/>
Gathering at Stone Mountain triggered our trip, since we had read a<br/>
lot about all the boxes there. We assumed it was a large park where<br/>
we could do lots of hiking. However after I booked our flights I<br/>
Googled the park and got worried - it looked like a theme park with<br/>
lots of "attractions". Oh, oh... well we were committed, so we also<br/>
printed some clues for other boxes in the surrounding area just in<br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
We flew out Friday night and headed for the park Saturday morning,<br/>
not sure what to expect. Of course we had a HUGE bundle of clues to<br/>
juggle, so when we got to the park we just took a random turn and<br/>
ended up near the covered bridge &amp; quarry. OK, we had some clues for<br/>
this area, so we hopped out of the car. Hmmm... this seemed like a<br/>
very nice area. Trees, water, trails - just what we like! Our fears<br/>
were laid to rest immediately. While looking for one box in the<br/>
quarry area, a couple started walking near us - drat! Time to look<br/>
like we were consulting our map and just admiring the area. The<br/>
woman proceeded ahead, but the man wandered along past us. All of a<br/>
sudden he asked "Did you find it?" Oh GOOD - Just another<br/>
letterboxer! He said he thought it was further ahead, where the woman<br/>
was and sure enough we headed up to retrieve it and do our first<br/>
exchange of the day with Llama Mama. After finding several boxes, we<br/>
headed to the picnic area to meet some of the local boxers. We were<br/>
greeted by several and started the process of doing exchanges and<br/>
chatting with people. Some were names we recognized from message<br/>
boards or as planters and others were new to us. After a pleasant<br/>
few hours, we headed off with a small group led by StarSAELS. He had<br/>
offered to act as a "tour guide" for a climb up the rock and a search<br/>
for many boxes along the way up &amp; down. Wow - he is ORGANIZED and we<br/>
really appreciate his willingness to spend his time helping us find<br/>
our way around the mountain. We also were amazed at the detail on<br/>
his 99 Bottles of Beer stamps.<br/>
<br/>
We had hoped to meet up with the group again for dinner, but got lost<br/>
trying to find the place. It didn't help that we never asked the<br/>
name of the restaurant, nor exchanged cell phone numbers, so we<br/>
couldn't even tell anyone where we were trying to get to! After<br/>
checking 3 places, we decided to just eat some pizza ourselves and<br/>
head back to the park. We found a few more before the laser light<br/>
show and then headed back to our hotel for a much-needed rest.<br/>
[Exchanged with 24 letterboxers, Found 28 boxes and 1 Hitchhiker]<br/>
<br/>
We figured that Stone Mountain would be very busy over the holiday<br/>
weekend, so we decided to visit different parks on Sunday and Monday,<br/>
then return to Stone Mountain on Tuesday. We headed to Tribble Mill<br/>
park on Sunday and after a rough start (couldn't figure out what<br/>
trail we were supposed to start on, but eventually got something to<br/>
work and went from there). Eventually we backtracked from one of the<br/>
first clues to find the "No Parking" sign and that got us going on<br/>
more clues. The plus side of being disoriented was that we found a<br/>
box that we didn't even have clues for! This was another nice area<br/>
to spend the day walking. However there were way too many boxes here<br/>
than we could find in one day, so we eventually called it quits and<br/>
headed back for another good night's sleep.<br/>
[Found 22 boxes and 1 Hitchhiker]<br/>
<br/>
Monday we headed down to the Davidson-Arabia Mountain Nature<br/>
Preserve. First we found several boxes on the "flatter" part of the<br/>
park, then headed over to climb up the granite. We again really<br/>
enjoyed the walks - Martini Man especially enjoyed being on the<br/>
Arabia peak since it was so undeveloped and we had the place to<br/>
ourselves. We finished up in the park by mid-afternoon, so decided<br/>
to head back to Tribble Mill again. Didn't have as much luck finding<br/>
some of the boxes - especially frustrating when we know others found<br/>
them not long ago. What were we missing?! Oh well, you can't find<br/>
them all!<br/>
[Found 19 boxes]<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday it was a return to Stone Mountain. We started off at the<br/>
covered bridge/quarry area again and after finding a few newer boxes<br/>
we took off on the Cherokee Trail. I had a whole packet of clues<br/>
clutched in my hand since we would try to find some going forward,<br/>
reverse engineer some going backward and we never knew where we might<br/>
find the things shown in all the picture clues... A great walk with<br/>
views of water and mountain along the way. Also mostly shaded and a<br/>
nice breeze, who could ask for a better day? We did fairly well and<br/>
many clues went from the packet to Martini Man's pocket as we found<br/>
them one by one. After completing the circuit we headed to the<br/>
Nature Trail and then the Songbird Trail to find a few last boxes<br/>
before we ended our 4-day extravaganza.<br/>
[Found 23 boxes and 1 Hitchhiker]<br/>
<br/>
We both agreed that this was one of the nicest areas in the country<br/>
we have boxed - challenging clues, good box placements and excellent<br/>
carvings!!! Thanks so much to all of you who have placed boxes (we<br/>
will be sending individual "Contact the Placer" messages in the near<br/>
future), to Red's Bunch for organizing the gathering and to StarSAELS<br/>
for all his recommendations and tips for our visit to the area.<br/>
