P.S.  We still need to get our Bingo Booty sent out.  I see from the database that 17 people have already mailed their cards &amp; booty.  We'd better "shake our booties" and get our stuff sent in!  The last 3 years there have been 50-60 players, so I think there are probably many others who also need to "shake, shake, shake - shake your booty"<br/>
