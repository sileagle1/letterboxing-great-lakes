People have emailed me to say that they are planning to make this a Lake Bluff holiday weekend....LOL....to find letterboxes.  Not much else to do in this small village.  But I promise, there are plenty of active letterboxes waiting to be found in this area.  Lake County has some great boxes...worth the price of gas to find them too.  <br/>
