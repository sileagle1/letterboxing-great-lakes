                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of course, there will be OTHER veteran boxers attending! In our area The Dragon and Leapin' Lizards were boxing before us and they have both found and planted many boxes as well as attended several events.  I figure anyone is a veteran if they have been "playing the game" for several years.  Also pleased to see MC Bear on the list - we met her at the first Great Lakes event we attended in 2004.<br/>
<br/>
We're definitely looking forward to meeting the "newer" people - I count 5 on the list that we personally haven't seen at an event before.<br/>

Wanna "hear" his favorite engineer joke?  How do you tell if an <br/>

Needless to say, Peabody is a character, and he is good with <br/>
mechanical things.  And math. And our 13y.o. daughter.  And <br/>
explaining math to said 13 y.o.  And remembering lots of trivia.  I <br/>
