                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just added a new folder to the files section of the group on inks <br>
and stamp pads. There are three files in the folder that I copied <br>
over from my old Letterboxing_Bindlestiff yahoogroup. I think you'll <br>
find some helpful information in the files. Here's a link to the <br>
files area (note, you'll have to be signed in to yahoo to access it)<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/files/<br>
<br>
As a general rule, pigment inks dry out less quickly than dye or <br>
hybrid types do and slovent based inks dry out the fastest.<br>
<br>
Personally, I wouldn't want a Petal Point in a letterboxing pack. For <br>
one thing, even though the individual pads are small, the overall <br>
size isn't. Also, the lid doesn't have a positive latching system so <br>
it's possible it may one day open up inside the bag and make a mess <br>
of everything around it and finally, pigment ink takes time to dry so <br>
it's possible that it will smear in logbooks. <br>
<br>
Hope my two cets (and the files) are helpful.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Pigment ink in general should be just fine.  I'm an artist and often use<br>
stamping in my artwork, and it's usually using my own hand-carved stamps,<br>
and both pigment inks or dye inks work fine.  Pigment inks are slower drying<br>
and thus easier to clean off a stamp if a person blots it off quickly, but<br>
pigment inks also don't hold up nearly as well to the weather elements that<br>
might attack a logbook since most letterboxes are outdoors.<br>
<br>
I steer clear of chalk inks because those can leave small particles behind,<br>
particularly as the stamp pad gets older and begins to dry out.<br>
<br>
I also steer clear of any solvent based inks like Stazon or alcohol inks for<br>
either hand-carved or "clear" cling-type stamps.  Eventually the solvent<br>
will harm the stamp and the colors tend to be very permanent, making it<br>
often difficult to switch colors without harming the stamp because it's so<br>
difficult to clean off the previous color enough so that it doesn't corrupt<br>
the next color.  Solvent based stamp pads also tend to dry out much quicker<br>
than other stamp pads, so if a person doesn't use them often, they might not<br>
consider it to be worth the price.<br>
<br>
You might also want to consider just carving a quickie stamp or two just to<br>
use to experiment on with inks and markers to see what you like.  In the<br>
past couple of years, there's really been sort of an explosion of available<br>
inks, everybody and their brother and sister is coming up with new inks,<br>
particularly if a person buys online, and so much of the literature out<br>
there dealing with ink comparisons is often outdated.<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever considered not stamping into a letterbox's logbook itself?<br>
I was thinking of making some ATCs which would include my stamped image of<br>
my sig stamp and putting one in the logbook when I find a box.  That way I<br>
could make my own backgrounds, do some embellishing, etc, plus laminate the<br>
ATC at home before I set out, and just tack it into the logbook.<br>
Obviously, this isn't something that's going to interest anyone who likes to<br>
find a ton of boxes in a day and anyone who isn't an artist.  Altho it's<br>
easy to make a lot of ATCs at once as far as background goes -- designing<br>
and making one large background sheet and then cutting it up.  But Ancient<br>
took my idea and made a bunch of ATCs using her sig stamp with some<br>
background papers Ancient had made last summer but hadn't found a use for<br>
yet, and they look terrific.  But to stand up to the elements in a logbook,<br>
the ATCs would have to be laminated.  Or possibly use acetate with an acohol<br>
ink background but then something like Stazon would have to be used for the<br>
sig stamp which I wouldn't want to do to my sig stamp.<br>
<br>
That's what I've thought about doing with boxes I find this year.  Making a<br>
pre-made background on cardstock before I leave home based on what the theme<br>
of the stamp or box is or seems to be, stamping onto that cardstock, and<br>
then laminating it when I get home and cutting it down to an ATC size.  Not<br>
to be traded, of course, but just to go in my letterboxing scrapbook.<br>
Again, not something that's going to be done by someone who's out to find a<br>
lot of boxes in a set time frame.<br>
<br>
I wish I'd thought to do that with the Edgar Allan Poe box here in Villa<br>
Park.  Edgar Allan Poe is great ATC material.<br>

Subject: [LbGLK] Re: Stamp Pad Question<br>
<br>
<br>
I have another question about chosing the right ink.  I have read the folder<br>
about the differences and I was wondering if the larger particles of the<br>
pigment ink make for a less crisp image line?  Also, do those particles fill<br>
in fine details in a stamp requiring the stamp to be cleaned often?  I have<br>
finally carved a stamp for the family that I like, but it has fine leaf vain<br>
detail in it, so I am not sure what kind of ink to use.<br>
<br>
  Thank you for any experienced insight you can give me.<br>
