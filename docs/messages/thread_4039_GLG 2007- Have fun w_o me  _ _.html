attending the GLG this year. Due to money and medical<br>
problems I will have to stay home : ( I do hope to see<br>
all of you next year however in MN! ( My first request<br>
for having the gathering here next year. You lucky<br>
Ohioans stole the election last year! ) I wish you all<br>
nice weather, no bugs, good food and way too many<br>
boxes to find. I will be cancelling my campsite<br>
tomorrow, M-13, so if someone wants it you might be<br>
able to contact the park and request that site once<br>
it's available tomorrow. Once again, sorry for such a<br>
late withdrawal, life happens sometimes.<br>

 Also, sorry to all the campers who were looking<br>
forward to the oatmeal breakfast, I will be sad to<br>
miss it as well. I will also miss seeing new friends I<br>
only met once, last year in Delafield, You're too many<br>
to list but I will miss spending the weekend with you.<br>

 Anyhoo, sorry for the late withdrawal, have a great<br>
time everyone.<br>

Gathering next month.  My campsite is also now up for grabs, having<br>
canceled my reservation earlier today.  Last year I couldn't go to the<br>
gathering because I didn't have a job and couldn't afford to travel;<br>
this year I have a job and have to work that weekend.  Pout.  But next year....<br>
<br>
I will, however, still be sending the doggie event stamp on with Kimono<br>
Girl and company, so at least I'll get some stamp images from the weekend.  <br>
