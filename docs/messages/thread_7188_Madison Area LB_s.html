Does anybody know of something odd going on with Madison, WI area LB's<br>
lately? Or maybe I just had rotten luck, going zero for four attempts today<br>
on some newer boxes (Cap City Bike Trail 3&5, Engaging Series).<br>

Cap City boxes are stamps on magnets in public places by new planter with<br>
F55. Engaging Series' demise surprised me more - in a not-busy conservation<br>
park by a newer planter with F197. Oh, fudge! I just took another look at<br>
the clue for this series - I was using an old clue for one box, so I didn't<br>
look in the right place. So, I was really 0 for 3 yesterday.<br>
