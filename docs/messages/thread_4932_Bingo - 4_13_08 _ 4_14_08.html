I hope you all had a great weekend despite the weather.  Mine started <br/>
great with my first letterbox finally being found.  I also got to meet <br/>
and do an exchange with Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man.  (who i <br/>
thought were going to be first finders of my LB, but was surprised to <br/>
find it had been found the day before.)  But, the FF left a very <br/>
interesting and well traveled HH with some very impressive names and <br/>
locations in it. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, my weekend went downhill from there.  But at least i had <br/>
a nice Sat. to reflect on. <br/>
<br/>
Have a great Monday! Unfortunately i have to work today. <br/>
