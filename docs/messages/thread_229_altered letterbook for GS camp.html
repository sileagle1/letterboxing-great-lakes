                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, everyone.  I've been working all day (okay, not ALL day!) on a new Lb<br>
for camp.  I think I mentioned my idea a while back...an altered book that<br>
would actually be the journal for the box as well as the hiding place of the<br>
stamp.  (There's a niche in the back of the book to hold the stamp.)  Has<br>
anyone ever done anything like that before?  The book I'm using is an old<br>
(1953) pronounciation dictionary, and my altering is pretty<br>
rudimentary...basically just playing with some of my stamps to illustrate<br>
words on some of the pages.  On the page that has "BLIND", I stamped the<br>
three blind mice.  For "ALIEN" I stamped Worf from ST:TNG.  A few pages are<br>
a bit more elaborate:  "ANTS": I multiply stamped an image of three ants,<br>
and stamped out the words "the ants go marching 3 by 3".  I just wanted to<br>
do enough to give the girls some idea that writing in the book was okay, and<br>
spark a little creativity without stiffling their own ideas by being too<br>
overwhelming.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'd like to bring this along to the Gathering so that all of your<br>
can stamp into it, if you don't mind.  I'd like them also to see what some<br>
"real" letterboxers' stamps look like (not the pathetic stuff I've produced<br>
so far!!...I *really* need a workshop!).<br>
<br>
The name of the box...er, book?...is "May I have a word with you?"  The<br>
clues imply the lodge it will be hidden in...oh, heck...here they are:<br>
"May I have a word with you?<br>
<br>
Ah, camp! The perfect place to relax and forget about your problems, at<br>
least for a few days.<br>
<br>
You say the Pioneer lifestyle is not for you? Well, perhaps youd prefer<br>
some of our other accommodations. Perhaps some flush toilets? Indoor<br>
fireplace and kitchen? Nearby swimming pool? A separate room for your<br>
leaders to escape the noise of your troop? Sounds rather idyllic, dont you<br>
think?<br>
<br>
What? Whats that you say? Youre trying to read these clues to your<br>
troopmates but dont know how to pronounce that "I" word in the last<br>
paragraph? Well, you know what they always say, "Look it up in the<br>
dictionary!" As a matter of fact, one of the amenities (okay, look that one<br>
up too) at camp is a collection of books for your reading enjoyment. Find<br>
the dictionary and youll find a most unusual letterbox!!"<br>
<br>
["Pioneer" is the name of the first box I placed there...and refers to the<br>
fact that it is hidden at a platform tent site called Trailblazer.  The name<br>
of the lodge is "Idle-A-While", hence the reference to "idyllic".  The book<br>
itself will be on a bookshelf by a set of old encyclopedias that never get<br>
used, so no one will pay any attention to it unless they are looking for<br>
it.]<br>
<br>
Hey, this is kind of nice that you guys can't go looking for this box!  This<br>
way I can share this info with you instead!<br>

I've done quite a bit with books and niches.<br>
Although I considered using one for a letterbox container in a <br>
library, my plans were slowed when librarian acquaintences cautioned <br>
me that the books are regularly moved within a libray's shelving <br>
systems. That, of course, would preclude a successful and secret <br>
placement without the "intruder" book being detected by staff.<br>
So that plan went to the back burner.<br>
Nevertheless, I have made many "hollowed-out" books and developed a <br>
rather interesting method of removing a major part of the page block <br>
without using a craft knife.<br>
I'll bring some samples to the gathering, although the method is not <br>
one that can be done without special power tools. And it does not <br>
lend itself to conventional book altering.<br>

of altered book letterboxes (letterbooks?), but I have not actually <br>
ever seen one done by anyone else, so I am very excited to see yours <br>
at the gathering!<br>

A great way to combine letterboxing and altered books!  What fun for <br>
your girl scouts!<br>
