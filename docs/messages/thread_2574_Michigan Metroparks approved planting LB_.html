Hi to all the Southeast Michigan boxers out there (and those Boxers <br>
wishing to plant in Southeast MI regardless of your dwelling <br>
location!) -<br>
<br>
I have succeeded in getting official approval from the Huron-Clinton <br>
Metroparks System for us to place letterboxes in the parks :) This <br>
means that the park rangers are aware of the sport of Letterboxing, <br>
know where the boxes are, and won't remove or dispose of them.<br>
<br>
The Metroparks will be adding a Letterboxing dropdown on their <br>
website (www.metroparks.com) as well as other fun goodies!<br>
<br>
The only thing they ask in return is for us to fill out a permit. The <br>
permit is free and you can either e-mail, mail or fax the completed <br>
permit with clues to Tim Philips. Once the permit and clues are <br>
approved, you can then place your box. (They just want to ensure it's <br>
not placed in a sensitive area, etc.)<br>
<br>
Tim's contact info is:<br>

Just wanted to share this happy news - yahoo! Now if I could just get <br>
the Michigan State Parks to endorse LB (like the CT State Park <br>
systems did!)....I'm working on that too!<br>

I'm so excited!:)<br>

<br>
Same goes for the MI State Parks.  This is a very delicate issue and it is currently on the books that both geocaching and letterboxing are not allowed in MI State Parks without a permit and a fee, although few parks have the resources or the inclination to enforce this.  The Michigan geocaching organization has been working very diligently with the MI DNR on this issue.  Although pressure and requests from others could have a positive impact, it could just as easily have a negative impact, losing progress that MIGO has already made. <br>
<br>
For the past several years, we have chosen to peacefully "co-exist" with the parks systems in MI -- for good reason -- it works this way.  If every letterboxer does their part to ensure that they are not placing boxes in eco-sensitive areas, we are in essence policing ourselves and not drawing undue attention to letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents...<br>

<br>
No apology needed -- no unwritten code has been violated.  Everyone sees this issue differently and I can understand the perspective from which it does appear to be a good thing to have park approval.  However, that opens up a whole can of other issues.  There are certain organizations that have taken a firm stand against letterboxing (i.e. National Parks) and for the most part, we respect that position.  But it is generally felt that when there is not a clear policy or a policy that is not actively enforced, it is better to ask forgiveness than permission.  Putting a park in the position to have to say "yes" or "no" often results in a "no" just because nobody wants to be the one to say "yes" and have environmental and/or liability issues then rest of their shoulders.  On the other hand, many parks are very aware of letterboxing even though they have not formally approved it, but because they have not been forced into a decision one way or the other, we peacefully co-exist.  Even when they have made a positive decision, that can be changed at any time and because they have implemented a permit system, they know where the boxes are and who has planted them.<br>
<br>
A better way to ensure that unsuspecting park rangers do not find and/or discard your letterboxes is to not make them obvious or easily stumbled upon.  I doubt many park rangers have time to sit at their computer and seek out letterboxes in their park.  For the most part, boxes that are found are accidental finds out in the field or boxes that are in sensitive, actively watched areas.  Tougher clues, longer hikes, better hiding places, mystery boxes are all good ways to increase your chances that the boxes will not be accidentally found and disposed of.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Did the Michigan DNR give any further specifics as to what they mean <br>
by "permitted" as it pertains to Michigan State Parks?  At the time <br>
that they first created a geocaching policy, which was January 2004, <br>
they were charging $35 for the permit, and the cache could only be left <br>
in place for 3 months.  Is that still the requirement?<br>
<br>
They didn't mention letterboxing in that 2004 policy, but they did <br>
somehow let the park administrators know about it, because we were <br>
asked to remove 3 letterboxes we'd placed in a state park in 2003.  We <br>
replanted them all in various county parks and rest stops since the 3 <br>
month limitation wasn't feasible for us.  Our situation was the only <br>
such removal request I've heard of in Michigan, though; other <br>
letterboxes have remained 'under the radar' and haven't appeared to <br>
lead to any problems.<br>
<br>
On the other topic, the Metropark approval and acceptance is not <br>
surprising, since the HCMA (the Huron-Clinton Metroparks Authority... <br>
they administer 13 parks in southeast Michigan that are not state <br>
parks, but are similar in size, amenities, etc.) have planted their own <br>
geocaches in each Metropark and promoted programs related to them <br>
("find all 13 and get a free annual pass," etc.).  I think they still <br>
have a posting on their website with this information.<br>

Don't beat yourself up feeling bad about this. I think everybody <br>
understands that you were acting with the best of intentions. :-) It <br>
is just that many letterboxers tend to operate on a "don't ask, don't <br>
tell" (yes, I am horribly misusing that policy) system with <br>
the "officials" because it is preferable to not break a rule because <br>
the rule doesn't exist. We all get a bit spooked when attention is <br>
drawn to us!<br>

Everyone sees this issue differently and I can understand the <br>
perspective from which it does appear to be a good thing to have <br>
park approval.  However, that opens up a whole can of other issues.  <br>
There are certain organizations that have taken a firm stand against <br>
letterboxing (i.e. National Parks) and for the most part, we respect <br>
that position.  But it is generally felt that when there is not a <br>
clear policy or a policy that is not actively enforced, it is better <br>
to ask forgiveness than permission.  Putting a park in the position <br>
to have to say "yes" or "no" often results in a "no" just because <br>
nobody wants to be the one to say "yes" and have environmental <br>
and/or liability issues then rest of their shoulders.  On the other <br>
hand, many parks are very aware of letterboxing even though they <br>
have not formally approved it, but because they have not been forced <br>
into a decision one way or the other, we peacefully co-exist.  Even <br>
when they have made a positive decision, that can be changed at any <br>
time and because they have implemented a permit system, they know <br>
where the boxes are and who has planted them.<br>
> <br>
> A better way to ensure that unsuspecting park rangers do not find <br>
and/or discard your letterboxes is to not make them obvious or <br>
easily stumbled upon.  I doubt many park rangers have time to sit at <br>
their computer and seek out letterboxes in their park.  For the most <br>
part, boxes that are found are accidental finds out in the field or <br>
boxes that are in sensitive, actively watched areas.  Tougher clues, <br>
longer hikes, better hiding places, mystery boxes are all good ways <br>
to increase your chances that the boxes will not be accidentally <br>
found and disposed of.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I appreciate SunFleur's efforts in getting approval from the park <br>
authorities.  I do, however, have a big concern about the addition of <br>
letterboxing to the drop-down activity list.  I know it's impossible <br>
to keep letterboxing a secret, but adding it to a drop-down list at <br>
the top of the parks page will expose it to many more "casual" <br>
observers.  If we think there's an education issue NOW, just wait <br>
until somebody who was looking for a playground stumbles on a list of <br>
letterboxes, with no reference to this group or letterboxing.org or <br>
anything else where they could get more information.  SunFleur - <br>
could we perhaps ask the park system to NOT add it to the dropdown <br>
list?  I'm cool with abiding by their rules and filling out permits, <br>
and it's nice to be able to create a positive relationship with the <br>
park system!<br>
