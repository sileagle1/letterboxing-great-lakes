                    <div class="plaintext-content">Back in the Saddle? Heck....I fell off the saddle weeks ago. In the meantime, Tiptoe and Tonto's horse has trampled me into the dust. While I was trying to get my senses together, some Wisconsin Hiker came along and stepped on my back. "Oops! Sorry...didn't see you there...(hic)...It must have been the Martini, Man!" Whatever, I thought, as some Doglvrs decided to let here four legged friend use me as it's personal hydrant. While wiping off the yellowish slime, I spotted a Grandvilla in the distance. Getting to my feet, I wandered over to the stream to wash off but I was startled by a River Rat. It scared me so much I climbed into a Pine Tree to gather my senses. Just then, another Trail Rider came along (sipping her Chai Tea, of course). "Hey!" I yelled, "Can you tell me how to become a Spartans Fan?" "Nope," she replied, "But if you'd like, I spotted some Christmas Elves partying hard with a TrailTroll about a mile back along the trail. I believe they were eating some psychodelic mushrooms, or smoking some Lilac Butterfly. They seemed a bit weird." Just then, some Horseriders(from Michigan)came along."You won't beleive what we just saw in the river. A Kayakinmonkey!" "Aaaaaahhhhh.....This is nuts. Just get me to that Grandvilla!" They told me to follow the Northstarr. I left on my way, passing through Sherwood Forest along the way, when I cam upon RobinHoodand MerryMen. They were busy helping some Pastor's Wife get her Coffeebeans (or was it Espresso Beans?) back from some Gray Rabbit, who mistook them for carrots. (I'm sure he had some Lilac Butterfly earlier!) Anyhow, I eventually made it my destination, only to find some Springchick at the door, loading her Lock, Shock, and Barrel. "This will teach you Mr. Familyof6 for making a Voodoo Doll and giving it to me at the Iditarod !" "Oh Springchick, you Dartmoor Dreamer you. It was all in jest!" <br>
<br>
And that, my friends, is the true story of how Springchick happened to get her voodoo doll. Now, all you bingo losers out there, let's all give her a collective poke! (just kidding, SC!)<br>
