Haven't seen those yet - I've been using some quite nice containers <br/>
that I found at Kmart.  Yep, Martha Stewart brand.  We'll see how <br/>
they hold up through a Wisconsin winter.  I just bought some olive <br/>
drab spray paint that I'm going to use on them so the white rim of <br/>
the lid doesn't show so much.  Otherwise they're clear but shiny.<br/>
<br/>
Remember in a previous post I said I was on my fifth pack/bag to hold <br/>
all my boxing stuff?  Make that SIX.  After all the talk recently <br/>
about organizing, I thought I'd try the binder idea where you put all <br/>
your "placed" box clues in one binder and your "found" box clues in <br/>
another.  I found some forest green binders (how appropriate!) at <br/>
Walmart along with some sheet protectors.  So while I was there I saw <br/>
these clipboards that actually open up to hold stuff under them.  I <br/>
think it was Lipstick Chick that said those worked for her so...  Now <br/>
I just have to get out and 'box so I can try it out!<br/>

Note to Delirium:  Sure, you can be willowy and auburn-haired.  I <br/>
picture you as athletic, too, since you mentioned doing a triathlon <br/>
over the summer.  Let's see - wife, mother of a two-year-old, <br/>
letterboxer, triathlete, scrapbooker extraordinaire... sure you're <br/>
not a super-hero?  <br/>

I have not placed any boxes with these containers but there are a <br/>
couple of W. MI area boxers who use them and the Lock &amp; Lock do seem <br/>
pretty impervious to assaults from nature. But, as noted, the're <br/>
pretty pricey<br/>

I saw those too at Meijer and Marsh.  I'm not sure if they'll work, but I considered them.  I <br/>
have some "snips" plastic stackable containers, with a similar snapping tab.  I put them <br/>
into the freezer, but not the dishwasher.  They are starting to get out of shape.  I figured <br/>
the same might happen to these Lock &amp; Locks in the freezing weather.<br/>

One of the letterboxes Deedle &amp; I found on our Great Michigan Adventure was hidden in one of these containers, and we were so impressed we contacted the placer to find out where they had bought them.  They said in a Meijers, which we don't have in Northern Ohio.  I found them for sale on a few websites, but if they're being sold at Targets now....yet another reason for me to love that store!  (assuming that our Northern Ohio Targets will be carrying them)<br/>
<br/>
Granted, that doesn't help answer your question about how well they hold up, but I'd be willing to risk a little investment on them.<br/>

Doodle, who came home from a day of letterboxing to an inbox full of messages about her informal poll :)  The master list is on my work computer, so it will be another day before the latest tallies are posted.<br/>
