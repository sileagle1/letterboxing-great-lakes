One last call for anyone interested in playing in the Letterbox <br>
Exchange.  I have 23 people playing as of right now -- if I received <br>
your e-mail you should have received a confirmation e-mail from me <br>
in response.  If you did not hear back from me, I did not get your <br>
sign-up info and need you to send it to me again as soon as <br>
possible -- I was having some problems with my e-mail for a few days.<br>
<br>
If there is anyone else who would like to play, please privately e-<br>
mail me tonight with your name, trail name, street address and e-<br>
mail address.  I will check my e-mail again in the morning before I <br>
put the names in the hat to make assignments.  Will try to get that <br>
information out to everyone who is playing late tomorrow or on <br>
Monday.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who is in on this project -- looks like it will <br>
be a great bunch of "Hometown Landmarks" letterboxes!<br>
