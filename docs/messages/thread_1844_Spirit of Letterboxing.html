                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to take a minute to thank Brian (Robin of Loxley) for<br>
taking the time to do some maintance on one of my boxes.  Since I<br>
won't be near this box anytime soon, he not only gave the box some<br>
much needed TLC, but will be mailing me the old logbook.<br>
<br>
Earlier this summer, Grandvilla and Mobius Klien did a rescue on<br>
another of my boxes that had been "evicted" from it's hiding place by<br>
some kind of critters-that-chew. This one was quite close by so they<br>
mailed everything back to me so I could do maintance and replace it.<br>
<br>
These are true examples of the spirit of letterboxers helping one another.<br>
<br>
Thanks also to anyone else who has ever performed these sorts of<br>
letterboxing maintance and acts of kindness.  I can't even imagine how<br>
many times someone has done simple things like: wiped the condensation<br>
out of one of my boxes, cleaned off a stamp that had gotten all<br>
"gooked" up or replaced worn out baggies for me.<br>

When I got home from Virginia last week, there was an e-mail waiting from my daughter in Rhode Island telling me that they had gone out letterboxing!  She has a stamp that I carved her a while back when she went with me, but she asked me to carve a stamp for hubby.<br>

I was pretty excited about that (not to mention jealous because she has so many boxes in her neck of the woods).<br>

I actually carry my stamp scrubber stuff that I bought and if we can, we<br>
scrub the stamps while we are there, LOL!  I figure if I am taking the few<br>
seconds to de-ink mine, I can clean the main one before I pack it back into<br>
the box.<br>

The multi-generationalism of this is what is so cool.   I get to play with<br>
my Daddy again!!!!!!  (-:  And I like it!  (and I'm not just saying this<br>

That's cool -- isn't it a good feeling when somebody you introduce to<br>
letterboxing begins doing it on their own?  You know they enjoy it and<br>
aren't just being nice when you ask them to go.  <snip><br>

I agree though that you still have to be really careful with that one kind<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
