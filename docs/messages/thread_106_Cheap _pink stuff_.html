                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to John from the Leapin' Lizards for giving us this website <br>
for cheap "pink stuff".  I just ordered some and noticed that it is <br>
even cheaper than he told us (I think).  If you want to check it <br>
out, go to<br>
<br>
http://www.in2art.com/product/277<br>
<br>
IMHO, the Speedball "pink stuff" is the best carving material out <br>
there, but it is the most expensive in the regular stores.  In2art <br>
has it pretty cheap (but they do seem to overcharge for shipping a <br>
bit).  This site also allows you to order bigger than normal sizes <br>
for the "pink stuff".<br>

<br>
I laquer before gluing personally.  They suggest using the spray <br>
polyurethane, but after giving it a try, I think I prefer to use <br>
brush-on.  Be sure you let the stamp image on the wood dry before <br>
you spray or brush the polyurethane on.  You don't laquer the bottom <br>
of the wood (the part to be glued to the stamp).  After a number of <br>
coats of polyurethene and after it has dried, rough up the bottom of <br>
the wood and the top of the stamp, apply the GOOP, let sit a minute <br>
or two, then put them together.  Let the GOOP dry a while in the <br>
open air.  This helps get rid of the strong smell of the GOOP too.<br>
