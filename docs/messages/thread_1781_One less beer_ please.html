When you're out at happy hours or at dinner tonight, ask your bartender or<br/>
wait staff for "one less beer."  It might raise some eyebrows until you<br/>
explain that you'd like a glass of water and that you'd like to place the<br/>
price of your beer (or martini or glass of wine) into the donation canister.<br/>
And what self-respecting establishment isn't going to have a canister for<br/>
flood relief donations? - if they don't, ask them to start one.  Tell your<br/>
friends, tell your bartender - heck, tell people you don't know - about the<br/>
one-less-beer campaign.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As you're enjoying your glass of water, think about all of the people who<br/>
can't get clean water and who have no homes.  "One less beer" by just a few<br/>
people might mean one more blanket, one more meal, one more shot of insulin,<br/>
one more glimmer of hope.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can do it.  Again and again.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don't drink alcohol, try the one-less technique on<br/>
bagels, coffee, dessert, cosmetics, pet treats, etc.  <br/>
