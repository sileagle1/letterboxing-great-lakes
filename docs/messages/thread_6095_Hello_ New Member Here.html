Oh boy, Apt.Dwellers, we are LOL over that last comment.  ALL of us on this message board and for that matter, those across the world, could report that we've seen "Their" stamp in quite a few letterboxes.  It becomes a completely new game to try and find a box that "They" haven't stamped into!  But, rest assured, a better duo of letterboxers aren't to be found!<br>

I have been monitoring the group just to get some idea of what was going on and the people who frequented the group. I enjoyed reading the interest shown for Boxacon. What a great bunch of letterboxers!<br>
<br>
It looks like my wife and I will be attending the next gathering in the area if at all possible. <br>
