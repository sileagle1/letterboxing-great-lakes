  Well, speaking of babies.....mine decided to come about 6:48am Wednesday morning. I woke up about 1:30am with some sharp pains, and told hubby I think it's time. He gave me a look as if this another false alarm. Well, we were at the hospital a littel before 4am, and I was dilated to 9. I was BEGGING for some drugs, and the doc came in, checked again, I was at 10, and he broke my water and said it was too late for any drug relief. I cussed out hubby for wanting to wait as long as we did. Well, after almost 3 hours of pushing, we got our little boy. (Luckily, I got all the Christmas shopping done on Monday and Tuesday, and everything wrapped as well.) <br/>

grandparents in 2006! I just love being a "ga-maw" (grin)!!!<br/>
<br/>
My grandson turned 2 this week -- such fun! <br/>
<br/>
My twin grand-daughters, who were born in Aug (at over 7lbs EACH!!)<br/>
have had multiple medical problems and hospitilizations since birth<br/>
are now finally on their way to wellness without the anticipation of<br/>
additonal problems! HURRAH!!! (Note: just because a baby is born<br/>
without a low birth weight doesn't mean there isn't the possibility or<br/>
potential of problems)<br/>
<br/>
There seems to have been many blessings among our members re: babies<br/>
this year.... I wonder if we should start a database for tracking<br/>
this?  I, for one, would love to see our potential membership<br/>
increase! (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>
