However, Czeltic Girl is a bit frantic these days, so the clues for box 6 have not been put <br>
inside box 5 yet. If you're heading out to do the series, print the clues ahead of time. <br>
<br>
I'm going to try to get the clues into box 5 sometime this weekend.<br>

Between the two, they're eating up all my letterboxing time!)<br>

Cambridge #6, Oak Leaf Letterbox is my box; is that the one you <br>
mean?  Your description doesn't seem to fit number # 5 (Rogue <br>
Stamp). <br>
<br>
The series is kinda far from home to run out and check it.  I'd <br>
appreciate any updates from the group so that I can replace it if <br>
necessary.<br>
<br>
If anyone ever runs into any problems with my boxes, let me <br>
know right away.  I take  box maintenance very seriously.  <br>
<br>
Of course, I also like to hear when things are right, too. :o)<br>

<br>
Actually, Box #5 is yours ("Oak Leaf") and #6 is mine ("Out of Water"). I've still got to put <br>
my box 6 clues in your box. I'm hoping to do so this weekend, and will definitely let you <br>
know about its status after I take care of that.<br>
<br>
I would have checked on it when I placed my box, but there were 4 hikers and a group of <br>
kids on bikes on the trail very nearby your location and I didn't want to give it away.<br>
