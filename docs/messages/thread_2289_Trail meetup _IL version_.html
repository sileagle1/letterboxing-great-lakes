                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of trail meet-ups, heres a belated report on our letterboxing<br>
weekend last Saturday & Sunday:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We started off early Saturday morning to find Snowy Evening, a new box<br>
placed in Milwaukee by Fermont (first box planted!).  It was a sunny, Snowy<br>
MORNING as we wound our way along the trail, boots crunching in the snow.<br>
It was good to be out on a sunny day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Next we hopped in the car for a longer drive down to Wauconda, IL for All<br>
the Worlds a Stage #1: Kindergarten and Singing Hills Forest Preserve<br>
(saw a hawk soaring overhead in a brilliant blue sky}.  Both boxes were in<br>
fine shape.  Next it was over to Volo for LCAS.  They were doing some<br>
controlled burning at the bog which was interesting.  When we walked on the<br>
boardwalk to the deck at the center of the bog we could hear the ice<br>
cracking beneath us  a sure sign that things were warming up and spring was<br>
on the way. We had our coats off or unzipped and didnt need any mittens.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Next was a visit with Ichabod.  A nice spot to stamp in  a table and a<br>
view, it doesnt get much better than that!  Lots of geese honking away at<br>
this spot.  (I found out later that the placer of this box, Domedreamer from<br>
Connecticut, is a relative of the Cottontails and we may get a chance to<br>
meet them when we are in CT in September.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After that it was on to the new mecca of letterboxing  Elgin, IL!  We found<br>
Stick a Fork in Me and the Keith Haring boxes, all excellent carvings.  At<br>
this park we met KissMeKate and Sylvie Rose La Fee and of course exchanged<br>
stamp images and chitchat.  On our way back to the car we ran into the<br>
Cottontails with friends Cake Baker and K8E.  More exchanges and chitchat!<br>
We barely had time to wrap up the day with The Cottontails Easter Egg<br>
 Hunt.  We had to be patient here since someone was practice driving in<br>
the parking lot, driving in circles over and over.  Arrgh!  Just when we<br>
thought they were gone, they were back AGAIN!  We had heard there had been a<br>
lot of LBing activity here in the morning, but we didnt meet anyone (but we<br>
think we passed Cmoon while driving from one park to the other.).  The<br>
stamps were very nice, as were the stamp containers.  It was on this series<br>
that we reached our F1200 mark (but not at the same rate as that couple who<br>
found 800 in one year!).  We also realized we had had one of those rare<br>
days  we found every single box we looked for!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We then decided to call it a day and headed over to Glenview for dinner and<br>
a hotel stay.  We were up early the next morning to go out on the hunt for<br>
the nine boxes KiddyWriter had recently placed (also nice carvings).  Unlike<br>
Saturday, the morning was overcast and by the time we found the ninth box a<br>
few snowflakes were floating down.  So much for spring!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Next was Grosse Point Light.  When we arrived there was a pretty bluish<br>
hue on the horizon, but by the time we were done stamping in everything was<br>
white/gray as the snow started up more seriously.  We decided we had time to<br>
detour over to Buffalo Grove/Palatine to try Buffalo Creek (found) and<br>
Spring Window (didnt find).  The snow was now wet and heavy, so out came<br>
the umbrellas, especially needed for the stamping in process.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Then it was on to our final destination, Lake Forest/Lake Bluff.  Beetle had<br>
asked us to retrieve her Beatles boxes, so we didnt have to worry about<br>
stamping in out in the snow.  Instead we simply collected the boxes and<br>
carried them along with us.  This was a very pretty walk with all the new<br>
snow clinging to the branches as we walked along the river/creek.  We<br>
decided we had time for one more box, so we headed for Sunrise Beach.  It<br>
was funny tromping along a snow covered sand beach in a snowstorm!  I dont<br>
think weve ever been to a beach in those conditions before  The clues had<br>
mentioned a shelter, so thats where we brought the box to stamp in, and<br>
then returned it to its hidey hole.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our last stop was the Full Moon restaurant where we had made plans to meet<br>
Beetle for dinner.  In the parking lot we opened all the boxes we had<br>
collected and had a Beatles Reunion in the car as we stamped in. Great<br>
stamps! We then turned them all over to Beetle when she arrived.  We spent<br>
an enjoyable hour or two chatting with her over dinner before we headed<br>
north to home.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, a GREAT weekend!  Thanks to all of you who plant boxes and make<br>
these adventures possible!<br>

What carving medium did you use to carve that?   It seemed like it would be<br>

We let Pico know right away and also noticed that someone else had trouble<br>
finding it in December according to the status logs.  Pico was disappointed<br>
to hear about it and planned to check on it soon.  It's possible we just<br>
missed it since there seemed to be perhaps a new fallen tree and there was<br>
still some snow in the area....<br>
<br>
I hope it's still there so we can have another try!<br>

I'm a little belated myself (from being out and about last weekend too)<br>
<br>
Sylvie-Rose and I (KissMeKate) had a great time in the warm weather on <br>
the 4th.  I found 3 of Lavender's boxes in the Roselle/Schaumburg area <br>
before meeting S-R for the Elgin boxes. <br>
<br>
T'was a very unusual day. I record number of boxes (25 for S-R and 28 <br>
for me) AND it was an impromptu gathering at the Easter boxes!  By the <br>
end of the day, we had done 13 exchanges. Richard (Barefoot Ankh was <br>
disappointed that he had to work that weekend, but he say's "Hi!" to <br>
everyone. S-R is definitely hooked on letterboxing now, even though I <br>
did tell her it was an unusual day!  We're looking forward to the <br>
gathering in June!<br>
