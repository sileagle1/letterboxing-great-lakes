We went out today to check on our adopted boxes at Independance Grove,<br>
Pleasant Valley is doing fine, but The Flower is missing AGAIN!  This<br>
after it went missing and we adopted.  Stay tuned for The Flower<br>
Redux, in a new, better position, maybe even with a couple more (a<br>
series, perhaps?)<br>
<br>
For a funny, while out there, we were rolling along slowly in our car,<br>
looking for a trail off the main drive that leads to the other side of<br>
Independance Grove, the part that you can sort of see from the road. <br>
There's a lot of fallen logs and it looks real neat.  Anyway, we<br>
rolled up the drive to the maintenance facility, and I got pulled<br>
over!!!  Why?  Because the ranger was worried I was lost!  How nice. <br>
I got lots of friendly advice as to where I was supposed to be driving<br>
and parking  and sent on my way.  UGh.  Oh well.<br>
<br>
Having fun? You bet.<br>
