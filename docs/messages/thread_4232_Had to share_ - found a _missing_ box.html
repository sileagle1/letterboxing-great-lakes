                    <div class="plaintext-content">I took Friday off to drive to my cousins wedding and just spent the <br>
day letterboxing once down there. There was a box at a rest stop <br>
marked as missing but my 3-year-old needed me to stop there anyway so <br>
I thought what the heck I'll go look for it and IT WAS THERE! it has <br>
been marked missing since October 06, last found in July 06 and I <br>
FOUND IT! It was my first box of the trip and was very exciting and <br>
energizing for this newbie. <br>
<br>
I had 9 boxes mapped out, found 6 including the lost one and ran out <br>
of time searching for the last one in a library where one of the <br>
books with the clue to it was checked out of the library (the clue <br>
said ask for help if needed and I did so they gave me the next clue <br>
and I found it) but that took me over 2 hours and I had a wedding <br>
rehersal I had to get to that was still an hour drive away. but the 4 <br>
left overs are all close to one area and close to the interstate so I <br>
should be able to go back to those someday when visiting with my <br>
family. (and when I got home I saw one of the ones I skiped was <br>
reported missing this weekend anyway so that gives it time to be <br>
replaces I guess.) But now I know to go ahead and look when someoen <br>
says it's missing.<br>
<br>
I sent a message tot he planter using both LbNA and AQ but have not <br>
heard from them again, but I get the impression from the listings <br>
that they are not active anymore.<br>

of it. :-) Or, more correctly, we enjoy patting ourselves on the back <br>
for being such clever letterboxers! :-)<br>

followed the clues even though I knew there was no box waiting at the <br>

I haven't found any, but maybe someday I'll be as lucky as you.<br>

My Witch's Hat Depot box was found!!!! Yee-haw!!!<br>
<br>
This is one I had been moaning about to everyone recently. A guy  <br>
emailed me this morning telling me it was found on the steps of the  <br>
museum building there... I had images of a bundled baby abandonded  <br>
there by someone, LOL!!!! My precious letterbox!!!<br>
<br>
Anyway... all the advice about don't hurry; wait to recarve it; wait  <br>
to decide whether to replace or move... was all good advice because  <br>
there it is, and looks like I don't have to recarve after all.<br>
