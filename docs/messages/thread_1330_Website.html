sharp objects. Last night, stirring peanut butter with a dull butter<br>
knife, just about lopped off my finger. Two days ago scissors in dish<br>
washer stabbed my wrist, almost lost a paw. Still scabby from the<br>
Briar patch I fell into while Letterboxing. Brushed my hair and the<br>
brush decided to brush my forehead off. Nibbled on a hangnail and took<br>
a piece of my thumb.<br>
<br>
Should I go on?<br>
Probably should never have told you guys at all.<br>
Oh look, there's Scheherezade, the one bleeding all over the trail.<br>
