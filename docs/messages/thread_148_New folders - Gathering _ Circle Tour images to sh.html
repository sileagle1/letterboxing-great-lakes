There ... having gotten that out of the way, I'd like to let you <br>
know that I've created a couple of new folders in the files area; <br>
one each for the Gathering and one for the Circle Tour series. <br>
<br>
They're under the main folder Deb created called "Member Stamp <br>
Carvings"  Here is a shortened link to the files area:<br>

<br>
Still not sure if Team Bindlestiff will make the Gathering but we <br>
will be sending Dragon a couple of boxes to place for us.  The one <br>
in the files is one I carved with the "Cooler By The Lake" theme.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
