park and placed it out in the open.  I will be heading that way this<br>
weekend for the CC state meet, but I don't think it'll stay where they<br>
put it until then.  If anyone in the area could go pick it up and<br>
maybe return it to its hiding location sooner than Friday, please<br>
email me off list and I'll let you know where they left it.<br>

Thanks!<br>
