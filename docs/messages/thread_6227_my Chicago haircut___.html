During my stay in Chicago while Seth was in the hospital, to get my mind off things I decided to get a haircut. Since I didn't know my surroundings well, I stopped at the first place I could find, an African American haircutting establishment.<br>
<br>
The lady asked me what I wanted done to my hair. I answered half jokingly, "Oh, I don't care, just make me look sexy."<br>
<br>
She replied, "Honey, that ain't what they be lookin' at. Besides, you walk into a room wearin' a Cubs hat and they a White Sox fan, theysee that right away. But God forbid yo' hair should be on fire."<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I left her a big tip for the much needed laughter.<br>
