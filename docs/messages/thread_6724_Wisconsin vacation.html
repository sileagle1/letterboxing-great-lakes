Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the carvers and planters who planted letter boxes!  Because of you, we were able to experience places we might not have seen (Bailey's Harbor Lighthouses and the Sturgeon Bay area to name a couple) if not for this great hobby of letter boxing.  We were only able to do the drive by boxes but we look forward to returning to the area.  Even my hubby who is only a boxer by marriage had a fun time.  Thanks again.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to hear you had fun!  We were also up in Door County recently.  Even though we have been there many times, we STILL found new places since we were on the hunt for some new letterboxes.  This hobby does indeed get you to many interesting spots!<br>

Door County my favorite place to box!!! I started my Letterboxing career boxing there in Sepetmber 2007. We make a trip up there every year since my wife loves the area so much. I am amazed at the number of new boxes that are placed up there every year. We are headed up there again this year in late September to see what we can find.<br>
<br>
Keep on placing those boxes<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We picked out a stamp for DH too.  I'm a bee, our daughter is a ladybug so we made him a googly spider and gave him the name spyD.  (Their nicknames for each other are big D for daddy and little d for the daughter.....hence the tie in with the letterboxing names.)  He doesn't want a logbook either and tells us if we get him one then he just may letterbox without us when he's on out of town business trips.  The nerve of the guy!!  Needless to say, we won't be gifting him with a logbook any time soon!!! :)<br>
