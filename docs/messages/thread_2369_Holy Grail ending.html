Does the DVD have lots of cool extras and things?  Like maybe a segment about the GL group doing a series of letterboxes about the film?  Hee hee.  --Papeseed   <br/>

PS: We just got through watching "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". Got the<br/>
DVD for my birthday. Wisconsin Hiker forgot how lame the ending was. Great<br/>
bits in there, though. Love the rabbit.<br/>

BindleBabe" ; - )<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me for using this forum for expressing some thoughts after <br/>
seeing what has been going down on other lists...<br/>
<br/>
Ever since the beginning of this particular group, we have always <br/>
taken great strides to be a very civil list. In fact, one could say <br/>
this is one reason this particular group was started, as many of us <br/>
were disenchanted with the "flaming" going on on the "big list".<br/>
<br/>
I am sure I am speaking for many, if not all, of the older and newer <br/>
members of this group when I say "thank you" to all of you wonderful <br/>
people, including BindleBabe. You have remained steadfast in <br/>
keeping this group free of anything even remotely close to what may <br/>
be considered "flaming", even with a wonderful BINGO April Fools' <br/>
joke fooling many of us. We got a great thing going here - let's <br/>
all give ourselves pats on our backs and continue to do whatever we <br/>
can to build this group up and never tear anyone or anything down. <br/>
I'm proud to be a member of one of the greatest groups to be <br/>
involved in!!!<br/>
<br/>
To BindleBabe, you are always welcome here. I hope that someday <br/>
your ship finds safe harbor here once again. Sail on!<br/>
<br/>
It's spring! Let's all get out and box!<br/>
Dragon<br/>
<br/>
P.S. If you disagree with anything I said, please "flame me" via <br/>
private email. Except Leapin' Lizards, you jerks! Your last email <br/>
was the LAST STRAW!!!!! ;-)<br/>

If you get the enhanced DVD I guess it has the whole "Lego" film <br/>
version as well.  Wish I knew that before I got just the single DVD <br/>
version. :-(<br/>
