What do some of you think of the practice?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have found that the outer bag makes it much easier for a critter to get<br>
hold of and drag away.  Also, if the box is in a tight place, or even just a<br>
stump with rough edges, the bag tears easily and is then worthless.  I find<br>
it much more effective to put the individual baggies (i.e. one for stamp,<br>
one for log book) into a zip lock box INSIDE the box.  A disadvantage of not<br>
using the outer bag is if the box gets open, things scatter easier.<br>
Sometimes I will put a rubberband around the outside of the box if it feels<br>
like to lid is not tight enough.<br>
