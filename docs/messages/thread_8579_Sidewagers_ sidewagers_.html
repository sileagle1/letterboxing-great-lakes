                    <html><body><p>Looking for some more entries for the side wagers game! You have until 1/7/18 to send me your submissions.<br/><br/>You do not need to be playing bingo to be in the side wagers game.  There is no "entry fee", it's just a little friendly side "bet" to add to the interest of the bingo game.<br/><br/>NOTE:  If you letterbox as part of a team/group/family with one trail name, you can send multiple submissions for your various members, just differentiate them some how for me.<br/><span><br/>Send me your top three guesses for the date the first "full card" bingo game will be won.  You will be assigned one date as your spot. If 
your first choice is taken, I will use the 2nd or 3rd choices subject to availability. If
 all three are taken, I’ll assign the first available date closest to your 
first choice.   Please E-MAIL me directly with your submission (baliddletoo@yahoo.com); DO NOT POST TO BOARD.</span><span>  With your submission, send me your real name, trail name and email address<br/></span></p><p><span>
<br/>
Must be 18 to play<br/>
<br/>
Player who is closest to the first full card win date (without going over) will get a small Letterboxing prize from me. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>I have sent confirmations to everyone I have already received, if you haven't received an email back from me, you should resend your info.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"/></span></p></body></html>
