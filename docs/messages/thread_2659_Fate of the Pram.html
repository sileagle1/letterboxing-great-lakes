Subject: Fate of the Pram<br>
<br>
Attention Seekers of the Holy Grail!<br>
<br>
There has been much speculation as to the fate of the poor infant which the knight had to push in the pram a lot. I have just returned from a quest through these hilly woods, and all is still well with the pram. It is right where I left it last, although a lot of trees have since fallen in its path. Therefore, I make these slight adjustments to the clues (if the Scribe and Keeper of Clues, Dragon, could be so kind as to quill these changes into his Book of Clues...)<br>
<br>
"The pram slipped from the knights grasp and rolled down a small hill toward the waterfall overlook but, before reaching it, veered off to the left. It slowed briefly on a flat landing, and the knight was relieved to see it take the level path on the left. It soon became clear that this path was not level at all, and the pram sped off down a steep hill, out of control, until it clunked along a bunch of rocks at the bottom and crashed into a tree in its path, stripping off most of the bark. Armor clanking, the knight finally caught up to the pram and rescued the frightened infant inside. They walked on the path to the right for a few steps and, when they came to a fork, took the right path, even though it looked rather forbidding with several downed trees blocking their way."<br>
