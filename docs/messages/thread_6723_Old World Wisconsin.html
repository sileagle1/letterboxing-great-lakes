I'll try again when the clean up from the tornado extends further out.  All but one of the usual museum buildings are open.  The damage to buildings was relatively minor, but the staff told us the property lost over 2000 trees!  DS has a field trip there this coming year, so I'll try again.  :)<br>

Dragon - thought of you while I was there as some of the buildings are representative of immigrants from Pomerania - and I believe it's you who has the Pomerania heritage LBs.  Oh, and to answer an old question, no my family does not run the SunnySideUp restaurant - though I am thinking of somehow working that place into some clues.  :)<br>
