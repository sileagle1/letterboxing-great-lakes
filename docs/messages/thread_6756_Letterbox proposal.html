      I am sure I am not the first to do this but I though some here might enjoy hearing my good news.  My girlfriend and I, the VBSP Bluegills, got engaged Saturday while letterboxing.  Over the past new month I managed to purchase a ring, carve special proposal stamp, find a park and location in a park that works, and write a clue without my girlfriend getting suspicious(we work different shifts sometimes).  My sister was in on it helping me partially write the clue and putting the box with the ring in it in the hiding spot about half an hour before we arrived.  She was on an overlook in the park making sure the ring was safe and video taping the whole thing.  She even wore camo and a camo facemask so we could not see her.  It went great.

<br/>
And yes, as many of you know, Atom and I started boxing about a year <br/>
after we started dating, and it has been a huge part of our <br/>
relationship.  We had a "letterboxing wedding" event that took place 6 <br/>
months prior to our actual wedding with many wedding-themed stamps, <br/>
which was a fun way to celebrate with our LB friends.  And again just <br/>
recently, our LB friends helped us to celebrate another upcoming <br/>
life-changing event by throwing us a little baby shower during the meet <br/>
&amp; greet with Mark and Sue!  Letterboxing itself, and especially the <br/>
community of fellow boxers, has definitely had an impact on our lives <br/>
too. :)<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you the best,<br/>
Coffee Beans (of Atomic Beans)<br/>

&gt;       I am sure I am not the first to do this but I though some here might enjoy hearing my good news.  My girlfriend and I, the VBSP Bluegills, got engaged Saturday while letterboxing.  Over the past new month I managed to purchase a ring, carve special proposal stamp, find a park and location in a park that works, and write a clue without my girlfriend getting suspicious(we work different shifts sometimes).  My sister was in on it helping me partially write the clue and putting the box with the ring in it in the hiding spot about half an hour before we arrived.  She was on an overlook in the park making sure the ring was safe and video taping the whole thing.  She even wore camo and a camo facemask so we could not see her.  It went great. I was a little behind getting the clue online, luckily I could backdate it.  Originally I tried to get Sundawg to put it up but I did not allow her enough time and she was having computer issues so I made a fake name,<br/>
&gt;  SunDowg.  we like her clues so I wanted to use her name so she would be excited to do that clue over the other few located in the park.  It went great, outside being a little cold.  We came from a family tailgate for the Western Michigan Broncos, and did the hunt. When we were done and she said yes, we went back and told her family after the game.  everything went great!  It was a great day for the Bluegills.  anyway, long story short we love the hobby, been doing it for almost 2 years, 120 finds, 2 plants with more to come.  We are hooked.  Wanted to share with others who would truely appreciate it, most people we tell are just like ????<br/>

I am sure I am not the first to do this but I though some here might enjoy hearing my good news. My girlfriend and I, the VBSP Bluegills, got engaged Saturday while letterboxing. Over the past new month I managed to purchase a ring, carve special proposal stamp, find a park and location in a park that works, and write a clue without my girlfriend getting suspicious(we work different shifts sometimes). My sister was in on it helping me partially write the clue and putting the box with the ring in it in the hiding spot about half an hour before we arrived. She was on an overlook in the park making sure the ring was safe and video taping the whole thing. She even wore camo and a camo facemask so we could not see her. It went great. I was a little behind getting the clue online, luckily I could backdate it. Originally I tried to get Sundawg to put it up but I did not allow her enough time and she was having computer issues so I made a fake name, SunDowg. we<br/>
 like her clues so I wanted to use her name so she would be excited to do that clue over the other few located in the park. It went great, outside being a little cold. We came from a family tailgate for the Western Michigan Broncos, and did the hunt. When we were done and she said yes, we went back and told her family after the game. everything went great! It was a great day for the Bluegills. anyway, long story short we love the hobby, been doing it for almost 2 years, 120 finds, 2 plants with more to come. We are hooked. Wanted to share with others who would truely appreciate it, most people we tell are just like ????<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the boxers in our area who plant all the great boxes, it's because of you we are hooked! <br/>
