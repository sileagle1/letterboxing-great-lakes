Remember High School?  Did you like it?  Hate it?<br>
<br>
Does it bring back good memories??<br>
<br>

Well if the memories are good ~ get out your old yearbook, carve<br>
your mascot, include the year your graduated and join this ring!<br>

Taking up to 30 sign ups, plan to mail on April 1st.<br>

Oh, this one sounds fun, but I will have to pass this time.  I planted 2 boxes with this <br>
