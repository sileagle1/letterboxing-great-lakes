My computer broke about 2 weeks ago, maybe longer, at this point who's keeping count of the days.  It might be repairable.  So I am reduced to 1 hour appointment sessions at the local library to read my hotmail messages.  However, their system will not allow me to connect to AQ, LBNA, or LbGLK.  I can only read hotmail and reply to messages.  UGH!  I HATE COMPUTERS!!!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
As a result, I can't get clues or go letterboxing.  COLD TURKEY!  This is maddening.  It IS an addiction and I don't want to stop.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
And I can only use the library computer when they are open, and they aren't open most nights.  And I don't have <br>
<br>
internet access at my job....maybe I need a different job; one with internet access.  LOL!  <br>
