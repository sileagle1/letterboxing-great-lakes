                    <div class="plaintext-content">Definitely yes! I have it on my arm now. The biggest problem with poison ivy is that it is a vine that can climb up trees to. So it is found low to the ground and up trees. My daughter describes it as looking like your hand when you have your fingers closed together. It can have a reddish tint to it, or be all green. <br>
