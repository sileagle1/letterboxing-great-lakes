This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those who missed it, THE boxes to find this weekend were the <br>
Haunted Trail series in Western Springs, IL...The weather was so <br>
spectacular that we could've been lbing anywhere in the Chicagoland <br>
area and it would have been fabulous...But, here we found 10, yep, <br>
we said 10 boxes at one of CMoon's favorite haunts - Bemis Woods!<br>
Not only were the stamps great, but we had just begun when the ever <br>
observant Tonto spotted a woman with clues in hand and markers in <br>
her bag!  Ah Ha! he thought (rare for Tonto...just kidding) another <br>
boxer - we introduced ourselves and found out she was "Prairie Dog", <br>
and asked her to join us. (Which she willingly agreed....I didn't <br>
have to beg her....amazing!)<br>
We were only half way through the series when the astute Tonto again <br>
spotted two ladies seated on the ground carefully coloring with <br>
markers!  We couldn't believe it!  We've never run into other LBers <br>
on the trail except at gatherings, let alone twice on the same <br>
trail....So exchanges were made with "PGranola" and "Calliope".<br>
We decided that the way to get everyone out to your boxes is to warn <br>
perspective finders that the box is temporary!  Sure worked for <br>
these fun boxes!<br>
We reiterate a big thanks to Kookaburra, Squeek and Cmoon for yet <br>
another delightful time letterboxing!<br>
