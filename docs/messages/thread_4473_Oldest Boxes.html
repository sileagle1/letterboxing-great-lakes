                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, the oldest box in IL is/was the one in Evanston.  It has been <br>
missing for quite some time.  It was amazing that it survived as long <br>
as it did as the place was very tenuous. I personally found it and <br>
checked on it a couple of times and verified it was missing.  Without <br>
checking my records, I'm sure it was placed before 2000.<br>
<br>
As for WI, I've been trying to get up to Door Cty. to check on <br>
placement dates.  The main reason is that we are trying to have a 10 <br>
year anniversary gathering for WI and I needed to know the date of <br>
the placement of Cave Point and to verify that it was the first <br>
plant, as there is some dispute as Beetle brought up.  My memorory <br>
needs clarifying, but I beleive that Cave Point IS the first in Sept. <br>
1998 and Mink River was placed in the spring of 1999 (sloppy 9 looks <br>
like an 8 in the log?).<br>
<br>
Just a note on Mink River...it may not be there much longer.  A <br>
ranger contacted me to remove it, but we have tried to contact him <br>
MANY times without any response from him.  Personally, this has led <br>
me to believe that he either doesn't have the authority he said he <br>
had or the email I got was a fake.  As for now, I'm not removing the <br>
box until he contacts me again.<br>

Tonto and I found the Mink River box back in May of 2003.  While looking for it, a prof <br>
from University of Illinois came out of the "cabin" to see what we were doing...He took one <br>
look at us and asked if we were looking for the Mink River letterbox...Surprised, we told <br>
him that indeed we were.  He nonchalantly walked us over to the exact location of the box <br>
(he must've known how inept we are at finding boxes) all the while explaining how much <br>
he didn't like the intrusion from letterboxers as the area was a rare habitat of the <br>
endagered Hine's Emerald Dragonfly that he was studying.  We have marveled that the box <br>
has remained in place for the past 4 years knowing that the authorities have known (and <br>
not been happy) about the letterbox's existence on the property.  We did engage him in a <br>
long diatribe about the benefits letterboxing brings of getting more people connected with <br>
nature...but, back then letterboxing was still in it's infancy and the number of letterboxers <br>
actually finding the box was very few compared to the visits it probably now generates.<br>

=======================================<br>
<br>
The Hine's Emerald Dragonfly is also the reason DuPage County forest<br>
preserve folks would prefer not to have letterboxers and geocachers in<br>
Waterfall Glen preserve in Darien, IL without an approved permit.  From what<br>
I understand, there's a slim possibility they might be there, tho as of<br>
March 2007, when the study was finished, Waterfall Glen wasn't included as a<br>
site.  It's one of the most endangered of the dragonflies.<br>
<br>
For anyone who might be interested in locations where colonies have been<br>
found in IL to possibly avoid placing boxes there, the March, 2007 report is<br>
at:<br>
<br>
http://www.museum.state.il.us/research/entomology/hines/2007_IL_HED_final_re<br>
port.pdf<br>
<br>
There are a few sites in Kane County along the Fox River for the dragonfly.<br>
I did see one Hine's in the vicinity of one of the Grail boxes out there.<br>
As soon as I saw that, we left.  Didn't want to look any further for the<br>
box.  Saw a couple of birds in that area also that are on the threatened<br>
list.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is the complete opposite of other stories I have heard about <br>
letterboxers meeting the researchers.  I have gotten stories that the <br>
researchers are happy to have letterboxers stop by and look forward <br>
to sharing info on their study.<br>
<br>
Now I hear there is actually a sign saying "no longer a letterboxing <br>
site".  I guess the box will be moved.  They could have the curtesy <br>
to reply to emails and phone calls though...<br>
