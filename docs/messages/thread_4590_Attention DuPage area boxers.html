The following (edited) message was received regarding letterboxes in <br>
DuPage County Preserve.<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
(snips)<br>
"We want to get as many people out to the preserves, enjoying<br>
the beauty of nature.  Letterboxing is a great way to get people<br>
 started<br>
on visiting the preserves or keeping them coming out.  When we noticed<br>
how many people were coming out for geo-caching we went through this<br>
same process.  They have one main website that we worked with and got<br>
 on<br>
the same page with the people placing caches.  They went though the<br>
Forest Preserve District to get all caches and locations approved (they<br>
all have our stickers on them) and they are registered with us in case<br>
we have any issues with their caches.  I was hoping to get all of the<br>
people placing Letterboxes in DuPage County do go through the same<br>
approval process.  <br>
<br>
Your LbNA website seems to be the biggest<br>
organization posting locations and clues for boxes.<br>
<br>
(He refers to LbNA, not the Great Lakes Yahoo list)<br>
<br>
If you would<br>
contact the people posting at the site so they could get our approval<br>
 to<br>
place letterboxes I would really appreciate it. <br>
<br>
(snips) <br>
<br>
we would really like to<br>
get all of these formally approved and make sure they are following all<br>
regulations & guidelines we have in place.  Thanks again for all of<br>
 your<br>
assistance!  <br>

cranky rangers telling them how much buisness they are getting. Maybe <br>
they would change thier policies.<br>
