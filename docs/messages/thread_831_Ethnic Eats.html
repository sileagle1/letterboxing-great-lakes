                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK let's see:<br>
were I come from there is one national dish: "Asado", barbecue should be the translation, but this has some differencences with the grilling you do up here:<br>
 <br>
It is done in a huge grill, this is is a small brick and mortrar construction just out of the house, even if your bussines is to grill 2 pounds of cow ribs for yourself you set a nice fire and use about 50 sq. inches of your big grill. Some other people like to use an iron cross, hang a good piece of meat from it and set the fire on the ground near where the cross is planted.<br>
 <br>
We don't grill over the fire, usually use the red-hot coils, so sometimes when there is a big celebration there is one person paddling hot coils in to the grill from a side fire!<br>
and the whole proccess may take about 2-3 hours (since starting the fire to having the meant on the table)<br>
 <br>
What we put on the grill?<br>
well, every single part of the cow and her family 8^)<br>
The ribs are THE meat to be grilled, the thin muscle in the belly called "matambre" (deformation of kill-the-hunger in spanish) is also premium meat for that.<br>
 <br>
Then the sausage (like bratburst or Italian S.) and a german thing called "Bloodburst".<br>
 <br>
Additionally we have the "thin" intestines (mexicans call it "tripa", we give'em a funnier denomination), we even grill the last part of the "coarse" intestine (after careful wash), also the udder, the kidneys and pancreas are grilled.<br>
 <br>
And whe have an infusion called "mate" that tastes like green tea but the aspect is quite different, the person in charge of the grill ussually has another person that provides him/her with mates (each mate is just a sip) all the time. <br>
 <br>
Now imagine: one person cooking, another helping with the hot coils, another one bringin this "tea" every 2 minutes, and a bunch of people going around and giving opinion:<br>
 <br>
One says: "hey buddy, think you'll be short on the fire"<br>
Another: "nah! the fire will be OK, but I think the cooking is going to fast"<br>
A third: "maybe if you move that piece of meat..."<br>
 <br>
And of course, because we are latinos everybody talks LOUD and at the same time Ha! Ha! Ha!<br>
 <br>
all in all, the food is nice, but the circus around its preparation... that's awsome!<br>

Since we're talking Ethnic Eats here, the drippy bacon grease bread reminded me of something my Croatian grandma used to make.  Stoogelina (that's how I always heard it pronounced, but per my internet search just now I got spellings of both studzienina and studeninja).  Anyway, it's jellied pigs feet, and from what I understand, a common Eastern Eurpoean dish in general.  Wasn't that appetizing, to go to my grandparents and see the dish of jellied pigs feet sitting on the kitchen table? :)  She used to also make vegetable soup with tripe in it.  They used to tell me the tripe pieces were chicken.  With my father, they just told him it was tripe, and he nodded and ate, never asking what exactly tripe was...<br>

It was called "Stip" (that may not be the correct spelling). It is a Dutch food<br>
which consists of white bread, deep-fried in bacon grease and then smothered<br>
with syrup and eaten for breakfast along with the 3 lbs. of bacon that you<br>
fried to get the grease to cook the stip. How's that for clogging the<br>
arteries?<br>

This reminds me of another Dutch favorite I've heard of, but never tired...<br>
Bread, heavily buttered with non-perils sprinkled on...eaten like a sandwich. My, my, my - this sounds positively yuck!<br>
