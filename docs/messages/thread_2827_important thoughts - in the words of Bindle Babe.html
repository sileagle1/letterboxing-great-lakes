the cookie jar", I thought I'd share something I came across while<br>
looking up clues.<br>
<br>
These comments were written by Bindle Babe and included at the bottom of<br>
a set of clues she posted.  Since I am giving credit where credit is<br>
due, BB, I hope you do not mind me reposting them here.  I think they<br>
are very important for all of us, both new and experienced letterboxers<br>
to keep in mind.<br>

<br>
And I quote:<br>
<br>
"ATTENTION NEW, OR BEGINNING LETTERBOXERS:<br>
Before you begin please consider the effort that goes<br>
into carving a stamp, maybe even hand making a logbook,<br>
and then to find a secure spot to hide the box in the<br>
vicinity of a certain area or site. All of that effort<br>
spent for no other reason that to bring some enjoyment<br>
into the world.<br>
<br>
Be aware of your surroundings; enjoy the view from where<br>
you are. Letterboxes are often place in areas for a<br>
certain reason, spend a moment to consider why the placer<br>
may have chosen to share this area with others, by drawing<br>
them here with the lure of a letterbox find.<br>
<br>
Please! Survey the area for people who may be watching<br>
what you're doing. Remember, a common activity is<br>
"people watching"... someone may be watching you! Please<br>
don't give away the hiding spot to others who might not<br>
share the appreciation of this activity. If you will use<br>
care when you replace the box in it's hiding space, you<br>
can be sure you won't contribute to a box being lost,<br>
stolen, or destroyed.<br>
<br>
Consider that there would be no letterboxing, if there<br>
were no boxes to find. Missing boxes not only deprive<br>
other boxers of the same sense of enjoyment you just<br>
experienced, but the person who created the box has lost<br>
all the time they spent and sadly, may someday choose<br>
to stop placing boxes."<br>
