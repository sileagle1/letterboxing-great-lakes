the local (Rockford) newspaper reported that 4 of the 11 parks were closing <br/>
and Castle Rock and Lowden were on the list to close.  I certainly hope that <br/>
I'm wrong or that things change for the better next spring.<br/>

You might want to double check on that.  As of last week it had been <br/>
reported that all 11 of the state parks slated to be closed would remain <br/>
open as our "wonderful" governor restored part of the budget cuts that were <br/>
made.  I know for sure that Kickapoo is staying open and I'd bet that Castle <br/>
Rock is also staying open.<br/>

NamVet and I (and the 2 shelties) will be heading south to Castle Rock State<br/>
<br/>
Park tomorrow to pull two letterboxes, "Castle Rock" and "Graceful Flight."<br/>
<br/>
That park is slated to close December 1, thanks to our wonderful governor.<br/>
