I've sent thank you emails to our guest stamp carvers and will be <br>
sending them a set of the zodiac stamps.  I only wish I had time to <br>
stamp everything for them!  Thanks to all who contributed to the zodiac <br>
and everything else.  What a fun day!<br>

Skeeter was asleep before her little head hit the pillow.<br>

I am still awake . . . why???<br>

I agree with TG, and I quote, "it was stamp stamp stamp stamp stamp stamp  <br>
stamp stamp stamp stamp <br>
stamp stamp stamp"<br>
 <br>
I apologize if I seemed dazed and confused. This was our first Gathering  and <br>
I was SO overwhelmed. I truly didn't mean to be so quiet and to myself -- I  <br>
just wanted to get as many stamps as possible -- without loosing Skeeter ("has <br>
 anyone seen my daughter?") I must say that my puny stamps where put to  <br>
shame!<br>
 <br>
Thank you for such an enjoyable day. Look forward to seeing you all again  on <br>
the trail or at another gathering!<br>

No such thing in letterboxing! (Except for maybe store-bought stamps.)<br>
All carving attempts are appreciated! :-)<br>

Not true, Not true!!  I thought your stamps were terrific!!  It was <br>
really a pleasure meeting everyone and also seeing "old friends" <br>
again.  I think that there were some people we missed that we will have <br>
to meet later, and we also didn't get to finish stamping.  We are still <br>
getting used to working with an infant and stamping at the same time.  <br>
Emily had a great time and is already asking when the next gathering is.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got home from Illinois, since we decided to make it a full <br>
Letterboxing weekend, in honor of the event.<br>
<br>
Beetle & FungusWoman did a fantastic job with the SILO event!  So <br>
many interesting Chinese decorations, lucky envelopes, and oodles & <br>
oodles of boxes.  I know we didn't even stamp into half of those that <br>
were available.<br>
<br>
We enjoyed meeting some of the newer boxers for the first time.  The <br>
Brat Pack are incredible!  How can a family have so many kids, yet <br>
find the time to make such cute gifts for everyone attending the <br>
event?  The crafty oragami-type animals matched the theme of the <br>
zodiac animals and the little Chinese word symbol stamps were <br>
enclosed in fabric covered containers that reminded me of fortune <br>
cookies.  So clever!  It was fun to meet some of the others that are <br>
as obsessed (I mean enthusiastic) as the rest of us.  HartX6 and <br>
Chirodoc come to mind!  Of course it was also nice to meet the famous <br>
Miss Emily in person (although she seemed to be a good sleeper even <br>
with all the commotion).<br>
<br>
Speaking of cooties - we arrived with 5 and went home with 6.  I <br>
later realized that I should have just started handing them to the <br>
1.5 year old Brat Pack member.  He probably would have taken them <br>
willing.  Skeeter would have also probably taken them.  That's my <br>
plan for the next event - just keep handing them to the little kids <br>
(and don't leave my backpack open & unattended!).<br>
<br>
I loved looking at the photos FungusWoman posted - yes we were a sea <br>
of red yesterday afternoon!<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to hopefully seeing many of you at the regional <br>
event in June.<br>

<br>
P.S.  On Saturday morning, and all day today, we were out boxing in <br>
the significant snow that had fallen in the area.  We did 6+ miles <br>
yesterday and probably 8+ today.  Some trails were already a bit <br>
packed down, but on some we were blazing a trail through snow a foot <br>
or more deep.  Quite a workout for the old legs - like walking on <br>
sand...  Thanks to Cherokee Rose 2 & Hawkeye and Atom118 & <br>
CoffeeBeans for hiding some series of boxes on longer hikes - those <br>
are our favorites!<br>

I was infected too - 5 times!  Do we dare ask everyone and then total up all the cooties that were released at the Silo?  Do we really want to know how many were released?  The next time we get together, all the cooties from the Silo event cold be re-released PLUS new ones too!  I'll say this much - it's great being a member of this friendly letterboxing group...but we need a plan!  Travel light, no bags, no purses, no  pockets.  And no large Rubber Maid storage bins -  I guess I wasn't thinking.  I found 4 inside that box of party supplies.  <br>

Hopefully if someone tries to give my dogs a cootie they try it with Tatsu, Aina will probably shy away and they'll be caught red-handed.  BTW, what's the "penalty" for being caught passing a cootie?<br>
