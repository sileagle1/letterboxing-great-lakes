                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes!  A new installment in the TTE boxes in now available!  I was asked by the administration to make modifications to my student project, so these boxes are all in the same park (Regner Park in West Bend, WI. -different hiding spots than TTE 1).<br>
<br>
Although the boxes are in place, I have not had the opportunity to modify the clues for letterboxers just yet, but if you are up to trying them as is, you can email me to request the student version of the clues.<br>
