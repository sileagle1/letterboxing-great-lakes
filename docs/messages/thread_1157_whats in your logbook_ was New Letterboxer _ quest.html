Sorry I couldn't resist the word play on those awful "whats in your<br/>
wallet" comercials. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
When I stamp into my log, the minimum I like to include:<br/>
* Name of the box<br/>
* Who placed it/carved it<br/>
* Date it was placed<br/>
* Location of the box<br/>
* Date I found the box<br/>
* The "F" count number it is for me<br/>
<br/>
Then if there's time, I like to make little journal entry notes as<br/>
well. Those might include who I was with, my feelings about the area I<br/>
was brought to or observations made of the flora/fauna, notes about<br/>
the clues and/or my experiences solving them, I may jot down something<br/>
about the hiding spot or container, or even record my feelings about<br/>
the logbook or stamp.  I might make notes about the weather (think<br/>
MiniMeet day last year!!) the box condition/maintance done, or even<br/>
any ideas spawned for boxes of my own (grin) <br/>
<br/>
Most often there isn't time for those kinds of journal notes while I'm<br/>
out boxing so I jot down things in my own version of short hand. Of<br/>
course I fully intend to get back to those scribbles and turn them<br/>
into a lovely journal entry that I can look back on from the future,<br/>
with fond memories ... but that doesn't always happen, so I have quite<br/>
a few pages in my log that still have my cryptic short-hand scribbles. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

the stamp, a date found? A little journal entry?  <br/>
