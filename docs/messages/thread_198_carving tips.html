the mistakes I've made would fill a book, but (hopefully) I've <br/>
learned from them.<br/>
Okay a couple of tips:<br/>
First, I use *strong* magnifying glasses.<br/>
Next, I raise the work on a wooden block until it's about 5-6 inches<br/>
from my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Towards the end of the process, I use a light colored ink to test the<br/>
stamp. That way I can still see the dark parts of the transferred<br/>
image which remain on the block and still need to be removed.<br/>
Only when I think it's almost finished do I use black ink to test.<br/>
<br/>
Anxiously awaiting others' contributions...<br/>

I'll watch the list and see what shows up. I may add a few more later.<br/>

This way you not only get light where you need it, but you can see where you work!!<br/>
