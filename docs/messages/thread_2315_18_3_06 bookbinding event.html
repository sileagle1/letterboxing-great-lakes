                    <div class="plaintext-content">   So here is the account of Saturday 18.3.06 which I spent 6 hours <br/>
away from c-u in Clear Lake, Indiana.  Why did my mum and I go all <br/>
the way out there?  For a letter boxing event on bookbinding.  What <br/>
is letter boxing?  Try looking at these two sites...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Drive there<br/>
	We got on the road about a half hour late, I was driving <br/>
because mum's not really an early morning person, but after about <br/>
two hours I NEEDED food, so mum and I switched places.  After Sudoku <br/>
puzzles and sleep I found out that mum was lost, so we ended up <br/>
being even later than we had so planed.<br/>
<br/>
Stab binding with Acorn<br/>
	So by the time we got there we had missed `book binding 101' <br/>
and were already on to stab binding with Acorn, we were learning the <br/>
tortes shell stitch.  Acorn was so nice and patient, but I had to <br/>
feel bad watching her run around so much because we were all getting <br/>
ahead of her, sorry Acorn, the instruction books you made were just <br/>
do pretty we just couldn't help reading them.  Once I got the first <br/>
stitch the rest really just fell into place, mum had a bit of <br/>
trouble with it though, sorry mum.<br/>
<br/>
Button hole stitch with Boot Prints<br/>
	After stab binding we moved right onto the button hole <br/>
stitch with boot prints :).  She already had much experience with <br/>
teaching and it showed.  She came with a lot of her personal work, <br/>
it was quite inspiring.  In her lesson she kept us all moving step <br/>
by step together by holding the instructions from us till the end.  <br/>
This was one of my favourit bindings I made and I used the book I <br/>
made as a log book for the event.<br/>
	At the end some of us decorated our books with beads (me!) <br/>
while others of us looked at the books boot prints had made and <br/>
brought along with her (mum).<br/>
<br/>
Lunch &amp; Stamp exchange<br/>
	Well there was Veggie food, but it was all raw.  All the <br/>
same I did eat quite well.  When we were all done eating we spent <br/>
time estranging stamps.  Since I had forgotten my log book!  I had <br/>
to use one of the books I had made that day. <br/>
<br/>
Altered books with Dog Lovers<br/>
	After we were... um... sort of done trading stamps dog <br/>
lovers started teaching us how to make altered books.  Altered book <br/>
is were you take an old books and do two things to them, one you <br/>
turn the back of the book into a cubby hole to hide a stamp in, and <br/>
two you put pretty paper and decorations in the front to make a log <br/>
book.  We all got a pre-prepared book to alter, mine was green, then <br/>
we blindly chose and envelope which we later learned held our <br/>
subject (pictures or words to decorate our log book) I got poems.  <br/>
It was quite difficult for us to not read our books, especially mum <br/>
who got a book titled "The Methuselah Enzyme" and it had to do with <br/>
everything from weather or not Bloody marys' were a multivitamin or <br/>
not to roomers about sex!  Mum just couldn't help reading it out <br/>
loud.<br/>
<br/>
Coptic stitch with Boot Prints<br/>
	Spring Chick was supposed to teach us this one but had to <br/>
miss the workshop due to a personal loss.  Due to this boot prints <br/>
took over, the only problem was that she did the stitch differently <br/>
than spring chick, so we all sort of made it up as we went along and <br/>
had fun (well almost all of us)<br/>
<br/>
The Drive Home<br/>
	The sun was setting and we were driving west, but soon we <br/>
got out of it.  After we got on the interstate and mum started to <br/>
fall asleep I took over driving.  I was really nice and we even go <br/>
to some nice chatting in which we don't normally do.<br/>
	All in all it was a great day.<br/>
