 I'm interested in any critiques on it before I publish it on Sunday.<br>

I think it looks great! I read flyers all over school, but rarely <br>
ever go to the events because half the time the person making the <br>
flyers doesn't say what the event is all about. By you putting the <br>
address for the LbNA site on there, I think more people will be <br>
interested. They will get an idea of what it is going to be about by <br>
going to the site to decide whether or not to go.<br>
<br>
Are some of your students or their parents going to come to it as <br>
well? If so, will they give us math lessons so that some of us can <br>
figure out those Mathman clues? :)<br>
