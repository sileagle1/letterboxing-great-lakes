necessary household chores (cleaning gutters, trimming hedges, etc) it <br/>
seems like everyone else was out &amp; about on the trails.  We <br/>
got "contact the placer" messages from several different people today, <br/>
telling us of their adventures finding (or not finding) nine different <br/>
boxes of ours - ranging from the MI U.P. down to our most recent plant <br/>
in Illinois.  It sounds like that park was a busy boxing spot today.  <br/>
Trail Rider said she was out with Pastor's Wife and then met P. Granola <br/>
on the trail and then also met a family who had recently started boxing <br/>
in a different area of the park.<br/>

Glad to hear everyone is having fun and we appreciate the status <br/>

Wisconsin Hiker, your Email prompted me to carve and plant a new  letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda along the lines of my limited time only stamp of February of this  year <br/>
(for those of you not on list yet, I hid a box in my driveway the  night of a <br/>
snow storm.... to find it you had to find our house and shovel the  driveway <br/>
BEFORE I got up for work the next morning).<br/>
<br/>
This box is a little more forgiving as far as time limit... it will remain  <br/>
until someone finds it!!! Could be tomorrow, could be next spring -- but why  <br/>
risk it, hurry up before someone beats you to the punch!!<br/>
<br/>
CLUES;<br/>
<br/>
Find our house... take the interstate, to the avenue to the street. We are  <br/>
the white house down that street!<br/>
<br/>
Once at our house start cleaning out our gutters. This is a micro box  hidden <br/>
beneath the leaves and sludge of one of our gutters.<br/>
<br/>
If you clean all the gutters and come up empty handed, move on to the next  <br/>
house as you probably cleaned out our neighbors gutters by mistake . . . they  <br/>
would be very grateful of your mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and happy hunting!!<br/>

P.S. I can't take all the credit for this idea, so thanks Wisconsin Hiker  of <br/>
being my inspiration!<br/>

Wow, luckily so many of YOU were out &amp; about finding boxes - we got to <br/>
live vicariously through all the status update reports!  We had <br/>
originally planned to do a nice 10-mile hike in the Southern Kettle <br/>
Moraine area with our hiking club on Sunday.  However our conscience <br/>
got the better of us and we stayed home to do MORE mundane house <br/>
stuff!  So intead of actually being out on the trails ourselves, we <br/>
enjoyed hearing that even more of our boxes were found on Sunday - the <br/>
WI State Bird, way in the northwestern part of the state, a couple of <br/>
boxes at Devil's Lake (a really nice place to hike), Governor Dodge <br/>
(more good hiking), and another finder for our most recent box in <br/>
Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to seeing a bunch of you at the "Wedding" this <br/>
weekend.  We haven't been to IL since the SILO event (so missed the <br/>
locusts, floods, and other IL natural wonders).  It sure looks like you <br/>
guys have been BUSY down there - so many new boxes for us to find!!  <br/>
We'll barely make a dent on Saturday morning....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL!!!    You guys probably won't believe it, but on the day we planted<br/>
those Devil's Lake boxes we started out hunting boxes at Mirror Lake with<br/>
our 9-year old nephew and 12-year old niece.  It was a VERY hot day, so<br/>
after boxing in the morning we surprised them with a visit to the Noah's Ark<br/>
water park.  After we spent the rest of the day there, we left at about 5<br/>
pm.  It was still quite hot but all 4 of us, tired from all the sun &amp; water<br/>
park activities, made the hike all the way up &amp; down &amp; around the lake to<br/>
hide the boxes.  The kids were groggy starting out, since they had fallen<br/>
asleep in the car, but picked up steam by the time we got halfway around.<br/>
After hiding the boxes, we all changed into our suits and went for a late<br/>
swim in the lake before heading home. Of course we stopped to find the "I<br/>
Believe in Ferries!" box on the way.  A long but fun day!<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  I just got ANOTHER report of people out hunting our boxes this<br/>
weekend!  Aimlesst was getting in the Christmas mood with our Botanicals<br/>
series.  I should tally up all the reports &amp; logs we got - I guess everyone<br/>
was out &amp; about before the snow flies.  I DON'T like the dark &amp; cold period<br/>
we are moving into...<br/>

&gt; Count us in for #10...We found Martini Man's "Get the Lead Out" today<br/>
&gt; in Dodgeville! We sure did talk about the famous Wisconsin duo<br/>
&gt; (WI/MM) today...At one point Tiptoe muttered as she was climbing up<br/>
&gt; in elevation..."They must have legs of steel!"<br/>
&gt; "Who are you talking about?" Tonto asked.<br/>
&gt; "Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man, that's who!" she snapped back.<br/>
&gt; "We'll have to ask them next week at "The wedding"!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our suggestion is that Nov. 4th should go down as "National Hunt for<br/>
&gt; WI/MM Letterbox Day!"<br/>
