2.5 inches of rain fell, flooding the area.  After a week, the water <br>
finally dried up enough that I could finally get back there to check <br>
if the box washed away.  It managed to stay wedged under the branches <br>

completely dry on the inside.  So to The Cats Meow and all else, the <br>
lock n locks seem to be water tight.  My only concern is the hinges <br>
