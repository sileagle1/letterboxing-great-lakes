<br>
On Saturday we headed west to try to hunt down some of the MANY boxes WalesFlyerMary has planted recently.  However we first started out with a LS&B pin-up.  Rita had weathered the winter well in Wisconsin.  On our way to meet her, we checked on a few older boxes along the way that were planted for GLG 2006 "Wandering in Wonderland" event.  We are very happy to report that the Enormous Puppy, Bill the Lizard and the Dormouse were all in perfect shape.  A Wisconsin winter did them no harm and they are ready to greet more visitors.<br>
<br>
We then found 10 of the 11 WFM boxes we hunted.  For those of you who appreciate a "total package" where box, clues and location all relate to a common theme, be sure to check out her "Caesar" box.  She actually even incorporated the plant date into the theme!  We also enjoyed her boxes that included a hike, especially on a nice spring day like Saturday.<br>
<br>
Sunday we planted 2 new boxes - clues still to be written, but they are both Martini Man "Musical Mystery Tour" boxes.  We also tried to find some Kermit boxes.  We enjoyed the hike along the Milwaukee river but were unfortunately unable to find the box.  Bummer!  Oh well, try, try again...<br>
