Found Tom George in Madison.  What a great tree!  Isn't Tom George MI <br/>

<br/>
Membership is on approval, so it won't happen immediately, but between<br/>
Azobox and myself, we usually get people approved within a few hours of<br/>
their request, and so far we haven't turned anyone away as long as they<br/>
mention the reason they are here is because of letterboxing.  It is more<br/>
just to ward off potential spammers.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you are having a great time in WI!<br/>
