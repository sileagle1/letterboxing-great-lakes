it just refers to a very closeby neighbor stamp in a less obvious location<br/>

Well, there is good and bad news.  The good news is that Grandvilla contacted me to let me know that although Giant Coaster was flooded out (not such a good hiding place after all!) and the log is gone, she amazingly managed to find the stamp still in good shape.  So as soon as I get it back from her, I will be replacing it with a new log in a slightly different location.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is that I have just gotten back from checking on Say Yes and it's gone again.  That makes twice in four months.  I'm not sure whether I should try to replace it again or not.  I don't really want to have to replace it every two months.  :(<br/>
