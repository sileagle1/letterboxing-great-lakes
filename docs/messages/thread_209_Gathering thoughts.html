We can always use more boxes for the gathering!  If we don't have <br/>
anymore workshops, we'll need something to fill our time!  How about <br/>
a ton of more boxes?  (Just a wish...)<br/>
<br/>
Here's a workshop suggestion - a "newbie" workshop.  Learn all the <br/>
tricks of the trade to get you started, including making your first <br/>
stamp (in conjunction with SpringChick's workshop).  You'll learn <br/>
how to find and place your own boxes, write clues, etc.  If we have <br/>
enough interest, I think I could give the workshop a shot.  Any <br/>
takers?  Let me know.<br/>
<br/>
T-shirts - still waiting for info on cost. Hopefully very soon.  So <br/>
far I have an $8 to $15 range depending whether you get your name on <br/>
the back or not.  I'd ESTIMATE $9 for no-name and $11 with name.<br/>

I also think that a workshop aimed at newer boxers would be very <br/>
popular for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe people could bring examples of clues that they especially <br/>
enjoyed creating and could explain the process for those for whom <br/>
that is a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Or we could further flesh out the TOTW about what makes a box <br/>
special. At one or time another I expect all of us have had a block <br/>
and found ourselves searching for the next inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
Go for it.<br/>
