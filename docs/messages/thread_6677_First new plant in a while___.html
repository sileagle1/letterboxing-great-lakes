electronically log their plants/finds on a specific LB site have access to<br>
the clue, that is their prerogative as a planter.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
All I was saying that if you use AQ features to limit access, the clue<br>
should only BE on AQ.  No point to having dead links on other sites.  <br>
