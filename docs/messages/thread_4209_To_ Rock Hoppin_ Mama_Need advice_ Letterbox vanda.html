You are a hoot!  I love the way your mind works when it comes to retrieving<br/>
a letterbox in a public area.  Your posted message gives everyone some real<br/>
food for thought when we are out on the trails.  You give a whole new<br/>
meaning to the word "sneaky!"  <br/>

  We have managed to find boxes in busy parks with no one noticing. I think<br/>
  having kids helps a lot with this. If you walk a trail before getting to<br/>
  the busy picnic area you can go to a picnic table and tell the kids the<br/>
"old<br/>
  folks" need to rest a bit; hand them some empty containers (box size) and<br/>
  then them to see if they can find any bugs or worms to take home to the<br/>
  turtle for dinner while the old folks rest. Ours are 8 and 11 so they are<br/>
  old enough to understand what it is they are to do. They go to the<br/>
location<br/>
  the box should be, if they find it, they leave one of the boxes they had<br/>
and<br/>
  take the real one. They then come back to the table and say they don't<br/>
want<br/>
  to look for bugs anymore. So I say lets do something else then. Take out a<br/>
  coloring book and another box size container of crayons, our logbooks,<br/>
etc.<br/>
  Looks like we are wasting time while we rest.<br/>
<br/>
  Another thing we do is toss a ball back and forth making sure one is in<br/>
  front of the area where the box should be. Overthrow it so the person can<br/>
  look for the box while they are looking for the ball. If they find it they<br/>
  slip it into their backpack and come out with the ball.<br/>
<br/>
  I usually take sandwiches and such in our backpack so if we need to have a<br/>
  picnic to throw off onlookers we can. When going to a busy park I usually<br/>
  pack our logbook and stamps in box size containers as well as our lunch so<br/>
  all the boxes just blend in to onlookers.<br/>
<br/>
  Where there's a will there's a way. LOL We've had a "sick" kid to allow us<br/>
  to be on the side of a road where a box was a couple times, as well as<br/>
boys<br/>
  and their "potty breaks" too.<br/>

  &gt; Sadly, I have to agree with Bali - I found both of these wonderful<br/>
  &gt; stamps, but I had great difficulty retrieving them with any stealth at<br/>
  &gt; all. I'd suggest hiding places that aren't as exposed.<br/>

  &gt;===============================<br/>
  &gt; I think maybe they were both in too open of areas where people<br/>
  could be seen too easily retrieving them... <br/>

  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
  We just had to skip a box in Lancaster, WI for exactly that reason. <br/>
  Box was placed in the middle of a totally open area, near a picnic<br/>
shelter,<br/>
  with people playing nearby. There's no way you could retrieve that box<br/>
  without being seen. A cold, inclement day would be the only chance. We ran<br/>
  into the same situation with another box in LaCrosse (same planter). We're<br/>
  trying to get better at reading clues to determine which boxes are too<br/>
  exposed for us to try in the summer, especially on the weekends. We're<br/>
just<br/>
  not cut out to be "urban boxers".<br/>
