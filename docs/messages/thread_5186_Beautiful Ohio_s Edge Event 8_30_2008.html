is the very edge of our group's territory, I am wondering if some of <br>
you would be interested in sending a traveling event stamp or a stamp <br>
that you may have retired there that could be planted in our area once <br>
the event is completed.<br>
<br>
If you are interested, please contact me on the Atlas Quest site to <br>
sign up if you can attend, or at my e-mail of <br>
grannybutterfly06@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Thank you for your interest.  We are 25 miles East of I-77 if someone <br>
is heading to school, home from school, or back from vacations that <br>
weekend.  <br>
<br>
Ohioans who want just one more close by trip of the summer, this could <br>
be your chance.<br>
