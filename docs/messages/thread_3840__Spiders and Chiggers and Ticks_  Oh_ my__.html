  Using the lint roller in addition to taking precautions will <br/>
reduce the number of ticks brought home, into your car, or carried <br/>

<br/>
Ticks aren't like fleas.  They don't do a whole lot of hoppin' around.<br/>
Ticks don't have much in the way of travel expenses to turn in to the<br/>
company.<br/>
<br/>
Ticks lay masses of eggs.  Depending on the species of tick, ticks can lay<br/>
anywhere from a hundred eggs in a bunch to a few thousand in a bunch.  When<br/>
they hatch, they generally don't move around all that much.  They often<br/>
climb a bit and lie-in-wait for a sucker to come along and give them both a<br/>
free ride and a free meal.  Which means that if a person wanders into a<br/>
place where a couple of hundred ticks have been laid, quite a few of those<br/>
ticks might move quite quickly to take advantage of the free ride and free<br/>
meal ticket.<br/>
<br/>
My personal best so far was in Rusk County, WI.  54 ticks in one outing.  I<br/>
picked up 53 ticks.  My dog picked up 1 tick.  She came down with Lyme<br/>
Disease.  I didn't.  But she picked up her 1 in an entirely different area<br/>
from where I picked up my 53.  And the person hiking with me also picked up<br/>
only 1 or 2, so I obviously just managed to wander into a nest of 'em.<br/>
Maybe that's why there seem to be so few boxers in Rusk County. :-)  The<br/>
ticks got 'em.<br/>
