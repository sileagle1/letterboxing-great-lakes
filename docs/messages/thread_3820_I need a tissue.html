I don't get to Dixon very often at all. I planted that box on my way to the  <br>
gathering at the SILO.<br>
 <br>
It has been found now by 3 people, all on this Email list. <br>
 <br>
I'm all paranoid now, and don't want to lose this stamp. Can you, time  <br>
permitting, re-hide this box for me -- perhaps along the Hennipin Cannel,  anywhere <br>
would be fine (in Dixon OR along the "Reagan Trail" roadway just keep  it in <br>
Lee County is all I ask). <br>
 <br>
Email the clues to the new location to me and I will edit the clues on AQ  <br>
and LBNA -- I will give you all the credit for the new hiding spot.<br>
 <br>
If you DO NOT have the time to re-hide this box can you please pull it and  <br>
mail it to me (I will reimburse your shipping costs). And I will re-hide it  <br>
myself sometime this summer.<br>
 <br>
Thanks,<br>

After thinking more about it I think I would rather re-plant this box  <br>

as soon as I can . . . hopefully in the next 2-4 months or so.<br>
