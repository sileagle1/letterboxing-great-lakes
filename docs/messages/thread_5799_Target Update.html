  Target's Dollar Section is currently featuring 7x10" spiral bound scrapbooks, 15 pages, unruled.  There are various cover designs with the bridal/bachelorette stuff that have a window cut into the front for inserting a picture (mostly graphic designs, not overly bridal).  There are also some black ones with "2009" printed on the cover (graduation area).  While too big to put into letterboxes, they work well as logs for event stamps or for personal logbooks.   (I like to use books like this for attending gatherings in lieu of my regular logbook.)  Pages are heavier than bond paper but lighter than cardstock, and should work fine for stamping.<br/>
<br/>
  They also have those plastic "beach safes" -- rigid screw-capped tubes with a clip on them you use to keep keys, change, etc. dry.  4.5" tall, 1.25" diameter, available in blue and red (alas, no camo).  They appear to be decently waterproof...they have a silicon O-ring gasket.  Might not last forever, but would work great for a temporary placement for an event or other limited-time situation.<br/>
