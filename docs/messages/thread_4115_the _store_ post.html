<br>
Yes, the original poster acknowledged that he had no affiliation with<br>
the commercial firm touted in the message. But that was *not* known<br>
from the outset.<br>
Since the poster was a new member to this group and Yahoo groups have<br>
been beset by auto/spam membership requests (and subsequent ads for<br>
who-knows-what), we always review both the membership request for its<br>
authenticity *and* the member's first post. And, yes, trolls do join<br>
under the cover of well-meaning letterboxers. And, yes, YOU were<br>
likely moderated on your first post.<br>
All first posts by new members are now moderated.<br>
<br>
So when the question was asked, the poster immediately disavowed any<br>
commercial relationship with the company mentioned, and the post went<br>
through.<br>
End of story.<br>
<br>
It is a common practice on lists like this for posters to acknowledge<br>
whether or not they stand to gain financially from mentioning a business.<br>
Is it a rule? No.<br>
However, it's a courtesy to disclose those relationships up front.<br>
<br>
It's not unusual to read mention of specials, coupons, or someone's<br>
favorite carving medium's source, but it is deceptive if one stands to<br>
gain financially and that fact is not public.<br>
