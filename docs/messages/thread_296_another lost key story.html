the house, callingme at work 15 minutes before I was scheduled to leave<br/>
(darn it, why couldn't he have gotten me out of work sooner on such a nice<br/>
day?).  I told him I was going to get a spare key and one of my centrifuge<br/>
tubes and hide it in the back yard as a "letterbox".  Of course, knowing you<br/>
guys, you'd probably come looking for it!!!  (And since I live walking<br/>
distance from one of my boxes, that very well could happen!)<br/>
