Thanks for the heads up. We plan on going there this weekend <br/>
actually. We found out the hard way last month about how bad the <br/>
ticks are this year. So now I carry Deep Woods Off in my bag and <br/>
spray all of us down before we go out hiking. We haven't found one on <br/>
us yet since we've used it. <br/>
That's a great idea about using a lint roller to remove ticks that <br/>
you find. I'll have to add that to my bag too ; )<br/>

I completely agree~ticks are out in full force this year already!  We <br/>
have had more already this year than in the past 10 years combined.  I'm <br/>
not kidding.  We've had 5 bite in and 4 more that didn't get that far.  <br/>
This is combined from hiking in both NC and OH.  And I completely forgot <br/>
about the lint roller method!! <br/>
<br/>
I will add that Dr. OZ was on Oprah sometime last week and he said that <br/>
it is okay if, when you pull on a tick that has bitten in, the head <br/>
stays buried when you pull on the body.  (Not what I learned as a <br/>
kid---so I listened for further explaination.)  He said that the <br/>
"poison" is in the body and only when you cause the tick to spit that <br/>
out into your skin is that a  problem.  Most often if you pull (and NOT <br/>
SQUEEZE with tweezers) there is no harm done at all and your body will <br/>
chuck the remaining head.  Using tweezers could force the poison INTO <br/>
your body and he did not recommend that method.  That's why it sounds <br/>
like the lint roller is a perfect solution---especially since you don't <br/>
have to touch the little "thangs" and they won't get away from you either!<br/>

We are either going Sunday or Monday. We haven't decided yet. If <br/>
Monday is buy one-get one free then we'll go then : ) But we will <br/>
definitely be out looking for boxes. That would be great if we met <br/>
up. <br/>
