While poking around in the Geocache forums I found some fun messages<br>
about cover stories that have been used to avoid looking suspicious to<br>
non-players (muggles in cache-lingo)<br>
<br>
Pretending to use the GPS as a cell phone by either "talking" on it,<br>
fake-sending a "text" message or pretending to forget your glasses<br>
while holding it way out in front and squinting at it. <br>
<br>
Another one was pretending to use the GPS as if it were a digital camera.<br>
<br>
It reminded me of an experience I had while working out the clues for<br>
a box I had just placed. NOTE: I use the hand-bearing compass from our<br>
boat, which is about the size of a baseball, and bright yellow in<br>
color.  While I was getting some bearings I noticed a couple behaving<br>
in a "curious manner" nearby. It didn't take long for me to figure out<br>
they had a GPS and were likely caching. It seemed that they must have<br>
been right on the coordinates because they just wouldn't leave the<br>
area and were doing some discrete poking around with a walking stick<br>
while they kept stealing peeks over at me.<br>
<br>
Since I had more work to do in the area and understood they wanted to<br>
get the cache, I just pretended my compass was a GPS and asked what<br>
coords they were showing. LOL ... they looked so relieved to be able<br>
to get the cache.  <br>
<br>
So now I wonder other what kind of "cover stories" we could share<br>
about our letterboxing trips. Let's please share them!<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

Most people assume I'm looking for wild mushrooms, so I used to let<br>
them think that.  That was until I found out that it is illegal to<br>
pick wild mushrooms!  Luckily I never ran across a park ranger....<br>

someone approaches, esp. if we're already off the<br>
trail in the woods, my favorite "cover" is for us to<br>
start making out ;)  He always has his camera with<br>
him, so on occasion we've become very interested in a<br>
tree or getting that "perfect shot."  If we actually<br>
have the letterbox open and someone approaches we<br>
pretend we're having an impromptu picnic - it IS<br>
tupperware and plastic baggies, after all :)<br>
