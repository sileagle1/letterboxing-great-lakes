Do you have a backing on it?  I bought some foam stuff from stampeaz <br>
that works pretty good.  It's thin and flexible so you can still get <br>
a good image, but it adds some support and sturdiness to the stamp, too.<br>

Pick up some better material that you like.   Carving medium is much cheaper than your time and artistic investment.  <br>
<br>
As for transport, we cut a large "plus sign" out of felt, where the center intersection is a hair bigger than the stamp surface, and each of the 4 'legs' are big enough to fold up over the sides and across the top.  Makes a good little protective pouch, but is easy to open up, even one-handed.  (We do the same on our box stamps too.)  Of course that still won't protect a stamp from all damage, so you might want to keep it in one of the smaller compartments of your backpack.<br>

I borrowed an idea from the Cottontails (as observed at the GL Gather in WI last summer) and keep my stamp and stamping supplies in a compartmentalized plastic container that fits nicely into my backpack -- I think it may have originally been meant for hardware pieces or fishing tackle or craft supplies or something of that nature.<br>
<br>
It provides a nice little crush-proof space for everything I need -- stamps, ink pads, markers, even chapstick -- and makes this organization freak happy, happy, happy.  It also provides a great hard surface for stamping while out on the trail ;-)<br>

<br>
The only stamps of mine that have broken were carved on the orange <br>
stuff....so I don't use it anymore---especially knowing boxes in the GLK <br>
region have to get through tough winters too.  I use PZ cut only anymore <br>
and the felt protection as well and I think it helps, too.<br>
<br>
I don't know what your signature stamp looks like but if it is more of a <br>
rectangle shape or has some piece of it that extends out from the <br>
rest---that could be a more vulnerable part---and one you might not cut <br>
as much of the "extra" away from.  In other words leave some protection <br>
around the more vulnerable part by cutting away, but not off.  Having <br>
that foam backing will help protect for sure.<br>
<br>
I have noticed some letterboxers put their signature stamps into a small <br>
jewelry-sized box--even lined with felt or other material.  Many folks <br>
have two or even 3 different sizes of signature stamps for then they <br>
stamp into HH or smaller logbooks so the box works out really well for <br>
them---and protects on top of it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If this is your signature stamp, you should really invest in a better carving material that you would prefer working with!  Our smaller stamps live in little tins (like the kind that mints come in) and that keeps them safe from being beat up by other things in our backpacks.  But our team stamp is much larger and I simply wrapped it in a piece of scrap flannel and tie it with some string (actually, the "string" is also a thin strip of scrap flannel).  It's held up pretty well on the trail and even survived a bout with the washing machine!  Although after the round with the washer it certainly has more "character," not quite enough to need to be recarved, but enough that I don't think we'll be hand-inking it with markers anymore.<br>
<br>
Backing can help prolong a stamp's life.  Also, not carving quite so deeply.  I have a tendency to carve really deeply, especially when I'm clearing out large white areas, and that will weaken the stamp more than shallow carving.<br>

found at JoAnn Fabrics and Hobby Lobby...  I don't go to Michaels too <br>
often so I can't remember if they carry it there.  One size it comes in <br>
are these big, thick white bricks (I think they're like 3x5" for <br>
~$3ish).  It's really soft and easy for carving with Speedball cutters <br>
-- plus the thickness of it prevents cracking/breaking without needing <br>
to mount the stamp on something else.  I've actually done a majority of <br>
my carvings with this and been happy with the results... both Atom and <br>
my sig stamps are in this and they have held up (we store them in our <br>
backpack inside a lock n lock along with our signature ink pads).  <br>
Recently, Atom and I have upgraded to PZ Cut and have used both the <br>
orange and white grade B stuff.  It's available online through <br>
Stampeze.  It's thinner and firmer, and I think you can carve more <br>
detail with it.  Good luck!<br>

I'm not sure if this works on the orange stuff, but on the white, <br>
before I transfer the image or start carving, I ink the material up <br>
with a contrasting color.  Let that dry and then transfer the <br>
image.  Then once you start carving, with the ink on the rubber, it's <br>
easy to see where you haven and haven't carved.<br>

I wish I could find the original post, but I can't even remember what list it was on.  But I do remember thinking that would probably help when carving the orange stuff.<br>

I like the Speedball SpeedyCut pink stuff you mention (if that's the  <br>
same stuff; sounds like it.)  I used to prefer the white thick block  <br>
MasterCarve, but use the pink stuff exclusively now. I've found it  <br>
holds up real well and carves smoothly too. The white was just a  <br>
little bit too soft.<br>
<br>
I do back it with a wood block... but not til I'm done with the  <br>
carving. Maybe putting your backing on first... before you carve...  <br>
will help it to feel more firm and hold up better for you while you  <br>
carve.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another alternative to inking that uses the same concept if you're not that brave is plain old pencil.  When I'm doing a really detailed stamp (usually using white mastercarve) sometimes I'll transfer my image and then very lightly rub pencil over the image.  This makes the carving medium "dingy" and when I cut away the cut sections are brighter.  It offers a little contrast.<br>

I do back it with a wood block... but not til I'm done with the <br>
carving. Maybe putting your backing on first... before you carve... <br>
will help it to feel more firm and hold up better for you while you <br>
carve.<br>

  I am the same way about the pink stuff. I won't use anything else. I tried the Master Carve and didn't care for it at all. The pink stamps that I've carved are in perfect condition, where as the white stamps are flakey and/or broken.<br>
