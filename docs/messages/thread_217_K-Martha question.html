really<br/>

brought a<br/>

run out and<br/>
&gt; sign up for a bookbinding class.  A few people brought stamp <br/>
carvings they<br/>

&gt; Although this didn't apply to our gathering last year, I know that <br/>
at some<br/>

where a<br/>

at the<br/>

like<br/>
&gt; K-Martha), but since there will be opportunity to do a fair amount <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; 'boxing and I believe Tim has a HH hostel coming, you may want to <br/>
have a HH<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">K-Martha began as a HH crafted by the legendary legerdemaine as a <br/>
spoof on Martha Stewart -- legend has it that she logged into one of <br/>
his letterboxes and he copied her signature stamp to make the K-<br/>
Martha HH.  In the beginning it actually did a brief tour of <br/>
letterboxes as any other HH.  It became a much sought after and <br/>
prized stamp both because of the legend of its maker and because of <br/>
the colorful flurry of posts that it had generated at the talk list.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the line, in keeping with the legerdemaine spirit of <br/>
mischief, he created a second K-Martha stamp, nearly identical to the <br/>
first, for the purpose of playing a joke on the infamous Wanda of <br/>
Pete and Wanda fame.  About that time, both stamps were removed from <br/>
circulation as normal HH and began making the rounds of letterbox <br/>
gatherings and events, where everyone proudly took a stamp for their <br/>
logbook -- for many the only legerdemaine stamp they may ever have.<br/>
<br/>
Early in 2003, legerdemaine schemed up yet another prank, this time <br/>
aimed at long-time rival Randy Hall.  Rather than carve the third <br/>
stamp himself, he commissioned the carving of K-Martha #3, to be an <br/>
exact duplication of #2, from one of his letterboxing acquaintances.  <br/>
All three stamps now make the rounds to gatherings and events.  It is <br/>
most difficult to tell which is which.<br/>
<br/>
K-Martha #2 made an appearance at our Great Lakes gathering last <br/>
year.  Personally I have stamped images of #2 and #3, and would <br/>
consider it quite a coup to run across the original.<br/>
<br/>
I will do some hunting later today to find some of the original list <br/>
messages pertaining to the K-Martha stamps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; prized stamp both because of the legend of its maker and because <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; the colorful flurry of posts that it had generated at the talk <br/>
&gt; list.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Somewhere along the line, in keeping with the legerdemaine spirit <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; mischief, he created a second K-Martha stamp, nearly identical to <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; first, for the purpose of playing a joke on the infamous Wanda of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Pete and Wanda fame.  About that time, both stamps were removed <br/>
&gt; from <br/>
&gt; &gt; circulation as normal HH and began making the rounds of letterbox <br/>
&gt; &gt; gatherings and events, where everyone proudly took a stamp for <br/>
&gt; their <br/>
&gt; &gt; logbook -- for many the only legerdemaine stamp they may ever <br/>
have.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Early in 2003, legerdemaine schemed up yet another prank, this <br/>
&gt; time <br/>
&gt; &gt; aimed at long-time rival Randy Hall.  Rather than carve the third <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp himself, he commissioned the carving of K-Martha #3, to be <br/>
&gt; an <br/>
&gt; &gt; exact duplication of #2, from one of his letterboxing <br/>
&gt; acquaintances.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; All three stamps now make the rounds to gatherings and events.  <br/>
It <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; most difficult to tell which is which.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; K-Martha #2 made an appearance at our Great Lakes gathering last <br/>
&gt; &gt; year.  Personally I have stamped images of #2 and #3, and would <br/>
&gt; &gt; consider it quite a coup to run across the original.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I will do some hunting later today to find some of the original <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like you have it pretty well covered!  It was very <br/>
cold <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (and rainy)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last year, even though it was May 31st.  But that didn't <br/>
&gt; dampen <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spirits one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit -- we had a great time despite the uncooperative <br/>
weather!  <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can't think of much besides the things you have mentioned.  A <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; couple people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brought items to show -- for instance Matt the Rat has taken <br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bookbinding classes and has done some awesome handbound <br/>
&gt; books.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; He <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; brought a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few of these with him and we all ohhhed and ahhhhed and vowed <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; run out and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sign up for a bookbinding class.  A few people brought stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; carvings they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were especially proud of.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although this didn't apply to our gathering last year, I know <br/>
&gt; &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the other gatherings, people have taken the opportunity to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; distribute<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clues to unpublished letterboxes.  Also HH stamps are a <br/>
common <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bring to gatherings.  I am not a big fan of the HH table <br/>
&gt; concept, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; where a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bunch of HH are just laid out on the table and all of the <br/>
&gt; people <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering just stamp the HH (except in the case of legendary <br/>
&gt; HH <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; K-Martha), but since there will be opportunity to do a fair <br/>
&gt; &gt; amount <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'boxing and I believe Tim has a HH hostel coming, you may <br/>
want <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a HH<br/>

&gt; Pete and Wanda fame.  About that time, both stamps were removed <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; circulation as normal HH and began making the rounds of letterbox <br/>
&gt; gatherings and events, where everyone proudly took a stamp for <br/>
their <br/>
&gt; logbook -- for many the only legerdemaine stamp they may ever have.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Early in 2003, legerdemaine schemed up yet another prank, this <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; aimed at long-time rival Randy Hall.  Rather than carve the third <br/>
&gt; stamp himself, he commissioned the carving of K-Martha #3, to be <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; exact duplication of #2, from one of his letterboxing <br/>
acquaintances.  <br/>
&gt; All three stamps now make the rounds to gatherings and events.  It <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; most difficult to tell which is which.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K-Martha #2 made an appearance at our Great Lakes gathering last <br/>
&gt; year.  Personally I have stamped images of #2 and #3, and would <br/>
&gt; consider it quite a coup to run across the original.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will do some hunting later today to find some of the original <br/>
list <br/>
&gt; messages pertaining to the K-Martha stamps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; is a "K-Martha", and what makes her so legendary?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like you have it pretty well covered!  It was very cold <br/>
&gt; &gt; (and rainy)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; last year, even though it was May 31st.  But that didn't <br/>
dampen <br/>
&gt; &gt; spirits one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bit -- we had a great time despite the uncooperative weather!  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can't think of much besides the things you have mentioned.  A <br/>
&gt; &gt; couple people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; brought items to show -- for instance Matt the Rat has taken <br/>
some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bookbinding classes and has done some awesome handbound <br/>
books.  <br/>
&gt; He <br/>
&gt; &gt; brought a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few of these with him and we all ohhhed and ahhhhed and vowed <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; run out and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sign up for a bookbinding class.  A few people brought stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; carvings they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were especially proud of.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Although this didn't apply to our gathering last year, I know <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; at some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the other gatherings, people have taken the opportunity to <br/>
&gt; &gt; distribute<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clues to unpublished letterboxes.  Also HH stamps are a common <br/>
&gt; &gt; thing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bring to gatherings.  I am not a big fan of the HH table <br/>
concept, <br/>
&gt; &gt; where a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bunch of HH are just laid out on the table and all of the <br/>
people <br/>
&gt; &gt; at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering just stamp the HH (except in the case of legendary <br/>
HH <br/>
&gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; K-Martha), but since there will be opportunity to do a fair <br/>
&gt; amount <br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 'boxing and I believe Tim has a HH hostel coming, you may want <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; have a HH<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with you.  Don't have one in your possession right now?  Make <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; new one and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; launch it at the gathering!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; No doubt I have left off something -- anyone else?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I'm doing my homework.  I looked through the photos <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; saw pics<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from last year's gathering (trying to guess who is who!).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Studying the stuff on the tables to see what kind of stuff I <br/>
&gt; &gt; need to bring<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with me, but I can't make out anything specific.  So besides<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tools for the carving workshop, and the usual personal/event <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; markers/stamp pads, journal/logbook, and of course gear for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weather (looked pretty chilly last year...when was it held?) <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; food, is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there anything else we should bring?<br/>
