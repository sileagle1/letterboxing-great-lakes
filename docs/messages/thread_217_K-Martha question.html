                    <div class="plaintext-content">K-Martha began as a HH crafted by the legendary legerdemaine as a <br>
spoof on Martha Stewart -- legend has it that she logged into one of <br>
his letterboxes and he copied her signature stamp to make the K-<br>
Martha HH.  In the beginning it actually did a brief tour of <br>
letterboxes as any other HH.  It became a much sought after and <br>
prized stamp both because of the legend of its maker and because of <br>
the colorful flurry of posts that it had generated at the talk list.<br>
<br>
Somewhere along the line, in keeping with the legerdemaine spirit of <br>
mischief, he created a second K-Martha stamp, nearly identical to the <br>
first, for the purpose of playing a joke on the infamous Wanda of <br>
Pete and Wanda fame.  About that time, both stamps were removed from <br>
circulation as normal HH and began making the rounds of letterbox <br>
gatherings and events, where everyone proudly took a stamp for their <br>
logbook -- for many the only legerdemaine stamp they may ever have.<br>
<br>
Early in 2003, legerdemaine schemed up yet another prank, this time <br>
aimed at long-time rival Randy Hall.  Rather than carve the third <br>
stamp himself, he commissioned the carving of K-Martha #3, to be an <br>
exact duplication of #2, from one of his letterboxing acquaintances.  <br>
All three stamps now make the rounds to gatherings and events.  It is <br>
most difficult to tell which is which.<br>
<br>
K-Martha #2 made an appearance at our Great Lakes gathering last <br>
year.  Personally I have stamped images of #2 and #3, and would <br>
consider it quite a coup to run across the original.<br>
<br>
I will do some hunting later today to find some of the original list <br>
messages pertaining to the K-Martha stamps.<br>

Martha, the Letterbox-USA (Yahoo big list) message that started it <br>
all is #10816 (3/31/02).  Message #17757 eludes of the discovery of <br>
the faux (#2), but not of the associated mischief.  I think that is <br>
simply a tale passed by word of mouth.<br>
<br>
While scanning through the archives, I also happened upon message <br>
#10721 -- the origins of the postal letterbox.<br>
<br>
And now a moment of silence for the great legerdemaine...  may the <br>
spirit never die.<br>
