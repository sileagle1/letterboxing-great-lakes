back to an older letterboxing recipe this weekend.  In June 2004, the <br/>
male half of Leapin' Lizards brought some fantastic Cheesecake Bars to <br/>
an event.  He was willing to share the recipe and we made them a few <br/>
times after that.  We made some again for a party this weekend and they <br/>
were as delicious as ever!<br/>
<br/>
Hope all of you are also enjoying the holiday parties &amp; treats this <br/>
month!<br/>
