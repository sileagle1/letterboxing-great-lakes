report on our most recent letterboxing trip. :)<br>
<br>
Atom and I went down to the Starved Rock State Park (IL) area over the <br>
weekend.  Apparently a few other letterboxers had the same plan, as we <br>
stamped in a day after RacerCar (I think) on several of our finds, and I <br>
got an email that LibraryGrrl and Gram Judy were there this weekend as <br>
well!  Anyway, HEAVY rainfalls all Friday night made things a bit wet <br>
and muddy, but nothing we (and our tent) couldn't handle. ;)  We started <br>
out on the cool, completely overcast Saturday morning with a <br>
semi-challenging box: "Effigy Tumuli" by Matt the Rat.  This box had a <br>
few "attempted" finds marked from last summer, but we were up for a <br>
challenge.  We reached the place where we thought (knew!) the box should <br>
be, and after a few readjustments of the compass, we managed to find <br>
it!  The box hadn't had any visitors in just about a year and was <br>
well-hidden, so we felt good about ourselves.  This good find set the <br>
tone for the rest of our day.  We next went to check out the buffalo and <br>
find "Shuffle off to Bluffalo" by FungusWoman.  A little buggy back <br>
there, but another great find. :)  Afterwards, we did some hiking at <br>
Starved Rock State Park itself, but mostly at the western end, which <br>
sees a lot less visitors than the east side where the lodge and <br>
visitor's center are located.  We found "The Point" by edna, followed by <br>
a very pleasant hike through Illinois Canyon for the box there by <br>
Travel'n Trout, although the "mostly dry creek bed" was certainly not <br>
dry on Saturday. :)  We then headed over to the lodge area to find <br>
"Starved Rock Buffet" by Matt the Rat and "Stargazer" by edna.  Both had <br>
fun and semi-tricky clues to follow so we had to wander around a bit, <br>
but we ended up successful for both boxes.  We also went to where we <br>
thought "Over the Creek" should be, but had no luck there.  Perhaps it <br>
was just the overgrowth preventing us from seeing something obvious.<br>
<br>
Sunday morning dawned cloudy again, but at least no more rain.  We <br>
packed up our very muddy and damp tent and headed over to Mattheson <br>
State Park.  We REALLY enjoyed this park.  We found "A Lil Bit of <br>
Flutter" and "Hershey's Hike" by FungusWoman, Papillon, and Hershey of <br>
course. :)  The trail along the canyon bottoms there were great and not <br>
very busy.  We definitely recommend doing the "long" version for <br>
Hershey's Hike -- we did take the "shortcut" back to the car later on, <br>
and it was definitely less impressive.  From there, we drove out towards <br>
Princeton, IL to do some boxes by the Pitties.  The city parks there are <br>
very large and clean -- there were several people out enjoying the day <br>
at the parks.  The boxes there were very nicely done as well.  Next, we <br>
turned around and headed back east towards home.  On the way, we took a <br>
brief detour up IL 71 to search for a few more FungusWoman boxes: FOOW2, <br>
FOOW6, and Lutefish out of Water.  The location for FOOW2 was a popular <br>
stopping place on Sunday it seemed, for 2 other cars stopped while we <br>
were attempting to find the hidden box.  Unfortunately, we had to give <br>
up once the others arrived.  We did find FOOW6 and Lutefish successfully <br>
however.  These boxes are very neat little stopping points to break up <br>
the drive.<br>
<br>
Overall, we had a great weekend.  So if you're "starved" for some good <br>
letterboxes, hopefully now you know where to look! :)<br>

Hey, I remember when we boxed in those areas, but it was almost 3 <br>
years ago!  There might be some newer boxes there now...<br>
<br>
We're working on a trip report from our most recent trip, but if <br>
anyone wants to read about our Memorial Day adventures, I'll post it <br>
below (we originally posted it on the Southeast regional board).  <br>
We'd HIGHLY recommend boxing in the Stone Mountain (Atlanta, GA) <br>
area - lots of nice hikes and great carvings!<br>
<br>
Trip report:<br>
<br>
Hello everyone!<br>
<br>
We arrived home yesterday after our 4-day trip to GA. The SE Annual<br>
Gathering at Stone Mountain triggered our trip, since we had read a<br>
lot about all the boxes there. We assumed it was a large park where<br>
we could do lots of hiking. However after I booked our flights I<br>
Googled the park and got worried - it looked like a theme park with<br>
lots of "attractions". Oh, oh... well we were committed, so we also<br>
printed some clues for other boxes in the surrounding area just in<br>
case.<br>
<br>
We flew out Friday night and headed for the park Saturday morning,<br>
not sure what to expect. Of course we had a HUGE bundle of clues to<br>
juggle, so when we got to the park we just took a random turn and<br>
ended up near the covered bridge & quarry. OK, we had some clues for<br>
this area, so we hopped out of the car. Hmmm... this seemed like a<br>
very nice area. Trees, water, trails - just what we like! Our fears<br>
were laid to rest immediately. While looking for one box in the<br>
quarry area, a couple started walking near us - drat! Time to look<br>
like we were consulting our map and just admiring the area. The<br>
woman proceeded ahead, but the man wandered along past us. All of a<br>
sudden he asked "Did you find it?" Oh GOOD - Just another<br>
letterboxer! He said he thought it was further ahead, where the woman<br>
was and sure enough we headed up to retrieve it and do our first<br>
exchange of the day with Llama Mama. After finding several boxes, we<br>
headed to the picnic area to meet some of the local boxers. We were<br>
greeted by several and started the process of doing exchanges and<br>
chatting with people. Some were names we recognized from message<br>
boards or as planters and others were new to us. After a pleasant<br>
few hours, we headed off with a small group led by StarSAELS. He had<br>
offered to act as a "tour guide" for a climb up the rock and a search<br>
for many boxes along the way up & down. Wow - he is ORGANIZED and we<br>
really appreciate his willingness to spend his time helping us find<br>
our way around the mountain. We also were amazed at the detail on<br>
his 99 Bottles of Beer stamps.<br>
<br>
We had hoped to meet up with the group again for dinner, but got lost<br>
trying to find the place. It didn't help that we never asked the<br>
name of the restaurant, nor exchanged cell phone numbers, so we<br>
couldn't even tell anyone where we were trying to get to! After<br>
checking 3 places, we decided to just eat some pizza ourselves and<br>
head back to the park. We found a few more before the laser light<br>
show and then headed back to our hotel for a much-needed rest.<br>
[Exchanged with 24 letterboxers, Found 28 boxes and 1 Hitchhiker]<br>
<br>
We figured that Stone Mountain would be very busy over the holiday<br>
weekend, so we decided to visit different parks on Sunday and Monday,<br>
then return to Stone Mountain on Tuesday. We headed to Tribble Mill<br>
park on Sunday and after a rough start (couldn't figure out what<br>
trail we were supposed to start on, but eventually got something to<br>
work and went from there). Eventually we backtracked from one of the<br>
first clues to find the "No Parking" sign and that got us going on<br>
more clues. The plus side of being disoriented was that we found a<br>
box that we didn't even have clues for! This was another nice area<br>
to spend the day walking. However there were way too many boxes here<br>
than we could find in one day, so we eventually called it quits and<br>
headed back for another good night's sleep.<br>
[Found 22 boxes and 1 Hitchhiker]<br>
<br>
Monday we headed down to the Davidson-Arabia Mountain Nature<br>
Preserve. First we found several boxes on the "flatter" part of the<br>
park, then headed over to climb up the granite. We again really<br>
enjoyed the walks - Martini Man especially enjoyed being on the<br>
Arabia peak since it was so undeveloped and we had the place to<br>
ourselves. We finished up in the park by mid-afternoon, so decided<br>
to head back to Tribble Mill again. Didn't have as much luck finding<br>
some of the boxes - especially frustrating when we know others found<br>
them not long ago. What were we missing?! Oh well, you can't find<br>
them all!<br>
[Found 19 boxes]<br>
<br>
Tuesday it was a return to Stone Mountain. We started off at the<br>
covered bridge/quarry area again and after finding a few newer boxes<br>
we took off on the Cherokee Trail. I had a whole packet of clues<br>
clutched in my hand since we would try to find some going forward,<br>
reverse engineer some going backward and we never knew where we might<br>
find the things shown in all the picture clues... A great walk with<br>
views of water and mountain along the way. Also mostly shaded and a<br>
nice breeze, who could ask for a better day? We did fairly well and<br>
many clues went from the packet to Martini Man's pocket as we found<br>
them one by one. After completing the circuit we headed to the<br>
Nature Trail and then the Songbird Trail to find a few last boxes<br>
before we ended our 4-day extravaganza.<br>
[Found 23 boxes and 1 Hitchhiker]<br>
<br>
We both agreed that this was one of the nicest areas in the country<br>
we have boxed  challenging clues, good box placements and excellent<br>
carvings!!! Thanks so much to all of you who have placed boxes (we<br>
will be sending individual "Contact the Placer" messages in the near<br>
future), to Red's Bunch for organizing the gathering and to StarSAELS<br>
for all his recommendations and tips for our visit to the area.<br>

Oh my goodness--your post was like a trip down memory lane.  We've <br>
made 2 trips over the past year or so to the Starved Rock area and <br>
have found most of the boxes that you mentioned.  Our favorite for <br>
scenery was the Illinois Canyon box.  Those streambeds were not at <br>
all dry when we were there either--which meant that the kids had a <br>
great time plotting out routes over stones and wobbly logs and such.  <br>
The waterfall at the end of the canyon was gorgeous.  We sat and <br>
enjoyed the view and skipped a few stones.  Our favorite for <br>
quirkiness was Fish out of Water 2.  We were fortunate to have the <br>
place to ourselves because it took us quite a while to find that <br>
box.  Those trips were so fun and scenic that quite a few of the <br>
letterboxing sites made it into my scrapbook.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for the post.<br>

I think you made a wise decision pulling your original logbook when you <br>
replaced it with a new one.  One of my boxes that is by far my most <br>
visited box, had tons of awesome signature stamps in it from many states <br>
and lots of great messages about folks being on their honeymoon etc.  <br>
Sometime last fall, I added the 4th logbook and decided to leave the <br>
first 3 so others could enjoy them as well---as this is placed in an <br>
extremely secure location and there is plenty of time to sit and page <br>
through.  Not even a week later someone reported that the bags and <br>
container were left open and everything got soaked and ruined.  I was <br>
just sick...and there's no getting it back.  Most other boxes I would <br>
never consider pulling the logbooks---but I blew it on this one.   I'm <br>
glad you decided to protect your treasure and let others see at events <br>
if you want!<br>
