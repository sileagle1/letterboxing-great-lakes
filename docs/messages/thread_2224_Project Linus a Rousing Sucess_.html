Thank you to all who came to lend a hand and hook at the Project Linus <br/>
Mini-meet!<br/>
We had a great time and got a few things accomplished - although we did not <br/>
manage to finish an entire blanket, we did get a lot of squares edged.  A <br/>
couple of letterboxes were found and a book donated to the library ~ about <br/>
letterboxing of course.<br/>
<br/>
We were 6 strong with hooks in hand - thank you to Jacks, SpringChick, Boot <br/>
Prints, Howling Coyote and Tiptoe for giving an afternoon to a good cause ~ <br/>
I believe there are enough squares to make 3 blankets (correct me Jacks if <br/>
I'm wrong) to donate to Project Linus, that means at least 3 warm kids for <br/>
years to come!<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be great to make this an annual event - maybe a mini-meet <br/>
that meets on the same day in multiple locations ~ how cool would that be?<br/>
<br/>
After the library closed, 5 of us had a lovely dinner together, and we all <br/>
left "very happy"!!  ; )<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again - Letterboxers ROCK!<br/>

for such a good cause.  Not only was a great deal of crocheting <br/>
accomplished, but also a great deal of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Doglvrs was kind enough to hide three boxes for the rest of us and <br/>
although there were some false starts (it would have helped if she had <br/>
mentioned one was outside so that I didn't scare the patrons of the library <br/>
circling the inside three times looking or a yellow ribbon!!) I was able to <br/>
obtain all these wonderful stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I had such a wonderful time with this group that I'm still recovering. <br/>
Thanks again so much to everyone for your help and your companionship.<br/>
