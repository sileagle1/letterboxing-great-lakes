<br>
This is the weekend that the city hosts a huge annual event called Cache Ba$h.  It attracts people from all over the United States.  One of the interesting things each team get in their goodie bag is a "Dash Card: You can display this postcard on your vehicle's dash to let law enforcement know that your vehicle is not abandoned while searching for caches."  This town (where Martini Man's mom and one of my sister & her family live) really supports people getting out to explore the area (and spend their tourist dollars).<br>
<br>
If you want more details about the event, you can find it here:<br>

<br>
and/or here:  http://www.westbendcache.com/<br>
<br>
Even if you don't geocache (we DON'T), it is interesting to read about all the activities at the event.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Weird. I grew up in West Bend... and they never had such a thing then! It's<br>
amazing how things change! Of course, I'm kind of glad they never had a<br>
geocaching even when I was a kid, because then I might have grown up to be<br>
a geocacher instead of a letterboxer, and of course, I think being a<br>
letterboxer is WAY better! ;)<br>

Love to all, and my home town,<br>
