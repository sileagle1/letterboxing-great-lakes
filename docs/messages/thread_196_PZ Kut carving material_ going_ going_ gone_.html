Just an FYI: <br/>
while recently placing an order with Stampeaz for another supply of <br/>
my preferred carving medium, PZ Kut, I learned that they are going <br/>
out of business.<br/>
April Pease, Stampeaz's main/only person, is closing the business <br/>
this week.<br/>
She plans to take her website down on the 12th; however she said that <br/>
she can still be reached at   alp@4pease.com   and that she will be <br/>
able to get PZ Kut until she finally closes down all sales.<br/>
She has been wonderful to deal with over the past couple of years.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, just wanted to post an update on the PZKut situation.  I talked <br/>
with April today and she will be taking orders through June 7th and <br/>
then she's closing shop.<br/>
<br/>
She currently has a limited amount of A Grade ($5.00/sheet) and LOTS <br/>
of B Grade ($3.00/sheet).  She can get 5 sheets into a flat rate <br/>
package for a shipping cost of $3.85. <br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, you can contact her at alp "at" 4pease.com<br/>
