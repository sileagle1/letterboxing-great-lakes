Well... my 3rd South Lyon box has been vandalized; just got an email<br>
saying there's a bag with pages left but nothing else. Real similar to<br>
the last lost, so I'm really suspecting a single person doing this.<br>
<br>
Because of it, I've decided not to post any clues for the 4 SL boxes<br>
on the national websites, and I will also pull the others if they have<br>
the same fate.<br>
<br>
I think I'll go strictly by word of mouth (or word of email!) and only<br>
give out clues to trusted LB'ers that I already know and who've<br>
already found my other boxes with valid names/stamps/finds as I determine.<br>
<br>
This really stinks to have to do this, but I think for a while it's<br>
the only answer unless I want my stamps to keep disappearing.<br>

<br>
You know, I'm not sure! I actually don't even know many people in this<br>
town and I'm a pretty nice person (I think! LOL...) so I know it's not<br>
personal. I really think it's something like this: Either someone saw<br>
someone else retrieving a box... and they then have been doing this.<br>
Or it's a KID of someone who's parents took them boxing (I've got lots<br>
of stamp ins from kids that are in groups, like a girl scout group, a<br>
school group, a summer camp group... and then they haven't kept quite<br>
about it all. Most likely they live right in the area. I do see a good<br>
amount of young punk "riff-raff" later in the day at the park near the<br>
Depot (I take my 5 year old there often)... so I really suspect a<br>
teenager or young person doing this... especially since the last box<br>
gone is in a spot where it is really easy to find/put back the box<br>
WITHOUT being seen. There's no other reason than vandalism that THAT<br>
one would be gone (You've been there... the one within the bridge;<br>
inside the lower beam... it's really in a good area for a box.)<br>
<br>
Anyway... as I said in the post, it really sucks to have to do this,<br>
but I think after the almost 3 years I've been doing this now, I have<br>
a pretty good list of people like yourself that I can safely share<br>
clues with, and then hopefully they will likewise share with only<br>
people they trust.  As I talk to more people about this, it sounds<br>
like that's the way some have already gone.<br>
<br>
I also am going to work on placing more boxes in places that take<br>
longer to get to (like your A Christmas Story, for instance :-) I know<br>
that will probably help a lot. My creepy little cretin trashing my<br>
boxes in South Lyon will probably not have the transportation,<br>
motivation, or stamina to take a hike over 1/8 mile long, lol!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks for your concern... as always, if you have any ideas, I'm all<br>
ears :-)<br>
<br>

That sucks!  I wonder what the deal is.  I haven't heard anything <br>
about other boxes going missing.  It's gotta be a local kid.  I think <br>
you're right, it's probably a friend of some kid who went with their <br>
parents and blabbed about it.  Unless someone was really clueless <br>
putting that bridge box back, there's no way someone could find that <br>
accidentally!  The junior league one I thought may be visible, but <br>
that one wouldn't be.<br>
<br>
Instead of going totally WOM, what do you think about leaving your <br>
website active, but not linked to the main sites?  There are a lot of <br>
boxes of yours that are on my list, but I haven't made it out to <br>
yet.  I know I want to get them eventually, but I'm not sure when and <br>
I haven't printed them all yet.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Bali... there's many "regulars" on this list (you included) that<br>
I'd have no problem passing clues on to. I'm keeping the site up, but<br>
on the page for those particular boxes in South Lyon, it simply says<br>
I've pulled all the boxes. That will remind others to ask about them<br>
(so I'm thinking) and then I'd pass along the clues. So when you're<br>
ready, let me know ;-)  BTW... Take your time, as there's only one<br>
ready right now, since I have to re-do and re-carve the others.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah... and on the ballpark one you mention: I did figure out that<br>
the hiding space was JUST high enough for a hardball (not a softball<br>
though) to slide under... and when I first placed it -- I should have<br>
tested it -- I thought it too small a space for a baseball to go<br>
under. But being that a ball could fit under, it was only time before<br>
some kid had to retrieve a ball and find the LB under there. So that<br>
one WAS bad placement on my part... even though it was hidden far back<br>
and near a grassy side of the box. That will definitely go elsewhere<br>
in the park, LOL!<br>

Yeah, that's a good idea... I'm thinking anyone on this list is fairly<br>
serious about LB'ing, and wouldn't even think of visiting the files<br>
section right away at least (I haven't looked there in probably a year<br>
or more, LOL!!! I'm off to check it out now ;-)<br>

It's amazing what you can find in the files!  Sorry, I deleted clues to<br>
one of my WOM boxes (retired).<br>

I am new to this and at first was thinking about all the really <br>
special places in my hometown I wanted to plant boxes. I was told to <br>
wait a while before I started planting and so I did and started <br>
thinking "no I don't want to cause it could get lost". but after <br>
reading this thread I have decided it's better to go ahead and take <br>
the risk to plant them cause it will be enjoyed by so many. One <br>
person can mess it up, but think about how MANY have really enjoyed <br>
it (including yourself when you planted it) Thanks for showing this <br>
to me and I hope you can find it in yourself to try again in a few <br>
months.<br>
