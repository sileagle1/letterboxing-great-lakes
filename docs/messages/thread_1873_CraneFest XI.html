Thank you so much for sharing more places to see the cranes!!  :-)<br>
I've been to see them during their migrations at the Jasper-Pulaski<br>
preserve in Indiana, and also during the big spring migration in Grand<br>
Island, Nebraska.<br>
It is truely a spectacular site!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
