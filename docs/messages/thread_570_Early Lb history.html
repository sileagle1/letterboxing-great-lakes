                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I can hold my tongue no longer. Having just taught a class on letterboxing for a <br>
local Parks and Recreation Department, and having done a great deal of research on <br>
the history of the craft, I would like to share what I believe to be true. <br>
<br>
Over a century and a half ago, James Perrott worked as a guide at Dartmoor. One day <br>
in 1854, he left his calling card and a self-addressed postal card in a sealed glass jar <br>
buried in the bank at Cranmere Pool. This pool, incidentally, is totally dry. The next <br>
person (and many after) who made the twelve mile trek to Cranmere left their calling <br>
cards and postcards. Once found, messages were written on the cards and then sent <br>
on. This began a tradition of 'letterboxing' on the moors. The original glass jar has <br>
long since been replace with a tin box containing a rubber stamp and a guestbook <br>
which was added in 1905.<br>
<br>
As you see, the stamp was a very early addition. Furthermore, while most stamps <br>
hidden in Dartmoor National Park are commercially made, they are usually made from <br>
original designs conceived by the hider. One of the first stamps ever hidden in the US <br>
is this type of stamp. It was hidden in Oregon by The Green Dragon in October of <br>
1998 and is known as the Brown's Camp Letterbox. There are a number of handmade <br>
stamps in Dartmoor as well and are called 'handcuts.' These are supposedly highly <br>
prized, not scorned in the least.<br>
<br>
Personally, I hold the early letterboxers in our own country in the highest regard. <br>
They developed a game that is very sophisticated, one for intellingent adults. I am sad <br>
to see that so many newcomers to our hobby have not realized this and consider it an <br>
appropriate activity for four year olds. So much for my mini lecture... I'm back to my <br>
carving bench, hoping that one day I will be half the carver that SpringChick is. <br>

occured. <br>
<br>
Thank goodness boxing, like life, is not static. How boring that <br>
could become. And, like watching your own kids grow or a wound heal, <br>
you don't notice the subtle changes, growth or healing that you're <br>
exposed to all the time. However, let someone who hasn't seen the <br>
child or wound for a while come for a visit, and the  first thing <br>
they do see are the changes.<br>
<br>
