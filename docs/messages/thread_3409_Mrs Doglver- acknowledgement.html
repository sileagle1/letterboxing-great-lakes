Mrs Doglver - thank you for sharing your creative talents with us.  I thought those posters were fabulous!  What a neat idea - little windows that open to reveal the signature stamps of those who attended the gathering.  <br>

  One person was not mentioned in the list of those who contributed to the gathering this past weekend. Mrs. Doglver, who created the cute and clever Advent-style log-in poster. Neat idea! Thanks for sending it our way. We missed you!!!<br>
