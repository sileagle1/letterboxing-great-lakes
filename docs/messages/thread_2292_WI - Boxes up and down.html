for spring cleaning before my students go out to do them (and I found<br/>
box #1 was missing anyway).  I hope to have them back out very soon<br/>
along with TTE2!<br/>
<br/>
Also checked on Mathman 2 - Dead Fish.  It was there, but not in the<br/>
right spot.  So it is back in its tree hole for those wishing to get it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just a freindly reminder that April is the annual GL "Check on<br/>
your boxes" month.  So out and spring clean your boxes so they are<br/>
ready for the busy letterboxing season! :-)  If anyone is willing to<br/>
check on my boxes in MI for me and perform maintenance, let me know!<br/>
If anyone needs me to check on their box in the SE WI area, let me<br/>
know too!<br/>
