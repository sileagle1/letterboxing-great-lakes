                    <div class="plaintext-content">I actually had that happen on one occasion. I had recarved a stamp for <br/>
a box since I wasn't happy with the first one.  Drove out to the hiding <br/>
spot.  It was a week or so after some bad storms and there were trees <br/>
down.  With the downed trees it changed the landscape enough that I <br/>
wasn't sure I was in the right location.  Then much to my <br/>
dissapointment I realized that the little den under some uplifted roots <br/>
that the box had been hidded in was gone, because the tree was one that <br/>
had come down.  We searched for the box and best we could determine, it <br/>
ended up buried under the tree.  So lesson learned, no more hiding in <br/>
root dens! LOL <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh yes.  The first time I went out to check on my Lance's Fish Tank<br/>
series I forgot where I had hidden box #3.  I did happen accross a<br/>
geocache while thoroughly searching the log where I *thought* I had<br/>
hidden it.  When I went back and looked at the clues it turns out I<br/>
wasn't even close (we're talking at least a five minute hike from the<br/>
log to the actual location!) and I had only thought about hiding the<br/>
box in that log when I was looking for hiding spots.  Turns out it's a<br/>
good thing I didn't hide it there, since the last time I went to check<br/>
on those boxes that log had been completely burned out!<br/>
<br/>
I also feel the need to follow my own clues at least once a year<br/>
(especially for longer hikes) just to make sure that the landscape<br/>
hasn't changed dramatically enough to render the clues useless.  For<br/>
most of my series/longer hikes, I do use short cuts to go between<br/>
boxes if I'm just doing a quick check so it's important to travel the<br/>
actual route that other boxers will be taking once in a while.<br/>
