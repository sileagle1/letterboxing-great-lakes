Hi everyone, the Sr. members (ha-ha!) of Team Bindlestiff go to<br/>
Chicago for the Strictly Sail show at Navy Pier every winter. This<br/>
year Enders and I are thinking of making it a real TEAM trip by<br/>
joining them. This trip is still being planned cuz we have about 3 wks<br/>
before the show.<br/>
<br/>
So far it looks like we'd leave the Muskegon area on Wed after Jeff<br/>
gets  home from work and drive down to Michigan City, IN for the<br/>
night. Then drive into Chi-town for the boat show, some museums and<br/>
staying overnight on Thurs. For Fri we're heading to the Rockford, IL<br/>
area to meet up with some art friends of my Mom and we'll probably<br/>
stay over in the area for a day or two.<br/>
<br/>
We'd love to get some boxes on this trip so we're asking for any<br/>
locals for input on the best ones to attempt. Team Bindlestiff<br/>
currently has a couple of members on the disabled list - a little<br/>
football talk, since I can't seem to turn around without having a game<br/>
in my face lately, ha! This extreme cold SHOULD be gone by the time<br/>
our trip come around, but for now it's been really tough on Enders CF<br/>
and Moms foot. We're not likely to do any long hikes for this trip.<br/>
<br/>
What are the best boxes along our route from SW MI to Chicago to<br/>
Rockford, IL? I've offered to be the one to take notes, investigate<br/>
the clues and plan the boxing adventures!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are quite a few boxes in the Grand Haven area, but I think BindleBabe<br/>
has nabbed most of those already and that may be a bit early in your trip<br/>
for a leg-stretcher anyway.  There is a 3-box series in Holland (It's  Dog's<br/>
Life), although one of the boxes is currently listed as missing.  I have not<br/>
done these myself as I have been waiting for the missing box to be replaced,<br/>
but they do not appear to be difficult hikes at all.<br/>
<br/>
The Bird and Butterfly, also in Holland, are a longer hike, with some steep<br/>
climbs.  South of that, there are a handful of boxes at Saugatuck Dunes<br/>
State Park if you have not been to those already.  I did Birthday Box and<br/>
First Letterbox on the Lake in the winter with several inches of snow on the<br/>
ground.  My Old Man Winter box was planted in the winter, and my Spring<br/>
Fling box should also be accessible in the snow.  Azobox also has a box<br/>
there -- it may be a bit tougher in the snow, but not impossible, depending<br/>
on how much snow and how the wind has settled it.  These are all medium<br/>
hikes, and if you study a park map, you will probably be able to figure out<br/>
how to nab them in one loop around the park.  The Mt. Baldy box in Saugatuck<br/>
is not a good winter box -- 282 steps that are very icy in the snow.<br/>
<br/>
You may also want to check on a few planted by Azobox down in the South<br/>
Haven area.  It was a beautiful spring day when we were there, so I can't<br/>
say how they might be in the winter -- perhaps he has made the trip over to<br/>
check on them when there was snow on the ground?  If I recall correctly,<br/>
these were medium hikes also.<br/>
<br/>
You definitely do not want to do the Beach View by the Dunes box at Warren<br/>
Dunes SP on this trip.  It is a very long and difficult hike.  It is however<br/>
a rewarding hike (if you go into it knowing what you are getting into), so<br/>
do try to make it back down in nicer weather once you are up for a longer<br/>
hike.<br/>
<br/>
I think that about covers the Michigan part of your trip.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

I believe all the Rockford boxes are in place except for the Red <br/>
Rover box. That one has been missing for quite some time now. My <br/>
Creatures of Blackhawk #3 might be missing due to flooding, but it is <br/>
a very short hike from where the start of #2 is if you want to give <br/>
it a go.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to meet up with some of the Rockfordians while you <br/>
are here, we are always game for a mini meet! Just let us know where <br/>
you will be and we will flock to you. :)<br/>

Oh sure, have a new Grand-baby born into the family and suddenly we're<br/>
the "SENIOR MEMBERS" of the team. You stinker! (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Hey, thanks for giving Angela the hints on boxes ... she *IS* our<br/>
boxing coordinator for the trip. I'll let her know which ones I've<br/>
already gotten.  Heck, I may be revisiting some boxes, if it's an<br/>
image she "HAS" to have. <br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to trying out my new back-pack with built in stool<br/>
that Mr Bindle-Santa bought me!! And as always, I'll have my box<br/>
maintance kit with me and do TLC as needed. For the boxes we do find,<br/>
I'll let the placers know how the box is doing over the winter.<br/>
<br/>
Shutterfly, a mini-meet sounds like a blast! Either Angela or I will<br/>
keep you updated on the trip, ok?<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Hi Enders Angel,<br/>
<br/>
There are many accessible boxes in the Chicago area, many of them near <br/>
museums and attractions.  Below, I've listed some urban letterboxes that <br/>
might fit the bill.<br/>
<br/>
Fungus Woman's Brookfield boxes are near the zoo, accessible by Metra, <br/>
near refreshments and require very little walking.<br/>
MRLC: Sit...Sip...Stay...Box	1	Brookfield, IL<br/>
MRLC: Happy Apple	1	Brookfield, IL<br/>
MRLC: Hurray for Hollywood	1	Brookfield, IL - these three are near the zoo, <br/>
all drive by or take Metra to the zoo stop<br/>
<br/>
Fish Out of Water 1	1	Brookfield/Riverside <br/>
MRLC: Come Grumpy, Go Happy	1	(these two are one stop earlier than the <br/>
Zoo stop).<br/>
<br/>
Pico's<br/>
Historic Chicago Box #1: The Clarke House	1	Chicago, IL	Great location in <br/>
historic district <br/>
Historic Chicago Box #2: The Columbian Exposition	1	Chicago, IL	Not far <br/>
from the Museum of Science and Industry <br/>
<br/>
Matt the Rat's <br/>
Chicago Underground	1	Chicago, IL	Great box, but only if you're feeling <br/>
very, very adventurous - also, steps <br/>
Ilin	1	Chicago, IL	-  Drive by on your way to the big city<br/>
<br/>
If you're so inclined, I may be able to join a gathering in Rockford, also.  Lots <br/>
in Rockford too. In addition to what Shutterfly wrote, I recommend<br/>
<br/>
151 Questions (one of my favorites)<br/>
Symbol of Rockford<br/>
I Want YOU, To Want ME! -both of these are in a city park		<br/>
Peace Plaza, for its location- very easy driveby<br/>
<br/>
