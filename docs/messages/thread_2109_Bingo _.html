I just realized that I meant to email you days ago with questions about the Bingo. <br>
I'd thought I'd play it, but I have yet to place a box, I have yet to find a hitchhiker, I have yet to meet/exchange boxes with other boxers..or something similar to do with one of the sections on your list. I don't have it in front of me. <br>
I haven't found any series boxes. So I suppose I am excluded?<br>

<br>
Would love to have you play Bingo with us!  The game is set up so <br>
that anyone can play, regardless if they have never been <br>
letterboxing in the Great Lakes region, or even if they just started <br>
letterboxing yesterday and have never found a box or met another <br>
letterboxer.<br>
<br>
There are sufficient terms in the general section for you to still <br>
be able to have a 30-item list.  While it could be argued that there <br>
may be a slight advantage to having some of the more obscure terms --<br>
 i.e. you have it and nobody else does when it is called, when it <br>
comes right down to it -- statistically, each item on the list has <br>
the same chance of being called as the next, so make up your list <br>
and get out the lucky rabbit's foot -- although maybe Team Rabbit <br>
has the edge on luck, after all they have 6 rabbit's feet over there.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
<br>
