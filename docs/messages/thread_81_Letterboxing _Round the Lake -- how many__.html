you have the ability to delete your own messages, just not those of others.<br>
If you open one of your own posts, you will see the delete option right<br>
above the address header info.  I didn't know if you would be at the<br>
computer today, so I deleted these two messages per your request.<br>
<br>
I will reply to your message re: Letterboxing 'Round the Lake Boxes later<br>
today.<br>
<br>
Have a good one...<br>
