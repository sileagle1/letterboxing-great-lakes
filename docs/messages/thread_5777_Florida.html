OH, how exciting!  I was there a year ago with my Mom who now lives in N. Ft. Meyers.  We had so much fun!  A year ago the Wild Pigs Run Amuck was missing too, but the walk way for that park was exciting.  And as locals, my Mom and her boyfriend had never been there.  Thats the part I liked.  Going to Florida as a guest and then showing them something/someplace new.  The park with the cell phone tower ( I don't remember the name) it had a couple of boxes, but we only found the one, to the best of my memory, at this park.  We had a beautiful day on bikes we took there.  A nice day with my Mom, who I miss.  What better fun to have together,then letterbox together :)  That trip we found plently more, I would have to look in my log book to note the others.<br>
Thats all, sorry I don't regularly post, but I do enjoy this group when I can.  Take care- Riggsrock<br>
