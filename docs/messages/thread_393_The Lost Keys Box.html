Ok folks, thanks to the kind indulgence of Artistamp, Mobiusklein and Grandvilla, the Lost Keys letterbox is up and running.<br>
<br>
Here's how you get it (should you want it.  And you really, really don't want it):<br>
<br>
While letterboxing, you must lose something significant enough to seriously crimp your chances of getting home.  This includes, but is not limited to:<br>
<br>
   Your keys (either on the trails, locked in car, thrown at bear, etc. etc)<br>
   Your way (should you, of course, ever make it back to civilization to collect the stamp)<br>
   A family member (to that bear you threw your keys at, maybe?)<br>
<br>
Sorry, but your patience or sense of humor do not qualify you for the stamp.  There are those sick enough among us to suggest that the loss of those two items is part of the fun.<br>
<br>
Should you feel that you (from this point forward, retroactive losses don't count) qualify for this stamp, your story must be posted on this list for all to read, judge (and laugh at).  If general concensus feels that it is a significant enough loss, I'll contact you privately with the next steps.<br>
<br>
Cheers, and hopefully loss-free hunting!<br>
<br>
Delirium<br>
