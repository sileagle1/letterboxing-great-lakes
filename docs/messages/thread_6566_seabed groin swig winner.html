Congrats Pastor's Wife!<br/>
<br/>
Please email me offlist at baliddle@sbcglobal.net with your <br/>
name/address to I can send you your prize.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! Bali<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  For the rest of you, I hope people were able to figure out the <br/>
code.  I thought it was pretty obvious that since the last 2 letters <br/>
of every word were the same, they must have been pig-latin'd <br/>
first.  But, I heard from a couple people that it was really hard and <br/>
they didn't get it.  Sorry about that!  I didn't mean to make it all <br/>
that hard to solve.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all enjoyed the side game, anyway!<br/>
