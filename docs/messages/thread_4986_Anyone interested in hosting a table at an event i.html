<br/>
I just received an e-mail from a staff member at the Porcupine<br/>
Mountain Wilderness Park. Here is a portion of the e-mail:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, from the Porcupine Mountains Wilderenss! I work at the Porkies<br/>
in Administrative Support. We are planning our 2nd annual Hunters<br/>
Harvest Festival September 5th, 6th &amp; 7th 2008. Michigan Geocaching<br/>
will be a booth at our festival this year and we are interested in<br/>
having a letterboxing booth also. Do you know of anyone in the<br/>
letterboxing world in our area that enjoys holding events or would<br/>
provide instructional information for our event? I appreciate your<br/>
response. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We could possibly help with this event, but would prefer a more<br/>
experienced letterboxer to take the lead.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
Keweenaw Kimballs<br/>
