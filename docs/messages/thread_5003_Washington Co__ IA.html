Washington Co., IA (isn't she wonderful?)<br/>
<br/>
Washington Co., is littered with boxes by Maude.<br/>
<br/>
Our first find was a nice easy box -- esp. with little kids in the mud. <br/>
Maude used a technique of not using a box, rather a custome made <br/>
weather proof bag . . . Skeeter said, "its not a letterbox, its a <br/>
letterbag!" Bonus there was a HH inside!<br/>
<br/>
We went on to find a couple more before lunch, after lunch we figured <br/>
out the clues to "A Great Combo." Hidden inside a 1930's nightclub that <br/>
is closed on Sundays and holds off hours during the week.<br/>
<br/>
I knew the restaurant was closed on Sundays, but we were 2 hours from <br/>
home and just had to try. I attempted to open the door and to my <br/>
surprise it opened!! I went downstairs and found out that the <br/>
establishment was closed, but they were having a kids birthday party <br/>
downstairs... the woman I spoke to knew of the box and handed it to me! <br/>
<br/>
The best boxes are the ones you aren't expecting to find . . . but do <br/>
anyways.<br/>
<br/>
Bonus, it also had a HH inside, the Hines Emerald Dragonfly HH"  it is <br/>
one of my favorite HH's we've ever found (minus a small store bought <br/>
stamp) because A) It was released in 2004 -- 4 years ago! And 2) It had <br/>
some BIG names inside (many of which I recognize), released by Merlin &amp; <br/>
Andrea! Found by Sophie &amp; Me, Kiss Me Kate, The Christmas Elves, <br/>
RaqsEnigma, Shutterfly, Laughing Coyote, The Dragon, Jacks, Acorn, <br/>
Leapin' Lizards, Wisconsin Hiker &amp; Martini Man, and a bunch of names I <br/>
didn't recognize.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up finding 7 boxes and the last box of the day contained <br/>
another HH -- 3 total.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Maude for the fun day . . . looking forward to meeting you and <br/>
others at the NE Iowa Gathering on Sat.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to hear you had a fun &amp; successful LB day!  We also were pleasantly<br/>
surprised 2 weekends ago to find 5 hitchhikers while boxing in Illinois.<br/>
One of them was especially well traveled and people we've met on both coasts<br/>
had stamped in (Amanda from Seattle, Funhog, Der Mad Stamper, Wanda, Team<br/>
Green Dragon) as well as some boxers in the midwest, including Scoutdogs.<br/>
This hitchhiker had even been to Germany!<br/>

Wisconsin Hiker.<br/>
