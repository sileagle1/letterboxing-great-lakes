                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it is a matter of preference on this.  Here's the way I do it:<br>
<br>
--  After sanding the blocks I wipe them good with a tack cloth<br>
--  Stamp the image on one side (the easiest way to get a good impression is to ink your stamp, lay it ink side up on a folded piece of paper toweling or a cutting mat -- something with a little give to it -- and then lower your wood block down onto it, being careful to center it and not move it, and apply even pressure).  I use StayzOn black ink for this.<br>
--  Let the wood block lay for a few minutes to make sure the ink is dry.<br>
--  Take it to the garage and lay the block image side up on a piece of freezer paper and spray the image side and all 4 edges lightly with clear laquer or polyuerethane -- don't spray the empty side where your stamp will go because the adhesive will not bond as tightly to a glossy finish -- I have not found any one brand that works better than another, I think right now I am using Rustoleum -- I do find I like the semi-gloss /satin finish the best though (personal preference)<br>
--  Wait for this to dry completely and lightly sand with a fine grit paper if it feels gritty (I don't usually do this)<br>
--  Lay the block empty side up and center your rubber stamp piece on it and lightly trace around it with pencil onto the wood (make sure the stamp is orientated right per the image you've stamped on the other side)<br>
-- Now lay both the wood block and the stamp onto a piece of toweling and apply adhesive to the wood block inside the pencil outline and to the entire back of the stamp.  I use contact cement for this and have had perfect results every time and the stamps have held up great for 3 years through heat, humidity and freezing cold, repeated use and even submersion in water -- my favorite brands are Dap and Elmer's as they seem a little less gunky than some of the others.<br>
<br>
THE IMPORTANT THING WHEN USING CONTACT CEMENT:  You have to let the individual pieces cure for a little bit before putting them together.  This varies by brand, but it is usually about 30 minutes -- it will get glossy.  Then you put the two pieces together being careful to get it where you want it the first time because you're not moving it once it is stuck.<br>
<br>
A lot of times I have read on the big list where people have problems with contact cement that the stamp just peels right off the wood even after its dried.  This is because they didn't read the directions and let the adhesive cure on the pieces first.  Contact cement is supposed to just peel apart when you don't do the curing part -- it is a removable adhesive in that way.  But for a permanent bond, you have to let it cure first and it works great.<br>
