Great idea HowD girls!  Congratulations to the Atomic Beans on their WIN!<br>
That sounds like a great way to escape the heat, bugs, and evil plants, but<br>
still experience the thrill of the hunt.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for the Anniversary greetings and we send our best wishes<br>
to Trail Troll on HER anniversary today!<br>

They should give you a sales commission!  We just signed up to do the Harry Potter one at the Art Institute later this month.  The Art Institute is probably the only "big" museum in Chicago that we haven't visited with the kids, so this will be a fun way to do that.<br>
