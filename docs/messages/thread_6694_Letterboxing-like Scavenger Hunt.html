Great idea HowD girls!  Congratulations to the Atomic Beans on their WIN!<br/>
That sounds like a great way to escape the heat, bugs, and evil plants, but<br/>
still experience the thrill of the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for the Anniversary greetings and we send our best wishes<br/>
to Trail Troll on HER anniversary today!<br/>

They should give you a sales commission!  We just signed up to do the Harry Potter one at the Art Institute later this month.  The Art Institute is probably the only "big" museum in Chicago that we haven't visited with the kids, so this will be a fun way to do that.<br/>

&gt; That's so cool! I signed up for the newsletter. Maybe we will have to<br/>
&gt; make an 'event' or 'gathering' out of one of these. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This past weekend, my sister Fermont came to town to take me and Coffee <br/>
&gt; Beans on a fun adventure in the city. She had registered us for a <br/>
&gt; 'Watson Adventure' scavenger hunt in the Field Museum, and it was<br/>
&gt; AWESOME!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can go to their website for more details <br/>
&gt; (http://watsonadventures.com/schedule_chicago.html), but basically, we <br/>
&gt; were given a set of clues to solve that required us to run around the <br/>
&gt; museum for a few hours while collecting clues. This hunt was one of <br/>
&gt; their 'adult' hunts which were meant to be more challenging, but we <br/>
&gt; found that our letterboxing skills were VERY helpful. While some of the <br/>
&gt; clues required simply reading a informational board...a few others <br/>
&gt; required seeing things that, while in plain sight, were not obvious <br/>
&gt; (sounds familiar, eh). Anyway, needless to say, we WON beating out the <br/>
&gt; nine other teams on that day, and we were actually the only ones who <br/>
&gt; were able to solve the murder.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We'd recommend it to any letterboxers, maybe even as a way to pull in <br/>
&gt; those extra family members/friends who aren't so keen on finding <br/>
&gt; tupperware in the woods and use this as a compromise position. In <br/>
&gt; addition to Chicago, they are offered in several other cities, and they <br/>
&gt; do have some kid-friendly ones (Like the Harry Potter one at the Art <br/>
&gt; Institute).<br/>
