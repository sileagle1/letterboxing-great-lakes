What a hot day and to make matters worse, when you see the size of the <br/>

Azobox, the boxes were wet inside but no damage to stamp or logbook. We <br/>
dried them out before replacing them in their hiding spots. Wish Lucky Day <br/>
was up and running but hey you can't have everything. I love it when we get <br/>
"paid" to go letterboxing!<br/>

I can't imagine doing "I Spy" on a day like yesterday! Ohmigosh. It<br/>
was too hot and humid for me even to think about letterboxing,<br/>
but I have rumors that some World Travelers were out and about over<br/>
the weekend.<br/>
Thanks for the reports -- I do appreciate hearing about those guys.<br/>
