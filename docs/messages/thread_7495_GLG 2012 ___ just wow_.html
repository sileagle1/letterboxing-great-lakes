We were only able to attend for a few hours after she ran into some itchy weeds, but we had a BLAST. We will go back and find the other boxes soon. Thank you SO much to AF and VBP for all of the work you put into the event. We were so delighted to be a part of it.<br/>

Also wanted to echo everyone's thoughts about the gathering.  What a great choice of location, and an excellent job hiding so many boxes all around the park.  We had a fantastic day searching for them, and even got to squeeze in a few more on Sunday morning before the long-promised stop at the swimming pool!<br/>

So sorry to leave everyone high and dry on Tom and Jerry. Our eldest came down with a terrible fever the morning of the event so we were a no show. Tom and Jerry will soon find a permanent home here in SE Wi. Many apologies again!<br/>
