Mr. 6 I don't know about that whole gold nugget thing....the littlest BB decided to eat a dime a few weeks back, and my dad said if it came out a quarter he had a whole jar of dimes for her, but thus 4 days later...it was still a dime :)<br/>

<br/>
Nobody has to worry about me winning - I have 9 spots called and they're all horizontal/vertical alignment, so I'm light years away from the "X" game! Clearly I need to hit the trails this year to get a better selection of possibilities form the list! :)<br/>
