                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last Friday I took a little bike ride north from Chicago to check on<br/>
some letterboxes and scout out locations for new ones in Kenilworth &amp;<br/>
Wilmette. The Illinois #1 box has been missing since last year, but<br/>
I'd hoped that it was simply misplaced in the bushes nearby. This time<br/>
I did a thorough search of the area: it is gone. That box was placed<br/>
in 1998 by someone named Rachel and was the only one in northern<br/>
Illinois for many years. I'm sad to remove it from the LbNA website,<br/>
but I don't plan on replacing it. <br/>
<br/>
Also, a reminder to newcomers and old-timers alike: be careful when<br/>
you rehide boxes! I stopped by Grosse Point Lighthouse and could<br/>
easily see it in its hiding place. Way too easy for kids or random<br/>
hikers to find. Make sure there is no way that anyone can see that<br/>
shiny plastic box or plastic bags inside glinting in the sun, cover it<br/>
completely! Only the real letterboxes will know where to look behind<br/>
that rock or that piece of loose bark to see what is inside, it<br/>
shouldn't be at all visible to just anyone passing by. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I ran out of time and forgot to check on the Magic Hedge. Its<br/>
meant to be a challenge, so I'm not surprised that a number of people<br/>
can't find it. You might be within a foot of it, but unless you look<br/>
in an unexpected direction, you won't find it.<br/>
