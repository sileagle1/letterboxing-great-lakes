As you'll see at the site, I'm still working on a few things, but<br/>
you'll get the majority of what we have in store for you!  I'd say<br/>
don't print it off 'til the last minute.  I'll post when updates are<br/>
available to this list.<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure I'll be attending on Saturday.  Stupid me! On the way<br/>
down to plant the boxes today (whoops! It's after midnight), Thursday,<br/>
it occurred to me that I forgot to make the Garlic Mushrooms box! (Too<br/>
much stuff on my mind.)  So I still have to make that and go plant it.<br/>
 The Ren Faire suggested I might get in free on Sat if I need to come<br/>
and plant boxes, so maybe I'll take them up on that. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Not to slight anyone, you will notice I found easy ways to get some<br/>
references to myself, Pippin, and FungusWoman into the clues (sorry,<br/>
they just don't sell tacos at the Faire).  I hope you enjoy my story!<br/>

Dragon, I hope you list the new clues soon, cause I'm chomping at the <br/>

everything in 1 spot!!!!  (Well only 1 day cause I can only get hubby <br/>
out there only once!  LOL)  This year we'll be bringing the WHOLE pack <br/>

cooties, I think I got that out of the kids' systems at S.I.L.O. I.  <br/>
