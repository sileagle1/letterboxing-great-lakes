continued the fun today to find the 14 boxes we were too tired to <br>
find.  (Must have been all that circus exhaustion!  But what great <br>
stamps -- worth the effort.)<br>
<br>
Especially for Team 5th Wheeler (grin), the group photo from the <br>
gathering is in the photos section.  Apologies to those who were at <br>
the gathering but weren't around for the photo...if you email us, <br>
we'll add you to the list as 'missing in action' :).  <br>
<br>
The names of the 'boxers are on the 'Left', 'Right', and 'Center' <br>
versions of the pictures.  Seems Yahoo doesn't allow for a <br>
description large enough to hold all of us.   We hope we got all the <br>
names correct; if not, we'd be happy to fix any errors.  <br>
<br>
More photos will follow tomorrow, if The Nickerboxer cooperates with <br>
a nice long nap...<br>
