me it has internet access (not very reliable though)<br/>
<br/>
So far we're having a wonderful trip (those of you who don't know,<br/>
we're cruising Lake Superior and the North Channel of Lake Huron for<br/>
two months aboard our sailboat) and Bindle Bum made one of my<br/>
childhood dreams come true.  Since I was 10 years old, I've wanted to<br/>
view the Pictured Rocks "from my own boat" (who knew it would be a<br/>
sailboat) and now I've done it!<br/>
<br/>
I created an album on my yahoogroup "Lake Superior Cruise" and<br/>
uploaded just a few of pictures ... some cool, some funny. (Internet<br/>
keeps dropping and making things like uploading files difficult)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested here's the link to the homepage. (Remember,<br/>
you'll have to join if you're not already a member, just unsubscribe<br/>
afterwords if you want to) <br/>

I downloaded a ton of digests for messages from this list (geez oh<br/>
pizza, can I please beg you guys to snip messages when you make a<br/>
reply?!) and haven't gone through them all but I MUST know how Fungus<br/>
Woman is doing from the spider bite. I'm sending you healing thoughts<br/>
and best wishes, my friend.<br/>

Unfortunately the newest changes that Yahoo! has made do not <br/>
encourage this.  If you are receiving the group messages in e-mail <br/>
and have your format set to HTML (I believe this is the default when <br/>
you sign up at the group), you cannot delete part of the message <br/>
when replying.  Your choice is all or nothing, and deleting the <br/>
entire body of the message you are replying to often leaves people <br/>
wondering what your comment is about.<br/>
<br/>
You can get around this one of two ways:<br/>
<br/>
1) Change your e-mail preferences to the traditional style.  If you <br/>
go to the home page and then click on "Edit My Membership" up at the <br/>
top, you will see your Message Preference setting.  The HTML setting <br/>
is now called "Fully Featured."  Change this to "Traditional."  <br/>
Unfortunately while this will allow you to delete portions of the <br/>
text in messages you are replying to, it does not enable you to take <br/>
advantage of some of the graphical things that Yahoo! is doing.  So <br/>
as an alternative, you can...<br/>
2) Reply to messages you wish to snip at the list online.<br/>
