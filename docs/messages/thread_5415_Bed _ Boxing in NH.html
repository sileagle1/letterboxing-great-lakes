                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are back from our four day foray to New Hampshire and the Bed & Boxing event <br>
sponsored by Mark & Sue Pepe in Jackson, New Hampshire.  WOW!  We sure had a great <br>
time!  We are here to disclaim any notion that New Englanders aren't as hospitable as us <br>
good ol' Midwesterners!  Our only hope is that if any one from outside our region comes <br>
to one of our events, that we should be as gracious as we were treated!<br>
<br>
What was so nice about this kind of event is that it was with a fairly small group (around <br>
30) that over a forty hour period of time were able to really get to know each other.  There <br>
wasn't that pressure to choose between hunting for boxes or meet and exchange.  There <br>
was time for both.  We were able to share several meals, hikes, and  leisure time together.  <br>
We thoroughly enjoyed the company of everyone!  Although most of the group knew each <br>
other, many having traveled to Dartmoor or cruised with Mark & Sue, they welcomed us in <br>
as if we had been boxing with them all along. The New England letterboxers were fun and <br>
fabulous!<br>
<br>
We arrived in NH early the first day in order to box our way across the Kancamagus Hwy. <br>
before the event started on Friday night.  We got off the plane in Manchester and were <br>
greeted with a heavy drizzle of rain which would be our weather for the next three days.  I <br>
thought we were in Oregon!  We drove straight up to the western end of the Hwy. and hit <br>
our first box in NH.  The clues warned this was not a box for children!...VERY <br>
SLIPPERY....repeated in the clues and read to Tonto NUMEROUS times.  The location was a <br>
swift moving, wide river with lots of scattered boulders causing mini waterfalls all across.  <br>
Quite beautiful!  A very large flat rock, about 35 feet square, jetted out across the river <br>
that was mentioned in the clues for a bearing reading.  It was at an angle facing <br>
downstream.  And did I mention VERY SLIPPERY????  Oh, that's right, you heard me didn't <br>
you?  Well guess who didn't?<br>
<br>
Our first box and Tonto's feet slip from under him.  He is flat on his backside sliding in <br>
slow motion right before my very eyes down the slope of the rock toward the river!  In <br>
typical fashion, my first response isn't, "Are you hurt?" but blood curdling, ""What the <br>
blankety-blank do you think you are doing!!!"  Fear for me manifests itself as anger in <br>
split seconds!  Miraculously, his momentum stopped inches from the edge.  I was out in <br>
the middle of the rock and couldn't get to him.  He was so stunned he just laid there <br>
sprawled out and motionless.  Tonto was down for the count!<br>
<br>
All I could think about is "Dang!  There goes our letterboxing trip!"  How sick is that?  <br>
Don't answer...I know I'm bad.  Thankfully, by the time I made it over to him, he was able <br>
to slowly get to a standing position.  He said his elbow was hurting a bit, but other than <br>
that he was O.K.  Of course he blamed it on his worn out boot treads.  Yeah right!  His <br>
entire back side head to toe was wet, but he managed to gingerly make his way back to <br>
the shore.  His stubborn Dutchness came out as he immediately started looking under <br>
roots for that elusive box.  Way to go Tonto!  Shake off that near death experience and go <br>
for the carved rubber!  You're the man!<br>
Unfortunately, we never did find the box, but that was the only one that eluded us the <br>
entire trip!  He had been baptized by water and earned his reward by finding all the other <br>
attempted boxes.  Warning: New Hampshire can be very slippery!<br>
<br>
The weather was rainy, but those New Englanders are a hearty group and we boxed in the <br>
rain, the sleet and drizzle, and still managed to have such fun.  We scaled more rocky, <br>
uphill trails than I've seen in a long time.  I guess that's why they call it the granite state!  <br>
There is some of the stuff scattered on every trail!  We saw gorgeous waterfalls, but no <br>
moose.  Some of the boxes we found had been in the wild for over five/six years.  That <br>
was exciting to see "old" boxes still in place.  The food, comraderie, and fun made for a <br>
memorable trip. We'd go back in a heart beat!<br>
 Oh, I almost forgot about Betty the ghost!  But, that will have to be another story!<br>
