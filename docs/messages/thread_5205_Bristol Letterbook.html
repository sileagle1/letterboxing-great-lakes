scanned in and uploaded the current pages of the Spellbook of<br/>
Incantrix which is a letterbook at ren faire.  You can find it in the<br/>
"Files" section of this site.<br/>
<br/>
Finders are not only to stamp into the logbook but should also write<br/>
another page to the continuing story.  <br/>
<br/>
Those who have found the book in the past can see where the story has<br/>
headed since they stamped in.  Those seeking the book for the first<br/>
time can read ahead of time so they know what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
I scanned all the pages in, so do not feel bad if you didn't<br/>
contribute to the story line.  We all know that circumstances don't<br/>
always allow us to stamp in as we might've liked to.  There is no rule<br/>
saying one cannot find the book again and add to the story again. <br/>
(Only count one find though...)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
