I don't think this is referring to the photo storage on groups.  I <br/>
think it's for individuals to use for developement, photo storage and <br/>
sharing ( like flickr or webshots).  Sounds to me like they own both <br/>
Yahoo Photos and Flickr, and they're dumping Yahoo Photos only.  I <br/>
don't think the groups have anything to worry about.<br/>
