One year, Caveman was going after some blueberries up in northwest Wisconsin<br/>
and a big ol' bear paw came thru the dense brush, aiming for the same<br/>
blueberries.  Paw and hand met.   I'm not sure which one of 'em was running<br/>
faster but they both went flyin'.  In opposite directions.<br/>
<br/>
Caveman was a wee bit ticked at me for laughing............but I couldn't<br/>
help it.<br/>

We picked a quart yesterday while letterboxing in Madison...it was our second time looking for this particular box...still no luck, but we knew that it was the same time of year that we discovered massive amounts of blackberries two years ago and made it a point to go back and pick while searching. Not many boxes, but yes...very stained hands! :)<br/>
