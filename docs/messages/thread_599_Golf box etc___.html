                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmm, I am smiling at your comments about French Creek.  This is exactly<br/>
what I would have said after a rather lengthy, but eventually successful,<br/>
search for the box two years ago.  I e-mailed the placer to let her know,<br/>
but apparently the clues haven't changed or perhaps it is meant to add to<br/>
the difficulty of finding the box?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you had a fun trip!  I really enjoyed myself in the general<br/>
Cleveland area and would love to go back since there are so many new boxes<br/>
there now -- I think I'll skip that muddy one though.<br/>
<br/>
BTW -- Is the Burton's Log Cabin box still in place and has anyone else<br/>
found it?  I was FF for that box when I was there 2 years ago and something<br/>
about that box just totally creeped me out.  I was fine with the walk<br/>
through the graveyard, it was once I got beyond there and back into the<br/>
woods that I started to feel like Bubba and Earle were going to drive up in<br/>
a lopsided pickup truck and throw a lifeless body off the back end, spewing<br/>
mud from the back tires as they squealed away.<br/>

LOL! Burton's Log Cabin was on our list, but we never<br/>
got away on Sunday to head to Geauga county. I'll have<br/>
to remember to bring the hillbilly repellent, Crest<br/>
Toothpaste, on our next trip. <br/>
