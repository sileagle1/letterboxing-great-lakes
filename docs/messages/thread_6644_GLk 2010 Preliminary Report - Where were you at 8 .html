We echo TJ_Mich's thanks for the hotel block.  We really appreciated that convenience.  We liked the booklet style for the clues and including the maps.  Thanks to all for planning, carving, planting, arranging, supporting, attending, etc.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">At roughly 8:00, Leapin' Lizards and The Dragon were trying to finish the last two boxes of the coin operated series. Sara and Dragon headed back to the car as the rain poured down and John replaced the last box. Sara handed John the lightning rod...er, umbrella to hold. Thanks.:) We started running to the car, then made it back to the campsite to find Dragon's tent tipped on its side. He had "heavy stuff in it, but didn't stake it down." Window was down, so water was inside. LL frantically tried to find shower gear and clothing in their tent as the sirens wailed from what seemed like all directions. Made it to the showers and then tried to figure out where the tornadoes where going through by listening to the radio and checking the gps.<br>
