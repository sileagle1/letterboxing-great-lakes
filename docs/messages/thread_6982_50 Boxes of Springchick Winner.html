                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK...NO ONE is even CLOSE to winning the 50 Boxes of Springchick game (although Wisconsin Hiker is in the lead...but we all know how her luck is going this year with bingo, so I wouldn't be too concerned just yet). Anyhow, in the event that several people fill all 50 boxes in on the same day, those winners will have their names thrown into a bag to determine the ACTUAL winner. THERE WILL ONLY BE ONE WINNER FOR THE 50 BOXES OF SPRINGCHICK GAME! The 50 BOS Booty will not be split up! There will be NO 2nd or 3rd place winners in this game, just ONE grand prize winner! Good luck! :)<br/>
