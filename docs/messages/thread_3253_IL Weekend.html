                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well our IL weekend started out great (except for al that traffic <br/>
congestion on I294 last night).  Finally made it to Elgin a bit <br/>
before 8 pm last night and met the Cottontails for dinner at a <br/>
brewpub.  We enjoyed exchanging lots of letterboxing chit-chat with <br/>
them.  They seem to be doing great with less than 2 months to go <br/>
until the twins emerge.  It sounds like they have been busy getting <br/>
the house rearranged in preparation for the big event, but we did see <br/>
them out on the trail today on the hunt for a new series in Elgin!<br/>
<br/>
We started our morning today in search of some of the fantastic <br/>
Cottontail stamps we hadn't looked for yet, including two more in <br/>
their artist series.  GREAT!, as we expected.  In addition to the <br/>
great stamps, we really enjoy reading about the history of the <br/>
artist.  <br/>
<br/>
While in Elgin, we also found 5 of the 7 "Things that Ruin a Picnic" <br/>
boxes.  Didn't realize until late in the game that some were simply <br/>
in a baggie, not a box, so it is possible we missed the last two. (We <br/>
didn't do the series in sequential order). If you are a more diligent <br/>
searcher than we were, you might be able to uncover the bear and <br/>
skunk.<br/>
<br/>
Also in Elgin was the great new "Nurtured by Love" series.  I think <br/>
these newer boxers used the Cottontails as their example - <br/>
interesting background clues, great stamps, and very well put-<br/>
together boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Enroute to DeKalb we looked for the Campton Preserve box, but no <br/>
luck.  We suspect it may be missing.<br/>
<br/>
In DeKalb we found 4 boxes by Hercules and another Grail box we <br/>
needed.  More nice stamps!<br/>
<br/>
So even on a damp, drizzly, dreary November day, we managed to find <br/>
19 boxes and left a HH in one of them.  Nothing like a full day of <br/>
boxing to make it a fun day, regardless of weather!  Tomorrow we plan <br/>
to "tackle" the Big Ten series in the Wheaton area.<br/>

P.S.  Stay tuned Michigan!  It's not over, til it's over!<br/>
