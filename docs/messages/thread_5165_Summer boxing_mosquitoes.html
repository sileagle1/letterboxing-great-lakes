Ugh yes, I was completely eaten alive by the swarms of mosquitoes in SE<br/>
WI and NE IL this weekend. :( I have 25 bites on just one elbow! Our<br/>
can of bug spray ran out and the Walgreens we stopped at was completely<br/>
sold out too, so we had to use some bug wipes instead -- if you ask me,<br/>
they do nothing. :P Go with the spray!! But we had a good time boxing<br/>
anyway. :)<br/>

Although we have not YET encountered the bugs of summer, we do try to<br/>
remember to take the over-the-head mosquito netting that we got just<br/>
before the McHenry event a few years ago.   The unfortunate 'bug in the<br/>
mouth' is an experience to avoid!!<br/>
<br/>
We got our nets at Gander Mtn but I'm sure most sporting goods stores<br/>
would have them as well. A good investment when the bugs get thick.<br/>
