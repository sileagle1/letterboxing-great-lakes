                    <div class="plaintext-content">Amongst our boxin' yesterday, I was finally able to check up on the <br/>
Tunnel #3 box and to place the companion Tunnel #2 and Tunnel #1 <br/>
boxes.  You'll find the clues posted on the LBNA site now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to WI Hiker and Martini Man and others that have taken great <br/>
care of the Tunnel #3 box so that it was found in great shape when I <br/>
arrived!  I had expected the worst, but other than the original <br/>
logbook being destroyed, everything else was okay.  I'm so glad I <br/>
didn't have to carve a new stamp while I was there!  (For those of <br/>
you that have been there, imagine carving for an hour there in the <br/>
middle of July!)<br/>
<br/>
There is a bunch of bush-wacking to get to the Tunnel #3 box right <br/>
now, and we also saw lots of stinging nettles and poison ivy.  As <br/>
far as ticks are concerned, we didn't see any there.  Although I <br/>
braved it with three small kids and their mom, you might want to <br/>
wait until fall or spring.<br/>
<br/>
I should also note that all three boxes now require that you bring <br/>
inking pens if you want to color them as suggested. Please clean <br/>
them when you are done, either way.  I removed the pens from the <br/>
Tunnel #3 box.  The tunnel #2 and #1 boxes don't require bush-<br/>
wacking, but all three boxes really require that you go during the <br/>
biking season when the tunnels are unlocked so you can walk through <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you can always bike the trail to find the boxes instead of <br/>
hiking.  Just remember you need a trail pass to bike on the trail, <br/>
but walking is free.<br/>

Off to MN!<br/>
