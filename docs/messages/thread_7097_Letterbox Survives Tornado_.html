                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last June, there was a tornado in Eagle, WI, that did damage at Old World Wisconsin.  There's a link to the photo of the parking lot at the end of this post.  Last fall we visited OWW and tried to get the LB, but the trail was impassable - picture jumbled Lincoln logs stacked across the trail.  Today we approached from the Clausing Barn side, found the trail rough but easily passable until the last few yards.  We were SO close, my box-dar said, so we did some climbing over, under and through - and Mr. Peabody found the box!   And the actual box itself is quite impressive!  We were so happy to find this LB from 2005 had survived the tornado!<br>
