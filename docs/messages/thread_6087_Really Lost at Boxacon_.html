(Also, pay attention to where you've headed from there on out, because<br/>
otherwise you will have the Lost experience as well as the Lost boxes, like<br/>
we did.  It's amazing that you can leave several different groups in<br/>
opposite directions and end up facing each other coming down a path ... but,<br/>
as they say, the island does strange things ... )<br/>
