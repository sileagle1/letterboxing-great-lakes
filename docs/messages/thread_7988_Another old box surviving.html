 </p><p>We first visited “Shanty Boys” in 2012. We stamped then but
did not stamp this time. However, we did have two new letterboxers stamp in.
Two more of our grandchildren who we have introduced to letterboxing
adventures. They don’t have trail names yet, so they haven’t posted on the
letterboxing site. We have six grandchildren and all are letterboxers!</p><p>
<br/></p><p>Your box is in great shape with that large piece of outer
bark holding up surprisingly well. The box is completely dry inside so your
journal is safe. A wonderful stamp and a wonderful subject. One of our
grandfathers was indeed a shanty boy. He remembered his times in the woods with
his carving of the miniature logging camp which is on permanent display at the
Iron County Museum in Caspian, Michigan.</p><p>
