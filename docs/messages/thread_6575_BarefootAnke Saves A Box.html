I want to publically thank BarefootAnke for repairing one of my damaged letterboxes and quickly alerting me to the problems. He was only able to make temporary repairs but he did ALL he could. Today, I found the broken box dangling by a piece of tape and hanging on for dear life.  It was truly a red alert emergency situation.  The box, logbook, and stamp were saved.  Many thanks BarefootAnke!!!  <br/>
