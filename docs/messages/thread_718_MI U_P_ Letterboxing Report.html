The following MI U.P. letterboxes were all found during the week of <br>
9/25 - 10/2.  We replaced a few baggies and dried off some stamps, <br>
but for the most part everything was in good repair, with the <br>
exception of TJ_Mich Leelinaw box -- everything was soaked inside <br>
the box and much of the soggy logbook was unreadable.  I had an <br>
extra log book so I replaced it with the dry one and took the wet <br>
one -- it has dried out and I will send it to you via U.S. Mail.<br>

We believe the following boxes may be missing and will get in touch <br>
with the placer individually:<br>
<br>
Miner's Falls<br>
Little Girl's Point (previously reported as missing)<br>
<br>
<br>
I printed the clues for Shamrock's two new Keeweenaw boxes just <br>
before leaving the house but neglected to add them to my "list" and <br>
forgot all about them until a couple days after leaving the Copper <br>
Harbor area.  So those two will have to wait until next trip, as <br>
well as the Beaver Trail box at Bob Lake -- we looked and didn't <br>
find, and then later realized what we had done wrong.<br>
<br>
Thanks again to everyone who has placed boxes in the U.P.  What a <br>
wonderful place to spend a week sightseeing and letterboxing!<br>
