LOVE the cicadas..she only has them on her arm...You probably don't <br>
want to see the pictures of them scampering on my face and <br>
hair...And, I won't even mention in my ....uh....mouth!<br>
<br>
We have them so thick here that I am guiding field trips around my <br>
back yard to watch the mayhem!  It is so noisy that you can hear them <br>
over the roar of the lawn mower.  <br>
<br>
It is nothing short of a cicada orgy!  <br>
<br>
In matter of fact, Tonto went out to his car this morning to put <br>
something in the trunk.  He returned inside to kiss the old girl <br>
goodbye...He nonchalantly said in the midst of the kiss, "Is there <br>
one on my neck?"  <br>
Sure enough, as I opened my eyes, (Yes, I close my eyes when he <br>
kisses me...)there was one coming around the corner, so to speak, <br>
from his ear to his chin....A male to be sure as it was making a <br>
whole lot of racket...Probably realized Tonto wasn't exactly his type!<br>
I'm getting sad that they will be gone by the fourth of July...not to <br>
be seen again for seventeen more years!<br>
