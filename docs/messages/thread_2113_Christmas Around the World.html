Subject: [LbGLK] Christmas Around the World<br>
<br>
We checked on our "Christmas around the World" series a few days<br>
before Christmas and all was well.  Now that the temperatures are out<br>
of the teens, it might be a good time to grab these boxes before they<br>
go out of circulation on January 16th or thereabouts.<br>
<br>
Waltzing Pigs<br>
 ================================<br>
<br>
That's exactly what we're hoping to do!<br>
<br>
We did some boxing on our way to celebrate Christmas Eve with Martini Man's<br>
side of the family in the Madison, WI area. We found "Peas in a Pod" and<br>
"Lions" and also put another logbook in our "Picnic in the Capitol" box<br>
since we had received a report that there were only a few pages left in the<br>
first book (Thanks Christmas Elves!).  Christmas morning we headed back home<br>
to celebrate with my (Wisconsin Hiker) side of the family and found 3 boxes<br>
by the MonkeyHunters (Messy Trails Hybrid Cache, Skybrid Cache and Quest for<br>
BigTooth).  We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the hybrid boxes<br>
contained HAND-CARVED stamps.  All the other combo geocache/letterboxes that<br>
we have found before only had an off-the-shelf, store-bought stamp.  Glad we<br>
decided to give another hybrid a try.  The Quest for BigTooth box was along<br>
a great trail that followed a creek and crossed it several times.  Very<br>
pretty on a winter day, with some light snow falling occasionally.  Also a<br>
good way to start each day since it gave us a chance to get outside and get<br>
a little exercise before all the holiday eating & drinking began!  [P.S.<br>
All the boxes were in great shape - totally dry inside.]<br>
<br>
Now we're planning another 2-day visit to northern IL to find some boxes.<br>
We're hoping to be there Thursday & Friday this week and the "Christmas<br>
Around the World" boxes are definitely on our list.  We had hoped to also do<br>
the "Big Ten" series, but when we checked the clues yesterday we found out<br>
that they have all been pulled for the winter.  Oh well, we have other ones<br>
we can look for!  One of them is the latest  Cemetery Stroll box.  We're<br>
"making our list and checking it twice" before we head out.<br>
<br>
We hope you all have a chance to do some boxing this week.  It is still<br>
pretty on the trails and there are a lot less "scratchy things".<br>
