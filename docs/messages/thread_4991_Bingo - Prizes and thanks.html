great addition to the photo album!<br/>
<br/>
thanks again to SpringChick for the dedication to organize this <br/>
awesome winter diversion. <br/>
<br/>
and a big thanks also to Azobox for the extra excitement and the <br/>
clever presentation of the side wagers!  and again, i was not going <br/>
to enter this.... I picked an early date which azobox later assured <br/>
me might have the potential to win....  And i could have won it with <br/>
my own card ..... if only SpringChick had pulled the Exchange on the <br/>
3rd. <br/>

&gt; I already have the stuff divided out and packaged up so I can <br/>
deliver some at the Fairies Gathering today and I don't want to take <br/>
away the surprise from any of the winners, especially those whose <br/>
packages I need to mail.  But if the winners would like to take <br/>
photos or otherwise divulge the contents of the booty they receive <br/>
that would be fine.<br/>

&gt;   Spring Chick, what are the chances of us seeing pictures or at <br/>
least <br/>
&gt;   reading about all of the wonderful prizes we might have one if <br/>
only you <br/>
&gt;   would have called our much needed word sooner? Thank you for the <br/>
all <br/>
&gt;   the fun that you have given all us these past 116 days. Just <br/>
think <br/>
&gt;   there are only 251 more days and the fun begins all over again. I <br/>
hope!<br/>
