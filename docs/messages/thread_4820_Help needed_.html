<br>
Today, I received this email from Bone Yard Recorder (cool trail name!).  Sounds like Sandusky County is a interesting area with history.  But what impressed me most was those hard working, farmers!  <br>
<br>
Anyway, Sandusky Co. is in need of some letterboxers.  Bone Yard Recorder would more than likely want to meet other letterboxes in Ohio, or certainly learn about our Midwest gatherings.  <br>
<br>
So I am sharing this email with all of you.  The letterboxing bug has bit this letterboxer in Sandusky Co.  Read the email below and contact BYR.  I plant to mail off some surprises soon.  <br>

Subject: [AQ] Help needed!<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello, let me introduce myself. I am BONE YARD RECORDER.<br>
<br>
As of January 1st, 2008, our county in OHIO (SANDUSKY COUNTY, not to be confused with the town of Sandusky) had 2 boxes... one is a micro box the other a small store bought stamp. And so I have had to travel miles and miles to learn about letterboxing and to retrieve boxes... so as I met other boxers from around the state and became friends, I told them of my empty county and they started giving me and sending me stamps that they had lying around and some even carved new stamps for here.<br>
<br>
Residents named the county after an Indian term for "at the cold water." Our county has a lot of Civil War history and heroes. President of the United States Rutherford Birchard Hayes ranks as Sandusky County's most prominent resident. His home, Spiegel Grove, is now an historical landmark operated by the Ohio Historical Society. Union General James B. McPherson also lived in Sandusky County. He was killed during the American Civil War and was buried in Clyde, Ohio. We have a Heinz 57 plant here and an old Pioneer Sugar plant, Christy Knives and shears were founded and manufactured here. The GREAT BLACK SWAMP occupied most of the land here in the beginning. Most of Sandusky County's residents find employment in agricultural positions, with seventy-percent of the county's acreage under cultivation. Sandusky County farmers are the fifth largest producers of tomatoes in Ohio.<br>
<br>
I am on a quest to fill my county as full as I can. So if you have a stamp you would like to carve or dig out from an old postal, an old signature stamp, cootie, hitchhiker, event stamp or personal traveler I would love it if you would send it to me for planting here. You will be the carver and be contacted every time someone logs it in.<br>
<br>
I have planned 4 events for this year starting in April and would very much love to include a letterbox stamp to be planted here permanently, no matter how small, from you!<br>
<br>
Thanks a million for your time.<br>
<br>
Your boney friend,<br>
Bone Yard Recorder<br>

This weekend, I was playing in the snow and sledding at GS camp.  Relaxing weekend with extra down time to also carve some new stamps.  I now have new boxes to place...as soon as this ice and snow melts.  <br>
<br>
Looking forward to some muddy hiking this Spring!  <br>

is on the list for the NEO Coming Up Flowers event on<br>
Saturday here in my backyard.  Well, not LITERALLY my<br>
backyard, but close enough.  Let me just say that I am<br>
AMAZED at the number of people signed up for this<br>
event!  When Travel'n Turtle first told me she wanted<br>
to host another event in the area and asked my idea<br>
for gathering locations I never dreamed so many people<br>
would show up.  TT had to close the registration<br>
because we're maxed out for the space we're meeting<br>
at.  And they're coming from ALL OVER - Deedle & I<br>
were checking out AtlasQuest profiles last night. <br>
There's supposed to be someone from Canada coming!  <br>
<br>
Anyway, along the lines of Beetle's post, one of the<br>
events we're doing at the NEO gathering is a box swap<br>
- bring a ready-to-plant letterbox with you to the<br>
event,  take someone else's box home to plant with<br>
you.  It will be interesting to see where our Swap Box<br>
ends up!<br>

  At the Letterboxing 101 workshop last weekend we were talking about where to find resources other than the tutorials on AQ and the FAQs on LbNA. I mentioned that some great information could be found in the yahoo group files. <br>
  What????? Yahoo groups? What's that?<br>
  So we talked about the Great Lakes yahoo group and the LbNA yahoo group.<br>
