what it said:<br>
<br>
Friday Night<br>
Partly cloudy with a chance of showers and thunderstorms. Lows in the <br>

<br>
Saturday<br>
Mostly cloudy with a chance of showers and thunderstorms. Highs in <br>
the lower 80s. Chance of rain 40 percent. <br>

Saturday Night through Sunday Night<br>
Mostly cloudy with a chance of showers and thunderstorms. Lows in the <br>
lower 60s. Highs in the upper 70s. Chance of rain 50 percent.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I sure hope that rain doesn't actually show up!  I'm going to look on <br>
the bright side - there's MORE of a chance it WON'T rain most of the <br>
weekend (60%)<br>

Your report says highs in the lower 80' for Saturday. I checked <br>
Yahoo weather and it says high of 89. I was looking at my hotel's <br>
website, and the forcast for Saturday said a high of 70. What the <br>
heck - such a difference! I personally hope 70 is closer to the <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Exactly!  I was going to say, all three temperatures<br>
are probably correct, depending on the time of day.<br>

Speaking of Ohio crazy weather - yesterday as I was<br>
walking past an outside window here at work, the<br>
dandelion fluff was flying around full force.  When I<br>
first looked out, though, my heart skipped a beat - I<br>
thought it was snowing!!!<br>
