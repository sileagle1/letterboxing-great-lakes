<br>
I'm in Boone County, up in the far north central part of the state.  I have<br>
noticed how Champaign Co. is a little hotbed of letterboxing, good for you!<br>
Unfortunately it seems I never have need to head for that part of the state.<br>
Maybe someday when I'm retired and spend ALL my leisure time trail riding<br>
and letterboxing!<br>

I started counting the Illinois counties without boxes when the MI/WI<br>

I just have to remind myself how very few boxes there were in the central<br>
region of the state when I started boxing (4 listings, I think) and<br>

After looking at the map and the listings, we decided that this week <br>
end we were going to try and cover Grundy and Kankakee Counties. That <br>
would just leave Lee county in N. Illinois.<br>

Then we might have to take a long weekend and drive down Rt 1 and get <br>
the Indiana Border counties covered.<br>

LBNA. It will come out around this same time each<br>

<br>
We just started with this great hobby this summer and I am hooked <br>
completely!!  I also have been watching the competition in WI/MI with <br>
filling up their counties.  I would love for IL and IN to be able to <br>
fill up also.  I have some stamps ready to go to help out with that <br>
but haven't had the time to finish up the boxes and get them <br>
planted.  I hope to get them all done and planted in the next couple <br>
of weeks.  They will go in Richland, Clay, Jasper and Lawrence <br>
counties in IL and Vigo and Knox counties in IN.  Some of the <br>
counties will have more than one box.  I figure this is an out of the <br>
way area for many to come to so it should be worth your time.  I'll <br>
keep you posted on when they are placed.  <br>
<br>
Happy Hunting<br>

<br>
A meet would be nice.<br>
<br>
After looking at the map and the listings, we decided that this week<br>
end we were going to try and cover Grundy and Kankakee Counties. That<br>
would just leave Lee county in N. Illinois.<br>
<br>
Then we might have to take a long weekend and drive down Rt 1 and get<br>
the Indiana Border counties covered.<br>
