<br/>
I'm in Boone County, up in the far north central part of the state.  I have<br/>
noticed how Champaign Co. is a little hotbed of letterboxing, good for you!<br/>
Unfortunately it seems I never have need to head for that part of the state.<br/>
Maybe someday when I'm retired and spend ALL my leisure time trail riding<br/>
and letterboxing!<br/>

After looking at the map and the listings, we decided that this week <br/>
end we were going to try and cover Grundy and Kankakee Counties. That <br/>
would just leave Lee county in N. Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
Then we might have to take a long weekend and drive down Rt 1 and get <br/>
the Indiana Border counties covered.<br/>

LBNA. It will come out around this same time each<br/>

<br/>
We just started with this great hobby this summer and I am hooked <br/>
completely!!  I also have been watching the competition in WI/MI with <br/>
filling up their counties.  I would love for IL and IN to be able to <br/>
fill up also.  I have some stamps ready to go to help out with that <br/>
but haven't had the time to finish up the boxes and get them <br/>
planted.  I hope to get them all done and planted in the next couple <br/>
of weeks.  They will go in Richland, Clay, Jasper and Lawrence <br/>
counties in IL and Vigo and Knox counties in IN.  Some of the <br/>
counties will have more than one box.  I figure this is an out of the <br/>
way area for many to come to so it should be worth your time.  I'll <br/>
keep you posted on when they are placed.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting<br/>

&gt; I started counting the Illinois counties without boxes when the <br/>
MI/WI<br/>
&gt; challenge first came up and stopped at 35 because it was too <br/>
depressing.  <br/>
&gt; I just have to remind myself how very few boxes there were in the <br/>
central <br/>
&gt; region of the state when I started boxing (4 listings, I think) and<br/>
&gt; compare that to the 88 listings, some with multiple boxes, that is <br/>
there<br/>
&gt; now.  It's so nice to be able to go letterboxing without having to <br/>
drive<br/>
&gt; several hours.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't know where you are in IL, Trail Rider, but we have a pretty<br/>
&gt; healthy population of boxers in Champaign county.  Not nearly so <br/>
big a<br/>
&gt; population as there seems to be in the Chicago area, but enough that<br/>
&gt; we've started talking about a winter mini-meet to put names to <br/>
faces and<br/>
&gt; stamps.  Sure beats the days when I was convinced that Kimono Girl <br/>
and I<br/>
&gt; were the only boxers in the area!    <br/>

&gt; &gt; It looks like Illinois has 43 out of 102 counties covered.  Not <br/>
bad <br/>
&gt; &gt; since 1/3 of the population lives in on county.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; WAY TO GO both Wisconsin and Michigan box-planters!  My own <br/>
state of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Illinois will probably never have a box in all counties - too <br/>
many <br/>
&gt; &gt; counties<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and it seems most of the boxers are concentrated in the <br/>

&gt; It's nice to hear that someone else has their eye on Grundy county.  <br/>
&gt; I'm in Kendall and have been working hard to get some more boxes <br/>
&gt; here.  I also had plans for some of my postal stamps when they come <br/>
&gt; home.  I've been looking for some spots in the Morris area for in the <br/>

&gt; A mini meet sounds great!  Any plans in the works?  Need any help?<br/>

A meet would be nice.<br/>
<br/>
After looking at the map and the listings, we decided that this week<br/>
end we were going to try and cover Grundy and Kankakee Counties. That<br/>
would just leave Lee county in N. Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
Then we might have to take a long weekend and drive down Rt 1 and get<br/>
the Indiana Border counties covered.<br/>
