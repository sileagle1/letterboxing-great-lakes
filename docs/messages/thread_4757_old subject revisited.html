That's FANTASTIC! I'm happy to hear that. Just remind him to take it easy when you do finally get a nice weekend...weekend warrior syndrome is no fun when you're totally healthy, let alone when you have a more serious condition. And don't worry about not making it to any gatherings yet. We are quite the active group...I'm sure something nearby will come up soon.<br>
