                    <div class="plaintext-content">Those of you attending the WI10 gathering last year may remember the "Project Pajama Pants" letterbox I had with me, to coincide with Operation Support Our Troops - Illinois' pajama pants drive for the wounded soldiers in military hospitals.<br>
<br>
I'd like to do another drive this year at the Boxacon gathering. <br>
<br>
One of the things OSOTIL does this time of year is collect items to stuff into holiday stockings for the troops. Their website lists the items they're collecting: http://www.osotil.org/christmasstockings.html, but I'd like to concentrate on collecting AA and AAA batteries. Bring a package of batteries to Boxacon and you can receive a special "I get a charge out of Letterboxing!" stamp.<br>
<br>
For those of you attending the Western Michigan gathering, I've got an offer for you too. Rather than sending batteries (too heavy to mail, and probably a bit hazardous), donate a dollar and I'll buy batteries for you. (Can I have a volunteer to coordinate this for me??)<br>
<br>
If any other gathering (I see there are quite a fewthis fall in our area) wants to participate, please let me know. However I must have everything collected by October 15th.<br>
<br>
Last, if you look at their website, you'll see they need volunteers to sew the stockings themselves. If anyone wants to sew some and bring them to Boxacon, that would be great! (You'll have to contact them to get the official pattern.) As to the other gatherings, I'll leave that to you if anyone wants to go that route...again, because of the expense of shipping them. <br>
<br>
And of course, thank you letters and holiday cards for the troops are always welcome.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!<br>

I still have your address and so I will send you some money in support <br>
of this very cleaver endeavor and support of our troops!  LOVE the name <br>
of the stamp!<br>
<br>
As far as the donations so many of you made for my son's soldiers, they <br>
have still not deployed but it can't be long at all. I'm thinking in the <br>
next week or two.  They are very happy to know care packages have <br>
already been packed up in support of them from the Great Lakes States <br>
and are ready to go!  Please know I will relay any information I get and <br>
I will also let you all know when I send out the care package with your <br>
donations!<br>
<br>
Thanks again!!<br>

Last week we saved the P&G coupons flyer.  Monthly there are more Duracell battery coupons than we can use.  Would you be interested in us saving and sending you coupons for before you purchase the batteries?<br>

Those of you attending the WI10 gathering last year may remember the<br>
"Project Pajama Pants" letterbox I had with me, to coincide with Operation<br>
Support Our Troops - Illinois' pajama pants drive for the wounded soldiers<br>
in military hospitals.<br>
<br>
I'd like to do another drive this year at the Boxacon gathering.<br>
<br>
One of the things OSOTIL does this time of year is collect items to stuff<br>
into holiday stockings for the troops. Their website lists the items<br>
they're collecting: http://www.osotil.org/christmasstockings.html, but I'd<br>
like to concentrate on collecting AA and AAA batteries. Bring a package of<br>
batteries to Boxacon and you can receive a special "I get a charge out of<br>
Letterboxing!" stamp.<br>
<br>
For those of you attending the Western Michigan gathering, I've got an offer<br>
for you too. Rather than sending batteries (too heavy to mail, and probably<br>
a bit hazardous), donate a dollar and I'll buy batteries for you. (Can I<br>
have a volunteer to coordinate this for me??)<br>
<br>
If any other gathering (I see there are quite a fewthis fall in our area)<br>
wants to participate, please let me know. However I must have everything<br>
collected by October 15th.<br>
<br>
Last, if you look at their website, you'll see they need volunteers to sew<br>
the stockings themselves. If anyone wants to sew some and bring them to<br>
Boxacon, that would be great! (You'll have to contact them to get the<br>
official pattern.) As to the other gatherings, I'll leave that to you if<br>
anyone wants to go that route...again, because of the expense of shipping<br>
them.<br>
<br>
And of course, thank you letters and holiday cards for the troops are always<br>
welcome.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!<br>

Do they have to be in a package?  Or can they be in a large package that<br>
soldiers could share?  Costco sells them in large packages and I thought I<br>
would pick some up went I stopped over to feed my M&M addiction.  Would have<br>
to mail them to you tho because we won't be at Boxacon.<br>

<br>
<br>
Those of you attending the WI10 gathering last year may remember the<br>
"Project Pajama Pants" letterbox I had with me, to coincide with Operation<br>
Support Our Troops - Illinois' pajama pants drive for the wounded soldiers<br>
in military hospitals.<br>
<br>
I'd like to do another drive this year at the Boxacon gathering.<br>
<br>
One of the things OSOTIL does this time of year is collect items to stuff<br>
into holiday stockings for the troops. Their website lists the items<br>
they're collecting: http://www.osotil.org/christmasstockings.html, but I'd<br>
like to concentrate on collecting AA and AAA batteries. Bring a package of<br>
batteries to Boxacon and you can receive a special "I get a charge out of<br>
Letterboxing!" stamp.<br>
<br>
For those of you attending the Western Michigan gathering, I've got an offer<br>
for you too. Rather than sending batteries (too heavy to mail, and probably<br>
a bit hazardous), donate a dollar and I'll buy batteries for you. (Can I<br>
have a volunteer to coordinate this for me??)<br>
<br>
If any other gathering (I see there are quite a fewthis fall in our area)<br>
wants to participate, please let me know. However I must have everything<br>
collected by October 15th.<br>
<br>
Last, if you look at their website, you'll see they need volunteers to sew<br>
the stockings themselves. If anyone wants to sew some and bring them to<br>
Boxacon, that would be great! (You'll have to contact them to get the<br>
official pattern.) As to the other gatherings, I'll leave that to you if<br>
anyone wants to go that route...again, because of the expense of shipping<br>
them.<br>
<br>
And of course, thank you letters and holiday cards for the troops are always<br>
welcome.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!<br>

Chances are, there is a nearby dropoff point you could take them to and save the cost of postage... http://www.osotil.org/howtohelpdropoffloc.html   There's nothing saying donations have to go through me...I have no special connections with the organization myself.<br>
<br>
And Speedsquare, sure, send me coupons.  Good idea.<br>

I just noticed on the OSOT-OL website they specifically say FOUR PACKS of AA and AAA batteries.<br>
<br>
As to the West MI gathering, I realized the date is too late to do an actual collection, since everything has to be turned in by the 15th.  So if you'd like to participate, please either send a monetary donation directly to OSOT-IL or a similar local organization that supports active duty military personnel or Veterans (remember, Veterans Day is coming up in November!).  [I favor the PVA (Paralyzed Veterans of America) myself.] At the gathering, locate TrailTroll who will have the stamp and logbook and tell her you made a donation (honor system, I don't need proof...).  Do NOT give her any donations.<br>
<br>
Thank you all!<br>

I've been called a lot of things in my life, but LetterProxer is a new one.  Too bad you had to be so clear about not giving me donations - this could have been a money-making opportunity!  (Just kidding - support our servicepeople is very important, and I thank you for doing this.)<br>
