But you can make up for it and come help me clean my craft room ;}. I <br>
know how that is.... start on that and you suddenly find its 3 am and <br>
you have to get up for work in 3.5 hours....<br>
(well, maybe it's OldShoe that has to come help, since he picked.?)<br>
<br>
I suppose i will have to clean now too, since i cna no longer use the <br>
waiting for the Bingo word excuse....<br>
