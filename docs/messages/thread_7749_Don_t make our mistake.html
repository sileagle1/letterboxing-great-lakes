Fortunately, other than the pain of all the cleaning, we didn't seem to <br/>
lose much (combination of only a few inches of water, rubber totes, and <br/>
less than awesome stuff in our basement).  However, I'd suggest everyone <br/>
of you to go check where you store your letterboxing journals! If you <br/>
store them in the basement...put them on a high shelf or have them <br/>
otherwise protected.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for us, we had our old logbooks stored on the bottom shelf <br/>
of our letterboxing cabinet, and now I'm hoping that they are <br/>
salvageable after being partially submerged in water.  Some of them are <br/>
better than others, but I did notice many pages of smeared rainbows of <br/>
ink...I know it is about the journey and the memories, but I like some <br/>
of the mementos too!<br/>
<br/>
On a happier note, I was double checking the bingo calls against my <br/>
list, and I found a word I had missed!...one call closer!<br/>
<br/>
Have a happy week (and hopefully dry),<br/>

they are on one of the lower bookshelves.  When I get home from work I'll <br/>
move them higher.  We got some seepage in our basement but took care of that <br/>
with frequent bouts with the industrial vacuum cleaner.  If one or both of <br/>
our sump pumps ever fails, though, we'll be in trouble.<br/>
