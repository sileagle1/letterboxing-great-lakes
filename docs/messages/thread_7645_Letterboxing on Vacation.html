March I'm going to be in a time crunch so I'm focusing in on two boxes...I've already solved the clues, confirmed that I solved the clues correctly with the box owner who was gracious enough to confirm that I solved it right and if we have time while we are in town (we'll only be there 2 days for a 5K and Half Marathon I'm running) then we'll grab them...if not, then no skin off my teeth.

For me personally, I only look for boxes within a 5mi radius of our hotel...sometimes even closer depending on how my husband's mood seems.

I do print off lots of clues...but sometimes things just don't work out. For example, on our way home from Florida in December I was driving when I realized I was about 10 miles past a rest area that *THAT* was the rest area that a box was at that I wanted to stop for. Ooops. My bad. Oh well. I wasn't expecting to be driving that stretch of highway...I figured my husband would be and I could navigate him to stop there. Turned out that I made up for it when we decided to stop at the Louisville Slugger Museum and there happened to be a box there...stopping there hadn't originally been in our plan but we figured it would be neat, fun for the kids, and a good chance to get out of the car for a few hours.<br>

<br>
If I can, I do prepare ahead of time when planning to do letterboxing while vacationing, even down to the point of mapping out all the boxes ahead of time so I know which order to do them in. However, I've found 2 other things to be helpful:<br>
<br>
1. If you have a Smartphone, download the Box Radar app. I've used it several times and it's been great for letterboxing. There is also another letterboxing app that I've seen others write about, but I haven't used it and can't recall the name of it right now.<br>
<br>
2. I have posted on the state board on AtlasQuest for wherever I'm going. I ask for boxing suggestions or specific questions about the area. If there are active letterboxers in the state, I have found them to be very helpful. <br>
<br>
3. The third thing I do is "make a deal" with my husband or family members about the amount of time allotted for letterboxing. I think it's fair to just establish that "Tuesday morning is all about letterboxing." Then we're all clear on the amount of time and everyone seems to have a better outlook on it. I know my husband enjoys letterboxing if he's planning on doing it.<br>
<br>
Enjoy Hawaii! It was one of my best vacations, although I went there before I was a letterboxer. <br>

It's an android app.  So use one of them. <br>
<br>
When we box and travel, I also make deals with my family and try to be<br>
FLEXIBLE.  My homework includes identifying boxes that are located in places<br>
that we want to visit anyway.  For instance:  My DH has a goal of visiting<br>
the graves of every dead President.  Therefore finding a cemetery that has a<br>
dead President AND a letterbox is a win-win.   i.e. Richmond Virginia has<br>
cemeteries with many letterboxes, as well as US and Confederate Presidents.<br>
Adam, Davis, Monroe, Tyler.  Indianapolis (Harrison) etc.  <br>
<br>
Drive-by's are also appreciated.  But you have to remember to be flexible.<br>
While in Tulsa, we located good boxes, but the park was infested with ticks,<br>
they were falling out of the trees on us.  We had to give up on those.  <br>
<br>
In Massachusetts we found a HUGE box of stamps in memorial to children who<br>
had passed away young.  There were at least 20 stamps in this box.  But the<br>
mosquitoes were SO BAD, that we allowed the boys to go back to the car.  My<br>
DD and I had used repellant and were fine.  <br>
<br>
Stamps by the ocean are popular.  Go for the easy finds until they get<br>
sucked into the obsession.  <br>

My family has agreed to let me get any boxes near any of the activities that we know we are going to do. But I am always wondering "is there a box here?, this would be a good spot for one"<br>
I am not going til June, but have already received a map so I can plan our itinerary, but when the schedule does not go as I planned I tend to get a little bent :( <br>
Thanks for the tips!<br>

Then I find the best deal on either a campground, condo or hotel in the area, as centrally located near as many boxes as I can.<br>
<br>
We then plan out which boxes we will get on which days, according to when areas might be open for operations or not (some are closed on various days of the week), and a place to have lunch out, or dinner, if we're eating (in the car, in a hurry to get to the next box) on the road.<br>
<br>
We'll often do research on various weird/cool/interesting things to see and do in the area, and will pre-carve a box ahead of time to plant while we're there.<br>
<br>
We don't get out much.<br>
Obviously, we need a life.<br>

I spend hours plugging everything into my GPS -- many cemeteries aren't on my GPS so I Google them and put them as close to the actual location as possible.<br>
<br>
I still take ALL the clues with me, however, as I drive through the big city I can see on the GPS which boxes I'm close to.<br>
<br>
My wife makes fun of me for bringing all the clues, my answer for her is that I never know where exactly we will be -- this way, we will always be prepared.<br>

How do you organize your clues and plan on which boxes to find? I was so excited to be going to New Orleans a couple of years ago that I printed all of them. I then put them in a 3-ring binder and spent months reading & decoding them. When the big day arrived I was unprepared for how large the city was. I was so focused on one box, (it was the hardest clue to solve and I never found), that I spent the day with my face in my binder and wearing out my family. I ended the day with one box and my family upset and worn out from walking from one district to the other. <br>
I am now planning a trip to Hawaii. I will be going to Waikiki on Oahu and Kona on the big island. My family has already let me know this trip is not about letterboxing. I wish there was an app so that whenever I was close to a box I could go after it. I don't want a repeat of my last  vacation. What do you do?<br>
