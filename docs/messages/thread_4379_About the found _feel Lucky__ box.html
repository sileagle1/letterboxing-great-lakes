I have pulled all my boxes (except TX for the moment) because I haven't had time for maintenance in quite awhile and many have been out since 2002 or 2003.  Since you DID find it (even though you couldn't stamp it through the ice) I can send you the image for your log book if you like.  Just send me your address off-list and if you prefer it on copy paper or card stock.<br/>

&lt; Feel Lucky? in Columbus, OH &gt;<br/>
<br/>
We went to look for this years ago and found it encased in a solid block of ice. When we went back in the summer we couldn't find it! I was so bummed because we never did get it. I did see what it looked like in your logbook, which only made me want the stamp more!<br/>
Any thoughts of replanting it back in Columbus?<br/>
