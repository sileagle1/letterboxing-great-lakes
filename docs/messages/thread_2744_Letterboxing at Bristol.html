I know Dragon was planning on another great round of boxes at the <br>
Bristol Renaissance Faire.  I had a small number of postcard-type <br>
coupons that I gave out at the Paw last weekend, but just found out <br>
that the Faire has put the same coupons on their website for <br>
printing.  Check out <br>
http://www.renfair.com/bristol/tickets/06coupon_web.php and the rest <br>
of their website for details about the Faire.<br>
<br>
There's quite a few boxers that are regulars to the Faire.  You can <br>
look for Barefoot Ankh at Mayhawke Armory, KissMeKate at Royal <br>
Exchange Jewelry or out and about, Sylvie-Rose at Moria Silver, and <br>
occasionally Howling Coyote, Laughing Coyote, and others.  Hope to <br>
meet you there!<br>
