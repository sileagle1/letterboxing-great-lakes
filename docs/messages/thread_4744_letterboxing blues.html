twice in the past 3 months -- pathetic for us!  It's partially been due <br/>
to weather but also because we've been busy.  Also, I am NO WHERE close <br/>
to any sort of bingo -- I only have 3 words and one was my free choice <br/>
which has since been picked.  And I'm also bummed out about all this GLG <br/>
talk because Atom and I aren't going to make it up to MN for the <br/>
event... although I suppose we do have a fun excuse for that: it's <br/>
because we'll be returning from our honeymoon that week and can't take <br/>
more time off to travel again.<br/>
<br/>
But at least there is one exciting Lb thing for me to focus on... SILO <br/>
II this weekend!! :)<br/>
