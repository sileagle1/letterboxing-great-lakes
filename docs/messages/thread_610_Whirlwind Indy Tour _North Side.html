                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah, Bikers!  Rather than letterbox this weekend, Deedle & I went on our first Bike Tour Ride.  It was called Rails n Trails, a 27 mile ride on the Cuyahoga Valley Towpath here in Ohio.  You rode the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad out to Akron, and then biked back, stopping along the way for a spaghetti lunch.  Of course it started raining about 7 miles to where our cars were parked, so by the time we reached the cars we were rather mud-caked, but we did it, even though Deedle, after having been sick earlier this week, made the trail blazers think he wouldn't make it at first because he needed to rest to catch his breath after the first few miles.  <br>
 <br>
I know, nothing to do with 'boxing, but I had to brag while I had everyone's attention and I'm still on the "we're exhausted but we made it!" high.<br>
 <br>
I do have a pair of cargo pants - beige - that I bought from Wal-Mart specifically for letterboxing.  They're like bell-bottoms when not worn rolled, though, so I need to hem them or something.  The shirt will vary, but I also recently bought a bucket hat on clearance for $1.00 - also from Wal-Mart.  I wanted something to keep possible ticks off my head :)  When I first started 'boxing I'd just wear my sneakers, but more & more, esp. if I don't know the terrain ahead of time, I wear my hiking boots.  Friday night I actually bought a second pair of pants to wear while letterboxing, for when I haven't had a chance to wash the first pair yet.  Those were on clearance from Dick's Sporting Goods (not Wal-Mart!) made out of that cool lightweight material that dries really quickly when it gets wet.  Deedle & I also bought rainjackets from Dick's in case we encounter any more soaking wet letterboxing adventures like we did this past summer.  (The jackets also came in very handy today on the<br>
 bike ride!)<br>
 <br>
That's all...<br>

all in Fort Harrison State Park. More Than Corn seems<br>
to be kinda missing (found the tree, looked under the<br>
rock, no box). All had nice hand-carved stamps. Boxing<br>
under the nose of 50 million cyclists and the DNR was<br>
pretty fun. No one seemed to notice me poking around<br>
in my "letterboxing getup" while they were having some<br>
big bicycle race around Harrison Trace. It was an<br>
ungodly humid day, so I pooped out pretty early.<br>
Didn't meet my goal of getting to Broad Ripple and<br>
Eagle Creek...but oh well. I'll get back down there<br>
soon, i'm sure. <br>
<br>
Does anyone else have a "letterboxing getup" or outfit<br>
that they wear exclusively to letterbox? I'm finding<br>
that I am partial to an obnoxious tie dyed t-shirt,<br>
olive cargo pants that roll up, hiking shoes, and now<br>
i've added a tacky visor from work. I'm sure the<br>
walkers on most of the trails I took today thought I<br>
was certifiable...<br>
<br>
Time to gear up for Leland, MI trip next weekend! My<br>
host is dying to go boxing so....it should be fun!<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
