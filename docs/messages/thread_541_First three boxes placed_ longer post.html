Ducks and Drakes<br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=10056<br>
<br>
	Named for wildlife you're likely to see while pursuing the<br>
cluetrail. :-> Quickish and fairly easy; probably 10-20 min start to<br>
finish even with boggling at maps and other losing-of-the-trail.<br>
<br>
Famous Faces #1: Abraham Lincoln<br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=10057<br>
<br>
	First of a series I plan to do which will each start from a statue<br>
of some famous Dead White Male from US history. :-> We have a lot of such<br>
statues, so it's not a horribly limiting theme for my carving skills. The<br>
stamp is of the same person the statue was. Fairly simple; very scenic;<br>
stroller-friendly.<br>
<br>
Fitness Challenge #1: Downtown Marathon<br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=10059<br>
<br>
	First of a series intended to both be physically demanding and<br>
urban-centered. Takes 40 min to an hour, probably, and is somewhat<br>
trickier clue-wise than the other two. No stairs, just curbs and lots (and<br>
lots!) of flat walking.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
	I'd actually be interested, as a new placer, in going 'hunting'<br>
for these with another 'boxer, as a silent partner, just to see how<br>
someone who isn't me interacts with what seem to me to be perfectly<br>
reasonable clues. :-> I won't hint unduly, honest, and Dagonell can vouch<br>
for how good of company I can be on a hunt. I'm free this Sunday-Tuesday,<br>
and after that my schedule gets a little more complex, if you're local and<br>
interested.<br>
