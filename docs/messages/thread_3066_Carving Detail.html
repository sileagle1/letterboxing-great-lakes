                    <div class="plaintext-content">My personal preference for detailed images is PZKut from Stampeaz.  The A grade is the orange stuff, which is not very appealing to me, but the B grade is still white.  I have always used the B grade since I began using it 3 1/2 years ago and have never had an issue with it being so irregular that I couldn't use it.  You can order PZKut at http://www.stampeaz.com/.  They are really good about mailing ASAP and I usually have my order within 2 days.  The pink stuff would be my second choice for detail -- it is a lot like PZKut, but a little softer.  This they have at many Michael's stores.<br/>
<br/>
If you aren't able to find either of these, I have a piece (of either) I can mail out to you tomorrow.<br/>

<br/>
Personally, I like the pink SpeedyStamp best. MasterCarve is my  <br/>
second choice. I like the MasterCarve mostly because it is thick (in  <br/>
the 3/4" size,) and then doesn't need a block or backing mount of any  <br/>
sort.  I tried the orange PZ kut... and I really didn't care for it;  <br/>
it seemed a bit more brittle and plastic-y than the pink stuff, which  <br/>
for me was important in carving the very fine, small details in a lot  <br/>
of my stamps. I've also liked how the pink stuff has held up so far.<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth!!!<br/>
