<br/>
I'm from Southeast Wisconsin and am a newbie at this.  I forget how I<br/>
learned about letterboxing, but I made the effort to get a logbook and<br/>
buy a stamp before our family trip to Yellowstone last summer.  I<br/>
attempted to find two boxes there and failed to find any (although I'm<br/>
confident on one I was close!)  Then the school year started and I set<br/>
it aside.  Finally this summer, I got it out again and have found four<br/>
out of eight attempted.  School has started again so who knows when<br/>
I'll have time to try again.  My family is sometimes interested,<br/>
sometimes not, which makes it less fun so I doubt I will become an<br/>
avid boxer.  Also my lack of ability to tell one tree species from<br/>
another makes it difficult.  But who knows?  I've got the materials<br/>
handy if I want to try again and there appear to be a bazillion boxes<br/>
planted in my corner of the state!<br/>
