248.625.0877. But there is another thing I wanted to ask you all that <br>
plan on attending. We just bought a house and would be moving around <br>
August 19th. It would be less stressful if the event could be moved to <br>
Sept. 9th. If this is a problem for too many people I can manage the <br>
original date. I have updated the information in the FILES section of <br>
the website. If anyone who is attending could bring a shelter tent <br>
canopy it would help out alot!! They wanted 300$ for a shelter, can <br>
you believe that!! Also any one working on the stamps that has not <br>
sent them in please e-mail me for an update on your progress on when <br>
you think they will be done. Thank you all for helping out with the <br>
carving and information!!<br>

that's after Barefoot Ankh and I finish up at the Bristol Renaissance <br>
Faire, and might be interested in a road trip.  I do have a 12x12 <br>

address, etc)?<br>
