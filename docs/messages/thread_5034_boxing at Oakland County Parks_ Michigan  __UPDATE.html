going to update what happened at the meeting.<br/>
<br/>
I met with Derenda and she explained they have been talking about <br/>
letterboxing for 1-1/2 years.  They want to change the <br/>
designated "geocaching trailways" to include letterboxing.<br/>
So in addition to being a member of the michigan geocaching <br/>
organization, they will accept members of atlasquest.org or LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
She asked about a board of directors, I think Geocaching Michigan <br/>
has one.  I told her I wasn't aware that letterboxing had any.  <br/>
<br/>
When I asked about temprorary boxes (those planted for events) she <br/>
told me that those boxes could be planted for the day outside the <br/>
designated trailways.<br/>
<br/>
They will add something to their website, just as they have for <br/>
geocaching, about letterboxing.  She will do her research and <br/>
include the LB code of conduct.  I explained to her that I think <br/>
letterboxing is less invasive to nature than geocaching.  It was my <br/>
understanding that GPS can only get within 30ft.  Whereas <br/>
letterboxes give directions that are right to the box.  She did <br/>
mention that geocacher tend to make their own trails through the <br/>
woods.<br/>
<br/>
She stated they haven't gotten the response that they expected to <br/>
their geocaching program.  She also gave me a letterbox that was <br/>
turned in about 6 months ago.<br/>

&gt; A few Oakland County Parks have designated "Geocaching Trailways".<br/>
&gt; I contacted them to find out, if we had an event at those parks <br/>
could <br/>
&gt; we plant boxes.  The rules on their website state you have to get <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; permit, and be a member of the Michigan Geocaching Organization to <br/>
&gt; plant a cache.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They called me back today and told me that they were very <br/>
interested <br/>
&gt; in letterboxing and were looking for someone to talk to them about <br/>
it. <br/>
&gt; So I set a meeting up with them for Monday 10am.<br/>
&gt; Hopefully I can answer all their questions and we'll be able to <br/>
&gt; letterbox at Oakland County Parks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They have a link on their website.<br/>
&gt; http://www.oakgov.com/parksrec/activities/geocaching.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If any of you have experience dealing with your county/state <br/>
advice <br/>
&gt; would be helpful.<br/>

<br/>
I think their policy is still the same.  It is my understanding that you have to get a permit for the box.<br/>
And it has to be within 20ft. of their designated trailway.<br/>
I'm not sure if the exact location has to be approved.<br/>
I didn't read that on their website and she didn't bring it up.<br/>
And I'm not sure about the time limitation either.  She will be emailing<br/>
me, what they plan on using on their website, so I'll ask her then.<br/>
<br/>
My main reason for contacting her was regarding events.<br/>
If an oakland county park is used, I didn't want to have all the boxes concentrated on one trailway.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the update, Heather! I mean to reply to your first post, <br/>
but forgot.<br/>
<br/>
Based on your time line, it could be me that sparked their thought <br/>
process on changing the guidelines to include LBing. I contacted <br/>
them last winter (2006) about my Jerome box. (The name you mentioned <br/>
sounds like it might be who I talked to also) Seems like they <br/>
changed their policies since then. At that time, you were supposed <br/>
to get a license (no fee) and use the special Geocache trails. But <br/>
there weren't any requirements on being a member of the geocaching <br/>
site. If I remember correctly, they had a rule about the length of <br/>
time the box could remain in a spot before it had to be moved or removed.<br/>
<br/>
Since Jerome was only there for a few months, I decided to take my <br/>
chances and ended up planting my box without the permit, but I did <br/>
follow all their other guidelines. I didn't get the permit mainly I <br/>
didn't want to deal with the hassles for a temp box. I kind of got <br/>
the feeling you had to have the exact location approved before <br/>
planting. Did she say anything about that? Or as long as they're <br/>
off the regular trails they're okay? Do you have to get a permit <br/>
still or nitify them of the plants somehow?<br/>
