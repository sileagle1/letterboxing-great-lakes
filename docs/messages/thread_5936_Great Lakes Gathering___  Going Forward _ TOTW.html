                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our 2 cents worth:<br>
1. We would shrivel up and die if there wasn't a GLG each year.<br>
<br>
2.  Fortunately we live smack dab in the middle of the GLG region and would go to any state for the GLG, but our vote is to keep the rotation going...one less thing to think about.  Tonto does tend to stay up at night worrying about where GLG 2048 will be....<br>
<br>
3.  The present date has mostly worked for us...However, we like Dragon's suggestion of allowing the hosts to have a little flexibility with the date to make their task easier.  We are opposed to the 3-day holiday weekends due to the fact that parks are usually much more crowded at these times and may be more difficult to procure shelters and accommodations.  Furthermore, we like the spring over the autumn because it is a nice way to re-connect after a long winter of BINGO, and kick off the season re-establishing old boxing relationships and making new ones in time for a new season of boxing!  Who doesn't like to go after a box planted by someone they just met?  Makes it all the more fun! This is assuming more boxing is done in the warmer months than the winter...which leads to an interesting statistical question (TOTW)- On average, do you have more finds in the warm months (April - September) or cooler months (October - March)?  Just curious..<br>
