well for you out there.  It certainly looks beautiful from your <br/>
photos.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you didn't get the Inn at the Lakeshore HH Hostel, that poor <br/>
box has been very lonely, but I can certainly see how a windy day <br/>
would make that a miserable place to be hunting around for a box.  I <br/>
would also have to think that the clues for that one would be much <br/>
more difficult to follow this time of year.<br/>

&gt; Hi Bindle Babe, DogLvrs, and those I otherwise met, emailed, or <br/>
who recognize my stamp - <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I am still out here, living and letterboxing in Maine (and <br/>
planting a few here myself).  I keep tabs on the Michigan activity, <br/>
and had the chance to go out with my folks and best friends (Sisu - <br/>
mom; Can Man - dad; friends Thumbs Up! and Becky from the Land of <br/>
Mid) while on an altogether-too-short visit home for Thanksgiving.  <br/>
In addition to your four boxes, BB, we attempted (SC's) HitckHiker <br/>
Hostel along Lake Michigan with no success.  The wind was more than <br/>
nippy blowing off off the lake, and each of us missed (even with a <br/>
significant amount of scanning and questions like "could that be <br/>
it?") the key landmarks identified in the clues.  Perhaps we'll try <br/>
again on my next visit home (in two weeks for Christmas). More <br/>
likely, with the colder weather, we'll look for boxes away from the <br/>
biting winds of the Lake. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've had a good time boxing out here in the Pine Tree State <br/>
(another state with the White Pine as it's state tree), though the <br/>
boxes are more spread out.  Boxing is now a three hour minimum road <br/>
trip for me, and it's offered a great way to explore this state.  I <br/>
even surpassed the F200 mark this summer while attending my first <br/>
gathering - Boxing By The Bay - in August.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Hope all boxers are well in my home region of the Great Lakes.  <br/>
The ocean (along which I am now fortunate to live) is beautiful, but <br/>
for me it can't compare to the beauty of Lake Michigan.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Wishing you all well, <br/>
&gt; KelticKara<br/>
