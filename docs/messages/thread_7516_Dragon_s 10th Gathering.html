<br/>
If you want to celebrate my 10th in August, skip the Geocaching event in West Bend and go to the Field of Honor event at Miller Park and honor out troops (http://starsandstripeshonorflight.org/events.php) on Aug. 11th (which is when the gathering was going to be anyway).  I hope that I myself can find time to attend...<br/>
