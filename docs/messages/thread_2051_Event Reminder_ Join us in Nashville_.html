<br>
I just thought I'd send a quick reminder your way to let you know that <br>
the Nashville mini-meet is coming up quickly! It's this coming weekend--<br>
Saturday, December 3 from 2p.m. until 9p.m. If you want to escape some <br>
of that snow and cold, it's still mild down our way (by Northern <br>
standards...and I should know, born and raised in MN!). The lights and <br>
decorations at the Opryland Hotel are worth the trip alone! If you have <br>
any questions, feel free to contact me...and the event is listed on <br>
AtlasQuest's event page as well.<br>
