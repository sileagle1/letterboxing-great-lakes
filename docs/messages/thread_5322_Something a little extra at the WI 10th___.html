Letterboxing 10th Anniversary event will have the opportunity to <br>
stamp into a logbook that has been at the other two "10th <br>
Anniversary" events earlier this year.<br>
<br>
The BABE (Birth of American Boxing Event) gathering was held in April <br>
in North Carolina, near the location of one of the very first boxes <br>
in the United states.  This event was hosted by Mountain Scorpia and <br>
she created a replica of the Smithsonian Magazine cover that was the <br>
impetus for American letterboxing.  This is a VERY large image, <br>
composed by 11 individual stamps.  I'll bring some large sheets of <br>
paper along for those that wish to obtain an image of these stamps.<br>
<br>
These stamps and the logbook then made the trip out to Oregon for <br>
the "Live & Breathe" event a few weeks ago, so you'll also see some <br>
stamps in the logbook from that event.  In addition I'll have a copy <br>
of a booklet that was created for the L&B event if anyone would like <br>
to take a look at it.<br>
<br>

<br>
P.S.  I'll also have some Letterboxing Great Lakes patches along if <br>
anyone is interested in purchasing (although I think most of you <br>
already have one!)<br>

There will be another box there that attended BOTH BABE and L&B events  . . . <br>
my "Tribute to My Dad" will be in attendance.<br>

My box has also been to the annual Great Lakes Gathering at Afton S.P. and  <br>
"Have a Grateful Tread" in MA.<br>

I carved 2 stamps with only one logbook. Others have added and I think  there <br>
are now 5 or 6 stamps with this one box. Someone along the way created a  <br>
pouch for all the stamps.<br>
 <br>
Please stamp into the logbook... its in the final stretch before my Dad's  <br>
60th birthday on November 11th.<br>

Sorry for the miscommunication, none of the Hart x6 clan will be in  <br>
attendance of the gathering. <br>
 <br>
As I type this you all maybe sitting down to enjoy your fish boil . . . or,  <br>
are you done already?<br>
 <br>
Either way, I hope every one enjoys themselves.<br>
 <br>
Beetle, you can get her first carved stamp next time :-) Perhaps this will  <br>
draw you to the QC's . ..  there will be a gathering in Bettendorf on the  25th <br>
. . . hint hint!!<br>
