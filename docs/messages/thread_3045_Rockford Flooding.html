                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a quick note to those of you who may not have seen this on CNN or <br>
the Weather Channel after Labor Day. Rockford had some pretty serious <br>
storms run through...tornado spottings and everything. Well, we <br>
basically got 10 inches of rain within 3 hours...worse than a <br>
hurricane, the weatherman said. Some areas of Rockford and Cherry <br>
Valley were under several feet of water (check rrstar.com for some <br>
crazy photos...search for labor day flood). If you are planning on <br>
coming to the area to find any boxes, you might want to check with the <br>
owners to see if the area was flooded or not. I'm hoping to find time <br>
to run out to Bauman Park to check on my CV boxes and then doing some <br>
others as well. Hopefully all are there! :)<br>
<br>
How are the other Rockfordians? Are you all okay out there?<br>

I was out trail riding at Deer Run Forest Preserve and got caught in it -<br>
rode the last half hour back to the trailer in a steady downpour.  But got<br>
home before the REALLY hard stuff started.  We were amazed when we watched<br>
the 5:30 local news and saw water up to the windows on cars in parking lots<br>
and in the flooded streets!<br>
