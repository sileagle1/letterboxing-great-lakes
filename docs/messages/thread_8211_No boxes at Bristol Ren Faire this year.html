                    <html><body><p>I know many boxers like to come up to the Faire for a day of boxing and entertainment. I, myself, enjoy meeting old friends and new letterboxers at the Faire. But there have been more and more problems over the last season or two and after speaking to Faire Management, Bristolstitch has decided that we need to suspend letterboxes this season and I concur with this decision.  So we are sad to report that there will be no letterboxes at the Bristol Ren Faire this summer.</p><p><br/></p><p>I know from experience that it only takes one or two individuals not following directions or causing difficulty to ruin activities for everyone. As always, I urge everyone to read through clues thoroughly, especially for boxes that have limited availability, such as the Faire. The following unacceptable issues have come up:</p><p></p><ul><li>Boxes have gone missing, most probably from being observed by muggles and then said muggles finding and removing the boxes. Although some have been returned to Lost and Found, most have never been seen again.  This is why Bristolstitch and I had thought about only having boxes in or near shops might been better.  However:</li><li>Trampling through flower gardens and digging up rocks and edges have been reported. Every shop owner decorates their space with care, these are not done or supported by Faire management.  One shop owner also told me personally that she had found people rooting through the rocks supporting a decorative water fountain.  There is no need to damage property or decorations.  </li><li>Impatient and belligerent letterboxers have been irritating shop workers and owners that boxes are unavailable, even when this delay was noted in the clues.  Although many owners have been willing to let us have boxes in their shops, these Faires are their livelihood, they are not there just to assist us.  All letterboxers must be patient and considerate to shop owners.</li><li>I have even heard a rumor that letterboxers were trying to get onto Faire grounds during the week to find boxes.  This is private property and is not available to the public outside of the days and times the Faire is open.  At best, Security will escort you off the Faire grounds.  At worst, you might find yourself arrested.</li></ul><div>We have done all we can to keep our hobby active and fun for everyone at the Faire, to no avail.  So although the Faire is a fun day any time, only letterpeople will be available this season.  And again, please be patient and polite, especially for those letterpeople who are actors at the Faire and have schedules to keep and many people who also want to talk to them.  </div><div><br/></div><div>If we hear there have been no problems with the letterpeople this season, Bristolstitch will again talk to Faire Management and determine if we can begin anew in 2016.</div><div><br/></div><div>Gibson Girl and Bristolstitch</div></body></html>
