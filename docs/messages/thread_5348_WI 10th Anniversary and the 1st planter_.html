                    <div class="plaintext-content">After we got home from the anniversary event, I was curious to see if <br>
I could get any info on the person who planted the first box.  I <br>
turned to my friend "Google" and found a few references, including <br>
one that noted he was the advisor & instructor for a fencing club at <br>
a high school in Green Bay.  The article also noted that an assistant <br>
instructor was Ms. Dierdra Baumgart.  Hmmm....  "Dierda" was the name <br>
of a person who also planted some of the early Wisconsin boxes.  <br>
Since the article included his email address, I sent him a note to <br>
see if he was indeed the planter and if Dierda was also an early <br>
letterboxer.  Here is his reply:<br>
===================<br>
Yes, I am the planter for the Cave Point letterbox.  Both Dierdra and <br>
I planted a lot of boxes, but haven't been out boxing in a long time. <br>
Every once in a while if I find myself near one of the boxes, I'll <br>
check if it's still there, but I think others have taken over <br>
maintaining them.  (Which is just fine with me, by the way, as I <br>
don't get up to Door Co. as much as I used to.)  It's good to know <br>
that there are more boxers in Wisconsin now, and that some of ours <br>
are still around.<br>
<br>
Steven<br>
==================<br>
<br>
I then sent him another note asking how he got started and this is <br>
his interesting reply:<br>
<br>
================<br>
Debbie,<br>
Yes, Dierdra and I still know each other; in fact she is my fiance.  <br>
I first heard about letterboxing about the same time everyone in the <br>
US read about it in the Smithsonian article.  A friend of mine read <br>
it and thought we should try to get something started in Door Co. <br>
where we both worked as summer help at a resort.  I started searching <br>
the internet, and made contact with the others just getting started <br>
around the country...  Map Surfer, Der Mad Stamper, and many others.  <br>
I planted the Cave Point Letterbox, the first box in Wisconsin, on <br>
Sept 26, 1999. (Or was it 1998?  I know the day, but I'm not sure <br>
about the year... been a while.)  My friend, Todd, was the first to <br>
find it, though he had no stamp.  After that, I planted a few more <br>
around Door Co. and Green Bay (where I live), and even placed one in <br>
Madison where I had gone to college.  Another boxer from Madison had <br>
the first one in that area.  All the Madison boxes went missing <br>
quickly as I recall.  Dierdra placed a lot of boxes around Green Bay, <br>
but didn't take weather and people into account.  Some washed away, <br>
others were stolen.  She had a series along the East River that when <br>
put together formed a map of the area.  It was really well done, but <br>
all long gone now.  We both got busy with other activities and jobs, <br>
and being the only boxers around it wasn't that much of a challenge, <br>
so we lost touch with letterboxing.  I think some of my better <br>
letterboxes are still out there though... Cave Point, Mink River, and <br>
Cana Island were all intact the last time I was able to check any of <br>
those locations.  Most of the rest of the Lighthouse series were <br>
casualties of weather, wear, and critters (furry as well as human.)  <br>
Back in those days, the message board (or one of the original ones, I <br>
think it's moved twice since then) was often contentious with people <br>
arguing the fundamentals of what letterboxing should be and how it <br>
should be run.  Some things never change, do they?  Some of the early <br>
founders left the hobby because of the issues, but I guess many of <br>
them are still on the boards.  Maybe now that there are more boxes <br>
around, it might be the time to get back into things.<br>

Do you mean the stamp image of himself (Steve Stary)? I thought Pugnasties<br>
had carved that. Or is there something else I didn't see?<br>
<br>
I will be emailing him again and will send some photos of the box with the 3<br>
logbooks in it (and the 1998 date). I'll also some photos from the event.<br>
I will definitely be telling him about the message group.<br>
