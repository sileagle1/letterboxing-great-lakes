It is entirely possible that I set it up wrong as it<br>
is my first!  :)<br>
<br>
How would I check if the map is set to ignore boxes?  <br>
<br>
Why would this affect the overall map?  Why is it not<br>
coming up?  Do I need an address?  Traverse City is 15<br>
minutes away, should I use that as a reference?  I<br>
found this issue by going to the map and trying to<br>
find it myself.<br>

Can't you just use the *simple* search page at AtlasQuest?  When I go to the simple search page, I get to type in the name of any city I want and specify a mileage radius.  If I look at Traverse City, it lists several boxes within a 25 mile radius, likewise with Mackinac City.  Perhaps I am not understanding the problem.<br>
<br>
There are several additional Traverse City area boxes listed at LbNA, many of which have been in place for several years.  Actually some of the earliest letterboxes in Michigan were in the Traverse City / Leland area, although those particular boxes are no longer active.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the heads up about that.  I was using the<br>
City Directory which didn't bring up any boxes in the<br>
upper part of michigan.  I am not sure how I typed it<br>
in, but it may just be because I am new and did it<br>
wrong.  <br>
<br>
I was happy to see that when I typed in Traverse City<br>
(today) my box showed up.<br>
<br>
Thanks again!<br>
