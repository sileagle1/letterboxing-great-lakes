We probably won't get to MN until later Friday.  How long do you think you'll be at the pizza place?  We could possibly stop in later if anyone will still be there.<br>

5:30.  The park opens at 8, we have the Visitors Center at 9:00 and<br>
since I need time to set up, the gathering will start 9:30-ish.<br>

I probably won't be able to make it to a pre-gathering.  My parents<br>
are coming up late on Thursday night, so we're going to do a birthday<br>
dinner on Friday.  I'm up for a post-gathering though.<br>
