                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we first started boxing, our daughter was 3 and she named us The K Crew (our last name is Klein). It flowed nicely off the tongue, so it stuck.. Then, my husband designed our stamp. A round circle made to look like a compass with an arrow for North, a big old-fashioned K in the middle and our first initials really small on the side...his and mine on the left....the kids' on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Later, we chose individual trailnames. Mine is Foodie Mom because...well, I'm really into food and I'm really into being a mom, our daughter is Hershey Bar because her camp name in Girl Scouts is Hershey...loves S'mores and just plain Hershey Bars, but as someone pointed out to us, a "hershey" on the trail is not a good thing so she added the Bar part to her name! Our son is Choo-Choo Boy because he loves nothing more than he loves his trains...except maybe MI football (he is 4). And the baby (whois 2 now) is Choo-Choo Baby because he also loves trains and his siblings named him that until he chooses later for himself.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is the one with the real story behind it. It took him awhile to decide on his name. He and I both...we wanted our names to really fit who we are. When it finally dawned on him...it was perfect. He is A Dragon Slayer. Not because he has an interest in dragons, but because he IS a Dragon Slayer. He has a rare auto-immune disease called Stills Disease and the people who have this disease have formed a community....The International Stills Disease Foundation...to, among other things, support each other. We talk to each other just like we do on this group. And, people with Stills say they are fighting the dragon, the dragon is rearing its ugly head, the dragon is winning...or, they are slaying the dragon. Well, my husband is slaying his dragon right now. Less than one year ago, he was in a wheelchair just to go to the corner to the bus stop. He was off work for 6 months on disability. He has slayed his dragon and gotten it<br/>
 under control with the right cocktail of meds for himself (everyone is so different) and is doing great!!! You would never know if you met him on the trail. But, he will never be the same...physically or mentally, so, his trail name is really meaningful to him. Unfortunately, when he finally found the one that fit, it was already taken on AQ...so he is A Dragon Slayer there. But, we do all of our correspondence as The K Crew anyway and Dragon Slayer hadn't checked in since 2006 so...<br/>
<br/>
That's our story! I love reading these types of messages...thanks for starting the thread!<br/>

Revode, I've always thought it out as Ree-Vode... not Rev. Ode.<br/>

You're not the only one, Kimono Girl -- well, for whatever reason my  mind <br/>
would insert the letter "d" into your name = komodo -- I just figure that  <br/>
"dragon" was a running theme in your family :-)<br/>
