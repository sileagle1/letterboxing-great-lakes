is a box that was created specifically for the event -- it may be <br/>
used only for the event and that's it, or it may go on to be a <br/>
regular letterbox after that.  It may have clues, or some other <br/>
ingenious way of making the rounds at the event.<br/>
<br/>
There are 'event boxes' that are made specifically for one event, <br/>
then there are travelling event boxes that make the rounds from one <br/>
event to another.<br/>
<br/>
I have a travelling event box that I started at the GL Gathering <br/>
last May and it has been to about 15 gatherings around the country <br/>
since then.  I have it back in my possession right now and it will <br/>
definitely be making an appearance at our gathering before it flies <br/>
off again.  I can't go into detail about how that one is passed <br/>
around since it will spoil it for at our gathering.<br/>
<br/>
At the GL Gathering last year there was a series of about 12 boxes <br/>
made by letterboxers from all over the US that were planted in the <br/>
woods at the park of the gathering.  Clues were written and <br/>
distributed just as any other letterbox.  There were also a few <br/>
travelling boxes that were hidden near and around the shelter and <br/>
there were no clues, rather the location was passed around via word-<br/>
of-mouth.  I initially shared the location of each of these boxes <br/>
with one person at the gathering and they then passed it to another <br/>
person, etc.  People had to ask around and listen and watch to find <br/>
out how to get them.<br/>
<br/>
There really is no set rule as to what an event box must be -- just <br/>
a log and a stamp and the rest is limited only by your imagination.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else had asked about the "share your stuff" table.  It is <br/>
simply a table where people can bring in a stamp carving for others <br/>
to see or a cool handmade log book or even an ingenious LB <br/>
container, etc.  The stamps and/or boxes on this table are off-<br/>
limits to stamping -- they are simply there as show and tell items.<br/>
<br/>
Another big hit at gatherings are personal travellers.  Many people <br/>
have personal traveller stamps that you can get as an exchange if <br/>
you know the right thing to say to them or how to ask them for it -- <br/>
the way you know these things is to keep your eyes and ears open, to <br/>
read the archives at the letterbox list and to visit their personal <br/>
web site and look for hints, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The main idea -- FUN!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; attendence or not, it can be based on any theme you wish.  We<br/>
&gt; would like to have a number of boxes based on the theme "Cooler by<br/>

<br/>
Too cool!  This just keeps getting better and better!<br/>
<br/>
So.... an event box could be "hidden" as a container of potatoe <br/>
salad, the stamp being carved in a potatoe......and if you hear <br/>
people making really strange comments that sound like passwords from <br/>
old spy movies, they're really just looking for personal travellers.  <br/>
<br/>
Fun is right!<br/>
<br/>
Milly in MI who added two stamps yesterday,planted a traveler and met <br/>
some really neat fungi's :0<br/>
