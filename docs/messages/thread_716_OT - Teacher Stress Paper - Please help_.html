I know this is off-topic for this message board, but I have noticed <br>
that many of you are (or were) teachers and I was wondering if you <br>
would be able to help me out. I am writing my Senior Seminar paper on <br>
stress in the classroom and I am including what causes teacher <br>
stress, how it affects students, and how teachers can effectively <br>
deal with their stress. If you are a teacher of any kind and have a <br>
couple minutes to spare, will you please answer the following <br>
questions for me? You can e-mail them back to me at Angi0105 "at" <br>
aol "dot" com or back to my yahoo address.<br>
<br>
1. What causes you stress when you are in the classroom?<br>
<br>
2. What environmental factors in the school cause you stress?<br>
<br>
3. If you are feeling stressed, do you notice a difference in student <br>
behavior?<br>
<br>
4. Do you feel that your peers help deal with or contribute to stress?<br>
<br>
5. What do you feel your administrators could do to alleviate stress <br>
in the school?<br>
<br>
6. Have you ever taken part in a workshop on how to handle teacher <br>
stress? If so, was it effective? What did you learn?<br>
<br>
7. How do you personally handle your stress?<br>
<br>
8. If you rarely or never experience job-related stress, why do you <br>
think that is?<br>
<br>
I will not be using your names or schools you work for in the paper. <br>
If anything, you will be noted as "Teacher A" or "Mr. X."<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot in advance for helping me with this (and not chewing me <br>
out for creating off-topic messages). :)<br>
