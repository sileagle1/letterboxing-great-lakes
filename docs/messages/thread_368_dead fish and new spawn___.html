First off, I'm pleased to announce that FOOW3 clues have been posted. <br/>
 Special thanks to Team Taco and The Missing Amigo who were my guinea <br/>
pigs in testing out the clues.  TMA beat out TT as the first finder <br/>
and is currently treasuring her first First Finder certificate.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I forgot to mention earlier...when I went out this AM to check <br/>
on the status of poor FOOW1, I stopped the car, left it running (I <br/>
never do that, but I was only going to take a quick glance...), closed <br/>
the LOCKED door...aaaarrrrggghhh!!!!  What is it about this group?  I <br/>
have NEVER done anything like that before!  Luckily the window was <br/>
open wide enough to reach in and unlock it (thankfully my Jeep has old <br/>
fashioned peg-style button locks, not the kind that are further down <br/>
on the arm rest and harder to reach!).<br/>
<br/>
--klk<br/>
<br/>
PS:  My t-shirt arrived today.  Papillon announced that it can only be <br/>
worn as a sleep shirt or at GS camp (ie, where none of her <br/>
school friends will see me wearing it in public).  <sigh> Kids!!!  <br/>
Personally, I think it's cool and can't wait to wear it!<br/>
