  Hey, have a great time in SW WI - where the boxes are few, but the <br/>
  potential is huge (or something like that).<br/>
<br/>
  In two weeks, I'll have all 5 boxes finished for the completion of <br/>
  the Swiss Village series near New Glarus, WI (not too far from <br/>
  Monroe).  If you were thinking of getting the one box listed, you <br/>
  may want to wait until the rest are up.<br/>
<br/>
  Happy hunting!  Let us know how things go.<br/>

Certainly caution needs to be taken wherever you are, but welcome to <br/>
hiking/outdoor recreation, I guess.  There's a number of really <br/>
great boxes in the Madison area.  And the one in Spring Green is a <br/>
spectacular box to find (Mercy at Mill Creek).  If you're in the <br/>
Dodgeville/Spring Green area, I'd definitely recommend that one as <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks!  While I do enjoy hiking, my preferred means of travel is by horseback.  Unfortunately, I know of NO boxes planted along equestrian trails other than my own!  Oh well, at least the dog loves it when we go hiking. <br/>
<br/>
I will keep your suggestions in mind and we may take a jaunt up into that region of Wisconsin this fall.  (I'll be sure to wear my Chicago Bears sweatshirt.)<br/>
<br/>
Found 5 letterboxes earlier today in Stephenson Co., IL, and then gave up on the rest.  The walking was getting to be too much for my elderly parents (both over 80).  We ended up in Monroe at Baumgartners for a late lunch.  Good weather, enjoyable day.<br/>
