I'm sorry, I had to say it.  I've laughed so much over this message.  Never<br>
have subscribed to the "See what you made me do" since I was in 3rd grade,<br>
and hit a boy with my arm cast, making him cry.  Teacher straightened me out<br>
pretty darned fast about the "See what you made me do" excuse.<br>
<br>
Last night I got from the same person, new to lbing, on 2 different boxes <br>
There was trash in the area, you might want to check on your box" and "I<br>
looked, it wasn't there.  Go check on it and let me know when I can go ago."<br>
 Trash area is one that I get 50/50 on its not there/is there and the other<br>
I just placed this weekend.  Do I go or not to see?  If I'm in the area,<br>
maybe.  Look what they made me do.<br>

I had one that I absolutely loved; the sender was accusing me of<br>
habitat destruction because *she* spent so much time off the trail<br>
looking for it that she trampled a bunch of plants. The boxer also<br>
informed me that I shouldn't have planted boxes in that particular<br>
park since it is a protected environment and I would know that if I<br>
had bothered to obtain permission. Except that the park isn't<br>
protected and I *do* have permission from the park manager.<br>
<br>
That one just made me laugh. Well, laugh and change it so that<br>
potential finders have to email me for the clues. For the most part,<br>
though, I find that boxers are pretty polite people, even when frustrated.<br>
