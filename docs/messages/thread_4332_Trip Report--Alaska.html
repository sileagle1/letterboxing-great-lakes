                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got back from a wonderful 2 weeks in Alaskabeautiful weather, <br>
gorgeous scenery!  Lots of wildlifebut not enough birds.  I was <br>
hoping to see 50 species so I could qualify for a "Wings over Alaska" <br>
certificate, but I came up a few short.  But I did add 15 birds to my <br>
life list, so that was really good!  We did manage to do some <br>
letterboxing in the midst of all of our other activities (biking, <br>
museums, kayaking, shopping, hiking, sight-seeing, mile-long zip <br>
line.). <br>
<br>
It seems like everyone talks about seeing the "Big Five"bear, moose, <br>
caribou, wolf, Dall sheep (we saw everything but wolf).  But we also <br>
had some other critters we wanted to see.  We decided to do a <br>
letterbox series on the OTHER big five: sled dog, eagle, musk ox, <br>
salmon, whale (and we did see all of these).   I think we managed to <br>
put them in some interesting or scenic places, but weren't able to <br>
place them on a long hike.  We did 3+ hours of hiking in Denali, but <br>
that was off-limits since it is a national park.  Plus, there are no <br>
trailsyou just goso that would have made clues rather difficult.<br>
<br>
We flew into Anchorage and rented a car for a week.  While we were <br>
there, we met Alaska Homeschoolmommy and her family for ice cream.  <br>
We've never met up with boxers while on vacation so that was nice.  <br>
On our way out of town, we tried to find a park with a series of <br>
boxes.  Unfortunately, the clues didn't give the name of a parkjust <br>
said it was near something.  We found the something, but couldn't <br>
find the park.  Oh well.  We did find the Thunderbird Falls box at a <br>
waterfall on the outskirts of Anchorage.  Then on to Wasilla, where <br>
we left the Sled Dog box near the Iditarod Museum/HQ.  On our way to <br>
Fairbanks, we stopped at Hurricane Gulch (gorgeous view) and <br>
spontaneously decided to leave the Bald Eagle box there.  But the box <br>
wasn't put together yet.  So I stood at the car with the trunk open, <br>
putting the box together and stamping the image into our logbooks <br>
while the rest of the family scouted out a hiding place.<br>
<br>
Left our next 2 boxes at Bird SanctuariesI love being able to <br>
combine 2 hobbies.  We left the Musk Ox box in Fairbanks (they have a <br>
herd at the university there).  Hoped to find a brand-new series in <br>
Fairbanks, but the rain came at just the wrong time for that.  As we <br>
were leaving Fairbanks, we stopped to see a section of the Alaska <br>
pipeline.  At the display, they showed a device called a pig that is <br>
used to clean out the pipeline.  Right next to this metal pig, they <br>
had a little statue of a dancing pigso we weren't the only waltzing <br>
pigs in  Alaska.   Then back to Anchorage, where we left the Salmon <br>
box.  We were able to find a few of Alaska HSM's boxesplaced during <br>
a Midnight Sun gatheringwhile we were there.  We got to the first <br>
box and were looking through the logbook and saw the Doglvers stamp.  <br>
We were thinking "Wow, they must be up in Alaska this summer too".  <br>
Then we realized that Alaska HSM had launched a postal out into the <br>
wild, but just kept using the logbook from the postal.  So we weren't <br>
surprised when we saw P. Granola in the next box.  <br>
<br>
Then it was on to our cruise.  We placed the whale letterbox at Icy <br>
Strait Pointour first port call and a good place to spot whales.  <br>
There was a nice little trail through the cedars.  Actually, this <br>
would have been letterboxing heaven.  I have never seen so many <br>
uprooted trees and stumps in such quantity.  We were able to find the <br>
one and only letterbox in 2 other port callsone in Skagway and one <br>
at a totem pole park in Ketchikan.  Now it is back to home and I need <br>
to find the time to plant the 2 Underground RR/Quilt boxes that I <br>
have all ready to go.  <br>

go with me, she would go now if it were allowed. When I go on <br>
vacation I drag my family with me to find boxes and I'm so worried <br>
they are sick of it already. anyway I'm planing another trip next <br>
weekend with about 15 boxes within walking distance. not as big of a <br>
trip as yours, but I hope I have as much luck as you did.<br>

Thanks for posting the details of your wonderful trip!  I made my first (and <br>
hopefully not only trip) to Alaska in May.  Ours was an Inside Passage/Glacier <br>
Bay cruise, so I didn't get to experience the beauty of inland Alaska.  I <br>
hope to make that my next trip!  I, too, found the letterbox in Skagway.  That's <br>
the only one I could fit in.  <br>
 <br>
Many of you are probably already aware that you can collect the National <br>
Parks Passport cancellation stamps at national parks, monuments, trails, etc.  <br>
Most of the stamps look like postage cancellation images, with the name of the <br>
site on the stamp, along with the current date.  On my Alaska trip, I did seek <br>
out some of the national park stamps.  I was surprised that most of the ones I <br>
found had images that differed from the traditional cancellation.  For <br>
instance, Misty Fiords in Ketchikan has an image in the shape of a shield, and within <br>
the shield outline is a very nice rendering of a bald eagle flying over the <br>
water.  The Tongass National Forest image has a totem pole, a bear with a <br>
salmon it its mouth, and mountains.  Because you cruise the waters of Glacier Bay <br>
when you visit, the park ranger who boards your cruise ship brings the stamp <br>
with them when they come on board.  (You do have to locate the ranger on a large <br>
cruise ship - is that similar enough to letterboxing to call it a find? <G>)  <br>
It's an image of a whale surfacing the water with the glaciers in the <br>
background.   And the Klondike Gold Rush NHP in Skagway has an extra commemorative <br>
centennial stamp that shows the silhouettes of gold miners hiking up the steep <br>
mountain pass, carrying their heavy equipment loads on their backs.  In <br>
addition to stamping my parks passport, I made extra images on blank pages in my <br>
journal so I can use them for cards, scrapbooking, etc.<br>
 <br>
I know these National Park passport stamps aren't the same as finding a <br>
letterbox, but for me it's still fun to collect them.  And the unusual ones I found <br>
on my Alaska trip makes them even more special as mementos of the trip.<br>
 <br>
Glad you had such a great time in AK.  Now I'm ready to start planning the <br>
next visit there, and it will include letterboxes, of course!<br>

P.S.  Martini Man remembered you had a planted some boxes in FL, so we <br>
thought you might be the only boxers who have placed in the opposite <br>

the northern-most and southern-most states, but when I checked I see <br>
that Hawaii is further south.  Another trip idea for you????)<br>

We've been collecting the passport stamps for years, but didn't <br>
realize that there might be different versions of the stamp for each <br>
park (or maybe they just started that recently--we haven't been to a <br>
new to us national park in a few years).  The Gold Rush one in <br>
Skagway is cool.  I did manage to find the ranger on our cruise--he <br>
was getting hot chocolate at the same time as the kids.  <br>
Unfortunatly, it was the wrangell-st. Elias stamp, which did not have <br>
any cool pictures on it.  I never thought of making extra copies of <br>
the stamp for my letterboxing log or scrapbooks--I think I'll start <br>
doing that. Thanks for a great idea.<br>

I would love to go back to Hawaii some time--you've given me another <br>
reason to make the trip!<br>
