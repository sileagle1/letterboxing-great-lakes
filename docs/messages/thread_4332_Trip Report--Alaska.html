                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got back from a wonderful 2 weeks in Alaskabeautiful weather, <br/>
gorgeous scenery!  Lots of wildlifebut not enough birds.  I was <br/>
hoping to see 50 species so I could qualify for a "Wings over Alaska" <br/>
certificate, but I came up a few short.  But I did add 15 birds to my <br/>
life list, so that was really good!  We did manage to do some <br/>
letterboxing in the midst of all of our other activities (biking, <br/>
museums, kayaking, shopping, hiking, sight-seeing, mile-long zip <br/>
line.). <br/>
<br/>
It seems like everyone talks about seeing the "Big Five"bear, moose, <br/>
caribou, wolf, Dall sheep (we saw everything but wolf).  But we also <br/>
had some other critters we wanted to see.  We decided to do a <br/>
letterbox series on the OTHER big five: sled dog, eagle, musk ox, <br/>
salmon, whale (and we did see all of these).   I think we managed to <br/>
put them in some interesting or scenic places, but weren't able to <br/>
place them on a long hike.  We did 3+ hours of hiking in Denali, but <br/>
that was off-limits since it is a national park.  Plus, there are no <br/>
trailsyou just goso that would have made clues rather difficult.<br/>
<br/>
We flew into Anchorage and rented a car for a week.  While we were <br/>
there, we met Alaska Homeschoolmommy and her family for ice cream.  <br/>
We've never met up with boxers while on vacation so that was nice.  <br/>
On our way out of town, we tried to find a park with a series of <br/>
boxes.  Unfortunately, the clues didn't give the name of a parkjust <br/>
said it was near something.  We found the something, but couldn't <br/>
find the park.  Oh well.  We did find the Thunderbird Falls box at a <br/>
waterfall on the outskirts of Anchorage.  Then on to Wasilla, where <br/>
we left the Sled Dog box near the Iditarod Museum/HQ.  On our way to <br/>
Fairbanks, we stopped at Hurricane Gulch (gorgeous view) and <br/>
spontaneously decided to leave the Bald Eagle box there.  But the box <br/>
wasn't put together yet.  So I stood at the car with the trunk open, <br/>
putting the box together and stamping the image into our logbooks <br/>
while the rest of the family scouted out a hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
Left our next 2 boxes at Bird SanctuariesI love being able to <br/>
combine 2 hobbies.  We left the Musk Ox box in Fairbanks (they have a <br/>
herd at the university there).  Hoped to find a brand-new series in <br/>
Fairbanks, but the rain came at just the wrong time for that.  As we <br/>
were leaving Fairbanks, we stopped to see a section of the Alaska <br/>
pipeline.  At the display, they showed a device called a pig that is <br/>
used to clean out the pipeline.  Right next to this metal pig, they <br/>
had a little statue of a dancing pigso we weren't the only waltzing <br/>
pigs in  Alaska.   Then back to Anchorage, where we left the Salmon <br/>
box.  We were able to find a few of Alaska HSM's boxesplaced during <br/>
a Midnight Sun gatheringwhile we were there.  We got to the first <br/>
box and were looking through the logbook and saw the Doglvers stamp.  <br/>
We were thinking "Wow, they must be up in Alaska this summer too".  <br/>
Then we realized that Alaska HSM had launched a postal out into the <br/>
wild, but just kept using the logbook from the postal.  So we weren't <br/>
surprised when we saw P. Granola in the next box.  <br/>
<br/>
Then it was on to our cruise.  We placed the whale letterbox at Icy <br/>
Strait Pointour first port call and a good place to spot whales.  <br/>
There was a nice little trail through the cedars.  Actually, this <br/>
would have been letterboxing heaven.  I have never seen so many <br/>
uprooted trees and stumps in such quantity.  We were able to find the <br/>
one and only letterbox in 2 other port callsone in Skagway and one <br/>
at a totem pole park in Ketchikan.  Now it is back to home and I need <br/>
to find the time to plant the 2 Underground RR/Quilt boxes that I <br/>
have all ready to go.  <br/>

go with me, she would go now if it were allowed. When I go on <br/>
vacation I drag my family with me to find boxes and I'm so worried <br/>
they are sick of it already. anyway I'm planing another trip next <br/>
weekend with about 15 boxes within walking distance. not as big of a <br/>
trip as yours, but I hope I have as much luck as you did.<br/>

Thanks for posting the details of your wonderful trip!  I made my first (and <br/>
hopefully not only trip) to Alaska in May.  Ours was an Inside Passage/Glacier <br/>
Bay cruise, so I didn't get to experience the beauty of inland Alaska.  I <br/>
hope to make that my next trip!  I, too, found the letterbox in Skagway.  That's <br/>
the only one I could fit in.  <br/>
<br/>
Many of you are probably already aware that you can collect the National <br/>
Parks Passport cancellation stamps at national parks, monuments, trails, etc.  <br/>
Most of the stamps look like postage cancellation images, with the name of the <br/>
site on the stamp, along with the current date.  On my Alaska trip, I did seek <br/>
out some of the national park stamps.  I was surprised that most of the ones I <br/>
found had images that differed from the traditional cancellation.  For <br/>
instance, Misty Fiords in Ketchikan has an image in the shape of a shield, and within <br/>
the shield outline is a very nice rendering of a bald eagle flying over the <br/>
water.  The Tongass National Forest image has a totem pole, a bear with a <br/>
salmon it its mouth, and mountains.  Because you cruise the waters of Glacier Bay <br/>
when you visit, the park ranger who boards your cruise ship brings the stamp <br/>
with them when they come on board.  (You do have to locate the ranger on a large <br/>
cruise ship - is that similar enough to letterboxing to call it a find? <g>)  <br/>
It's an image of a whale surfacing the water with the glaciers in the <br/>
background.   And the Klondike Gold Rush NHP in Skagway has an extra commemorative <br/>
centennial stamp that shows the silhouettes of gold miners hiking up the steep <br/>
mountain pass, carrying their heavy equipment loads on their backs.  In <br/>
addition to stamping my parks passport, I made extra images on blank pages in my <br/>
journal so I can use them for cards, scrapbooking, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I know these National Park passport stamps aren't the same as finding a <br/>
letterbox, but for me it's still fun to collect them.  And the unusual ones I found <br/>
on my Alaska trip makes them even more special as mementos of the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you had such a great time in AK.  Now I'm ready to start planning the <br/>
next visit there, and it will include letterboxes, of course!<br/>

P.S.  Martini Man remembered you had a planted some boxes in FL, so we <br/>
thought you might be the only boxers who have placed in the opposite <br/>
ends of the North American continent.  (I was  originally going to say <br/>
the northern-most and southern-most states, but when I checked I see <br/>
that Hawaii is further south.  Another trip idea for you????)<br/>

&gt; when you visit, the park ranger who boards your cruise ship brings the <br/>
&gt; stamp<br/>
&gt; with them when they come on board. (You do have to locate the ranger <br/>
&gt; on a large<br/>
&gt; cruise ship - is that similar enough to letterboxing to call it a <br/>
&gt; find? <g>)<br/>
&gt; It's an image of a whale surfacing the water with the glaciers in the<br/>
&gt; background. And the Klondike Gold Rush NHP in Skagway has an extra <br/>
&gt; commemorative<br/>
&gt; centennial stamp that shows the silhouettes of gold miners hiking up <br/>
&gt; the steep<br/>
&gt; mountain pass, carrying their heavy equipment loads on their backs. In<br/>
&gt; addition to stamping my parks passport, I made extra images on blank <br/>
&gt; pages in my<br/>
&gt; journal so I can use them for cards, scrapbooking, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know these National Park passport stamps aren't the same as finding a<br/>
&gt; letterbox, but for me it's still fun to collect them. And the unusual <br/>
&gt; ones I found<br/>
&gt; on my Alaska trip makes them even more special as mementos of the trip.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Glad you had such a great time in AK. Now I'm ready to start planning the<br/>
&gt; next visit there, and it will include letterboxes, of course!<br/>

&gt; Just got back from a wonderful 2 weeks in Alaska—beautiful weather,<br/>
&gt; gorgeous scenery! Lots of wildlife—but not enough birds. I was<br/>
&gt; hoping to see 50 species so I could qualify for a "Wings over Alaska"<br/>
&gt; certificate, but I came up a few short. But I did add 15 birds to my<br/>
&gt; life list, so that was really good! We did manage to do some<br/>
&gt; letterboxing in the midst of all of our other activities (biking,<br/>
&gt; museums, kayaking, shopping, hiking, sight-seeing, mile-long zip<br/>
&gt; line….).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems like everyone talks about seeing the "Big Five"—bear, moose,<br/>
&gt; caribou, wolf, Dall sheep (we saw everything but wolf). But we also<br/>
&gt; had some other critters we wanted to see. We decided to do a<br/>
&gt; letterbox series on the OTHER big five: sled dog, eagle, musk ox,<br/>
&gt; salmon, whale (and we did see all of these). I think we managed to<br/>
&gt; put them in some interesting or scenic places, but weren't able to<br/>
&gt; place them on a long hike. We did 3+ hours of hiking in Denali, but<br/>
&gt; that was off-limits since it is a national park. Plus, there are no<br/>
&gt; trails—you just go—so that would have made clues rather difficult.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We flew into Anchorage and rented a car for a week. While we were<br/>
&gt; there, we met Alaska Homeschoolmommy and her family for ice cream.<br/>
&gt; We've never met up with boxers while on vacation so that was nice.<br/>
&gt; On our way out of town, we tried to find a park with a series of<br/>
&gt; boxes. Unfortunately, the clues didn't give the name of a park—just<br/>
&gt; said it was near something. We found the something, but couldn't<br/>
&gt; find the park. Oh well. We did find the Thunderbird Falls box at a<br/>
&gt; waterfall on the outskirts of Anchorage. Then on to Wasilla, where<br/>
&gt; we left the Sled Dog box near the Iditarod Museum/HQ. On our way to<br/>
&gt; Fairbanks, we stopped at Hurricane Gulch (gorgeous view) and<br/>
&gt; spontaneously decided to leave the Bald Eagle box there. But the box<br/>
&gt; wasn't put together yet. So I stood at the car with the trunk open,<br/>
&gt; putting the box together and stamping the image into our logbooks<br/>
&gt; while the rest of the family scouted out a hiding place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Left our next 2 boxes at Bird Sanctuaries—I love being able to<br/>
&gt; combine 2 hobbies. We left the Musk Ox box in Fairbanks (they have a<br/>
&gt; herd at the university there). Hoped to find a brand-new series in<br/>
&gt; Fairbanks, but the rain came at just the wrong time for that. As we<br/>
&gt; were leaving Fairbanks, we stopped to see a section of the Alaska<br/>
&gt; pipeline. At the display, they showed a device called a pig that is<br/>
&gt; used to clean out the pipeline. Right next to this metal pig, they<br/>
&gt; had a little statue of a dancing pig—so we weren't the only waltzing<br/>
&gt; pigs in Alaska. Then back to Anchorage, where we left the Salmon<br/>
&gt; box. We were able to find a few of Alaska HSM's boxes—placed during<br/>
&gt; a Midnight Sun gathering—while we were there. We got to the first<br/>
&gt; box and were looking through the logbook and saw the Doglvers stamp.<br/>
&gt; We were thinking "Wow, they must be up in Alaska this summer too".<br/>
&gt; Then we realized that Alaska HSM had launched a postal out into the<br/>
&gt; wild, but just kept using the logbook from the postal. So we weren't<br/>
&gt; surprised when we saw P. Granola in the next box.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then it was on to our cruise. We placed the whale letterbox at Icy<br/>
&gt; Strait Point—our first port call and a good place to spot whales.<br/>
&gt; There was a nice little trail through the cedars. Actually, this<br/>
&gt; would have been letterboxing heaven. I have never seen so many<br/>
&gt; uprooted trees and stumps in such quantity. We were able to find the<br/>
&gt; one and only letterbox in 2 other port calls—one in Skagway and one<br/>
&gt; at a totem pole park in Ketchikan. Now it is back to home and I need<br/>
&gt; to find the time to plant the 2 Underground RR/Quilt boxes that I<br/>
&gt; have all ready to go.<br/>

&gt; Many of you are probably already aware that you can collect the <br/>
National <br/>
&gt; Parks Passport cancellation stamps at national parks, monuments, <br/>
trails, etc.  <br/>
&gt; Most of the stamps look like postage cancellation images, with the <br/>
name of the <br/>
&gt; site on the stamp, along with the current date.  On my Alaska trip, <br/>
I did seek <br/>
&gt; out some of the national park stamps.  I was surprised that most of <br/>
the ones I <br/>
&gt; found had images that differed from the traditional cancellation.   <br/>
In <br/>
&gt; addition to stamping my parks passport, I made extra images on <br/>
blank pages in my <br/>
&gt; journal so I can use them for cards, scrapbooking, etc.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
We've been collecting the passport stamps for years, but didn't <br/>
realize that there might be different versions of the stamp for each <br/>
park (or maybe they just started that recently--we haven't been to a <br/>
new to us national park in a few years).  The Gold Rush one in <br/>
Skagway is cool.  I did manage to find the ranger on our cruise--he <br/>
was getting hot chocolate at the same time as the kids.  <br/>
Unfortunatly, it was the wrangell-st. Elias stamp, which did not have <br/>
any cool pictures on it.  I never thought of making extra copies of <br/>
the stamp for my letterboxing log or scrapbooks--I think I'll start <br/>
doing that. Thanks for a great idea.<br/>

&gt; P.S.  Martini Man remembered you had a planted some boxes in FL, so <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; thought you might be the only boxers who have placed in the opposite <br/>

say <br/>

I would love to go back to Hawaii some time--you've given me another <br/>
reason to make the trip!<br/>
