<br/>
Merry Christmas in July from Beetle in Illinois.  No, I'm not your Secret Santa, sorry.  But if you or others have not yet received their presents from the Jolly Ol' Man, it may just be that his 'helpers' have been on vacation or the mail service is slow.  I am involved in a few postal rings and the mail is moving a bit slowly.    <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure all Christmas presents will be mailed before the end of July, or at least we should all try to focus on that as a mailing deadline.  <br/>
<br/>
My Secret Santa really surprised me!  Since I was planning to be at the Bristol Renaissance Fair last Saturday, he (she) dropped off my presents and they were waiting for me when I arrived.  There were lots and lots of packages for me to open and each one was colorfully wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper.  Sooooo many goodies!!!<br/>
<br/>
Either I've been a very good girl this year, or, I was really slick and fooled Santa into thinking I was a good girl this year.  Tee Hee!   Naughty or nice?  I won't tell.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the local radio stations in the Chicago area has been occasionally playing Christmas songs this month.  I laughed when I hear Christmas songs playing on the radio in July, but I still felt a small smile on my face.  <br/>
<br/>
"We're simply having a wonderful Christmas time..."<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I thought we were going to continue this Secret Santa exchange through the end of the year and we were suppose to keep our identity top secret.  But I guess I missed reading one of the many emails when we were chatting back and forth about cost of rules.  <br/>
<br/>
I've just mailed out a box of goodies to another good little girl.  I hope she likes the presents I am sending to her.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone....shhhhh!  Listen for the sounds of Christmas....jingling bells and the hoof sounds of reindeers on your roof.  OK...just watch for the postal carrier to come.  There are gifts in the mail and there's probably a box making it's way to you now.  <br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas to all....<br/>
And to all, a good night!<br/>
<br/>
Beetle<br/>

  Dear Santa, it has cooled down a little bit so am sure you will be able to deliver soon. Granny Butterfly<br/>

I was up late wrapping all the presents.  The box with all the surprise gifts is on its way.  Maybe we should think of Christmas in July as an extended holiday that might lap into the first week in August if the mail is a bit slow.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to tell speedsquare (the keeper of the list of names) that I've mailed the Secret Santa gifts and they should arrive at their destination soon. <br/>

Merry Christmas to all....<br/>
