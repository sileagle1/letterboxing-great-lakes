                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yup, me too...I'm a 50 ml centrifuge tube and/or 100-125 ml specimen cup<br>
user myself.  I've taken to camo taping the lids since I realized how<br>
visible light blue, hot pink, and orange caps are.  I sometimes throw a<br>
strip of tape down the sides of the container itself to prevent reflection.<br>
<br>
Logbooks become an issue...I have a large oval shaped punch which I use to<br>
make little logs for the specimen cups.  For centrifuge tubes, I use a 3x11"<br>
strip of paper accordion-folded to fit inside.  Unfortunately, a popular box<br>
can fill up fast.  That's okay for those near my house, but distant boxes<br>
become more of a problem.<br>
<br>
The other down side becomes lack of room for hitchhikers!<br>
<br>
I bought some of those stain resistant Rubbermaids (similar to the blue<br>
seal, but it's silvery grey, and the rest of the lid and bowl of the<br>
container are clear hard plastic).  I hope those work as well as the blue<br>
seals.  That's the kind I had used for Hershey's Hike, which as I noted<br>
earlier was found all wet inside.  Granted the lid was not on tight, but was<br>
that due to weather fluctuations or the way it was attached?<br>
<br>
The cheapo Dollar Tree container I was all worried about at Bluffalo (which<br>
WI Hiker graciously applied an extra baggie to this summer) turned out to be<br>
actually quite a nice box.  Go figure!  I must admit, though, hearing others<br>
confess to using them make me feel better.  I was under the impression that<br>
one HAD to use Rubbermaid to be considered a "real" boxer!!!<br>

I'm so glad to hear they work well. I snagged some a few weeks ago after<br>
my students did a lab on hydra, figuring they must be reasonably<br>
waterproof since they ship marine specimens in them. You've given me all<br>
the more reason to look forward to getting live specimens for the kids!<br>
I washed them out and left them on my patio for a few days and so far no<br>
interest from the wildlife or the dog, so I guess they don't smell<br>
interesting. Now I just have to carve some stamps.<br>
For microboxes, I like to use Fisherbrand centrifuge tubes. I actually<br>
borrowed the idea from catbead. We use them in my lab and store samples<br>
in the -80 freezer with them, so I know they hold up in the cold. We<br>
also run them through the autoclave, so I suspect they hold up in heat<br>
very well, too. The only down side I know of them is that too much<br>
pressure on the sides will shatter them.<br>
http://www.catbeadmischief.com/microbox.html<br>
has details on them, including ordering.<br>
I haven't made too many normal size boxes and none of them have weathered<br>
the winter yet, so I'm not sure what my favorite is. I think I will<br>
continue to favor microboxes, just because they are easier to hide. One<br>
of my boxes got vandalized and I replaced it with a microbox, in almost<br>
the exact same place, and it has been untouched by vandals, but found by<br>
4 letterboxers.<br>

Krylon makes spray paint specifically designed to adhere to plastic surfaces.  That might be a better route.  I don't know how much, and how many boxes you can get out of a can, but mathier heads than mine could run a cost analysis of cammo tape/box to paint/box and the economic, environmental, and spiritual advantages of each.<br>

I have been using the Krylon Camo Paint. Have not tried the one made <br>
for plastics. The part that wears off is the flexable rim part. After <br>
taking the lid off a couple times it cracks and falls off. I will <br>
give the plastic paint a try but I am thinking it will do the same <br>
thing. Hopfully it will work :-) Thanks for the tip. There is another <br>
way to camo the boxes, that I have seen done on several boxes here in <br>
Pennsylvania. The boxes are wrapped in a camofluage burlap with a <br>
rubberband around that. Wal Mart sells the stuff for about $6.oo for <br>
a big sheet. It does a very good job of hiding the boxes and holds up <br>
very well. It is made to use outdoors. Talk to you later,<br>
