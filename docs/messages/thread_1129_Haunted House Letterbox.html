I checked in on the Haunted House letterbox over the weekend.  This is <br/>
the box that can only be located using the clues from the Haunted HH <br/>
series.  I had heard of a few people who were "close" but not that <br/>
anyone had solved it and located the box.  I am sorry to report that <br/>
the box didn't make it through the winter very well and I found the <br/>
contents scattered in the area of the hiding spot.  I picked up the <br/>
pieces I could find and took it all home for a little repair work. <br/>

&gt; From the log pages I was able to retrieve, it doesn't look like <br/>
anyone <br/>
&gt; had stamped in yet.  I hope to have it back out in a couple of weeks.<br/>
