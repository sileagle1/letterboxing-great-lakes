Your limber way with linguistics is quite impressive, so I nominate <br/>
you for an honorary membership in our adhoc teacher posse.<br/>
<br/>
Do us proud.  And please, don't ever let me catch you abusing the <br/>
English alphabet ever again!<br/>

I was a medical technology major.  I teach mycology to the med tech students<br/>
that train at our hospital, but that's my least favorite aspect of my job.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm the mutant life form of this group!<br/>

PS:  I'm thinking the teaching connection may partially be the personal<br/>
schedule (summertime off for the most part), plus the creativity required to<br/>
teach.  My job requires me to be very structured in my activities (all lab<br/>
procedures must follow defined protocols to ensure accuracy, so my hobbies<br/>
tend to revolve around activities which allow me to be the opposite.  Even<br/>
cooking and baking...I tend to not follow a recipe unless I have to (drives<br/>
my mom nuts).<br/>
