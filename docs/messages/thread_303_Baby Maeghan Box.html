Your limber way with linguistics is quite impressive, so I nominate <br>
you for an honorary membership in our adhoc teacher posse.<br>

Do us proud.  And please, don't ever let me catch you abusing the <br>

I was a medical technology major.  I teach mycology to the med tech students<br>
that train at our hospital, but that's my least favorite aspect of my job.<br>

I guess I'm the mutant life form of this group!<br>

PS:  I'm thinking the teaching connection may partially be the personal<br>
schedule (summertime off for the most part), plus the creativity required to<br>
teach.  My job requires me to be very structured in my activities (all lab<br>
procedures must follow defined protocols to ensure accuracy, so my hobbies<br>
tend to revolve around activities which allow me to be the opposite.  Even<br>
cooking and baking...I tend to not follow a recipe unless I have to (drives<br>
my mom nuts).<br>

I have to admit that I was just a 'click' away from the same response.<br>
Garrison Keillor has had a lot to say about English majors over the<br>
years.<br>
