                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here I am minding my business (not really because school is out and the boys are going crazy) trying to finish planning this letterboxing trip (Hotel with waterpark for the boys) to Grand Rapids.  We have to get as many Doglvrs, Mobiusklein and Grandvilla boxes as we can in a day and a half.  Here I am trying to print maps, sort clues, make sure the basement and mystery boxes are covered and figure out which park when and I get this phone call from my lovely wife.  <br/>
She says we should cut our vacation to the UP over the 4th of July short so that we can drive over to Wisconsin to get all of the GLG boxes before the temps are pulled.  <br/>
Say what?<br/>
You mean condense 9 days of boxing in the UP with the day long side trips into 5 days?  Switch which boxes to get on the way UP and way down as now we go across instead?  Break and pack up camp to drive ALL THE WAY OVER to set up camp again?  (You ever set up and break down and set up and break down camp with 2,5 and 7 year old boys?)<br/>
I guess the real problem I have is now we have limited time to figure out every single Wisconsin mystery box and regular boxes including the basement between here and there with the slight possibility of being able to pull over long enough to get in a hike or two.  Heck, I don't even know how to get from Tahquamenon Falls to Blue Mounds.  Guess I gotta get busy but for now it's all about Aman Park, Hudsonville Nature Center, Hager Park, Seidman Park, Palmer Park.....<br/>
