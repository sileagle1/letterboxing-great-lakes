My brother was shocked that I would move from my Forest Park apt.  The<br>
location, above Golden Drugs, Harlem and Madison.  Literally, I could walk<br>
down my steps and walk to more pubs/restaurants than I had fingers and<br>
toes, and not have to find parking.  Oh, to be young again.  My favorite<br>
places were ParkyDogs (for the fries), and Johnny's Beef (Italian Beef and<br>
Italian Ice) on North Avenue.  Lots of other great spots too.  Not exactly<br>
on the Metra Pub Crawl line, but hikers won't noticed the difference.  I'm<br>
going to try to get back to Chicago this summer, after the GL gathering. <br>

Actually, on the documentary, there was a little piece about The <br>
World Dryer company--I think they showed an exterior shot of the <br>
place.<br>

to me.  Last night, MoneyMan and I were watching a documentary on our local<br>
PBS station about various communities in the western suburbs of Chicago that<br>
are on the Burlington or Chicago & Northwestern train lines.  They would<br>
give some interesting information on the community or its history.  After<br>

The Program is called "Chicago's Western Suburbs:  From Prairie Soil <br>
to Prairie Style".  It will be on 2 more times in March on Channel <br>
11:  3/12 at 7pm; 3/20 at 7:30pm.<br>
<br>
During the pledge breaks, the director mentioned that he had already <br>
done several other shows on the Chicago suburbs and is working on <br>
one now about the Fox River Valley and the SW suburbs.  I think it <br>
would be interesting to find these videos at the library or <br>
wherever; esp. since we had a big boxing trip in the north shore <br>
suburbs in January (and a number of Beetle's boxes had an historical <br>
angle) and there have been a number of boxes listed in Chicago <br>
recently with a historical bent.  <br>
<br>
Actually, I just went and checked our library system's Web catalog <br>
and there are 3 DVD's listed:  NW suburbs, North Shore suburbs, and <br>
South suburbs/NW Indiana.  The producer--Geoffrey Baer--also has one <br>
on Chicago Neighborhood via the "L" and one on Chicago by boat (and <br>
you don't have to worry about a tour bus dumping sewage on you while <br>
you're on this video tour:)<br>
