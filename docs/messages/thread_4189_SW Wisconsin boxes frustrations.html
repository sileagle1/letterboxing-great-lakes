                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings all,<br>
<br>
I was able to visit my boxes out in Grant County over the weekend.  I <br>
had planted two boxes last summer during the race to plant in every <br>
county.  I got emails from first finders on both boxes and then they <br>
were both promptly reported missing!  (Very discouraging.)  I had heard <br>
from an uncle that the location of one box was gone for sure, the town <br>
had gone in and cleared out the deadfall last fall.  So I recarved my <br>
two stamps and got their boxes ready.  Plus I had two new boxes to <br>
plant.  I'm all set for the trip out there.<br>
We get out to my aunt and uncle's home and get settled in.  We stopped <br>
and replaced Channel Cat.  We head over to Bald Eagle Days, and the box <br>
is exactly where it is supposed to be!  I had thought that this was a <br>
very straight forward box, so when it was reported missing, I figured <br>
it really was gone and recarved it.  So now I have a reserve stamp in <br>
case it ever does go missing.  I planted one of my two new boxes, but <br>
there was a pretty intense thunderstorm that went through, so I ended <br>
up not getting the second one planted.  <br>
So my score for the trip, I went out with 4 boxes to plant and brought <br>
2 home with me!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've worried about being "that LBer" who contacts the placer and <br>
reports the box missing, only to find out I'm just a dolt who <br>
couldn't figure out some simple clues.  So far I haven't been <br>
though, fortunately, even after being the one to report a couple <br>
boxes missing.  My mom and I looked for one box within probably a <br>
200-yard radius of where we thought it was supposed to be, just in <br>
case we were looking in the wrong tree stump.  I've found that I can <br>
pretty easily convince myself that I must be completely blind and <br>
dumb while following some LBing clues. Although, I sincerely hope <br>
I'm not the only LBer who is so easily convinced. :/  <br>
<br>
Glad to hear that at least one of your boxes was still there!  I'm <br>
sure I'll be experiencing the same worries/frustrations after I <br>
start placing my first boxes. :)<br>
