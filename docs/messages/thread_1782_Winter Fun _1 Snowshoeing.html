its home, but there is one bite area that does go through the plastic <br>
(not a fatal hole, just needs a small bit of glue or something - it is <br>
small).<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks!  (We actually have replaced whole boxes that have been damaged<br>
several times.  The last one was on our latest vacation trip - a 10 mile<br>
hike with 3,800 ft elevation gain!  The box lid was missing, but the placer<br>
had noted in his clues that the box needed major repair, so we brought a new<br>
box and logbook along with us. The stamp was fine.)<br>
<br>
Martini Man & I also used to swim at what we still call "Lannon Quarry" when<br>
we were in high school  (before they fenced off the beach and charged<br>
admission to the park).  It's a great park that didn't have any boxes yet.<br>
We'll probably have 30-40 boxes there the day of the gathering - some will<br>
stay for a bit longer and some will be permanent.  Since you live nearby,<br>
you should be able to find them all within  a week or two before some of<br>
them are removed.<br>
<br>
I've got an "Attendees" page on the website, so if your OCT 1 schedule<br>
allows, just let me know how you'd like to be listed and the sex/age of any<br>
kids (some families like knowing other kids will be there, so I'm listing<br>
the kids in more detail).<br>
