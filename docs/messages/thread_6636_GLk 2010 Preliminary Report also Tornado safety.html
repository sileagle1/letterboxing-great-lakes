Sounds like you all had some hair-raising experiences, weather-wise being a good part of it.  But, I'm glad you all had a blast from what I'm reading.  Although, I am sorry I couldn't attend.  Saturday was the celebration of my granparents' 60th wedding anniversary as well as my grandmother's 80th birthday.<br>
<br>
Few things that caught my eye while reading that made me sit up and pay more attention.  I'm only doing this to make sure that everyone knows as there are so many weather myths out there and this is what I majored in in college and have been out storm chasing.  While many of you already know, I'm sure, I am constantly coming across those that don't.  So, for those of you that do know, kudos!  And no, before anyone else makes the joke, I can't change the weather.  I don't have the keys.<br>
 <br>
With lightning: While inside is the safest place to be, the next safest place if you're not indoors is in your car.  It's a complete circuit if struck by lightning, provided you don't touch any of the radio nobs and the windows are closed.  Also, lightning can strike up to several miles away from storms before and after the storm has passed so wait at least 20 minutes after the last strike or thunder blast before heading back out.  If you hear thunder, head indoors as where there's thunder, there's lightning.  <br>
<br>
Tornado safety:  Good job to all of you taking shelters in freezers or bathrooms.  Those are away from windows and have all four walls.  I was very glad to see that no one simply waited out the horrendous weather on Sunday under a picnic pavilion.  However, while out driving, if you suspect a tornado, hear tornado sirens, or see a tornado, please do not go under an overpass for shelter.  Those areas are not safe in the slightest.  In fact, they can do more harm than good as they create wind tunnels and a tornados winds can drag you out from underneath or worse.  The safest places are in ditches with your head down if there is no other shelter available.  My friends and I have even been encouraged by those with a lot more experience than us to bang on people's doors if need be.  We've also been told by much more experienced storm chasers that trying to out-run a tornado while driving is also a bad idea as not only can tornados be extremely fast, they can also change direction, and the funnel cloud itself may not always be visible.  From reading the news, I'm also sure that you all know that the same storm may spawn more than one tornado.<br>
<br>
And so, like I had said earlier, I just wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of all that.  Sorry if I sounded preachy, I don't mean to be.  Short plug, every year, Tom Skilling from Chicago's WGN hosts a severe storms/tornado seminar in the spring at Fermilab.  It's always amazing and a lot of fun, full of information too.  I've been going every year that I have been able to attend.  I'll keep you all updated as to when next year's seminar is.  This year's may still be up on WGN's website.  I'll have to look.<br>
<br>
Have fun out there, but please stay safe.<br>
