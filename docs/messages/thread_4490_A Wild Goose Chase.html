                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wanted to say thank you to the great hosts (Big Purple Foot, Scout <br/>
Angel, and Mr. Duck) of "A Wild Goose Chase" gathering on Saturday. <br/>
This was our first gathering and everyone made us feel very welcome. <br/>
It was wonderful to finally put a face to all the names that I see so <br/>
often on here. <br/>
Although the weather was HOT, the location was great. We loved the park <br/>
and we can't wait to go back and find the rest of the boxes that we <br/>
missed! <br/>
And I am just kicking myself because I forgot about the Revel Bars. <br/>
Here I talked about them all week...couldn't wait to try the infamous <br/>
bars...and I missed them!!! Arrggghh!!! LOL <br/>
Thanks again for a wonderful day in the park. <br/>
