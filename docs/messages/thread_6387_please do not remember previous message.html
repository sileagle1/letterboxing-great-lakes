Please do not remember previous message for glorious Supreme Leader Kim Jong Il.  Er, was Korean joke, ha!  South Korean athletes have never heard of kim chee snow grenades, so how could they bring to Olympic Games?  In fact, there are no such things as kim chee snow grenades.  What silly idea!  Kim chee snow grenades are mythology, like Mickey Mouse.  Never were there such things!  Your various countries creative imaginations have dreamed them into being!  No kim chee snow grenades!  Or dog-flavored barbecue sauce, too!  Ha Ha!  You see, I am laughing at worldwide silliness!  Ha Ha!  Kim chee snow grenades, how ridiculous!<br/>
