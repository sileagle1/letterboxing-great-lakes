Maybe we should ask our US soldiers to hide plastic film container letterboxes in Iraq.  That would really confuse Bin Laden and his merry men.  They'd be trying to decode one of our cryptic Lb clues only to find a rubber stamp.  LOL!  <br/>

  Hi Beetle! Your thought has gone through my head many times as well. <br/>
  Like when I'm driving down the road with all kinds of camo-taped <br/>
  containers sitting on the front seat beside me. I often wonder how I <br/>
  would handle it if I got pulled over for speeding (to another letterbox) <br/>
  or something. <br/>
<br/>
  On top of that, a week or so ago, I went down to visit my son in NC <br/>
  before he deploys for the 3rd time. There was a box placed at Fort <br/>
  Bragg where he is based, on the day he deployed the last time. My son <br/>
  and his wife and I finally got a chance to go hunt for that box---again, <br/>
  this is ON post and you have to go through a complete inspection to get <br/>
  on Fort Bragg property. The box is gone...and I can't say any of us was <br/>
  surprised. In fact, I think it made us feel better that someone removed <br/>
  it for obvious reasons, and yet, we still pressed to find it just in <br/>
  case! :) The placer is a member of Special Forces and he or she is <br/>
  most likely deployed right now themselves. What we won't do for <br/>
  letterboxes?!<br/>
