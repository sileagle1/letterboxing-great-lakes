                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is around this time of year...a few months into winter with a few <br/>
more to go...that I start to look forward to the upcoming boxing season <br/>
when the days get warmer.  I know it is also a good time to do box <br/>
maintenance for those you've already planted (and remember, there is a <br/>
prize so add your boxes to the file in the database section!), but it <br/>
also is a nice time to think about fun series or tricky mystery boxes to <br/>
plant so carving can commence.   Plus, if you check-out a potential <br/>
plant in the winter, before the bushes and trees bloom, it is much <br/>
easier to find good hiding spots!<br/>
<br/>
So, I was wondering (and perhaps looking for ideas to steal!), if anyone <br/>
had some fun ideas they'd be willing to share?<br/>
<br/>
On my short list, at the moment, are a few 'Stroller Boxing' boxes I'd <br/>
like to plant.  For those of you who aren't in our area and haven't done <br/>
them, these are kid-themed boxes that are planted in locations that can <br/>
be done with a stroller in tow.  We like to make them 1-2miles so the <br/>
effort of hauling a big trail-worthy stroller is rewarded with a nice <br/>
hike.  The ones we had planted before were mainly Seuss themed boxes, <br/>
but I think our new series will be related to some other titles.  <br/>
Related to (or perhaps just nearby) some of those plants, I'd like to <br/>
include a series of photoclues. We have one planted that I really like, <br/>
so I'd like to make another one (or two) of those.  These might/probably <br/>
will be a bit more tricky so, ideally, one of the two series will <br/>
interest everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I'd share some thoughts since it seems like things are a bit <br/>
quiet expect for just checking the board to see if they have the daily <br/>
BINGO word (and if you are like me, more often than not, you don't)!<br/>
