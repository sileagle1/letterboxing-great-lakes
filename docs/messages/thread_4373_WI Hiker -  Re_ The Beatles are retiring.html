You are inspirational!  The Beatles Letterbox Series is really good series. I like nice easy hikes along rivers.   I really don't want to retire this series.  Maybe what the Open Lands Association doesn't know won't hurt them.  Actually, they told me they 'highly discourage games" because of sensitive planting areas but they didn't absolutely prohibit letterboxing under penalty of fine or conviction.  Don't ask/don't tell, out of sight/out of mind...etc.  And my boxes aren't in sensitive planting areas.  I know better.  Be friendly to mother nature - the letterboxer's motto.  Maybe I should just replace the Paul box and let the fab four and that great musical clue (which took me a long time to create) live on........yeah yeah yeah yeah!<br/>
<br/>
It was overcast and looked like rain so I didn't go out to retrieve the three remaining boxes.  Maybe I won't.  Thanks for the alternative idea!  <br/>

  Oh, that's too bad! We remember meeting the Fab Four in March of <br/>
  2006 on a snowy day. We took them with us for a reunion with Beetle <br/>
  ("Carol") at the Full Moon. It sounds like they were placed back to <br/>
  enjoy the "Norwegian Woods" after their vist to the diner. Sorry to <br/>
  hear that Paul drifted off in the "Yellow Submarine". "I've Got a <br/>
  Feeling" that he wanted to go "Here, There and Everywhere", "In Spite <br/>
  of All the Danger".<br/>
<br/>
  But Beetle, don't say "Not a Second Time"! "You Know What To Do" - <br/>
  don't be "The Fool on the Hill", but instead tell us "It Won't Be <br/>
  Long" before Paul rejoins "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". I <br/>
  can almost hear him saying "It Won't Be Long" before "I'll Be Back"...<br/>
<br/>
  "With a Little Help From My Friends" I'm sure we convince you <br/>
  that "There's a Place" that would be perfect for another "Magical <br/>
  Mystery Tour" for boxers that haven't met these icons of "Rock and <br/>
  Roll Music".<br/>
<br/>
  "Do You Want to Know a Secret?" - "I've Got a Feeling" they'll <br/>
  be "All Together Now" in the near future. Then you'll be sending us <br/>
  a message to "Come and Get It"!<br/>
<br/>
  "From Me to You",<br/>

  &gt; This is a notice to my LbGLK friends, <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; The Beatles Series of 4 boxes in Lake Forest, IL is retiring after <br/>
  just over 2 years. Paul was reported missing. He may have been <br/>
  washed away due to unusually heavy rains and flooding. I contacted <br/>
  the Open Lands Association to inquire if a box was found; and it <br/>
  wasn't. But they informed me that they 'highly discourage' any <br/>
  treasure hunting games on their properties. They found a letterbox <br/>
  once before and contacted LbNA. LbNA contacted me because I'm the <br/>
  only one in this are who is one of those crazy letterboxers. Hey, <br/>
  don't knock it till you've tried it. Sitting on the sofa isn't my <br/>
  idea a having fun in life. That found box belonged to another <br/>
  letterboxer who I recognized and I mailed it back to her. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Anyway, John, George, and Ringo bid farewell to Paul...where ever <br/>
  he drifted off too. And this series will be retiring in the <br/>
  morning. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Thought...It's getting harder and harder to find a good place to <br/>
  hide a letterbox. I guess 2 years was a good length of time for this <br/>
  series, but I would have hoped it would have lasted longer. Maybe I <br/>
  should recarve Paul and relocate the series. <br/>
