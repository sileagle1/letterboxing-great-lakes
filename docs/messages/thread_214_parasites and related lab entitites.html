I may be mistaken, but I think John from Leapin' Lizards makes his<br>
parasites out of the left-over scraps. They are tiny enough.<br>
Personally, I got my pile o' scraps over on the corner of my desk<br>
right now, just waiting for me to have a brainstorm as to what to do<br>
with them. Frankly, I wish I had a dog that would chew them up! ;-)<br>
