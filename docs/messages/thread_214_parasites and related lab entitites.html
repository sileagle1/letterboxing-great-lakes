I may be mistaken, but I think John from Leapin' Lizards makes his<br/>
parasites out of the left-over scraps. They are tiny enough.<br/>
Personally, I got my pile o' scraps over on the corner of my desk<br/>
right now, just waiting for me to have a brainstorm as to what to do<br/>
with them. Frankly, I wish I had a dog that would chew them up! ;-)<br/>
