If memory serves me....<br>
<br>
A reminder that the month of April has been declared the official<br>
LbGLK letterbox "spring cleaning" month.  During the month of April,<br>
we should check all of our boxes and do any maintenance on them,<br>
including updating our clues to say "Last checked - April, 2005".  <br>
<br>
The thought was to have all our boxes in the upper midwest ready not<br>
only for us local boxers to find, but also for any boxers that might<br>
be planning trips our way!<br>
<br>
If anyone has boxes far away from you, I'd suggest you ask another<br>
boxer that is closer to check on your box for you.  For example, I<br>
just received word that my "Go to Hell" box has just been found and is<br>
in good condition and ready for the summer from a boxer in MI.  They<br>
had emailed me before going, and I asked them to do any "spring<br>
cleaning" on the box if needed.  <br>
<br>
If there is anyone in the UP that could check on my boxes up there,<br>
please let me know.  I already have plans to lots of checking and<br>
fixing of my boxes around here during my spring break next week.  Let<br>
me know if I should check on any of yours while I'm at it.  Hopefully,<br>
the weather will cooperate...<br>
