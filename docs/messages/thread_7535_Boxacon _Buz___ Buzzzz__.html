<br/>
Slightly cold and rainy in the morning-but got the hard hill(wall, roller coaster, ect done early though!) then a nice sunny day, great food and people! Good job Aimlesst(and help)!<br/>
<br/>
So what is FW talking about--"And Shorty, your Box Radar clues have sealed my decision that my next phone will be an Android...bzz...bzz...bzzzzzz.........."??<br/>
<br/>
What's the buzz, the WOM Freedom Seeker?<br/>
<br/>
Well, Aiphid(from Maine) created an ANDROID based letterboxing app as many of us know. And recently, has invited a select few(BR users) attending events to plant a special box.<br/>
<br/>
Now, how it works;<br/>
A. You MUST have an android phone, with BR installed(it is a GREAT app, with no, or less than usual paper printed)or you can team up with someone who has the app. <br/>
B. You MUST be within a certain radius of a certain coordinate that I plug in. It's sort part of the background end of the clue no one sees. Obviously focusing around event, participants made the 1st radius really big, so when(and YOU MUST have the app open within the radius) you open the app, BUZ... BUZZZ! "What;s that?" Buz... BUZZ!! ^Check Phone^ "Signal?" ^Click^ "A CLUE! A CLUE! Okay, so it says go to....Lot, LETS GO!!" ^at ...Lot^ Buz...BUZZZ!!! "Another signal!"<br/>
<br/>
You get notified of a clue. A Special clue, just for BR users. This was obviously a test, and after some tweaking(texting my Maine Tech Support)we got it running, and a few people were able to get it!<br/>
<br/>
So now that the event is over, the word is out. I encourage you Android(Ohh I LOVE my smartphone, Id be dumb without it!) users to get back to Lapham, or team up with someone who has the app and test it for yourself! I think I got FW hooked! And I know forSURE Ill be doing another one! So keep those phones out(plus there are other clues on there in the area you might have missed anyway!) and Buz Buzzz alert on!<br/>
