planned to go to the SW area to pick up and plant some boxes on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Things happen.  My mac crashed Friday night so I couldn't print out clues.<br/>
 Saturday visit to genius bar didn't help either.  I did find Little Girl<br/>
in the Window and Kenekuk the Kickapoo Prophet it its new location Sunday.<br/>
 Pretty amazing since I didn't have the translation for the Kickapoo<br/>
words.  I am currently catching up on my mail at a mac service shop while<br/>
they replace my hard drive.  Whew!  It looks like I'll be back in action<br/>
later today.<br/>
