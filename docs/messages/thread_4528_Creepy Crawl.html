Heh!<br>
I hear ya!  Although, the overcastedness and general gloom of rain <br>
WOULD add to the overall "creepiness" of the event.<br>
<br>
Besides, Double Dragon and I will be inside almost all day, we don't mind!  ;)<br>

I can't believe it's this weekend!  I'm so excited!<br>

Unfortunately, it looks like you may be right... I see the chance of <br>
rain on Satruday has now increased from 30% to 50%!<br>

They don't have any idea!  LOL<br>
<br>
I just checked the Freep's forecast and it said "chance of showers, <br>
breezy 53 degrees".<br>
<br>
Then I checked channel 4's forecast and it said scattered showers, <br>
chance of precipitation 50%, 61 degrees"<br>
<br>
So, I checked channel 2's and it says "rain showers, high of 60, low 52"<br>
<br>
Channel 7 says:  "mostly cloudy with showers, high of 60, low of 51"<br>
<br>
Channel 62 says "mostly cloudy, scattered showers, highs 58 to 62; <br>
chance of rain 50%"<br>
<br>
I'm on a roll, so I decided to check detnews.com.... they say "rather <br>
cloudy, a shower possible, breezy, high of 53"<br>
<br>
Why not check the national guys, too, since the locals can't agree... <br>
weather.com says "showers, 50% chance and a high of 57"<br>
<br>
So, you're highly accurate forecast... It might rain.  It might <br>
not.   It might be cloudy, Or not.  It might be in the fifties or <br>
maybe sixties, but there's a chance of 40's, too.   Basically, they <br>
have every possibility covered!<br>
<br>
I bet by Friday, there will be totally different predictions on these sites.<br>
<br>
I just got back from planting all (but one) of the boxes for this <br>
event!  The moon was up and visible already.  It's almost full, very <br>
pretty!  It will be just past the full moon on Saturday, we should <br>
have done this at night!  That would have been really <br>
fun/creepy!  Except, I guess it if IS cloudy Saturday, you wouldn't <br>
be able to see it anyway.<br>
<br>
I'm so excited!  I can't wait to see everyone Saturday and see how <br>
this all turns out.  Hopefully, it works as expected!<br>

Ack!  Stop checking the weather, WH!  LOL Everytime you do, it gets worse.<br>

LOL Yeah, that's what I said the other day.  The dreariness will <br>
definitely add to the atmosphere, even if it is miserable.<br>
<br>
Latest weather.... showers likely, especially before 2pm (prime <br>
crawling time!), chance of precipitation 70!<br>
