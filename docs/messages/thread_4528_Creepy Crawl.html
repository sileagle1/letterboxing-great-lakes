Heh!<br/>
I hear ya!  Although, the overcastedness and general gloom of rain <br/>
WOULD add to the overall "creepiness" of the event.<br/>

Besides, Double Dragon and I will be inside almost all day, we don't mind!  ;)<br/>

Unfortunately, it looks like you may be right... I see the chance of <br/>
rain on Satruday has now increased from 30% to 50%!<br/>

<br/>
They don't have any idea!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I just checked the Freep's forecast and it said "chance of showers, <br/>
breezy 53 degrees".<br/>
<br/>
Then I checked channel 4's forecast and it said scattered showers, <br/>
chance of precipitation 50%, 61 degrees"<br/>
<br/>
So, I checked channel 2's and it says "rain showers, high of 60, low 52"<br/>
<br/>
Channel 7 says:  "mostly cloudy with showers, high of 60, low of 51"<br/>
<br/>
Channel 62 says "mostly cloudy, scattered showers, highs 58 to 62; <br/>
chance of rain 50%"<br/>
<br/>
I'm on a roll, so I decided to check detnews.com.... they say "rather <br/>
cloudy, a shower possible, breezy, high of 53"<br/>
<br/>
Why not check the national guys, too, since the locals can't agree... <br/>
weather.com says "showers, 50% chance and a high of 57"<br/>
<br/>
So, you're highly accurate forecast... It might rain.  It might <br/>
not.   It might be cloudy, Or not.  It might be in the fifties or <br/>
maybe sixties, but there's a chance of 40's, too.   Basically, they <br/>
have every possibility covered!<br/>
<br/>
I bet by Friday, there will be totally different predictions on these sites.<br/>
<br/>
I just got back from planting all (but one) of the boxes for this <br/>
event!  The moon was up and visible already.  It's almost full, very <br/>
pretty!  It will be just past the full moon on Saturday, we should <br/>
have done this at night!  That would have been really <br/>
fun/creepy!  Except, I guess it if IS cloudy Saturday, you wouldn't <br/>
be able to see it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so excited!  I can't wait to see everyone Saturday and see how <br/>
this all turns out.  Hopefully, it works as expected!<br/>

Creepy Crawl this weekend.  It was our first event and Lunagirl and I <br/>
had a terrific time!  It was great to put faces to the stamps in our <br/>
book and to meet new friends who share our love for letterboxing.  It <br/>
was so nice to meet all of you.  We'll definitely be back for more!<br/>
