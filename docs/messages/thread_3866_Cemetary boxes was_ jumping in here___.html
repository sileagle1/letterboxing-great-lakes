I have a HH named Playful Mouse.  I received a response that a woman and her<br/>
two children had found her and moved her on to a box that was by some baby<br/>
in a cemetery letterbox.  They seemed happy she said to have left the<br/>
playful mouse for the baby.  I was touched.<br/>
<br/>
  That baby's family may have been long gone for years but she was<br/>
remembered that day.  <br/>
