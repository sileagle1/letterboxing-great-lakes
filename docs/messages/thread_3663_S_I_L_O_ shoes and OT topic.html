Sure wish I could join in on the fun, but I have a fundraiser for police K-9's that day.  My troop has another one to outfit with a bullet proof vest.  If you want more details on that or would like to help with a donation in any amount... check out the home page for my troop: www.DogScoutTroop107.com <br>
