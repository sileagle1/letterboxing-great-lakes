My "crazy excuse" today was assumed by the park guy to be wondering what had happened in the area of the 4 Queens LB in Jefferson County - um, yeah, sure.  Turns out they are clearing and restoring the area around some Native American mounds in the preserve.  The LB was in a stump ADJACENT to one of these mounds (that I'd previously been unaware of).  The LB was actually in a geocache that took over the hiding spot - the cache contents were (wet) toast, but the logbook and stamp were fine, much to my shock.  My many thanks to Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man for telling me about the changes in the preserve!  I do intend to replant in another area of the preserve away from the mounds - and I do intend to check on another LB there when I go back.  I pretty much grabbed the stamp and logbook, repacked the cache and left since the park guy probably saw the box contents I'd been looking at.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate when we watch out for each other's boxes, do maintenance and send status updates!<br/>

My "crazy excuse" today was assumed by the park guy to be wondering what had<br/>
happened in the area of the 4 Queens LB in Jefferson County - um, yeah,<br/>
sure. Turns out they are clearing and restoring the area around some Native<br/>
American mounds in the preserve. The LB was in a stump ADJACENT to one of<br/>
these mounds (that I'd previously been unaware of). The LB was actually in a<br/>
geocache that took over the hiding spot - the cache contents were (wet)<br/>
toast, but the logbook and stamp were fine, much to my shock. My many thanks<br/>
to Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man for telling me about the changes in the<br/>
preserve! I do intend to replant in another area of the preserve away from<br/>
the mounds - and I do intend to check on another LB there when I go back. I<br/>
pretty much grabbed the stamp and logbook, repacked the cache and left since<br/>
the park guy probably saw the box contents I'd been looking at.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate when we watch out for each other's boxes, do maintenance and<br/>
send status updates!<br/>

might be wandering off trail in the first place when "caught" (i.e. "I lost<br/>
my [wedding band, earring, bracelet]...," or "We were trying to get a<br/>
picture but the light over there wasn't quite right...," or "A bird swooped<br/>
down and stole my hat. I think it went that way...," or "I thought I saw a<br/>

&gt; I received an email this morning from a Nature Center telling me to remove<br/>
my listing for a letterbox I have planted there. The message included this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "On Sunday June 3, I found a family on Phantom Prairie trail attempting to<br/>
walk off trail into the brush. They handed me a piece of paper titled 100<br/>
Ways for Barbie to Die: Inattentive Flying."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The family mentioned probably isn't anyone on this message board, but<br/>
perhaps we all need to put reminders in our clues that potential searchers<br/>
need to be more discreet and not divulge what they are doing, so as to<br/>
protect the secrecy of our boxes. <br/>

Dressed in pirate garb, we hiked out to a local beach to find a box. As we were counting paces along the beach, we had one or two people ask what we were doing... We just told them we were looking for buried treasure. Might try this all the time, except pirate garb is not the best for climbing through shrubs and brambles. LOL<br/>
