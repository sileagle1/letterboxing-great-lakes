I hope to go north to the UP this summer; there are a lot of interesting <br>
letterboxes up there!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It does skew the numbers a little that there are more Michigan boxes overall because upper and lower peninsula are treated separately -- so although there are not *twice* as many overall from MI, there are more from MI when you count both peninsulas...  I think it works out to be about the same number from the lower peninsula as from the other states and then a few additional from the upper peninsula.<br>
