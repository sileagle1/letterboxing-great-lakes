&gt; Well, I went a little further and included not only boxes but events and<br/>
&gt; people for each state as well. Here are those breakdowns:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; MI: 12<br/>
&gt; WI: 9<br/>
&gt; IL: 8<br/>
&gt; IN: 5<br/>
&gt; OH: 7<br/>
&gt; MN: 3<br/>

I hope to go north to the UP this summer; there are a lot of interesting <br/>
letterboxes up there!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, technically, there are 10 MI boxes and 7 from the other states, but the extra 3 are in the UP and probably visited very rarely so it pretty much evens out.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It does skew the numbers a little that there are more Michigan boxes overall because upper and lower peninsula are treated separately -- so although there are not *twice* as many overall from MI, there are more from MI when you count both peninsulas...  I think it works out to be about the same number from the lower peninsula as from the other states and then a few additional from the upper peninsula.<br/>
