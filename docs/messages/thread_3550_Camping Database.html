                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, that was easy.  The database is set up, called<br>
GLG 2007 Camping.  I included a "# adults," # kids"<br>
and "# pets" so we can see just how many of us there<br>
will be on the campgrounds.  If you don't want to<br>
divulge that information, just leave those spaces<br>
blank.  <br>
<br>
FYI, turns out most of the sites are $27 a night, not<br>
$26 like it said on their front page.  There's also an<br>
$8 "reservation fee" which you have to pay no matter<br>
if you book online or by phone.  Just so no one's<br>
caught off guard.  I just reserved our site, and was<br>
having trouble with their online page (I guess they<br>
just implemented some new changes) so if you're having<br>
trouble booking online, call their number instead. <br>
They're very friendly.  <br>
