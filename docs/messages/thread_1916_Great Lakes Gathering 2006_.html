                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's time to think ahead to spring!  The area fall gatherings behind <br>
us and the winter months bearing down on us, I would like to square <br>
things away for the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering before people begin to <br>
hibernate for the winter.<br>
<br>
I am looking for:<br>
<br>
- Possible locations<br>
- People who are willing to host/assist (locale you would consider)<br>
<br>
Please e-mail me offlist with input on either of these. Early in <br>
November I will put up a poll of locations.  Note that only locations <br>
that appear to have a potential hoster will be put up for vote.  You <br>
can still suggest a location without volunteering to host, or vice <br>
versa -- offer to host/assist without having a specific location in <br>
mind, but when the poll goes up, only the locales that have a willing <br>
hoster will be considered.<br>
<br>
I will also be putting the date up for vote, taking into consideration <br>
past input.  I do understand the school year issue, but also know that <br>
holding out much past the middle of June we begin to run into <br>
vacations, so it will go up for a vote to be as fair as possible.  <br>
This past year, the date was Saturday, June 18th, which was a week <br>
later than the previous year, which was a couple of weeks later than <br>
the year before.  I would like to see it remain within the first few <br>
weeks of June but am open to other suggestions.<br>
<br>
If you have any other feedback or ideas concerning next year's <br>
gathering, please feel free to post to the list of contact me directly <br>

the possibility of Pokagon State Park in Angola, IN.<br>
It's near the MI border, it's off the toll road...so<br>
easy access...and it has a large campground. It's also<br>
HUGE...so a lot of possibilities of planting boxes.<br>
It's about 2 hours from Indy, less than two from<br>
K-zoo, Lansing.....<br>
<br>
I think I *might* be able to throw my hat in the ring<br>
to help host if it's in IN. I think the Indy boxers<br>

Anywho.....just a suggestion<br>

Tonto and I would be willing to throw our hats in with Armadillo Jo <br>
and anyone else willing to share in the responsibilities...Although <br>
we are technically Illinois boxers, our parents have a home in <br>
Lagrange County...and Tiptoe is a born and raised Hoosier! <br>
We hosted a fiftieth anniversary celebration at Pokagon a few years <br>
ago and it turned out to be a terrific event due to the pleasant, <br>
accomodating staff and surroundings.  There is camping for those <br>
that prefer roughing it, and the Inn is wonderful too!  As I recall, <br>
last winter, they had a news clipping posted in the nature center <br>
promoting letterboxing. So, I would think they would be supportive <br>
of us planting boxes so a large group could hit their trails.  If <br>
anyone is interested in checking the park out before voting...in the <br>
winter they have a quarter mile refrigerated tobogan track that is <br>
way cool!  Also, great cross-country skiing trails.  <br>
It is an easy park to get to off main roads - we can get there in 3 <br>
hours from the south suburbs of Chicago....<br>

With all the talk about gatherings, I thought I'd better get my foot<br>
in for the 2006 GL Gathering...<br>
<br>
Since we're bouncing back and forth across the GL region, I'm<br>
presuming somewhere west, say like WI, would be next in line to host<br>
the gathering. (Sorry IN or OH, you're in 2007!) So I'm proposing<br>
that the 2006 GL gathering be in West Bend, WI in late June 2006.<br>
There are a TON of areas to hold the gathering, a TON of spots to hide<br>
boxes, lots of camping and hotel space, and TONS of boxes already in<br>
the area! We got so much here, many of you would probably want to<br>
make it at least a 3-day stay! I already got a theme too, but I'm<br>
open to suggestions. My idea is "Letterboxingfest!" or<br>
just "Boxingfest!" to add to all the "fests" we have here in Milwaukee.<br>
>snip<br>
<br>
In case anyone is wondering, I asked SpringChick to re-open the search<br>
for a spot for the 2006 Gathering (since the trip to Dartmoor was a<br>
bust), so there are no "sour grapes" if WI is not picked for 2006.  I<br>
just want WI (West Bend) to be in the running still :-)<br>
<br>
Remember though, that if the gathering is held the second weekend of<br>
June or earlier, few if any of us teachers will be able to attend.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I certainly consider WI to be a strong candidate for the gathering and have had a couple of other e-mails in addition to your post with this suggestion.  I think the IN proposal also sounds like an excellent idea.  It is my feeling that the face of letterboxing changes throughout the course of the year and to accomodate new people and concentrations of people, it is the most fair to put this up for suggestions and a vote around this time every year for the following spring/summer gathering.  I also think it is important that different people be able to take turns hosting the gathering if they want to.  We are fortunate to have a few people who have put together wonderful events in the past and would be willing to host again as a fall-back, but in my mind, new blood keeps things fresh and makes people feel involved.<br>
<br>
As for the date -- I certainly do understand your feelings about mid-June or later for teachers.  On the other hand -- those of us who are not teachers work a 40 hours week every week, year around and would have to make the necessary arrangements to attend the gathering despite our jobs.  So while this is certainly a consideration, it is not the only consideration as far as the date goes.  When I originally set the date of the gathering to be the end of May in 2003, the intention was for it to stay that weekend.  The following year that got moved to the second week in June primarily for convenience of the event planner.  Now last year it was moved again -- to the 3rd Saturday in June.  In addition to this weekend being a perennial conflict for me personally, last year we ran into several people who were already starting into vacations and therefore not able to come.<br>
<br>
It would be my preference that we choose a weekend and keep it consistent -- but previous attempts to do that have not held, so again I will be putting the date up for a vote.<br>

i was surprised over the summer at how many mini gatherings were planned throughout our region.  lots of opportunities to get together.<br>
it would be nice as sc originally planned to have a permanent date for the 'official' gathering.<br>
volunteers for hosts/hostesses would be easier as well, with an unchanging date.<br>
june is a very busy month due to graduations, weddings, etc.  but with the mini gatherings<br>
that are sure to be planned, another opportunity should present itself within the same year.<br>
just a newbie's opinion!<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
