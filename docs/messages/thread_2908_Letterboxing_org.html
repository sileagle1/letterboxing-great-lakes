LbNA Will Be Back Soon<br>
My apologies to all those who have tried to access Letterboxing North <br>
America to access clues but are locked out. Unfortunately, our web <br>
hosting service has suspended our account because of the increasing <br>
level of demand on the database. We're in the process of upgrading <br>
our service from a shared server to a dedicated service. The downside <br>
is that this increased level of service is significantly more <br>
expensive, at least $45 compared to $8 per month. I've received many <br>
offers to help and would be happy to accept donations via check. You <br>
may send checks to John Chapman, LbNA Server Fund, 28 Birch Road, <br>
Andover, MA 01810. If you'd like to use Paypal, please send the <br>
donation to john@johnsblog.com from Paypal.<br>
