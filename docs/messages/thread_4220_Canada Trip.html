  I was wondering if anyone has letterboxed in Canada, specifically Quebec, Montreal, or Niagara area?  If so, any recomendations on not to miss boxes.  We are travelling by car, and the kids look forward to stretching their legs just as much as we do.<br>

  Thanks for any info you might have,<br>

many in Quebec (13 listings, 17 boxes).  If you go to the LBNA site, <br>
click on the map, then the Canadian flag.  You may want to contact some <br>
of the placers in the areas you will be in to get their input and <br>
recommendations.<br>

Have a great trip!<br>
