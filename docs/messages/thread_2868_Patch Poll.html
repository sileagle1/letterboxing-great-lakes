                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well it seems there is enough interest to put in a new order for <br>
patches, so I created a poll to vote for either the round or <br>
rectangular patch design.  The poll will remain open for ~2 weeks, so <br>
vote before AUG 13.<br>
<br>
I didn't receive any comments about the lettering on the patch.  On <br>
the first patch, we matched what a few other regions have, with <br>
lettering around the circle.  We could do that again, or stay with the <br>
total design that is now on our Group Home page.  If you have an <br>
opinion, please email me or post something.  Otherwise I'll stick with <br>
the lettering as it is on the Home page.<br>
