the synopsis:<br/>
<br/>
October is national popcorn month, national desert month, and national <br/>
pizza month so I am thinking of putting together a mini meet around <br/>
those themes.    It would start off with us meeting for popcorn and a <br/>
movie at our downtown theater, The Majestic.   After the movie we could <br/>
go the ice cream parlor across the street for some letterboxing <br/>
activities, or if I can get the community center at our city hall we <br/>
could go there for letterboxing and everyone pitch in $5 for pizza, or <br/>
the third option go to the community center and everyone brings a <br/>
desert dish to pass.  <br/>
<br/>
I am waiting for the owner/operator of the theater to post his October <br/>
movie showings and then will go from there as far as scheduling, etc.<br/>

  The Majestic has recently been reopened after being kept dormant for nearly a decade.   It was bought by a couple who ran an independant theater in Arizona, they have completely refurbished the building with new seats, new sound, painting, carpet, etc.  <br/>
