<br/>
My time with you has been well spent; I have enjoyed your company and your wit. However, all good things must come to and end. I do have a few parting suggestions for your consideration. <br/>
<br/>
Keep your cell phones away from Wisconsin Hiker; she has a well-known aversion to their usage.<br/>
<br/>
Invite Fungus Woman to weddings. She really knows how to celebrate.<br/>
<br/>
Encourage WFMary to plant a Frankie Furter. Maybe she will split the check with you. <br/>
<br/>
Send Familyof6 more mittens and bacon. They can never have enough of either.<br/>
<br/>
Teach HX6 fungi. It is a marvelous language. <br/>
<br/>
Someone give TJ Mich directions to a real brewery. Tequila will drown misery faster than root beer.<br/>
<br/>
Encourage Socks3 to count to at least 5. There must be some conformity.<br/>
<br/>
Get that Mrs. Doglvrs to knit Barefoot Lucy some purple socks. Maybe then she will stop whining.<br/>
<br/>
Kick off a fund drive for the purchase of neon blinking arrows. These are to be placed over difficult letterboxes for Tiptoe &amp; Tonto.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the shining knight away from Dragon. Every group needs a good riddler.<br/>
<br/>
Till we meet again.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>

Looks like you kept good tabs on all of us. Hopefully your investigations  <br/>
were fruitful in our neck of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Also, many thanks for leaving us with more boxes to find!! Love the picture <br/>

<br/>
May you find many an adventure in the next region you visit.<br/>

any Mystery boxes here?  Oh, well....... maybe next year!  Thanks for all<br/>
that you did distribute across the USA.  I identified 27 clues to boxes, but<br/>
perhaps there were more?  We are still working to solve 5 of them and hope<br/>
to eventually hunt many of them when we eventually visit the various states<br/>
you traveled in.<br/>
<br/>
Have a good rest and hope you enjoyed some tequila on Cinco de Mayo<br/>
yesterday!  (but I'm sure you don't limit yourself to holidays...)<br/>
