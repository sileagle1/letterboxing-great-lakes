<br>
For the GLK 2007 we would like to carve a stamp of one of our <br>
favorite 50's icons.."Roy Rogers and Dale Evans"<br>
<br>
...also a special stamp that will only be available to those <br>
letterboxers who actually were alive in the 50's!  <br>
<br>
We returned earlier this week from Tucson, AZ where we were limited <br>
to finding 13 boxes due to Tonto being ill or having to attend <br>
meetings...But, we were able to meet for an exchange and dinner with <br>
Kristal and Ron, who are prolific LB planters in Arizona...a <br>
highlight of the trip!<br>
<br>
Before we left for AZ we had decided to plant the first of a series <br>
of boxes we want to carve to show our gratitude to letterboxers that <br>
have given us some of our favorite hikes....thus, while in Tucson, we <br>
planted the first of "Tiptoe & Tonto's Favorite Letterboxer" <br>
series...hopefully more to follow...as we do indeed have several <br>
favorites...Oh, we forgot ..it's like children...You ALL are our <br>
favorites!  But, our old eyes couldn't possibly carve that <br>
many....So, we will have to limit it to a few...<br>
<br>
Speaking of the newly planted box..it was a first of sorts for <br>
Tiptoe...Tonto was too weak to go on the hike that we had chosen to <br>
hide the box.  The canyon trail included a 1200 foot elevation <br>
incline...(impressive to this flatlander!)...and about 6 miles round <br>
trip (if you take into account all the wrong turns...)over boulders <br>
and switchbacks with breath-taking scenery...Tiptoe REALLY wanted to <br>
go on this hike...But, no one else was willing (or able)to go with <br>
her...So she did something she's never done before...while Tonto <br>
struggled through meetings one morning she went alone...She did loose <br>
the trail twice which added to the pedometer and caused a bit of <br>
anxiety...But, eventually had an exciting, stamina building workout <br>
and got the box planted.<br>
<br>
That evening, her jello legs were propped up in high heels for a <br>
formal dinner. The conversations before the dinner included people <br>
swapping stories about what they had done during the day...most had <br>
played golf, shopped, spa stuff etc.  When Tiptoe told them she had <br>
hiked up to the Maiden Pools they were surprised...One man informed <br>
her that he had just heard the hotel staff talking about a woman who <br>
had gone up that very trail later in the afternoon and gotten lost <br>
and had to be fetched.  And while up in the canyon she had run into a <br>
mountain lion...Egads!  Tiptoe knew cougars were up there, but <br>
wouldn't allow herself to think about it...too much...she did pray a <br>
lot on the way up and down...and made it back safe and sound!...But, <br>
still wouldn't advise anyone to hike that trail alone...As hard as it <br>
is to believe, it isn't the first time she's done something foolish!<br>
<br>
We also, boxed in snow ...which was an adventure because we started <br>
out in short sleeves!....We highly recommend the Tucson area for <br>
letterboxing adventure..they have a ton of boxes and something for <br>
everyone!<br>

We know several people from our hiking club that spend several weeks to<br>
several months there in the winter.  They have a great hiking club in that<br>
area that has numerous hikes to choose from every week.<br>
<br>
Glad to hear that the brave Tiptoe survived the hike and eluded the<br>
dangerous animals!  Also hope that Tonto is now feeling better.  And I find<br>
it easy to believe that she (and they) may have done something "foolish".<br>
They're letterboxers aren't they??!?  And many of us have read about their<br>
previous escapades....<br>
