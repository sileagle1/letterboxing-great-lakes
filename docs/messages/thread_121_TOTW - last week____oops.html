Everyone else who has posted seems much more thoughtful and organized <br/>
about finding locations than I am. Sometimes it's the park  -- I just <br/>
think there oughtta be a box here somewhere; where can I put one? <br/>
Sometimes I have an idea that cries out to be carved into a stamp  <br/>
hey, that's a cool image, I bet I can make a letterbox to go with it. <br/>
And sometimes it's a theme I can't shake  okay, what other versions <br/>
of "Whose Shoes?" can I make? And finally, sometimes the location <br/>
calls for a box and so I search for the right fit  "The Breakfast  <br/>
Elves" (Snap, Crackle &amp; Pop) *had* to be in the Battle Creek area, <br/>
right?<br/>
I certainly admit that not all of my boxes `make sense' where they <br/>
are, but heck, they're there for searchers to find.<br/>
Now when it comes to actually putting them in a spot, I've learned <br/>
through my own errors not to just put them on the ground with a <br/>
covering of leaves and twigs. SpringChick led the way in W. Mi with <br/>
placements so we learned a lot by seeking hers. While a dry location <br/>
is preferred, I'll happily take a hollow stump since the critters <br/>
don't seem to drag boxes up and out. Under a log with natural sticks <br/>
and leaves for cover works okay around here, too.<br/>
Micros, urban boxes and hitchers are their own special breeds with <br/>
their own special needs.<br/>
Perhaps that's another TOTW?<br/>
Now, time to think about *this week's* TOTW.<br/>
