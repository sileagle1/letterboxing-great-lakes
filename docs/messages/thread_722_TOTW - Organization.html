                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, a filing cabinet.  I haven't gotten that bad yet.  When we started printing off clues, I bought a 1/4" binder from OfficeMax.  Ha!!!  Within a month I went back to buy a 1/2" binder instead.  The 1/2" binder worked well for taking the 46 sets of clues to Michigan with us in August, but not for storing the entire collection.  I now need one of those gigantic 5" binders, or maybe a few 3" binders, one for each state.  (And I've only got printed clues from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan so far!)  Of course, right now the clues are just sort of in a pile that I'm hoping the cats don't knock over.  When they finally get re-filed, I use those re-writable tab dividers, one tab per county.<br>
 <br>
As for our supplies, I think the carving kit and the MasterCarve is at Deedle's house, I've got a box with some empty containers, ink pads, some pink stuff, and other miscellanous box-creation supplies.  So far the cardboard box is working, although we might have to upgrade to a bigger box if we don't get some more plants out there soon...<br>

I love filing cabinets and my favorite is the plastic type that you can stack up and add to as needed.  Another of my favorites is a super size Rubbermaid container (like for storing decorations) filled with many smaller containers, like plastic shoe boxes and other assorted recycled plastic containers.

Like Bess, I am lucky enough to have a sewing room at my house.  <br>
Well, it started off as a "sewing room" on our house plans, but <br>
became a scrapbooking room before the house was finished and, because <br>
we put our family computer in there, the computer room.  Then <br>
letterboxing came along so the sewing machine and the scrapbooking <br>
stuff got pushed aside.  Along one wall I have shelves from floor to <br>
ceiling stocked with plastic see-through Rubbermaid boxes in various <br>
sizes.  To the box side facing the room I attach those plastic <br>
sleeves you use on the binding of three-ring binders and on the <br>
inserts I write what's in the box.  In them I keep sewing projects, <br>
kids crafts, art supplies, etc. - and because they're clear I can see <br>
what's there.  One of the bigger boxes holds my letterbox materials <br>
(containers, labels, logbook materials, camo duct tape, olive-drab <br>
spray paint and wood backers for future rubber stamps).  By my work <br>
table I have a plastic drawer set that holds carving materials, <br>
tools, half-completed stamps, and anything I use often.  In a file <br>
cabinet by my work table I keep three folders: Placing Letterboxes, <br>
Finding Letterboxes and Letterboxing Misc.  So far the system is <br>
working alright, but as an obsessive organizer I change things around <br>
all the time.  Case in point: since I began letterboxing in June '04, <br>
I have changed the pack I keep my stamp, stamp pads, personal logbook <br>
(only one so far) and brush markers in FIVE times!  One of the packs <br>
never even made it to the trail before I found something better!  How <br>
sad is that?<br>
<br>
I find the most important thing in maintaining quick access to any <br>
files or supplies is to file things the way you think.  Seriously.  <br>
When looking for something I've often thought to myself "Where would <br>
I have put a (insert currently misplaced item here)?"  Most people <br>
are consistant in how they think, so if it made sense to you a month <br>
or even a year ago, it probably will today.  Try it and see!<br>

Wow, I had no Idea that the materials for letterboxing could grow to <br>
the collection size you are talking about.  Right now we are keeping <br>
our stuff in a child's lunch box.  Sounds like that won't last for <br>
long.  I did just buy a carving kit and some carving medium the other <br>
day.  I can see there's no room for any of that in the lunch box.  <br>
Fortunately, I have an extra storage bin that I didn't use last <br>
Christmas.  Maybe I better label it for letterboxing now so I will <br>
have it for the near future.  I do have one question that perhaps you <br>
could take a moment to answer however.  I understand why the logbooks <br>
in the boxes contain art quality paper, but...is it possible to buy <br>
them and create a new cover, do you need to make them from scratch???<br>
<br>
THANKS,<br>
Carol<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What you use for the log books in your boxes is a totally a personal<br>
decision -- as simple or elaborate as you want.  The most important<br>
consideration is the size of your box, and paper without lines is nice, but<br>
again that is more a preference than a requirement.<br>
<br>
I have seen boxes that use the little 3"x5" spiral pads of basic lined<br>
paper, others that use strips of adding machine tape stapled together at one<br>
end, index cards (blank or lined) -- spiral bound or held together in a<br>
variety of other ways, a wide assortment of purchased unlined paper<br>
pads/books and then handmade journals.  I enjoy bookmaking and can never<br>
seem to find the right size book for my boxes, so that is why I make most of<br>
mine, but it is certainly not necessary.  As you can see from the list<br>
above, even art quality paper is not a requirement, although some of the<br>
thinner papers tend to allow ink bleed-through..<br>
<br>
A lot of people buy the small sized Strathmore spiral-bound sketch pads and<br>
then recover or embellishment the cover a bit -- adds a touch of creativity<br>
and gives a nice quality paper without having to start from scratch.  A few<br>
options:<br>
<br>
400 series 4"x6" spiral-bound pad (brown cover) - 24 sheets/80 lb.<br>
Mister Art (www.misterart.com) for about 1.50 each<br>
400 series recycled 3.5"x5" spiral-bound pad (green cover) - 100 sheets/60<br>
lb.    Art City (www.artcity.com) for about 1.80 each<br>
300 series 3.5"x5" spiral-bound pad (yellow cover) - 100 sheets/50 lb.<br>
Art City (www.artcity.com) for about 1.80 each.<br>

You know, I wasn't going to add anything to this TOTW, but Spring Chick's post about the sheer amount of supplies possible for logbooks hooked me.  <br>
<br>
When I first started, I did the "store bought notebook" thing, but coming across one of Stampin' Pam's so-beautiful-it-hurts logbooks really made me (once my pride and ego recovered) want to try my hand at making my own logbooks.<br>
<br>
So now, while my stamp medium, carving tools, and ink pads fit into one or two drawers, it is my paper supply that has gotten out.  of.  control.  Seriously, I can't walk by a scrapbook store anymore without popping in and getting five or ten pieces of paper "for a logbook someday".  And don't get me started on the matching first finder certificates.  And the joys of embossing powder.  It's sick.  Oh well, Ford is paying for movers, so *I* don't have to cart all this stuff across the country.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

I have heard of other people who keep clues organized in binders and <br>
I have thought of doing this also.  Until now, I've just printed them <br>
as I go or am planning a trip, etc.  But I have been caught without <br>
the necessary clues a couple of time doing this.<br>
<br>
Couple of questions for you...<br>
<br>
Do you keep the notebook with you always just in case you end up by a <br>
place that has a letterbox?<br>
<br>
How often do you update the clues in your book in case the box status <br>
has changed or even the clue itself has changed from the original <br>
posting?<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">One of the downsides of pre-printing the clues is that if the placer changes clues since you printed the sheet you might not realize it, which makes as you've been doing, SpringChick, printing as you go along, almost the better way to go on one hand, and actually, we're starting to lean more towards that method.<br>
 <br>
When we first started letterboxing we were a little overwhelmed by all the boxes listed for just our area, and of course we wanted to get them all, so I had originally printed all those clues to help us keep track of what we'd found already & what was still out there.  Of course, then people keep adding boxes, which means more clues to then print off before you've found all the already-existing boxes....it's a curse, I tell you! :)<br>
 <br>
Sometimes if we're not sure which boxes we want to hunt for we'll take the entire binder with us, and then pull the clue sheet out once we get to the destination.  This is also good if the first search was shorter than we anticipated, because then we'd have all the clues with us to find another box in the area with the time we had left.  This was how we handled our Michigan trip.  I mapped out all the boxes we'd considered finding on a map, and placed the clues and directions in a binder.  The clues where then all placed in the binder in order of how we'd come across the locations if we started at point A and headed towards point B.  We had almost 50 sets of clues, and as I've reported, since we were only there for 4 days didn't find all the boxes we had clues for, but that set-up really helped us determine, "OK, we just found this box, so which box would it be best to head towards next?"<br>
 <br>
We haven't been taking the entire binder with us recently, more-so because we've gotten into the habit of pre-planning our trips.  We've found the majority of boxes that are within a short drive of our homes, so we've now moved on to the locales that will take at least half an hour drive for us to reach and a little more planning rather than spur of the moment, "Let's go hunt!"  We're going boxing this Sunday, and have to be done by 4 pm (Deedle has band practice at 5), so I went online to see what in our area we haven't found yet that would fit into that time-frame and came up with 4 different "trips" we could do, some multi-boxed, some just one box with a longer hike.  <br>
 <br>
What I'm leaning more-towards, rather than the binder, is a map.  That way I can star on the map where a box is, and then when we've got time to box determine what searches would make a nice trip for the time we've got to box, & then print off clues that way.<br>
 <br>
A binder is good, though, to store those mystery clues that take some time to unravel.  This way you can keep them next to other clues to boxes in the area for the day you can finally make that track.  <br>
 <br>
Hope that helps!<br>

Oh I like the map idea!  I am envisioning a state map on a cork board <br>
with push pins where there are letterboxes yet to find, perhaps one <br>
color for single boxes and another color for multiple boxes.  Would <br>
really help to see where there are concentrations and which cities <br>
are near enough to group together for a day trip.<br>
<br>
I have made up area maps and marked the locations of boxes when I <br>
have done specific trips, such as Chicago, Kalamazoo and the U.P., <br>
but had not thought of using a big map on an ongoing basis.<br>
<br>
I do keep mystery clues in a binder as I work on them, along with all <br>
of the related material one gathers while trying to solve...  and <br>
also WOM clues that I come across and wouldn't be able to get again.<br>
<br>
Very good idea!<br>

shorter than we anticipated, because then we'd have all the clues <br>
with us to find another box in the area with the time we had left.  <br>
This was how we handled our Michigan trip.  I mapped out all the <br>
boxes we'd considered finding on a map, and placed the clues and <br>
directions in a binder.  The clues where then all placed in the <br>
binder in order of how we'd come across the locations if we started <br>
at point A and headed towards point B.  We had almost 50 sets of <br>
clues, and as I've reported, since we were only there for 4 days <br>
didn't find all the boxes we had clues for, but that set-up really <br>
helped us determine, "OK, we just found this box, so which box would <br>
it be best to head towards next?"<br>

because we've gotten into the habit of pre-planning our trips.  We've <br>
found the majority of boxes that are within a short drive of our <br>
homes, so we've now moved on to the locales that will take at least <br>
half an hour drive for us to reach and a little more planning rather <br>
than spur of the moment, "Let's go hunt!"  We're going boxing this <br>
Sunday, and have to be done by 4 pm (Deedle has band practice at 5), <br>
so I went online to see what in our area we haven't found yet that <br>
would fit into that time-frame and came up with 4 different "trips" <br>
we could do, some multi-boxed, some just one box with a longer hike.  <br>
>  <br>
> What I'm leaning more-towards, rather than the binder, is a map.  <br>
That way I can star on the map where a box is, and then when we've <br>
got time to box determine what searches would make a nice trip for <br>
the time we've got to box, & then print off clues that way.<br>

<br>
Like SpringChick said, what you use as a logbook is a personal decision.  Occasionally I get a little irritated when I find a box that has one of those little composition books (lined paper).  But then I remind myself that the image I'm taking away from the box is on a paper of my choice and that if that person doesn't mind lines showing through the image I leave than it shouldn't bother me either.<br>
<br>
As for how to make log books, that's also a personal choice (obviously driven by your personal level of experience in bookbinding and how much effort you want to put into it).  I'm fond of spiral bound 3x5 cards (yes, they're lined, but only on one side).  Last time I went looking for logbooks I couldn't find a good price on spiral bound note cards, so I decided to make my own.  All it took was a hole punch and some binder rings with a piece of cardstock cut to size for a cover.  Takes about half an hour per 50-sheet book.  It's easy for me and they don't look horrible.  <br>

As for those strathmore sketch pads, the covers can easily be flipped so that the cover becomes the inside cover.  Just flip the front cover over to the back and play with the binding a little to remove it, turn it over and reattatch it and you have a nice blank cover to play with.  This would also work with any pad of paper that was not continuously bound.  If my explination doesn't make any sense, go stare at the wire spirals of the pad long enough and you should be able to figure it out (sorry, I'm not great at explaining things).<br>

My hubby, mom and I are just having fun right now finding a bunch.  I love the map idea.  I was thinking though, since we don't always get to go at the same time, we could each have our own colors of pins.  Any other suggestions?!!  Cyndi<br>

  Oh I like the map idea!  I am envisioning a state map on a cork board <br>
  with push pins where there are letterboxes yet to find, perhaps one <br>
  color for single boxes and another color for multiple boxes.  Would <br>
  really help to see where there are concentrations and which cities <br>
  are near enough to group together for a day trip.<br>
<br>
  I have made up area maps and marked the locations of boxes when I <br>
  have done specific trips, such as Chicago, Kalamazoo and the U.P., <br>
  but had not thought of using a big map on an ongoing basis.<br>
<br>
  I do keep mystery clues in a binder as I work on them, along with all <br>
  of the related material one gathers while trying to solve...  and <br>
  also WOM clues that I come across and wouldn't be able to get again.<br>
<br>
  Very good idea!<br>

I used to think I was just one of those people who simply liked <br>
neatness and order; then a couple of people with MSW degrees came <br>
into my life, and I started hearing terms like, "obsessive <br>
compulsive" and "anal retentive".  LOL!!<br>
<br>
Before Bindle Bum and I became live-aboard sailors, I had an entire <br>
art studio. The room had three 6 foot banquet tables always set up, <br>
with more stashed away with the extra chairs, three walls filled <br>
with peg-board shelves holding a couple thousand rubber stamps, <br>
various fibers, paints, glazes and other kinds of supplies, two big <br>
3-drawer tool boxes filled with ink pads and re-inkers, 10 Iris <br>
carts filled with supplies for various types of art, padded hanging <br>
shelves for suede leather, parent sheets and handmade papers, plus <br>
enough tools that Bindle Bum often said I could open my own store.<br>
LOL ... don't get the wrong idea, all that wasn't JUST my stuff. I <br>
was also teaching and needed many of those things for my students.<br>
<br>
Geez oh pizza ... let me tell you, cutting down to just the stuff <br>
that can justify its existence on a 36-foot sailboat was TOUGH!<br>
<br>
Because we do live in such confined quarters most of the year, I've <br>
gotten pretty good at being organized though. Remember, not only <br>
does my 'non-essential stuff' have to be organized, but it also has <br>
to be able to be quickly stowed if we're going to be getting <br>
underway. This has also helped me narrow the focus of my art, craft, <br>
and hobby interests. <br>
<br>
I have to confess though, because my daughter shares my love for all <br>
things artsy, she is currently my co-conspirator.  She is keeping <br>
some of the things I just couldn't part with, stored at her land-<br>
based dwelling for me. Shhhhh .... don't tell Bindle Bum, ok?<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

  We organize our clues with what's evolved into the "Red Dot <br>
Method".  After printing out the clues for a letterbox, we locate it <br>
as close as we can on a map.   (A map can tell you almost everything, <br>
except how to fold it up.)   "Avery" makes 1/4" adhesive, red dots <br>
(and other colors, too) in a roll of 450: pull the paper strip and <br>
out pops a dot.  A dot is placed on the map at the letterbox location <br>
and numbered.  The number is also written on the clues.  Once there <br>
are enough dots to warrant an expedition,  we're on our way.  Of <br>
course, the dots are also very helpful in planning your route and in <br>
knowing which clues to take along.  <br>
  After a trip the dots for the letterboxes we found are removed from <br>
the map.  The dots are pretty sticky and hard to remove sometimes, <br>
but they come off easily using a Q-tip lightly moistened with paint <br>
thinner or something similar.  It's probably a good idea to try the <br>
solvent on an unimportant part of the map first to make sure it <br>
doesn't smear the ink.<br>
  The red dots work quite well for us, but it does require some <br>
preparation time.  And I suppose it confirms our image of <br>
being "dotty" letterboxers.<br>

now get out there and enjoy the hobby!  It's amazing  what all you learn just by <br>
participating and finding other boxes.  My  teammate and I didn't realize how <br>
important double bagging everything was until  we came across a soggy box.  <br>
This week we couldn't find a box a believe it  was because the box was placed <br>
in the winter and some clues were overgrown with  foliage, cause it certainly <br>
couldn't have been our clue deciphering skills!  This made us rethink the  <br>
clues that we made for our first box.  Some may be covered in snow here  pretty <br>
quick.<br>

Worry about handmade logbooks when there is nothing better to  do.  Like late <br>
at night when there is nothing good on TV.<br>
