"There are 5 players that I'm not sure what state they are in:  GG Princess, Gigglegirls, horserider, Revode, RobinHood and MerryMen.<br>
 <br>
Otherwise I think they are distributed like this:<br>
 <br>
3 - IA<br>
0 - IN<br>
20 - IL<br>
24 - MI<br>
4 - MN<br>
2 -OH<br>
14-WI<br>

Interesting that there doesn't seem to be any Indiana players, but we do have some from Iowa instead."<br>

I also noticed I don't seem to get my individual emails in a timely manner.  I think I'll change my settings to daily digest.  I'm going to go back now and see what I've missed.<br>
