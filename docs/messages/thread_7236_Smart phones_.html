What Letterboxing apps would you suggest?<br>
<br>
Here are the ones that were suggested on the letterboxing boards. I looked at then but haven't downloaded any of them yet.<br>
<br>
Clue Tracker wonderful has both Atlas Quest and LBNA.- $4.99 THE REVIEWS WERE MIXED ON THIS ONE<br>
<br>
BoxRadar (combines AQ and LBNA),- I COULD NOT FIND IT ON MY iPHONE<br>
<br>
CompassPro,- $1.99 FOUND IT BUT NOT SURE WHAT IT WILL REALLY DO FOR ME<br>
<br>
Endomon (tracks how far I have hiked),)- I COULD NOT FIND IT ON MY iPHONE<br>
<br>
Columbus and c:geo to find out if there are any geocaches near where I want to find something, - DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THIS ONE YET<br>
 <br>
Formula Solver and GCC to help with decoding on the trail - ),)- I COULD NOT FIND IT ON MY iPHONE<br>
<br>
All Trails to find more trails, - FREE, FOUND IT MIGHT BE USEFUL<br>
<br>
Brightest Flashlight - FREE, FOUND IT BUT IT'S NOT BRIGHT AT ALL. IT JUST USES YOUR MAIN SCREEN AS THE LIGHT SOURCE. THERE ARE MUCH BETTER ONES OUT THERE. THE ONE NICE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT GIVES YOU SOME COLOR CHOICES FOR NIGHR VISION, i>e> RED, GREEN, BLUE.I AM CURRENTLY USING THE LATTER-DAY APPS FLASHLIGHT. IT USED YOU CAMERA FLASH AS THE LIGHT SORUCE. <br>
<br>
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?<br>
<br>
NORTHSTARR<br>

I just got my first smart phone. It's the iPhone from AT&T. <br>
<br>
What Letterboxing apps would you suggest?<br>
<br>
Here are the ones that were suggested on the letterboxing boards. I looked<br>
at then but haven't downloaded any of them yet.<br>
<br>
Clue Tracker wonderful has both Atlas Quest and LBNA.- $4.99 THE REVIEWS<br>
WERE MIXED ON THIS ONE<br>
<br>
BoxRadar (combines AQ and LBNA),- I COULD NOT FIND IT ON MY iPHONE<br>
<br>
CompassPro,- $1.99 FOUND IT BUT NOT SURE WHAT IT WILL REALLY DO FOR ME<br>
<br>
Endomon (tracks how far I have hiked),)- I COULD NOT FIND IT ON MY iPHONE<br>
<br>
Columbus and c:geo to find out if there are any geocaches near where I want<br>
to find something, - DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THIS ONE YET<br>
<br>
Formula Solver and GCC to help with decoding on the trail - ),)- I COULD NOT<br>
FIND IT ON MY iPHONE<br>
<br>
All Trails to find more trails, - FREE, FOUND IT MIGHT BE USEFUL<br>
<br>
Brightest Flashlight - FREE, FOUND IT BUT IT'S NOT BRIGHT AT ALL. IT JUST<br>
USES YOUR MAIN SCREEN AS THE LIGHT SOURCE. THERE ARE MUCH BETTER ONES OUT<br>
THERE. THE ONE NICE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT GIVES YOU SOME COLOR CHOICES<br>
FOR NIGHR VISION, i>e> RED, GREEN, BLUE.I AM CURRENTLY USING THE LATTER-DAY<br>
APPS FLASHLIGHT. IT USED YOU CAMERA FLASH AS THE LIGHT SORUCE. <br>
<br>
WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST?<br>

I also have an Otter box heavy duty case since I drop things all the time.<br>
My nephew told me it made me cool to have an otter box.  <br>

<br>
I'm a little biased but I recommend Clue Tracker.<br>
My husband and I wrote it because we wanted an app that could search both LbNA and AQ and save letterbox clues for access when we didn't have cell phone coverage.<br>
<br>
We have continued to improve the app over time.  The current version (which has only one review right now) includes many features including the capability to record finds and to adjust the location of a letterbox.<br>
<br>
If you have specific concerns about Clue Tracker, please let me know. We are always happy to get feedback whether for new features or for reporting problems.<br>
<br>
Also note that reviews and ratings on Apple's App Store tend towards the negative side because historically Apple has only prompted people to rate apps after they delete an app.<br>
