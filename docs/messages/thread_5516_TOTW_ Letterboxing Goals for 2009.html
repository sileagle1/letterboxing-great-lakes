Do you have specific letterboxing goals for 2009? <br/>
<br/>
The Atomic Beans hope to finally reach P100 F1000 X200....and maybe get <br/>
up to boxing in about 15 states. <br/>
<br/>
Those are our goals for the moment, but we might have to revise the <br/>
goals to include a few larger planting missions (since we've recently <br/>
had to remove a few of our older boxes).<br/>
<br/>
How about you?<br/>
