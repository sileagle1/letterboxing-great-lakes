Is there something about the Point's location that we all should know...for<br/>
safety's sake, perhaps?<br/>

<br/>
Sounds good...I will have to relook. The ones I have found so far<br/>
are:<br/>
"Over the Creek"<br/>
Starved Rock Lodge #3 "History"<br/>
The one for Post and Posts I was unable to find it according to the<br/>
clues, believe it may have gone missing in the tornado. Our radio<br/>
system tower for work is the one south of there and we lost some<br/>
equipment on "black tuesday"<br/>
The ones I attempted and couldn't find were:<br/>
SR Buffet, St. Loius and Point.<br/>
Stargazer I wasn't really sure about if you have to go down the<br/>
stairs or not (if you haven't been there recently, the stairs are<br/>
closed and beign rebuilt)<br/>
Didn't really put much effort into the Point. Because of work,<br/>
there are some issues with point about why you shouldn't be<br/>
there..but that is a different story.<br/>
