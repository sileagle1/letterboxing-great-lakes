Hey, we can do that!!!  So after sweet-talking Deedle Bug, we're going!  I'll be making our camping reservations soon.  Woo hoo!!<br/>

(286), thanks!  This will be our first LB event and we are looking<br/>
forward to many miles of boxing.<br/>
Who knows the answer to these questions?<br/>
1)Do we need to register somewhere.<br/>
2)Are event boxes still needed? We carve! Other ways to help?<br/>
