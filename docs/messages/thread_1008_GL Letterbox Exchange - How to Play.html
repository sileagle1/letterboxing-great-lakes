Okay, the theme has been decided -- Hometown Landmarks!  The <br/>
letterbox you create should be loosely tied to a landmark in the <br/>
city/county/state where you live.  It would be nice if you include <br/>
brief information about the landmark inside the logbook, but this is <br/>
not necessary.  This is a great theme and should produce a really <br/>
cool series of boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Specific details of how the exchange will work can be found in <br/>
message #2680.  If you would like to be a part of this group project, <br/>
please e-mail me offlist with the following information:<br/>
<br/>
Name<br/>
Trail Name<br/>
Mailing Address (this will be given only to the person who will be <br/>
sending you a box)<br/>
E-Mail Address<br/>
<br/>
The original date to sign-up by was 2/5, but since we had the tie-<br/>
breaker voting, I will change that to 2/19.  Once the sign-ups are <br/>
in, I will make random assignments as to whom you will be making a <br/>
box for and will let everyone know by 2/22.  The person whom you will <br/>
be receiving a box from will remain a surprise until your box arrives <br/>
in the mail.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes will need to be mailed to your recipient by 4/15/05.  If you <br/>
only have time for one letterbox between now and then -- please <br/>
consider doing a box for the Great Lakes Gathering first as it is not <br/>
my intention to compete for boxes with the that event.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to post to the list <br/>
or e-mail me privately.  Thanks for playing!<br/>
