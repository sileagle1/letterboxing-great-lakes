                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for your concern, Ish. :)  But the snow should be pretty <br/>
much cleared off the roads before Saturday morning (it better be!).  <br/>
And if I run into trouble, I have family (as in my ENTIRE family) in <br/>
Oconomowoc.  Those of you familiar with SE Wisconsin may know where <br/>
that is.  So at least I will have someone to call.  And since I spend <br/>
4 years driving back and forth from SE Wisconsin to college in NW <br/>
Indiana, and all the subsequent years driving back for family <br/>
gatherings, I am VERY familiar with the drive up there. :)<br/>
