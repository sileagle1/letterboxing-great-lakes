sorry for not getting replies out.<br/>
<br/>
Since moving back to the boat our desktop computer has gone into <br/>
hibernation.  Bindle Bum has needed our wi-fi laptop with him while he <br/>
is out of town on business, which means I'm at the mercy of public <br/>
library internet access.  The local Library has had trouble with their <br/>
T1 line for a month and it seems like every time I ride my bike up <br/>
there the internet has been down.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that we'll have DSL at the marina by the middle of <br/>
next week.  Not that we promise to reply any more promptly, but at <br/>
least you'll know it's probably because we're sailing (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
