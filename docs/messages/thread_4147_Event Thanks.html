                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to also offer a belated THANKS! to everyone involved with <br>
the 5th Annual Great Lakes Gathering!<br>
<br>
We got to Columbus later than expected Friday night, but managed to <br>
get our boxes hid in the last bit of daylight.  Unfortunately we <br>
forgot our compass and should NOT have guessed on directions, <br>
especially in the dark.  We'll have better clues posted on LBNA soon.<br>
<br>
After hiding our boxes we had a little bit of time to attend the Sock <br>
Hop.  We enjoyed meeting a few Ohio boxers and doing some exchanges <br>
before the "big day".  Very nice event stamp for this get-together!  <br>
Sorry we didn't have a chance to be there longer to enjoy the <br>
festivities.  <br>
<br>
The next day we arrived at the shelter early to drop off copies of <br>
our clues and pickup our packet of other clues.  M&X8 and Eagle Eyes <br>
sure had things organized!  An amazing attention to detail made <br>
everything go smoothly  a major feat with so many people in <br>
attendance.  We spent most of the day out on the trails, with a few <br>
stops back at the picnic area for snacks, chatting, exchanges and <br>
tickling baby Emily's feet.  It was great to see many of the boxers <br>
we've met at past events including Azobox, the Cottontails, Wormy <br>
Wanderers, TJMich, Team Rabbit, P Granola, the crazy Hiker Babe, <br>
Nature Nerd and River Rat, Kimono Girl & Flying Dragon (& dogs), <br>
Atom118 & CoffeeBeans, Fermont, Christmas Elves, Funguswoman, Doglvrs <br>
and Speedsquare,   I think we had 7 from Wisconsin attend the event <br>
this year.  We also enjoyed meeting some Ohio boxers and added many <br>
new exchanges to our book.  Hopefully we'll see them at future events <br>
so we can start remembering what names go with who!  It's always such <br>
a whirlwind at these big events  It takes us a few times to really <br>
remember people.<br>
<br>
We made it back to the shelters for a delicious potluck dinner, the <br>
group photo and the bagpipes.  What a nice way to end the day!<br>
<br>
Sunday we were out on the trails again and met a few other boxers <br>
along the way.  Imagine our surprise when we did the 50s Jukebox <br>
series that there were still a few prizes left!  That meant we <br>
enjoyed some good 50s hits as we drove around on Sunday and Monday.  <br>
What a creative idea Safari Man!!  <br>
<br>
We finished all the boxes hidden for the event on Sunday and hunted <br>
for some older ones later in the day.  We also did several boxes in <br>
the area on Monday before we returned home that night.  We'll be <br>
sending "Contact the Placer" messages in the near future.  Some <br>
highlights on Monday were seeing a bluebird and visiting the rose <br>
gardens which were in full bloom!<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone that contributed boxes to the event and a special <br>
thanks to the hosts for putting together such a terrific event!<br>

I second WI Hiker and Martini Man's words. I love Safari Man's first <br>
finder prize; an excellent, creative idea that made me enjoy the event <br>
all the way home! Thanks again Safari Man.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a lot of fun making the 50s Jukebox series and I am glad that those<br>
who visited it enjoyed it ....in spite of the ticks, ivy and either<br>
intense heat or sudden downpour.  I also enjoyed meeting all of the<br>
boxers from around the area and look forward to a return engagement.    I<br>
would also like to say welcome to Barefoot Lucy and I can vouch for her<br>
credibility and trustworthyness based upon previous boxing activities we<br>
shared.  She is right up there with Hikers and Hounds and there could be<br>
no way that she could be up to foul play......I think.  Any way unless<br>
she has changed her virtuous ways from whence I last talked to her.  <br>
Time will tell.<br>
Thanks for the thanks, you all,<br>
