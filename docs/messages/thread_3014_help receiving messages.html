I think it is a Comcast issue (at least in some areas of MI).  I see there are several Comcast members who are currently bouncing.  I have Comcast also and have been having a lot of problems getting group messages this week also.  I've been on the phone with Comcast support several times because apparently they are bouncing the Yahoo! groups messages back.  For me it is doubly bad because they were also bouncing back all of the messages coming to me from my domain provider (all of the @letterbox-mi.com messages).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the bounce-back message that Yahoo! gets indicates that the messages are being blocked because of abuse and that Yahoo! is on some Comcast blacklist.  One person at Comcast told me that I should have Yahoo! submit a request to Comcast to be removed from their blacklist.  Excuse me?  Are you kidding?  Like you can actually get in touch with anyone at Yahoo! and like they are going to bother with submitting blacklist removal requests to every ISP that doesn't like their SPAM policies.  Another support person indicated that perhaps the problem was because there were too many message coming through (between Yahoo! and my account).  I asked how many was too many?  Is there a limit on how many messages I can receive in a day?  No answer.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, after about the 4th person who really had no clue what was going on or what to tell me as far as getting it fixed, I got somebody to admit that they had made upgrades to their e-mail filters last weekend and were in the process of *tweaking* them.  Apparently they put in stringent filters and then open things up as people complain.<br/>
<br/>
Mine has actually been pretty good the last two or so, so they may have gotten the tweaking right.  I will send all of the bouncing Comcast group members a reactiviation request and when you get it, just click on the link in the message and it should be okay now.<br/>
