                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  I've been lurking for awhile and trying to get up to speed as to <br>
what discussions are going on here.  I've been letterboxing for about <br>
a month now and have found 17 letterboxes.  This weekend I will be on <br>
the lookout for a good place to place a letterbox.  <br>
<br>
I have some questions that I hope you will be able to help with.  <br>
When I first started letterboxing I was so excited that I just used a <br>
store bought stamp when I stamped in a logbook.  Now I have made my <br>
own stamp with a picture and my name on it.  How do you feel about <br>
people restamping logbooks?  My second question is about etiquette.  <br>
Is it okay to place a letterbox in the same park as someone else?  I <br>
know not in the same area but maybe on a different trail or on the <br>
other side of the park?<br>
<br>
I look forward to hearing from you!<br>

<br>
1.  If you want to, feel free to restamp the books you already found and add<br>
a note that you now have your "real" stamp.  I've seen people stamped in<br>
more than once - perhaps because they have a new stamp, are checking their<br>
box, visiting again with friends or whatever.<br>
<br>
2.  I generally think it's nice to have a few boxes in a location,<br>
especially if it is a larger park.  Makes the trip all the more worthwhile!<br>

Concerning point number 2, it is nice, esp. if it's a bigger park or a park you need to pay to get into, to have a few boxes to look for.  Be careful, however, in the case of boxes such as mystery boxes.  We've discussed on this list before how the placement of a regular letterbox around a mystery box can sometimes compromise the mystery box's mystery.<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree about with the concensus on the restamping question.<br>
 <br>
As for placing boxes in the same park, I would suggest (and it's just that, a suggestion) that you contact the placer of the original box before placing your own.  I've been on a few hunts where one person's box accidentally ruined a riddle from another person's box. <br>
 <br>
Aside from that, with a little courtesy, you may make an ally who will check in on your box while doing maintainence on yours.  One of my boxes has another box, by a different person, in the same park, and we'll check on each other's boxes.<br>
 <br>
But I'm all for multiple boxes in parks.  Like Wisconcin Hiker said, more boxes in one location makes for a good outing for me!<br>
