Woo hoo!  Bingo time!  Oh great Bingo Master, I do have to point out that "The Cat Whisperer" is listed in Column B and Column I.  It is entirely possibly that Ohio has two boxes with this name, but I thought I should mention it anyway.  I mean, not like I'd known, I've only boxed in Hawaii this year :-D<br/>

(OK, we also found a few boxes in Columbus, Ohio, this past July, too, but none of them were called The Cat Whisperer.)<br/>
