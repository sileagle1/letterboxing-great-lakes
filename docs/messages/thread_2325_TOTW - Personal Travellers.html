I am considering retiring one of my PT's now, but I wanted to hear from the group.  Do you <br/>
carry more than one?  Do you retire them ever?  How stingy are you if someone attempts <br/>

  Looking to the future....  I don't think I will retire it, I love it so much  :-)<br/>
  I think I will be pretty generous with mine also, in my opinion, what good is it if it just sits in my bag and I carry it around!<br/>
  I will probably carve more travellers in the future, but for now I'm excited about sharing this one at events this summer!<br/>
