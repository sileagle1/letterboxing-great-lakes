                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have finished drafting the "flyer" which will be distributed to<br/>
patrons at the Bristol Faire.  I'm hoping to talk them in to only<br/>
having them available at some place less trafficked than the front<br/>
gate (like the Kid's Kingdom, or the Bristol shops) so they don't get<br/>
loads of attention.<br/>
<br/>
Before I send the copy to the faire management, I would like input<br/>
from the letterboxing community.  If you have nothing better to do<br/>
today, look at the file in the "FILES" section and email me any<br/>
comments/suggestions.  Keep in mind that I have limited room to<br/>
provide information, and the order that it is in makes it into a<br/>
folded pamphlet.  Also note that there is no reference to letterboxing<br/>
or LBNA on purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

The flyer looks great!<br/>
<br/>
These boxes and the rest of the other boxes awesome, too.  I wish I <br/>
lived out there.  Although it's not all that far of a drive, maybe I <br/>
can convince someone to go to the Faire out there!  With that many <br/>
boxes, how does anyone have time to do Faire stuff though?  They must <br/>
go back more than one time each summer.<br/>
