I've updated the Bingo Players database to show the free space words<br>
that people chose.  There were 4 players from whom I did not receive<br>
an e-mail with a free space choice.  They were automatically given<br>
their center space as the free space, except one person who already<br>
had the center square crossed off so they were given the one above the<br>
center.<br>

If I have you down for the wrong word or if one of the 4 players given<br>
the default sent me an e-mail that I didn't get, please contact me<br>
offlist and we'll get it straightened out.<br>
