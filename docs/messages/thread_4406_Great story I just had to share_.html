       MARINES AND TAMPONS (A GREAT STORY)<br/>
<br/>
                      Tampons to the rescue in Iraq!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       Don't worry, it's a good story, and worth reading. It's even<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       humorous in parts. It's from the mother of a Marine in Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
           My son told me how wonderful the care packages we had<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         sent them were and wanted me to tell everyone thank you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         He said that one guy we'll call Marine X, got a girl care<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
          package and everyone was giving him a hard time. My son<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         said, "Marine X got some really nice smelling lotion and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       everyone really likes it, so every time he goes to sleep they<br/>
      steal it from him." I told my son I was really sorry about the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
          mistake, and if he wanted I would send Marine X another<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
          package. He told me not to worry about Marine X because<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       every time I send something to him, Marine X thinks it's for<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                                 him too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         He said when my husband and I sent the last care package,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         Marine X came over to his cot, picked up the box, started<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         fishing through it, and said, "What'd we get this time?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        My son said they had the most fun with Marine X's package.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        He said he wasn't sure who we were sending the pack to, but<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       the panties were size 20, and he said one of the guys got on<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        top of the Humvee and jumped off with the panties over his<br/>
        head and yelled, "Look at me, I'm an Airborne Ranger!" One<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       of the guys attached the panties to an antenna and it blew in<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      the wind like a windsock. He said it entertained them for quite<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                                  awhile.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       Then of course.......they had those tampons. When he brought<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       this up, my imagination just went running, but he continued.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        My son said they had to go on a mission and Marine X wanted<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       the Chap-Stick and lotion for the trip. He grabbed a bunch of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         the items from his care package and got in the Humvee. As<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
         luck would have it he grabbed the tampons too, and my son<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     said everyone was teasing him about "not forgetting his feminine<br/>
                            hygiene products."<br/>
<br/>
         He said things went well for a while, then the convoy was<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
           ambushed and a Marine was shot. He said the wound was<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      pretty clean, but it was deep. He said they were administering<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     first aid but couldn't get the bleeding to slow down, and someone<br/>
       said, "Hey! Use Marine X's tampons!" My son said they put the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
       tampon in the wound. At this point my son profoundly told Me,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        "Mom, did you know that tampons expand?" ("Well....yeah!")<br/>
<br/>
      They successfully slowed the bleeding until the guy got better<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        medical attention. When they went to check on him later The<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        surgeon told them, "You guys saved his life. If you hadn't<br/>
        stopped that bleeding he would have bled to death." My Son<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        said, "Mom, the tampons sent by the Marine Moms by mistake<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                          saved a Marine's life."<br/>
<br/>
    At this point I asked him, "Well, what did you do with the rest of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      the tampons?" He said, "Oh, we divided them up and we all have<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     them in our flak jackets, and I kept two for our first aid kit."<br/>
<br/>
      I am absolutely amazed by the ingenuity of our Marines. I can't<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     believe that something that started out as a mistake then turned<br/>
      into a joke, ended up saving someone's life. My sister said she<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    doesn't believe in mistakes. She believes God had a plan all along.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      She believes "that female care package" was sent to Marine X to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                             save our Marine.<br/>
<br/>
     Either way, our efforts have boosted the morale of many Marines,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    provided much needed items for our troops, AND saved the life of a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Marine! God bless every one of you for your efforts and hard work,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   and God bless our Marines, Army, Navy, Air Force and all our military<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                            service personnel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                    GOD BLESS AMERICA AND KEEP IT SAFE!<br/>

Although that does remind me of another story...back<br/>
in  high school, my friend's older brother was going<br/>
to play a prank on a female co-worker of his and told<br/>
us he was going to "tampon her car" - we just kind of<br/>
blankly stared at him as my friend asked him, "Just<br/>
how are you going to attach them?" thinking he was<br/>
going to tie them onto the car somehow with the<br/>
strings.  He looked at us and said, "Duh, you pull<br/>
that strip off of them and stick them on!"<br/>
<br/>
My friend then had to patiently explain to her older<br/>
brother the difference between a pad and a tampon. <br/>
And he was an honor student, too!<br/>
