trying to get the Grail series done.  But I'd help WI!....<br/>
<br/>
New GL project for the winter months-<br/>
<br/>
1) Each state in the GL region chooses a fairy tale to modify so it<br/>
has a letterboxing twist.  (I would suggest WI NOT choose Alice in<br/>
Wonderland...)<br/>
<br/>
2) A boxer in the state agrees to re-write the story keeping in mind<br/>
it will be a children's picture book - each page of text would have a<br/>
picture with it - including the cover.<br/>
<br/>
3) Once the modified story is complete, the text is posted online and<br/>
boxers in the state sign-up to create a stamp image/picture for each<br/>
page.  All stamps must be of a uniform size.  These individuals would<br/>
also complete a box for their stamp.<br/>
<br/>
4) Using the uniform stamp size and the text, printable log-booklets<br/>
are created.  I'm thinking a pdf file that one could print off and put<br/>
together to make a book to use in the collection of the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
5) A designated boxer in the state collects all of the boxes and hides<br/>
them in one main location in order as a series.  Clues and hiding<br/>
location should relate to the theme of the book.<br/>
<br/>
6)Finders of the boxes stamp into the log-booklets to create their own<br/>
picture books!<br/>
<br/>
7) Picture books are then used for bedtime stories for children of<br/>
letterboxers, or for reading time in classrooms, etc.<br/>
<br/>
With the wealth of great writers we have in the GL region (Sara of LL,<br/>
Acorn, Deedle, etc.) and all the great artists/carvers as well, I'd<br/>
think this would turn out pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this idea came to my mine while my mom and I discussed the<br/>
current display of artwork in the fine arts building at Wisconsin<br/>
Lutheran College (where the Never-ending Story box is - the box is in<br/>
the Library at WLC, the fine arts center is diagonally next door).  A<br/>
series of woodblock carvings and other art were created for a book and<br/>
they are on display.  Although the book is not necessarily a<br/>
children's book, the art is pretty good.  If you're in the area during<br/>
the day you might want to stop by at check it out.<br/>
