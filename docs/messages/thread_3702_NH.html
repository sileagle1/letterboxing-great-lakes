Public lands are exactly that, public. If it's ok for<br/>
IdiotRunningForOffice to slather their garbage all over the lamp<br/>
posts, the lawn areas, and anything that isn't actively moving, how is<br/>
it that I'm a criminal for 'playing a game'?  <br/>
<br/>
Sure, someone else could pick up my item and discard it if they think<br/>
they're 'maintaining' that same public land. It's a risk I take. <br/>
Accepted and moved beyond. Next!<br/>

Why does muggle's overreaction to a simple plastic box one-up my quiet<br/>
drug-free swap with a stranger? Shouldn't the *muggle* be the one<br/>
being warned over blowing things out of proportion?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, planting behind a national landmark is stupid. Yes, leaving a box<br/>
velcro'd to someone's power distributor should probably be rethought.<br/>
Yes, something emitting beeps and blinking lights is most likely going<br/>
to get attention of a negative variety. I'm not advocating idiocy.<br/>

How can anyone justify calling the bomb squad for a .5cup lock-n-lock<br/>
covered in camo?  Wait..didn't I say something about idiocy a moment ago?<br/>

<br/>
I was planning to hide an indoor letterbox where I work, but I'm rethinking that idea now.  We know that a lock-n-lock covered in camo is a letterbox, but since most people don't know what a letterbox is, they would see something that looks suspicious, wrapped in camo tape and think it's a bomb.   Why take a chance.  Letterboxes were originally hidden in nature, so indoor boxes or boxes hidden on federal property (like a postal box) might not be the way letterboxing was intended.  I'm planning to stick to trees, bushed, rocks and other nature crevices.  I don't need the FBI busting down my door in the middle of the night asking me questions.  I like to sleep at night.  <br/>
