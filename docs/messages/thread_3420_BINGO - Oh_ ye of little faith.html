So true, so true!  As I noted yesterday, all the GENERAL terms were <br>
pulled before those nice uniques ones we had chosen.  Even though <br>
Martini Man & I have found a lot of boxes (but not many of those that <br>
SpringChick put on the list THIS year! Did she purposely choose some <br>
boxes that no one has found yet?? EVIL!), been to a lot of events, <br>
etc, we were in about LAST place in 2005's Bingo game.<br>

Did you say *you* were in last place? HAH!!<br>
I s'pose we'd have to check in with SC, but I'll bet we gave you a run<br>
for your money. And, like you, this year I can hardly find a box on<br>
the list that I've stamped into.<br>
Do you think they are all 'real' boxes? Hmmmm<br>
<br>
Are you gonna play this round?<br>
How about a side-side wager?<br>

But, We're not sure we'll have time to play this year because after <br>
looking at the list of letterboxes and having none...zero...zip of <br>
them....Tiptoe is insisting Tonto take her out immediately to search <br>
for boxes... His response...<br>
<br>
"What? You've dragged me all over the country finding close to 500 <br>
boxes and we haven't gotten ANY of those listed???" <br>
 <br>
"Nope...not one!"<br>
<br>
Tiptoe read the general terms to Tonto and let him pick...He <br>
chose "strangulation"...finding it a better suited term instead <br>
of "triangulation"!<br>
Bring on the BINGO!<br>

Yep, we'll be playing again.  Always the hope of "the thrill of <br>
victory", but ready once again for "the agony of defeat".<br>
<br>
We're up for a side-side wager, maybe we could "win" by "losing"!  What <br>
did you have in mind?  Who has the most uncrossed out squares when the <br>
game is over?<br>
