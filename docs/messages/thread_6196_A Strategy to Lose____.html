                    <div class="plaintext-content">Monkey Journal? I believe that's one of SC creations. As for the strategy to lose, it's really not very hard. There are two ways:<br/>
<br/>
1. You didn't choose any of the right words<br/>
2. You chose the right words, but they weren't called.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps. ;) Anyhow, as a past loser myself, you will find that bribing doesn't work...or VOODOO dolls! It seems that our lovely Ms. Springchick is immune to both. However, you may want to offer praises to last years self imposed Bingo Queen (I'm not telling you who it is....but let's just say we tiptoe around the subject, ok?)That may help. If it doesn't, ask her about her adventures in TV Land. Anyhow, You're in for a treat with the s...l...o...w...e....s...t.... bingo game EVER! At least there is some lively discussion with it. <br/>
<br/>
ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY SPRINGCHICK!!!! (SC...Will this help my chances????)<br/>

&gt; Pretty please, can anyone tell me that the general terms of "Monkey Journal", "Purple Skull Guy" and "Centipede" mean?  I tried looking them up in LBNA and AQ's glossaries, but didn't find them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for strategy, I was just going to go alphabetical, but that would mean not using my own trail name or Mary's Mugs:Kentucky, my box that as far as I know no one has found yet.  Is there a strategy to lose?  The prize were SO generous last year, that I'm hoping others get the thrill of recieving a box full of letterboxing booty. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yup, a strategy to lose.  When I used to work with kids as a school social worker, I figured out ways to lose at various games like Uno.  I am very competitive when it comes to card and board games, and figured it was not kind to or good for the kids if I kept winning game after game after game.  And last year, I won two of the bingo games, including full card.  But maybe that was beginner's luck?<br/>
