<br>
The Holiday Survivor Mini Meet will take place on Sunday, January 21 from 1pm to approximately 5pm at the Urbana Free Library.<br>
<br>
Do not show up at the library at noon...they will not be open yet and you will have to wait in the parking lot (or perhaps visit some of the local boxes...that would be a better idea) until 1pm.  I'm not sure who added this event to the calandar, but they put the wrong times in by mistake and I've been too lazy to go see if I can change them.<br>
<br>
And as long as we're talking about official mini meet stuff here, I would like to announce that I will be doing the logbook making workshop (monkey journals) at 1:30pm.  I will have materials and supplies, so you don't have to worry about bringing your own.  However, if you would like to bring a ruler so that we have less time waiting on that particular tool (I will have a few, but not many) that would be great.  Also, I will be using rubber cement...so if you would rather not work with rubber cement please bring your own similarly durable glue (elmers school glue would probably work, but I just don't think it's quite strong enough).<br>
