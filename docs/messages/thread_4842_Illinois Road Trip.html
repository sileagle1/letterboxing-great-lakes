The end of a long winter is in sight and spring is just around the<br>
corner. Most of us are more than ready to brush the dust off our<br>
backpacking gear and hit the trails. A couple summers ago a number<br>
of boxers participated in a special letterbox series , "Around the<br>
World in 80 Days" by Azobox and Springchick. It was an adventure<br>
that took us to some great spots around Michigan. That series was the<br>
inspiration for this Illinois Road Trip. <br>
Illinois is rich in history and is just brimming with fun places to <br>
visit. With spring breaks quickly approaching this is the perfect <br>
time to hit the open road in search of some really cool Illinois <br>
attractions. The road trip will take you to museums, restaurants, <br>
cemeteries, historical sites and some really quirky spots.<br>
There are 45 boxes placed all around Illinois that will lead you to<br>
some amazing places. About half of the boxes have been placed just <br>
for the road trip, the others were already existing boxes that were <br>
incorporated into the road trip. Your mission is to collect the <br>
images from each box on a special log map that will be mailed to you. <br>
When you fill in the log with all 45 of the required stamps you will <br>
mail it back to me and you will get the "King of the Illinois Road" <br>
stamp mailed to you. If you are interested, you need to e-mail me <br>
with your home address so I can send you your copies of the Illinois <br>
Road Trip log, then you need to go to: yahoo groups  Ilroadtrip. <br>
(that's capital i - lowercase L) and request an invitation. Once I <br>
hear from you, I will send you an invitation and you will have access <br>
to all the road trip information. Once you have your log you can hit <br>
the road!<br>
This is not a race, there is no time limit because of the distances <br>
involved.  If you can't get to them all, it's ok.  <br>
My thanks to all who have contributed to this series, there are some<br>
great places I can't wait to go and visit myself!<br>

  Dear Great Lakes Boxers,<br>
  The end of a long winter is in sight and spring is just around the<br>
  corner. Most of us are more than ready to brush the dust off our<br>
  backpacking gear and hit the trails. A couple summers ago a number<br>
  of boxers participated in a special letterbox series , "Around the<br>
  World in 80 Days" by Azobox and Springchick. It was an adventure<br>

  cemeteries, historical sites and some really quirky spots.<br>
  There are 45 boxes placed all around Illinois that will lead you to<br>
