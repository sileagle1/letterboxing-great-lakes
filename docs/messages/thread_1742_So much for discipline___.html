                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, we did do a pretty good job this afternoon of scouting out some <br/>
preliminary box hiding spots for the HH Gathering (marked with <br/>
numbered poker chips as temporary "place holders").  We probably have <br/>
about half of what we'll need identified and since friends Merlin &amp; <br/>
Ardea have graciously offered to assist with this task, they have also <br/>
scouted out some others. <br/>
<br/>
Since we were feeling rather pleased with our progress and "since we <br/>
were right in the the area...", we succumbed to the beckoning boxes <br/>
and found Mathman 15 &amp; 16.<br/>
<br/>
I'm now back on task, printing maps for Portland area boxes (and yes, <br/>
BindleBabe, making plans with Funhog to meet &amp; eat at that great <br/>
brewpub with garlic fries you mentioned to us!)<br/>
