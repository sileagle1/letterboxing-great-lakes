If my stamp looks better in a certain color, I add a note with color suggestions.<br>

  You can add your clues to either or both of those sites.  (Or neither if you want to distribute them by WOM).  I put them on both, just in case one or the other goes down.<br>

<br>
I will jump in and respond with just a few of my thoughts and others <br>
will add comments as well.  You will get as many different replies as <br>
there are letterboxers and that is just one of the beauties of this hobby. <br>
<br>
The first suggestion many of us would make is to take some time to do <br>
some homework by checking out the many enlightening resources available <br>
to you on the home pages of both AQ and LbNA.  Under "What is new?" on <br>
the AQ home page, there is a wonderful new section explaining so many <br>
aspects of letterboxing in detail. <br>
<br>
At the bottom of the LbNA site, there is a glossary of terms that really <br>
helps as well, but these are just the very, very beginning of quite an <br>
educational adventure.  My own interests have taken many different turns <br>
since I found my first box in March of 2004 and that is what keeps this <br>
going for so long! <br>
<br>
A few things I think we all agree upon is that letterboxers must be very <br>
careful not to give away a location of a box while searching, not to <br>
damage the area, to reclose the box or container completely and to <br>
rehide the box better than found.  After that, it gets crazy and goes <br>
all over the board.<br>
<br>
For me, I do not put stamp padss into my boxes.  I did when I first <br>
started planting boxes and most of the stamp pads only added to issues <br>
with the logs being ruined when they might not have been, otherwise.  I <br>
have seen some others that held up fine, but I have also had one where <br>
the inked water spilled and ruined my jeans, shoes and jacket when I <br>
first opened the box. ughhh Red dye everywhere.  I learned the hard way <br>
and the owner of the box lost a ton of signatures that might have been <br>
salvaged had the log only been wet.   Most folks carry either stamp pads <br>
(many of them for some of us) a complete set of Marvy Markers or both, <br>
and I would think that we all carry pens or pencils too. It is nice to <br>
come to a box where the color made a difference because of the stamp.  A <br>
box I found recently included a stamp of Piglet and the pink was the <br>
perfect color.  I was happy to use the stamp they provided!   <br>
Regardless, it is all up to you.  There are really very few rules, but <br>
we all have opinions of what we like best or what we have found works <br>
best for us based upon why we love this hobby/sport/addiction!<br>
<br>
I'll end my comments here and let the next person jump in!  Congrats and <br>
welcome again!<br>
