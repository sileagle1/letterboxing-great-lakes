Just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone at Yankee Springs for <br>
making the WONDERBROADS feel so welcome.  It was our first time and we <br>
had a terrific day.  And now I have faces to go with the names in the <br>
Yahoo group. It was clear that Spring Chick and Azobox put in many <br>
hours organizing the details for the event.  The folders, the workshop, <br>
the clue game and of course the GREAT hot dogs and fixings made for a <br>
wonderful event. And I'm not forgetting all the dishes to pass that <br>
everyone brought.  You just can't beat a good potluck!!<br>
Although I was at first reluctant to give up the stamp that I carved <br>
since it was my very first one, Its good to know that the clue game <br>
will be traveling around for other boxers to enjoy.  In fact, I think <br>
there might be an old Clue game in the basement that I might have to <br>
resurrect. I'd forgotten how much fun it was.<br>
<br>
Again, our thanks to Spring Chick and Azobox for putting together a <br>
great day, and everyone for making us feel so welcome.<br>
