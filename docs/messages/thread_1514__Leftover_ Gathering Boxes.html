pick up the boxes that are ready to head back home and check up on <br>
the permanent residents.  For those of you keeping score, the boxes <br>
taking up residence permanently are:<br>
Motown Wonder - by Wisconsin Hiker & Martini Man<br>
Tranquil Moment - by Doglvrs<br>
Mo' Mustangs - by Dragon<br>
Motown Legend of Boxing - by TJ_Mich<br>
<br>
The clues have already been posted for the first one, and, <br>
until "permanent" clues are posted for the other three, the clues <br>
from the gathering packet will work just fine!  All these boxes are <br>
doing well, and await many more visitors.  Trail Troll, since you <br>
planned to visit Hudson Mills this week anyway, we also left your box <br>
as you asked, so you can pick it up directly.  Please be extra <br>
deliberate in rehiding Dragon's box (since it's a series of seven) so <br>
that future visitors may also enjoy it completely.<br>

ps.  Kody, we also use Access to track our finds, etc.  It helps in <br>
planning trips, as we have plotted future hunts in our Michigan <br>
gazeteer and listed them by location.<br>
