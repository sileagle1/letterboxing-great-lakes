                    <div class="plaintext-content">Howdy, pod'ners...Papillon, her new boxin' buddy BoBo the Talking Squirrel,<br>
and I are pleased to announce that Buffalo Rock State Park near Ottawa,<br>
Illinois is home to my new "Shuffle Off to Bluffalo" box.  The clues should<br>
be posted tomorrow if all goes well.  We also placed three more boxes at<br>
camp and have plans for four more, which takes us to the point where we will<br>
be presenting the book of clues and introducing the concept to the leaders<br>
and camp staff.  Let the boxing begin.<br>
<br>
Oh, my!  I just scratched my head and came up with a personal hitchhiker,<br>
and s/he's still alive!  Quick! Grab one of my trusty ziplocks!  I'll have<br>
to show my coworker ParasiteWoman.  Luckily my little eight legged friend<br>
couldn't navigate his/her way through the thickness of my hair to find my<br>
scalp, so it hadn't hunkered down for dinner yet.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we also attempted to find Effigy Tumuli, to no avail.  I'm not sure<br>
if we were just off track or what.  I think I had my compass coordinates<br>
correct.  I found a tree which looked like it had a perfect hiding place,<br>
but it was empty.  Matt, if you're out there, can we talk?  I took a picture<br>
of my suspected site so I can send it to you and you can let me know if I<br>
was in the right spot.  Thanks.<br>
