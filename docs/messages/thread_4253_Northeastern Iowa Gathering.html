to Davenport IA all the time.  I'd actually thought of making a day <br>
trip of sorts to Decorah.  I'd be really honored to make an event <br>
stamp for you, even though I have no idea when I'd be able to make <br>
it to the actual event.  E-mail me and give me some ideas on what <br>
you'd like.<br>
