I love watching it just as much as my soaps, that's when I tell the kids to be quiet and watch or go get ready for bed!!!  LOL   I was waiting for the Southie boys to start a brawl, talk about extreme hunting!!!!  I played the treasure hunting game on NBC and have done pretty well, and also even did a couple of the text phone quizzes on the show.  I think it only makes me wanna go out letterboxing even more tho.. LOL<br>
