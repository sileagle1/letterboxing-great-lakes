                    <div class="plaintext-content">This Saturday morning, I told Deedle that I needed to get a letterboxing fix, so we headed out to find ourselves some boxes.  We found the first box with only minimal trouble, took our time stamping in at a bench a bit off from the box's hiding spot, and then needed to wait to replant the box because the park was suddenly taken over by a few dog walkers.  We vacated the bench (which was actually a part of the clues for finding the box) and walked a little bit down the trail, box hidden under my shirt, and patiently waiting for the dog walkers to move on their way, when a woman appeared at the trailhead.  She pulled out a piece of paper and Deedle whispered, "She's a letterboxer!"  I made some comment about not jumping to conclusions and we nonchalantly watched her as we continued to wait for the coast to clear.  She walked over to the bench and sat down.  Deedle again whispered, "She's a letterboxer."  I didn't want to approach her just yet, though - but when she got up from the<br/>
 bench and started moving the way the clues specificed, we finally went over to her as she reached the spot where she'd start looking for the box's hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
"Excuse us," we said, "Are you looking for the (Name of) Letterbox?"  She kind of looked at us, and then said yes, and I pulled the box out from under my shirt, explaing that we hadn't had a chance to replant it yet.  Her trailname is Kelmark, but she's not a member of the talklist.  We talked and exchanged stamps and then wished each other well as we continued our boxing days.  Making the event even sweeter, though, when we got home I checked our email account and saw that she had planted a new box later that day, and in the clues she dedicated the box to us in rememberance of our exchange earlier that day.  What a way to remember our first exchange!<br/>
