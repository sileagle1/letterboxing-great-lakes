                    <div class="plaintext-content">With the possibility of many of you lurking around northeast Indiana in the coming week, we checked and updated the clues and boxes to three of our boxes in that general area..."Cabin in the Woods" in Rome City and "Maple Wood Nature Center" in Lagrange, are up and running.  We didn't get to replace the old boxes with newer Lock N'Locks like we had planned, but all are in pretty good shape and ready for visitors.  Especially "Cabin in the Woods" which hasn't seen anyone since July of last year and is one of our favorite spots!  We did have to change the clues slightly due to the bridge mentioned being rebuilt...<br>
<br>
Another word of caution - with all of the spring rain, the fearsome mosquitos are out in FULL force in NE Indiana, a healthy crop of PI is showing off it's strength to survive cold midwest winters, and our favorite enemy, the Stinging Nettle is sprouting up nicely all around....You've been warned!<br>
<br>
It will be good to be "Back Home Again In Indiana"!!! Looking forward to seeing old letterboxers and meeting all you new ones!  We especially want to meet Stargazers as they were so sweet to rescue, dry out and rebox one of the boxes in Maple Wood Nature Center for us!  Aren't letterboxers the greatest?!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We second that!  We've been out boxing since Friday evening and can personally attest to hordes of mosquitos and plenty of stinging nettles.  Hopefully we've managed to avoid the PI....<br>
<br>
One other hazard to be alert for - TICKS!  Just found one on me and remembered the trick of rubbing it in circles to get it to release it's grip.  <br>
<br>
An overcast day down here in St. Louis - we hope the rain holds off so we can get out on the trails.  Still working our way south before we loop back up to Angola.<br>

Oh boy!  We can't believe the tick activity - even in our own backyard!  We haven't been outside that we haven't gotten one! Kemosabe is getting them even with his Frontline.   We read that one reason for the increase is due to the proliferation of the deer population.  But, you are right, we posted a while ago about the youtube demo of spinning the little buggers around until they just pull out - it really does work and makes the whole ordeal of getting a tick a lot less stressful.  Tonto has accused Tiptoe of actually enjoying the little extraction game!  Now if only she could come up with a great idea to entertain herself with the mosquitos!<br>
