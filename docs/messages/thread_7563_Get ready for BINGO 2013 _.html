I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving.  Martini Man &amp; I have much to<br/>
be thankful for and one of those things is knowing so many fun<br/>
letterboxers in the Great Lakes region!<br/>
<br/>
As most of you know, part of our winter fun is playing the Great Lakes<br/>
Letterboxing BINGO game started by SpringChick back in 2006.  The<br/>
illustrious Mr. Familyof6 took the reins for the last two years and now<br/>
I'm honored to be hosting the 2013 BINGO game.  We're hoping to have a<br/>
lot of participants this year, so spread the word.  You sure wouldn't<br/>
want to miss experiencing the slow motion thrill of victory and agony of<br/>
defeat that this game is famous for!<br/>
<br/>

.  You may wish  to use the MS Word version to type (or cut &amp; paste)<br/>
your terms directly into the grid.   You can then save a copy and send<br/>
it as an attachment in an email to me. Then, make sure<br/>
you mail a booty prize and $2 to my address (see FAQ file)  by Decmber<br/>
31 OR.... if you are attending the Dead of Winter event on January 26,<br/>
you can give me your booty and $2 then if you want to save the mailing<br/>
costs.  However you still need to get your BINGO card to me by the<br/>
deadline of DECEMBER 31 because the game starts on January 1, 2013.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to get the files posted early enough so you could still get out<br/>
to find some of the boxes on the Word List, if you haven't already found<br/>
them.  It will give you a few more choices for filling your grid and,<br/>
more importantly, you'll get to find more great letterboxes!  I'd much<br/>
rather be out letterboxing this weekend than venturing to a store filled<br/>
with those crazed "Black Friday" shoppers!<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, just shoot me an email, or post the question<br/>
to this board.<br/>

P.S.  Martini Man didn't want to be deprived of playing, so he has not<br/>
been involved in any planning for the game and won't be involved in any<br/>
aspects of  pulling words, etc.<br/>
