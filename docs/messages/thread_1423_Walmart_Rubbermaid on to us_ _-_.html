containers in the Sunday coupon section of our<br>
hometown paper...I'm not sure how many Sundays ago<br>
this was, though, since I was looking through the<br>
coupons at my mom's house since she collects them for<br>
me to go through when I grace her with my presence<br>
(like I did last night :)<br>
<br>
Hmmm, I need to stop by there one more time before the<br>
gathering, though, to borrow a few things from<br>
them...I'll have to cut the coupon out - maybe it will<br>
appear in one of the boxes at the gathering as a<br>
bonus? ;)<br>
