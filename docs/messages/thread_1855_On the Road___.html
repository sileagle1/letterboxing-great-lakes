will be over in WI through Saturday and then in the U.P. for a week.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what we will find as far as wireless connectivity or computer <br/>
access up there, so I probably won't be around much until we are back <br/>
on the 10th of October.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing the Wisconsin group (and travelers not from <br/>
WI) at the Haunted Harvest Gathering on Saturday.  If you will be <br/>
there and haven't already got my personal traveler, you might want to <br/>
take a look at my web site -- Letterboxes Planted page -- there may <br/>
bee some info there of interest for you...  you have to look closely.<br/>
