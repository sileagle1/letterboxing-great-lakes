                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past summer I did a workshop at camp for 12 girls, ranging in age from 9-16.  The workshop was only 5 days, 1 hour each day.  Most were totally unaware of what letterboxing was before they signed up, although two of them had been letterboxing before, one just a single time with a friend's family and the other letterboxes quite regularly with her grandmother.<br/>
<br/>
I had made up and planted two letterboxes before-hand.  One letterbox was for the compass reading exercise so the clues were basically a series of compass directions, including triangulation.  The second letterbox was a traditional "go on a hike on the trail" letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I broke up the time as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Day 1 - overview of letterboxing and stamp carving -- hand out erasers and each draw a basic image to carve (on paper with pencil and then tip over and rub onto eraser with fingernail)<br/>
Day 2 - finish drawing if needed and carve stamps<br/>
Day 3 - finish up stamps and decorate a logbook (we did not make them from scratch as there was not time, just decorated pre-purchased books)<br/>
Day 4 - learn how to use a compass and find a letterbox using a compass reading exercise<br/>
Day 5 - put it all together and go out on the trail to find a letterbox<br/>
<br/>
The girls had a great time and are asking for an "advanced class" in 2009 where they just get to letterbox the whole time using different kinds of clues.  I haven't given much thought to the 2009 class yet, but will for sure be doing something as it was a very popular interest group.  I need to figure out a way to keep the hunt fun for everyone, not just the couple of kids out in front of the pack.  Perhaps a couple versions of the clue and break the group up into teams, each with a different set of clues leading to the same spot.  I would also like to incorporate making logbooks, although have been tossing around the idea of a separate interest group for beginning bookbinding, just not sure if I can dedicate 2 hours each day to teaching interest groups (not that I wouldn't love to spend the entire day teaching interest groups...  but duty calls elsewhere).<br/>

  Oh, I think it would absolutely kill me to find an image and copy it. My<br/>
  creativity would feel so mentally suffocated. My twisted and somewhat<br/>
  demented brain gives birth to the images I use. Then I draw, redraw, redraw<br/>
  and redraw it until the paper has a hole in it, and I realize that I<br/>
  basically suck at art and settle for whatever I come up with (aka -<br/>
  stickmen), which usually has absolutely nothing to do with my original<br/>
  thought. So when you find a stamp you can't identify and it makes you have<br/>
  a puzzled look on your face, just shake your head and know it's mine. <br/>
<br/>
  "12-step program confession..." LOL. Yes to all of the above (though I'm<br/>
  not sure what the term "lock 'n lock" means. I'm guessing it means a<br/>
  container of some sort? <br/>
<br/>
  In addition to boxes, clues, and stamps all calling out my name, I'm also in<br/>
  the process of planning the coming semester of teaching letterboxing to<br/>
  about eight teens. <br/>
<br/>
  I've got the basics down - carving stamps, making logbooks, recording clues,<br/>
  field trips to finding them, and more. Any suggestions for other things I<br/>
  can add to the class??? <br/>
