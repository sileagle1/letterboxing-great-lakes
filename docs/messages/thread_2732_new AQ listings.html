                    <div class="plaintext-content">Same here.  I tried Oak Hill Cemetery about a week or two after it was<br>
placed -- I know the place so well I figured it would be a piece of cake --<br>
nope, couldn't find it.   Got up to the cross part and then drew a blank.<br>
We tried every conceivable definition of the word cross.  Then we decided to<br>
forget the "cross" part and search for any conceivable type of coffin.  No<br>
luck at all.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Civil War graves, there's a great site in Milton township that's<br>
an "abandoned" cemetery in the Wheaton area.  Woods have grown up around it<br>
and in the middle of it are a bunch of civil war graves plus quite an<br>
elaborate family plot.  Milton Township folks were in kind of a fight to get<br>
the rights to the land to restore the cemetery.  They did a ton of<br>
absolutely beautiful work restoring a cemetery to the north of this one that<br>
has the gravesite of a Revolutionary soldier, so I'd love to see them go to<br>
work on the Civil War one.<br>
<br>
But I don't know if I should draw any attention to the cemetery at all that<br>
has the Civil War gravesites.  It's been vandalised as it is -- by the<br>
neighbors actually who don't want it restored because they feel it will hurt<br>
their property values -- and might not need any more attention since right<br>
now it's not really under anyone's "control" legally.<br>
<br>
The woods are rather dense, but the light comes thru the trees at just the<br>
right spots for me to get some great photos.  I always go out there when I'm<br>
in an Eeyore sort of mood.  It's that kind of place.<br>
<br>
Give a holler if anyone ever finds Oak Hill.  I went back a couple of times<br>
but finally gave up. I never did contact the placer because I figured there<br>
had to be something I was missing.  But the same placer planted the Windmill<br>
box and that was a physical toughie -- that was physically much harder than<br>
we expected it to be, with a lot longer distance than we expected.  After<br>
doing the Windmill box, I always thought that there might be something more<br>
physically difficult that we were missing about the Oak Hill box.  :-)<br>

remember the box.  We found that one about a year ago, and the cross <br>
clue is a little weird.  If I remember right it refers to a couple of <br>
trees lying on the ground.  Also the bridge in the clues is not the <br>
REAL bridge that is there but refers to a log crossing a small gully.  <br>
I would normally never say this but unless it has changed there is a <br>
