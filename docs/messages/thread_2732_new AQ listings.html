placed -- I know the place so well I figured it would be a piece of cake --<br/>
nope, couldn't find it.   Got up to the cross part and then drew a blank.<br/>
We tried every conceivable definition of the word cross.  Then we decided to<br/>
forget the "cross" part and search for any conceivable type of coffin.  No<br/>
luck at all.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Civil War graves, there's a great site in Milton township that's<br/>
an "abandoned" cemetery in the Wheaton area.  Woods have grown up around it<br/>
and in the middle of it are a bunch of civil war graves plus quite an<br/>
elaborate family plot.  Milton Township folks were in kind of a fight to get<br/>
the rights to the land to restore the cemetery.  They did a ton of<br/>
absolutely beautiful work restoring a cemetery to the north of this one that<br/>
has the gravesite of a Revolutionary soldier, so I'd love to see them go to<br/>
work on the Civil War one.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't know if I should draw any attention to the cemetery at all that<br/>
has the Civil War gravesites.  It's been vandalised as it is -- by the<br/>
neighbors actually who don't want it restored because they feel it will hurt<br/>
their property values -- and might not need any more attention since right<br/>
now it's not really under anyone's "control" legally.<br/>
<br/>
The woods are rather dense, but the light comes thru the trees at just the<br/>
right spots for me to get some great photos.  I always go out there when I'm<br/>
in an Eeyore sort of mood.  It's that kind of place.<br/>
<br/>
Give a holler if anyone ever finds Oak Hill.  I went back a couple of times<br/>
but finally gave up. I never did contact the placer because I figured there<br/>
had to be something I was missing.  But the same placer planted the Windmill<br/>
box and that was a physical toughie -- that was physically much harder than<br/>
we expected it to be, with a lot longer distance than we expected.  After<br/>
doing the Windmill box, I always thought that there might be something more<br/>
physically difficult that we were missing about the Oak Hill box.  :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't remember the placers of the Oak Hill cemetary box, but I do <br/>
remember the box.  We found that one about a year ago, and the cross <br/>
clue is a little weird.  If I remember right it refers to a couple of <br/>
trees lying on the ground.  Also the bridge in the clues is not the <br/>
REAL bridge that is there but refers to a log crossing a small gully.  <br/>
I would normally never say this but unless it has changed there is a <br/>
lot of work for a very small reward.<br/>

PS, We did go out and get your box today, being first finders was a <br/>
terrific Anniversary gift.<br/>
