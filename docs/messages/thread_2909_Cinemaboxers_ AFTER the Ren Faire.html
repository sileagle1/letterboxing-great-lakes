Thank you for the hoof hearted clue.  Have you listed it on AQ?  No telling when LbNA will be up and running again.  Glad AQ is there so we can get our fixes.  Is hoof hearted considered a word of mouth box?  Or is it now a permanent traditional box?  <br/>
<br/>
I was up bright an early this morning - that's about 9 am for me.  Beetle and Claire (daughter of Beetle) were first finders at hoof hearted on 8/7/06 at 12:35 pm.   <br/>
<br/>
Everyone else...watch out for those wild rose bushes.....OUCH!!!  Thorny little devils! <br/>

Sunday I planted a box and you were SO close with no clues - I may <br/>
get myself in trouble. (So I made sure I had them handy!)<br/>
<br/>
More plants today - 4 for us.<br/>
<br/>
And... 5 finds! We were FF on the second 'Leg' of Trip Across <br/>
America by CherokeeRose2. The COOLEST FF 'prize' a postcard from <br/>
each state with the Personal stamp of the Letterboxer who sent her <br/>
the postcard! <br/>
<br/>
So did you figure out Hoof Farted easily? (Giggling as I read this <br/>
question aloud... go ahead, try it. LOL)<br/>
<br/>
We didn't even notice the thorns - Must be our already problematic <br/>
case of 'Letterbox Leg'. (Torn up from diving in!)<br/>
