I checked on my 151 Questions box and, miracle of miracles, it made <br>
it through the winter. It is currently frozen to the ground, but it <br>
is still there. I pulled the lid back a ways, so it is possible to <br>
stamp in if you were thinking of finding it.<br>
<br>
My letterboxing bug has been satisfied for the moment. I got to walk <br>
through the mud and get my coat full of moss and other good stuff. <br>
And it only took 10 minutes! Wiener Mouse would be proud of me.<br>
<br>
Now, if only it stays nice enough to go check on the others...<br>
<br>
