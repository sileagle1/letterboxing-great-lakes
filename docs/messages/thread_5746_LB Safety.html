                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, I received an email from a new boxer who found one of my boxes and attempted to find another letterboxer's box too, but she and her buddy were totally shaken up by their experience.  They just weren't sure if this was part of the hobby, but felt they needed to ask someone, or warn others.  Here is what they said.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
..we tried unsuccessfully to find (name of letterbox.) We felt we did everything right. It started in a park that was in a bit of a questionable neighborhood, but seemed safe. It took us on a 30 minute hike along a path that had a river on one side and a steep hill with a fence on the other. This made us a bit nervous as there were areas that looked like they were inhabited unfortunately by homeless groups and we realized there was no escape route if we needed one. The clues took us under...an underpass filled with the same type of things. <br>
<br>
The area we ended up searching for the box was full of trash, clothes etc... Soon there were men on the bridge and the only stairway to get us out of there without taking the trail back. We immediately gave up and racewalked back the way we came. If we had any idea that this was a scary area, we would not have gone. Should there have been sort of suggestion in the clues that you should go with a large group or bring some mace?;) We are two very smart girls, but got really mad thinking that a fellow LBer would have us out in this area! What if my 65 yr old aunt and mom decided to go on this hike? Don't get me wrong, we are up for a challenge, but we felt this one was a safety issue. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I did not disclose the name of the box or the placer because I'm not sure how to address this issue.  I am glad that these two new boxers used their common sense and got out of the area.  <br>
<br>
I'm glad they asked me for advice.  I'm glad they spoke up. So now I ask the members of this group, what should be done when a new letterbox is placed in an area that is preceived as possibly unsafe? <br>
They may be new boxers, but they are concerned enough to look out for all of us and our safety.   <br>

Later, they commented to me that they went home and were too afraid to tell their husbands what had happened.  They really were shaken up.  Sometimes, homeless people living on the street do not use good judgement and passerbys can become targets of opportunity.  This is how they felt.  They got out of the area.  NO letterbox is worth this type of experience.  I gave me chills to think that someone would post a box knowingly that the area was questionable.  I also know that if you contact a boxer directly, they might take huge offense.  But I think it's an important topic for discussion because I feel we need to support each other and protect each other even if it means suggesting that the placer should reconsider this letterbox location.

And yeah, I'm offended that people think that homeless people target us for<br>
"opportunity" because they are homeless.  You're more likely to be raped by<br>
a drunk UWM college student here on the east side than you are to be<br>
accosted by one of the members of the homeless community living under that<br>
bridge.  I have never felt unsafe in that area.  EVER.<br>
<br>
Of course, as a nurse, I work with the homeless population and have no<br>
problem seeing them as HUMAN.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry for being a bitch, but I'm upset.  I have added a disclaimer to my<br>
clue for this box stating the basic safety and common sense clause.  And in<br>
all sincerity, if there is something else you think I should add to the<br>
disclaimer, please feel free to let me know.<br>
<br>
Also, feel free to flame.  Don't actually care right now.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's not just that the homeless can see them as "targets of opportunity",<br>
it's also that homeless people can become extremely possessive of the very<br>
few possessions that they do have and might think that boxers were messing<br>
with their stuff, and think the boxers were seeing THEM as targets of<br>
opportunity.<br>
<br>
Also, statistics say that about 1/3 of the homeless in the northeastern<br>
Illinois area are homeless because they have psychiatric<br>
issues..........schizophrenia, manic/depressive, etc.  Something a stranger<br>
may say or do might trigger an episode for them.  That number may have<br>
changed now due to the number of people losing their jobs and ending up<br>
homeless, but there are still plenty of emotionally disturbed homeless<br>
people out there.<br>
<br>
There is one boxer who's actually one of the original boxers in the Chicago<br>
area who places boxes in some pretty bad areas.  More than one of their<br>
boxes can potentially cause problems of safety.  But, lots of boxes out in<br>
the wild are potential problems.  Look at the fact that for awhile, people<br>
were being mugged and beaten up in the northern suburbs in some preserves<br>
that normally serve some very wealthy neighborhoods, and there are often<br>
lots of people walking, jogging, biking.  People were being attacked right<br>
in broad daylight.   And a totally deserted forest preserve that looks like<br>
just totally natural forest could be harboring a serial killer waiting for a<br>
victim.<br>
<br>
I don't place boxes in either Cook County or Kane County anymore because of<br>
scarey experiences we've had ourselves.  Probably total overkill f'sure<br>
f'sure, but I don't feel safe going to check on the boxes for maintenance<br>
after what happened when searching for other boxes in those counties.<br>
<br>
I think the huuuuuuuuuuuuuge mistake those boxers made was in not trusting<br>
their gut.  That's the first thing ya gotta learn.  Always trust your gut.<br>
If it feels bad OR looks bad........GET OUT.  Absolutely no box is worth<br>
getting one's body damaged over.   And carry a big fat whistle where ya can<br>
use it right away.  I keep one looped on my belt that I can grab right away.<br>
But my eyes and my whistle never take the place of my gut instincts.<br>

My thoughts - it would be worth contacting the placer and letting them<br>
know of this experience. While I realize that some boxes are more of a<br>

that had a river on one side and a steep hill with a fence on the other.<br>
This made us a bit nervous as there were areas that looked like they were<br>
inhabited unfortunately by homeless groups and we realized there was no<br>

area, we would not have gone. Should there have been sort of suggestion in<br>
the clues that you should go with a large group or bring some mace?;) We are<br>
two very smart girls, but got really mad thinking that a fellow LBer would<br>
have us out in this area! What if my 65 yr old aunt and mom decided to go on<br>
this hike? Don't get me wrong, we are up for a challenge, but we felt this<br>

what they were saying.  They went from just doing a walk in an iffy area <br>
to being watched by several men - who just happened to be blocking one <br>
of their potential exits from said area.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the men in question were just admiring the view, lol, (it was <br>
men watching women after all) - and wondering what the heck these women <br>
were doing down there rummaging around. Perhaps since they were <br>
rummaging around they thought they were undercover detectives... Who <br>
knows.  No, men do not usually walk around wondering who they should <br>
jump next, but the media has certainly portrayed things as such. But, <br>
that is a whole other topic than what we are discussing - I could go on <br>
for days.<br>
<br>
Personally, I would not want to be put in such a situation.  I have <br>
listened to my gut instinct more than once and turned around and walked <br>
away.  I have had that happen at a REST STOP!  Not a sound at that <br>
place, but 4-5 vehicles and no one to be seen.  Even the birds were <br>
quiet. I got back in my vehicle and left - held it for 20 more miles til <br>
I got to a truck stop.<br>
<br>
The walk that they described, might have put me on alert that I was <br>
potentially invading someone else's area and to be more aware of my <br>
surroundings.  But, that said, if it went from very few people around to <br>
a bunch of people staring at me, I too would have been very concerned <br>
and gotten the heck out of there.   But that is just me.<br>
<br>
Please do not be angry - these women were scared and did not want anyone <br>
put in harm's way.  That is all.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently had a private conversation with another LB-er about safety in the Cook County Forest Preserve.  Most of these boxes have a standard disclaimer about not boxing alone, etc, etc.  I was concerned about the men that sit in their cars alone in the parking lots and seem to "meet up".  Sometimes I think it's a drug thing, but others seem like sexual pick-ups.  <br>
Bottom line is that we all have different comfort levels.  Having lived in Chicago for years, what I deem safe is not the same as my sister from Rhinelander, WI.  She won't drive on lower Wacker drive.  However, you won't see me putting the garbage out at midnight in her bear infested back yard.  <br>
If it doesn't compromise the clues, perhaps a caution that transitory people live in the area of a box might be helpful.  I think the paragraph that Kermit just added to the box is great.  Thanks for adding it.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">IF the box in question IS Kermit's new box, I personally do fully understand Kermit initially not placing a warning about the area.  It is the same area in which the Cambridge series is in, and a number of local boxers have placed boxes there and numerous boxers have found them without incidence.  (Not to mention a number of the finders/placers of the boxes are women who box alone (besides Me who boxes with Sophie).)  Although there have been some "shady/interesting" instances mentioned in the many years those boxes have been in place, nothing substantial has ever been reported to me.  If I had the time, I would go down alone and find Kermit's box today.<br>
<br>
Not only is the Cambridge series there, but I personally have a number of boxes there and others do as well.  The trail(s) in question are used regularly by exercisers walking/running alone and are patrolled by police regularly.  Of course common sense should prevail, which is why there are the disclaimers on LBNA and Atlas Quest.  ANY box location is a potential hazardous place.  Urban boxes have different hazards than rural places, but none of us should go to either without our senses intact.<br>
<br>
As with all box placements, things can change in the area they are hidden in since they have been planted.  There can be a huge difference in the area just between day and night, as the seasons change, or as the years go by.  This particular area changes a lot at night, and only a fool would go looking for boxes in the area alone at night.  This area also changes dramatically due to the economy.  It is one of the areas of the city that attracts the homeless when there are more of them around.  Not too long ago, very few homeless would be found in the area.<br>
<br>
IF someone does hide a box in a VERY iffy area however (over and beyond the normal to be expected), they should place an extra disclaimer on it so people are aware.  However, placing the "Urban" indicator on the box at AQ should already alert one to the hazards of urban boxing, not to mention the "extreme" indicator.  Kermit did both of these things, and one cannot get the clue without going to AQ.  Kermit did nothing wrong or out of the ordinary for her new box.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would tend to agree with the posters who advocate NOT placing a warning on the box.  It is every letterboxer's personal responsibility to determine for themselves, based on their personal abilities, comfort level and the prevailing conditions if a letterbox is safe to pursue and to turn around at any time during their adventure if they are not feeling safe.  <br>
<br>
To place this responsibility onto the placer and to place warnings on boxes will only serve to set a precedent and people will come to expect that if seeking a box is questionable in safety, the placer will warn them ahead of time.  This encourages people to rely on that forewarning rather than trusting their own judgment.<br>
<br>
ANY box can be unsafe given the right conditions -- weather, construction, activities in the area on a certain day, or even the seeker's own ability and limitations.  It would be impossible for a placer to anticipate all conditions that may or may not be encountered on any particular day and in many cases could actually warn when none is needed.<br>
<br>
In this specific situation, the seekers expressed their discomfort with this box early in the hunt and as Mosey points out, made the mistake of continuing past that point.<br>
<br>
Nothing in life is 100% safe, but the vast majority of the time trusting your gut instinct is the best barometer and your best defense when it comes to your own safety.<br>

often true.  I work with the P.A.D.S. program and several times people with<br>
mental issues are "blacklisted" from shelters because they cause trouble.<br>
<br>
I also work with the homeless down in Chicago, particularly feeding folks on<br>
Lower Wacker Drive and definitely have to watch who I approach and when and<br>
how.  Once they come to know that I'm "safe", then all's OK.  Until they<br>
know that I'm "safe", however, I have to be careful.   I've been struck with<br>
fists, I've been kicked, I've had glass bottles thrown at me, etc because I<br>
got too close and didn't happen to see somebody.  I have a 20 inch scar<br>
going down my leg from a paranoid schizophrenic young man.  Even if I WASN'T<br>
fat, a bikini would be out of the question with the looks of that scar.  :-)<br>

I'm certainly not saying that all people with mental problems or emotional<br>
issues will cause trouble.  Of course not.  But a person who is unfamiliar<br>
with who is who in a particular area or setting COULD have a potential<br>
problem on their hands.<br>
<br>
And I'm not at all saying that they're any more dangerous than "the average<br>

I totally agree, however, that danger can be anyplace.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think that much of this is relative.  I was at that same box last weekend with a group of people.  A couple of them felt uncomfortable there, and I felt completely fine.  I was aware of people on the bridge above us and others in the woods.  I knew the bike trail was directly behind us with quite a bit of traffic on it.  If I was ran into people down there and felt uncomfortable, I would have headed out right away.  I think the person who mentioned following your instincts was completely right.  On the other hand I am completely uncomfortable out alone in more parks out in the suburbs.  I don't know that there are other people around that I could reach quickly, and frequently do not feel safe in a bigger park.  I live in the city and that is part of my comfort zone.  Others that I box with live further out in the suburbs and they go to those parks all the time by themselves.  Different people different comfort zones.  <br>

I would assume there's quite a bit discussed about safety for new folks on<br>
that list?<br>

But, we have warnings on a few of our boxes hidden in Cook County.  We <br>
have warnings for two reasons.  (A)  We realize we are more comfortable <br>
with boxing in the city that some other people and (B) we feel it's <br>
polite to point a few of these things out BEFORE someone drives all the <br>
way out to our boxes.  I'd think some people might get thrown off by the <br>
location of a few of our boxes and might not make it out of the parking <br>
lot (with all those creepy guys in their parked cars).  At least with <br>
our warnings, they can be aware of a potential situation prior to <br>
arriving on site.  If they are likely to be uneasy, we assume they won't <br>
drive out to look for our boxes.<br>
