They said on the radio that it turns out that the package is part of an on-line scavenger hunt and that no arrests are planned.<br>
Mark said he wished he had heard about it yesterday...he would have gone over and said, hey...I'll open it and show you what's inside!! Not that they would have let him near it.<br>
FYI, our local county park where we will be having The Great Literary Quest is allowing boxes but only inside clear containers so the contents can be seen.<br>
Just thought you all would want to hear about this.<br>

Suspicious package found near historic XXXX tower in XXXXXXXXXXXX<br>
Posted by XXXXXXXX | The XXXXXXXXX News August 14, 2008 11:23AM<br>
Categories: Breaking News, XXXXXXXXX<br>
A Michigan State Police bomb squad is on the scene of a suspicious package found near the historic xxxxxxxxx tower in xxxxxxxxxxx this morning, police said.<br>
Chief xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx said workers from the xxxxxxxxxxxx Community Utilities Authority went to the xxxxxx tower at about 10 a.m. to do some landscaping work. The xxxxx tower is off xxxxxxxx Avenue near the xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx campus.<br>
Harshberger said thexxxxxxx workers discovered a plastic container wrapped in duct tape near the base of the historical marker sign next to the xxxxxxxx tower.<br>
They alerted authorities, and xxxxxxxxxx officers called in the bomb squad.<br>
"It's better to be safe than sorry," xxxxxxxxxx said.<br>
The area is cordoned off, and residents are being advised to avoid the area. <br>
Eastbound traffic on xxxxxxxxx Avenue is being rerouted onto westbound xxxxxxx Street. The southbound lane of westbound xxxxxxxx Avenue is also closed, but traffic is moving through one available lane.<br>

It was apparently a geocache as it was reported to be full of, uh, <br>
geo-trash trinkets.<br>

If, as the article stated, "Inside was a typical "geocaching" logbook <br>
and "treasures," which are usually worthless trinkets" then perhaps it <br>
should have been labeled "Geocache (Hybrid)" ;}<br>

But the reason I am replying is to say, hey aren't you glad they <br>
assumed it was a Geocache and didn't call it a letterbox in the <br>
reports, that way we don't have people around here logging onto atlas <br>
quest and muggling our boxes with no intentions of boxing but to find <br>
out what these mysterious boxes are that the police thought was a <br>
bomb? If I heard that report on the radio happening right here in my <br>
own town (which it was) and didn't have any clue about either of these <br>
hobbies than I'm be googling it and out to at least see one of these <br>
things. Heck I already went out in search of a Geocache just to see <br>
what was so different with no intention to ever become a Geocacher, <br>
just curiosity got to me. At least I could give respect to the box no <br>
matter which sport, but college kids may not, and this is a college <br>
town. <br>
