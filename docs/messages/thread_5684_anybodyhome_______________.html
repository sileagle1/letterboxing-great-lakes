So, yea, the boards have been a bit quiet, except for a bit of bingo <br>
talk.  We've been stuck inside for much of the winter (except for a <br>
wonderful SILO), and here it is, the weekend, and looking like it might <br>
snow AGAIN!  We've managed to get our more in February than we did in <br>
January (shameless plug...we've managed to plant a few boxes in the last <br>
few months....I think a few FF are still possible!), but we are still <br>
doing a bit less than we normally get mid summer.  Based on the box <br>
reports from our own boxes, it seems to be a wide-spread trend.  I don't <br>
know about you, but yes, I'm ready for it to stop snowing and stay warm!<br>
<br>
Oh, and I don't think either of us is in the running for any Bingo <br>
awards.....<br>

Still felt just as bad on Thurs, but I couldn't breath well enough to sleep so I went to work anyway. Just now starting to feel better...hopefully I'll be recovered by Sunday or Monday. That seems to be the standard MO for this cold anyway. On the bright side, the Johnny Cash bio I watched the other night rekindled a desire to carve a companion stamp or two to Coal Miner's Daughter. And once the weather is a little nicer and I'm a little less exhausted I have plenty of boxes to replant now that the IL state parks are staying open.<br>

weekend facing me, too.  Thank goodness spring break is just one week away.<br>
<br>
<br>
I did get out this evening to do a little letterboxing.  Attempted one box,<br>
despite the numerous attempts listed on LBNA, and found not only no box but<br>
not really even any potential hiding spots.  First finder on the other box,<br>
so that made the trip well-worth it.  I was going to try for a third, but<br>
the dogs treed a cat right near where the box was hidden, so I decided to<br>
hike on and give the cat the opportunity to go home unscathed.   It was grey<br>
but not raining and pretty warm, actually, so it was nice to get out there.<br>
With any luck I can get back there sometime next week, after work, maybe.<br>

boxes - specifically the three IRT boxes in that area.  It felt good to do a little boxing - even <br>
if it meant some major muddy boots!  So muddy, that we had to offer to sweep the little <br>
historic area in the "Maid-Rite" where we realized a little too late that we were in fact the <br>
culprits who had deposited a ton of mud on the floor!  <br>
We also took in the Lincoln Library and Museum - something we would encourage everyone <br>
to do.  We realized that since letterboxing has come into our life, we've been remiss in <br>
visiting some of the places that we used to enjoy. Balance seems to be the key word here.  <br>
Turned out that it was a very full and successful little trip to the capital - a great way to wile <br>
away the long winter letterboxing wait!<br>

Sure enough as I neared the hiding place, I spied a patch of white through the trees...a bride being photographed in the garden. Not wanting to be seen lurking in the background of her pictures (no foliage to hide me), I just made a quick check to see if the box was still there (it is) but didn't get tocheck to be sure the contents overwintered without damage.<br>
<br>
But what I want to know is, when did the rules change to say all brides MUST wear strapless, sleeveless dresses no matter what month of the year or what the climate? Ye gads! Heck, I'm such a freezy-cat, I wore long sleeves in October!<br>

I got married in late September.   I went with a high stand up collar in the back that tapered to a low v in the front.  White satin.  Long train in the back.  Elegant!    The sleeves were long, straight, all lace.  Lots of hand beading.  Vera Wang?  Nope!  Mine was a Beetle Original!  I worked for the Singer Sewing Machine Company for many years so I never considered buying a wedding dress...I made it myself!  <br>
