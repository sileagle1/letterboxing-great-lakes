<br>
I would say this would be a perfect opportunity to work WITH the MI <br>
State Parks.  Since they have not started their new policy yet, <br>
there is time to work with them on a better policy.  I would suggest <br>
that a couple Geocachers and Letterboxers get together and draft a <br>
proposal for them.  Explain clearly your opposition to their new <br>
policy and also explain to them that it will not work the way they <br>
intend.  Instead of them making money on it, they WILL LOSE money, <br>
because all geocaches and letterboxes WILL be either removed or <br>
hidden without their knowledge.  (No one will pay $35 to hide a box, <br>
even for a year.)  AND fewer people will come to their parks as a <br>
result.  Encourage them to look at how CT and other states have <br>
actually MADE money by controlling Geocaching and Letterboxing in <br>
their parks and trails by ENCOURAGING it!  Work with the State Parks <br>
to control the proliferation of boxes and caches on sensitive <br>
areas.  Have cachers and boxers register thier boxes with the parks <br>
for no fee - just for promotion and upkeep.  If the Parks system has <br>
a way to freely register the caches and boxes on thier grounds, they <br>
can have final say as to whether the place the box is intended to be <br>
placed would be safe for the environment they are in charge of <br>
protecting.  Let THEM suggest good locations for boxes and caches.  <br>
Allow them to advertise that geocaching and letterboxing can be <br>
activities done in the parks!  This should bring in more revenue <br>
than them trying to charge people to hide boxes and caches!  By far!<br>
<br>
To be honest, I think SpringChicks boxes in Muskegon State Park are <br>
a huge draw!  I've been raving to the WI letterboxers and regular <br>
folks about it being THE trip to take!<br>
<br>
For the record, these boxes and parks are one of the prime reasons I <br>
took my MI letterboxing trip last summer and why I'm looking forward <br>
to going back!  If they want any idea of how much money they took in <br>
from just ONE letterboxer traveling through MI State Parks, they <br>
should see my Visa bill!  I paid $20 for an annual sticker (and <br>
probably for another one this year), I stayed about 2 1/2 weeks at <br>
various campgrounds at the state parks around the state at about $12 <br>
a night (about $200+).  I also bought their firewood, shopped at <br>
campground stores, etc. that should've also produced revenue for <br>
them too.  Now, there are a dozen or so new WI letterboxers that <br>
seemed very interested in doing part or all of my MI trip.  Multiply <br>
my expenses by 12 and that is some healthy income!  Add more boxes <br>
to the parks, make us stay more, send us to the "less used" parks, <br>
and up goes the revenue!<br>
<br>
I pray us in WI won't have to put up with this!  Maybe I should <br>
start checking the WI state parks policies....<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's some background I just learned about the state parks in PA and how <br>
they handle letterboxing and geocaching. This might help if anyone wants to <br>
approach any other state park officials.<br>
<br>
I recently heard from a letterboxer in Western PA who was contacted by <br>
parks officials about their letterboxes in a state park there. The <br>
letterboxer had to fill out a form to get approval for the letterboxes, so <br>
I started doing some research.<br>
<br>
The PA DCNR web page doesn't have anything on letterboxing, but they do <br>
have a geocaching policy (and I assume it also applies to letterboxes). I'm <br>
going to followup with the park down the road from my home to check on <br>
their letterbox policy, but in the mean time, I got this response from the <br>
DCNR regarding their geocaching policy:<br>
<br>
>The following webpage contains our state park geocaching guidelines: <br>
>http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/geocaching.aspx<br>
><br>
>If you plan on placing a geocache in a specific state park, I would <br>
>recommend contacting that park office and speaking to the park manager for <br>
>further information, as he/she will have a central part in making the <br>
>determination on whether or not to approve of the geocache.  In addition, <br>
>you'll be required to submit a Geocache Identification Form, which you can <br>
>also download from the above website.<br>
<br>
It's interesting that they provide "official geocache" stickers to be <br>
placed on any "registered" geocaches in PA state parks. These are the same <br>
stickers that you can purchase from the geocaching.com web site.<br>
<br>
While it's an extra step that must be taken when hiding a letterbox, I'm <br>
not opposed to their policy. At least they're not behaving like the NPS and <br>
banning letterboxes altogether!<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Michigan geocaching steering committee is currently working with <br>
the DNR to try and effect some change to the policy.  I have been in <br>
contact with them and gave some perspective as to letterboxing.  The <br>
original policy was $35 per cache/letterbox for a 3 month period of <br>
time.  At their last meeting, they were able to get the time frame <br>
increased to a year, although the cache/letterbox must still be <br>
moved every 3 months and the placement fee is still $35.  They will <br>
be meeting again, but I do not foresee that the fee will be <br>
dropped.  The $35 fee is their base when determining special use <br>
permit fees, which is what they consider this to be.<br>
<br>
There are a couple of things I see...  First let me say that I have <br>
nothing against geocachers and all whom I have personally come in <br>
contact with on the trail and via e-mail have been great people.  I <br>
know we have a few on this list also who are involved in both <br>
letterboxing and geocaching and I am happy to see that at least here <br>
in Michigan, the two hobbies peacefully co-exist.  However, that <br>
being said...  I have been hanging out over at the MiGO forum a bit <br>
lately because of this State Parks issue and although it certainly <br>
is not fair to slap down a blanket statement that applies to all <br>
geocachers or all letterboxers, I see a very fundamental difference <br>
between the two.  It is coming through loud and clear that the <br>
majority of them (at least those who are posting to the forum) use <br>
the parks only for their hobby -- did not use them prior to the <br>
hobby and will not use them in the future if the fee holds.  To me, <br>
having grown up in West MI and truly believing we are fortunate to <br>
have some of the best State Parks in the country, that is <br>
appalling!  It tells me that for most of them it is all about the <br>
numbers -- collecting caches, not about the hike.  And sad to say, <br>
but I think where a reverence for nature is lacking, there does tend <br>
to be increased disregard for the land and environmental concerns.  <br>
I am sure the same can be said of some letterboxers, but of those I <br>
have met, most did not begin enjoying the out-of-doors and the parks <br>
when they started letterboxing, rather they began letterboxing as an <br>
activity to enhance the time they were already spending at the <br>
parks.  And although we delight in finding the box at the end of the <br>
trail and even plan our hikes around the boxes, we were and would <br>
continue to use the trails and parks even if the boxes were not <br>
there because it is not just about the numbers.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately geocaching and letterboxing are treated equally when <br>
it comes to policy at Michigan State Parks because at face value <br>
they do appear to be very similar activities and it would be next to <br>
impossible to exhalt one over the other in terms of philosophy and <br>
environmental stewardship.<br>
<br>
As a parks department, if suddenly there was a large subset of <br>
people coming to the parks for the sole purpose of playing their <br>
game, I might try to charge them for that also.  I follow the logic <br>
and agree that the parks are probably bringing in more money on <br>
entrance fees and camping, etc. as it stands now, without the fee, <br>
than if the fee were to be in place -- simply because nobody is <br>
going to pay the fee and the activity will move out of the parks.  <br>
But they really think people are going to pay to play and the amount <br>
of dollars we are talking is small enough that they probably won't <br>
notice a huge drop in revenue if geocachers and letterboxers do go <br>
elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I was happy to hear that there is room for individual decision-<br>
making on the part of the individual park rangers -- that even <br>
though this policy has been handed down, they do have the ability to <br>
make decisions as to how it will be addressed in their park on a <br>
park-by-park, even case-by-case basis.  I am even more fortunate <br>
that the park rangers where a number of my boxes are planted are in <br>
favor of letterboxing and have chosen to take a wait-and-see <br>
stance.  I will be going out this weekend to check on all of those <br>
boxes and relocate any where slight spur trails are evident, and I <br>
will be keeping a close eye on those boxes to ensure that they do <br>
not cause concern with the park officials there.<br>
<br>
I think that trying to convince the powers that be in Lansing is a <br>
bigger war than we have the ammunition for, rather it would be more <br>
effective to work with the local park officials educating them on <br>
letterboxing and setting an example of good stewardship in hopes <br>
that either they will continue to allow them on an individual <br>
level.  Once there has been a successful track record in that <br>
respect, perhaps there will be some leverage at a higher level.<br>
<br>
Just the way I see it...<br>

<br>
I wanted to share the above link as another possible angle to the <br>
discussions.  I went back and read through this thread because I was <br>
considering collaborating with a friend on planting a box at some <br>
sort of DNR land near her house in the country.  My confusion grows <br>
over land usage and control when I look at an old map from the 70's <br>
that we used to use when we lived near Midland MI for dirt bike <br>
riding.  They have a trail that loops the upper part of the state <br>
that can be used for ORV, they have trails for mountain bikers, they <br>
have land for hunters.....and they have this great initiative still <br>
in the year 2000 to link and maintain use and recreation for <br>
everybody.  The site I'm referenceing is gun ho to draw tourist <br>
dollars, so maybe they don't realize the State park people are trying <br>
to cut off those same dollars?  I just think this may be an important <br>
angle to look at?  I'm a bit of a hitchhiker here, since I'm moving <br>
to PA soon (where I've lived before and am well aware of the corrupt <br>
beaurocracy)  but I did want to work with a practice box and my <br>
friend would really enjoy maintaining it and growing into the sport <br>
as well.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, some of this actually crosses over into the TOTW and maybe <br>
better addressed there.  Would it be considered "safe" to assume that <br>
people wouldn't try to locate letter boxes during hunting season when <br>
they're placed on combined use land?  Same with ORV, trailbiking, <br>
etc.  Is it dumb to think that the boxes would be respected by people <br>
who like to mow things over ;)  And who does patrol DNR land?  Would <br>
they try to require a permit as well?  Nah, couldn't be they let <br>
those smelly noisy ORV guys mow things over for free and charge us <br>
thoughtful, helpfull folks ;) ?<br>
<br>
Any insight and update  would be appreciated by my muddled mind!<br>
Milly in MI ....for awhile now<br>
