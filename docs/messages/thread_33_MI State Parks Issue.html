I would say this would be a perfect opportunity to work WITH the MI <br/>
State Parks.  Since they have not started their new policy yet, <br/>
there is time to work with them on a better policy.  I would suggest <br/>
that a couple Geocachers and Letterboxers get together and draft a <br/>
proposal for them.  Explain clearly your opposition to their new <br/>
policy and also explain to them that it will not work the way they <br/>
intend.  Instead of them making money on it, they WILL LOSE money, <br/>
because all geocaches and letterboxes WILL be either removed or <br/>
hidden without their knowledge.  (No one will pay $35 to hide a box, <br/>
even for a year.)  AND fewer people will come to their parks as a <br/>
result.  Encourage them to look at how CT and other states have <br/>
actually MADE money by controlling Geocaching and Letterboxing in <br/>
their parks and trails by ENCOURAGING it!  Work with the State Parks <br/>
to control the proliferation of boxes and caches on sensitive <br/>
areas.  Have cachers and boxers register thier boxes with the parks <br/>
for no fee - just for promotion and upkeep.  If the Parks system has <br/>
a way to freely register the caches and boxes on thier grounds, they <br/>
can have final say as to whether the place the box is intended to be <br/>
placed would be safe for the environment they are in charge of <br/>
protecting.  Let THEM suggest good locations for boxes and caches.  <br/>
Allow them to advertise that geocaching and letterboxing can be <br/>
activities done in the parks!  This should bring in more revenue <br/>
than them trying to charge people to hide boxes and caches!  By far!<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I think SpringChicks boxes in Muskegon State Park are <br/>
a huge draw!  I've been raving to the WI letterboxers and regular <br/>
folks about it being THE trip to take!<br/>
<br/>
For the record, these boxes and parks are one of the prime reasons I <br/>
took my MI letterboxing trip last summer and why I'm looking forward <br/>
to going back!  If they want any idea of how much money they took in <br/>
from just ONE letterboxer traveling through MI State Parks, they <br/>
should see my Visa bill!  I paid $20 for an annual sticker (and <br/>
probably for another one this year), I stayed about 2 1/2 weeks at <br/>
various campgrounds at the state parks around the state at about $12 <br/>
a night (about $200+).  I also bought their firewood, shopped at <br/>
campground stores, etc. that should've also produced revenue for <br/>
them too.  Now, there are a dozen or so new WI letterboxers that <br/>
seemed very interested in doing part or all of my MI trip.  Multiply <br/>
my expenses by 12 and that is some healthy income!  Add more boxes <br/>
to the parks, make us stay more, send us to the "less used" parks, <br/>
and up goes the revenue!<br/>
<br/>
I pray us in WI won't have to put up with this!  Maybe I should <br/>
start checking the WI state parks policies....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's some background I just learned about the state parks in PA and how <br/>
they handle letterboxing and geocaching. This might help if anyone wants to <br/>
approach any other state park officials.<br/>
<br/>
I recently heard from a letterboxer in Western PA who was contacted by <br/>
parks officials about their letterboxes in a state park there. The <br/>
letterboxer had to fill out a form to get approval for the letterboxes, so <br/>
I started doing some research.<br/>
<br/>
The PA DCNR web page doesn't have anything on letterboxing, but they do <br/>
have a geocaching policy (and I assume it also applies to letterboxes). I'm <br/>
going to followup with the park down the road from my home to check on <br/>
their letterbox policy, but in the mean time, I got this response from the <br/>
DCNR regarding their geocaching policy:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The following webpage contains our state park geocaching guidelines: <br/>
&gt;http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/geocaching.aspx<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you plan on placing a geocache in a specific state park, I would <br/>
&gt;recommend contacting that park office and speaking to the park manager for <br/>
&gt;further information, as he/she will have a central part in making the <br/>
&gt;determination on whether or not to approve of the geocache.  In addition, <br/>
&gt;you'll be required to submit a Geocache Identification Form, which you can <br/>
&gt;also download from the above website.<br/>
<br/>
It's interesting that they provide "official geocache" stickers to be <br/>
placed on any "registered" geocaches in PA state parks. These are the same <br/>
stickers that you can purchase from the geocaching.com web site.<br/>
<br/>
While it's an extra step that must be taken when hiding a letterbox, I'm <br/>
not opposed to their policy. At least they're not behaving like the NPS and <br/>
banning letterboxes altogether!<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Michigan geocaching steering committee is currently working with <br/>
the DNR to try and effect some change to the policy.  I have been in <br/>
contact with them and gave some perspective as to letterboxing.  The <br/>
original policy was $35 per cache/letterbox for a 3 month period of <br/>
time.  At their last meeting, they were able to get the time frame <br/>
increased to a year, although the cache/letterbox must still be <br/>
moved every 3 months and the placement fee is still $35.  They will <br/>
be meeting again, but I do not foresee that the fee will be <br/>
dropped.  The $35 fee is their base when determining special use <br/>
permit fees, which is what they consider this to be.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of things I see...  First let me say that I have <br/>
nothing against geocachers and all whom I have personally come in <br/>
contact with on the trail and via e-mail have been great people.  I <br/>
know we have a few on this list also who are involved in both <br/>
letterboxing and geocaching and I am happy to see that at least here <br/>
in Michigan, the two hobbies peacefully co-exist.  However, that <br/>
being said...  I have been hanging out over at the MiGO forum a bit <br/>
lately because of this State Parks issue and although it certainly <br/>
is not fair to slap down a blanket statement that applies to all <br/>
geocachers or all letterboxers, I see a very fundamental difference <br/>
between the two.  It is coming through loud and clear that the <br/>
majority of them (at least those who are posting to the forum) use <br/>
the parks only for their hobby -- did not use them prior to the <br/>
hobby and will not use them in the future if the fee holds.  To me, <br/>
having grown up in West MI and truly believing we are fortunate to <br/>
have some of the best State Parks in the country, that is <br/>
appalling!  It tells me that for most of them it is all about the <br/>
numbers -- collecting caches, not about the hike.  And sad to say, <br/>
but I think where a reverence for nature is lacking, there does tend <br/>
to be increased disregard for the land and environmental concerns.  <br/>
I am sure the same can be said of some letterboxers, but of those I <br/>
have met, most did not begin enjoying the out-of-doors and the parks <br/>
when they started letterboxing, rather they began letterboxing as an <br/>
activity to enhance the time they were already spending at the <br/>
parks.  And although we delight in finding the box at the end of the <br/>
trail and even plan our hikes around the boxes, we were and would <br/>
continue to use the trails and parks even if the boxes were not <br/>
there because it is not just about the numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately geocaching and letterboxing are treated equally when <br/>
it comes to policy at Michigan State Parks because at face value <br/>
they do appear to be very similar activities and it would be next to <br/>
impossible to exhalt one over the other in terms of philosophy and <br/>
environmental stewardship.<br/>
<br/>
As a parks department, if suddenly there was a large subset of <br/>
people coming to the parks for the sole purpose of playing their <br/>
game, I might try to charge them for that also.  I follow the logic <br/>
and agree that the parks are probably bringing in more money on <br/>
entrance fees and camping, etc. as it stands now, without the fee, <br/>
than if the fee were to be in place -- simply because nobody is <br/>
going to pay the fee and the activity will move out of the parks.  <br/>
But they really think people are going to pay to play and the amount <br/>
of dollars we are talking is small enough that they probably won't <br/>
notice a huge drop in revenue if geocachers and letterboxers do go <br/>
elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I was happy to hear that there is room for individual decision-<br/>
making on the part of the individual park rangers -- that even <br/>
though this policy has been handed down, they do have the ability to <br/>
make decisions as to how it will be addressed in their park on a <br/>
park-by-park, even case-by-case basis.  I am even more fortunate <br/>
that the park rangers where a number of my boxes are planted are in <br/>
favor of letterboxing and have chosen to take a wait-and-see <br/>
stance.  I will be going out this weekend to check on all of those <br/>
boxes and relocate any where slight spur trails are evident, and I <br/>
will be keeping a close eye on those boxes to ensure that they do <br/>
not cause concern with the park officials there.<br/>
<br/>
I think that trying to convince the powers that be in Lansing is a <br/>
bigger war than we have the ammunition for, rather it would be more <br/>
effective to work with the local park officials educating them on <br/>
letterboxing and setting an example of good stewardship in hopes <br/>
that either they will continue to allow them on an individual <br/>
level.  Once there has been a successful track record in that <br/>
respect, perhaps there will be some leverage at a higher level.<br/>
<br/>
Just the way I see it...<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to share the above link as another possible angle to the <br/>
discussions.  I went back and read through this thread because I was <br/>
considering collaborating with a friend on planting a box at some <br/>
sort of DNR land near her house in the country.  My confusion grows <br/>
over land usage and control when I look at an old map from the 70's <br/>
that we used to use when we lived near Midland MI for dirt bike <br/>
riding.  They have a trail that loops the upper part of the state <br/>
that can be used for ORV, they have trails for mountain bikers, they <br/>
have land for hunters.....and they have this great initiative still <br/>
in the year 2000 to link and maintain use and recreation for <br/>
everybody.  The site I'm referenceing is gun ho to draw tourist <br/>
dollars, so maybe they don't realize the State park people are trying <br/>
to cut off those same dollars?  I just think this may be an important <br/>
angle to look at?  I'm a bit of a hitchhiker here, since I'm moving <br/>
to PA soon (where I've lived before and am well aware of the corrupt <br/>
beaurocracy)  but I did want to work with a practice box and my <br/>
friend would really enjoy maintaining it and growing into the sport <br/>
as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, some of this actually crosses over into the TOTW and maybe <br/>
better addressed there.  Would it be considered "safe" to assume that <br/>
people wouldn't try to locate letter boxes during hunting season when <br/>
they're placed on combined use land?  Same with ORV, trailbiking, <br/>
etc.  Is it dumb to think that the boxes would be respected by people <br/>
who like to mow things over ;)  And who does patrol DNR land?  Would <br/>
they try to require a permit as well?  Nah, couldn't be they let <br/>
those smelly noisy ORV guys mow things over for free and charge us <br/>
thoughtful, helpfull folks ;) ?<br/>
<br/>
Any insight and update  would be appreciated by my muddled mind!<br/>
Milly in MI ....for awhile now<br/>

&gt; boxes and relocate any where slight spur trails are evident, and I <br/>
&gt; will be keeping a close eye on those boxes to ensure that they do <br/>
&gt; not cause concern with the park officials there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that trying to convince the powers that be in Lansing is a <br/>
&gt; bigger war than we have the ammunition for, rather it would be more <br/>
&gt; effective to work with the local park officials educating them on <br/>
&gt; letterboxing and setting an example of good stewardship in hopes <br/>
&gt; that either they will continue to allow them on an individual <br/>
&gt; level.  Once there has been a successful track record in that <br/>
&gt; respect, perhaps there will be some leverage at a higher level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just the way I see it...<br/>

&gt; &gt; If I may offer my two cents to my MI friends -<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I would say this would be a perfect opportunity to work WITH the <br/>
&gt; MI <br/>
&gt; &gt; State Parks.  Since they have not started their new policy yet, <br/>
&gt; &gt; there is time to work with them on a better policy.  I would <br/>
&gt; suggest <br/>
&gt; &gt; that a couple Geocachers and Letterboxers get together and draft <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; proposal for them.  Explain clearly your opposition to their new <br/>
&gt; &gt; policy and also explain to them that it will not work the way <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; &gt; intend.  Instead of them making money on it, they WILL LOSE <br/>
money, <br/>
&gt; &gt; because all geocaches and letterboxes WILL be either removed or <br/>
&gt; &gt; hidden without their knowledge.  (No one will pay $35 to hide a <br/>
&gt; box, <br/>
&gt; &gt; even for a year.)  AND fewer people will come to their parks as a <br/>
&gt; &gt; result.  Encourage them to look at how CT and other states have <br/>
&gt; &gt; actually MADE money by controlling Geocaching and Letterboxing in <br/>
&gt; &gt; their parks and trails by ENCOURAGING it!  Work with the State <br/>
&gt; Parks <br/>
&gt; &gt; to control the proliferation of boxes and caches on sensitive <br/>
&gt; &gt; areas.  Have cachers and boxers register thier boxes with the <br/>
&gt; parks <br/>
&gt; &gt; for no fee - just for promotion and upkeep.  If the Parks system <br/>
&gt; has <br/>
&gt; &gt; a way to freely register the caches and boxes on thier grounds, <br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt; &gt; can have final say as to whether the place the box is intended to <br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; placed would be safe for the environment they are in charge of <br/>
&gt; &gt; protecting.  Let THEM suggest good locations for boxes and <br/>
&gt; caches.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Allow them to advertise that geocaching and letterboxing can be <br/>
&gt; &gt; activities done in the parks!  This should bring in more revenue <br/>
&gt; &gt; than them trying to charge people to hide boxes and caches!  By <br/>
&gt; far!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To be honest, I think SpringChicks boxes in Muskegon State Park <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; &gt; a huge draw!  I've been raving to the WI letterboxers and regular <br/>
&gt; &gt; folks about it being THE trip to take!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; For the record, these boxes and parks are one of the prime <br/>
reasons <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; took my MI letterboxing trip last summer and why I'm looking <br/>
&gt; forward <br/>
&gt; &gt; to going back!  If they want any idea of how much money they took <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; from just ONE letterboxer traveling through MI State Parks, they <br/>
&gt; &gt; should see my Visa bill!  I paid $20 for an annual sticker (and <br/>
&gt; &gt; probably for another one this year), I stayed about 2 1/2 weeks <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; &gt; various campgrounds at the state parks around the state at about <br/>
&gt; $12 <br/>
&gt; &gt; a night (about $200+).  I also bought their firewood, shopped at <br/>
&gt; &gt; campground stores, etc. that should've also produced revenue for <br/>
&gt; &gt; them too.  Now, there are a dozen or so new WI letterboxers that <br/>
&gt; &gt; seemed very interested in doing part or all of my MI trip.  <br/>
&gt; Multiply <br/>
&gt; &gt; my expenses by 12 and that is some healthy income!  Add more <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the parks, make us stay more, send us to the "less used" <br/>
parks, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and up goes the revenue!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I pray us in WI won't have to put up with this!  Maybe I should <br/>
&gt; &gt; start checking the WI state parks policies....<br/>
