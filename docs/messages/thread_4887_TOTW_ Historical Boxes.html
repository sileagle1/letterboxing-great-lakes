                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was having an interesting conversation with some fellow letterboxers<br>
yesterday and the topic of historical boxes came up (i.e. boxes that<br>
have been in place for several years).  It got me to thinking about<br>
how these boxes that have survived the test of time are viewed by<br>
other letterboxers.  Is the opinion the same for seasoned letterboxers<br>
as it is for newer letterboxers?<br>
<br>
When choosing the boxes you look for, is the age of the box a factor<br>
in your decision?  Positive or negative?  Do you consider it more of a<br>
*find* to track down a box that has been hiding out for 5 years versus<br>
a box that was placed a month ago?  Do you look forward to finding a<br>
bulging logbook, filled with stamps from letterboxers from across the<br>
country or do you worry that an older box may be missing or in bad<br>
repair?  Or perhaps is the age of the box not really a factor to you<br>
at all, rather you make choices based primarily on other things --<br>
clues, hike distance, location, planter, etc.<br>
<br>
As time goes on, there are many boxes within the GL area that have<br>
stood the test of time and are aging nicely, but from my own personal<br>
experience, they don't see a lot of traffic.  One reason is that many<br>
seasoned letterboxers have already found these boxes.  Another is that<br>
there are now so many boxes for a person to choose from that any one<br>
individual box holds much less probability of being the box of choice.<br>
 This is where I wonder if the historical factor matters or not.<br>
<br>
Is there a value to maintaining these older boxes?  Or would it make<br>
sense to breathe fresh life into some of these areas by putting out<br>
new boxes?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, I hadn't really given this topic much thought.  Age is not really a factor in determining whether I go after a particular box or not.  My decisions are based on (in this order) location (is it nearby someplace I am traveling?  are there other boxes in the area?  is it someplace I can bring the dogs?), hike distance (am I on a time schedule with limited time to box or am I on a daytrip and looking for an all-day hike to make my drive worth while?), clues (can I figure them out or get someone to help me decipher them?  or am I feeling lazy that week?), and lastly planter (this is really a low priority...but some carvers are just plain amazing and I have run across the rare planter whose boxes are consistently in poor repair or missing and it isn't usually worth it to me to go after a box I *know* probably isn't there).  For me, the age of a box doesn't really give me much information about the likely condition of the box.  I do enjoy looking at logbooks with lots of<br>
 other boxer's stamps in them.  There is a thrill to being a first finder, but I really enjoy looking at the carving work of everyone who was there before me even more than being the first to put my stamp in a book....especially if we are boxing on a trip out of our home territory.<br>
<br>
I think there is a certain value to maintaining at least some of the older boxes.  While I don't necessarily see age as an incentive to look for a box, there is a certain satisfaction of finding a box that has been in place longer than I've been letterboxing...which is going on 4 years this summer.  For a box to stay in place for that long it means that a certain level of care and planning and some small amount of luck had to go into placing it.  Especially around here, where the wide-open landscape and flood plains tend to make finding a really good hiding spot that won't rot away in a few years very difficult.  As my own boxes age I do remove and replace some of them...especially if the stamp wasn't something I was particularly proud of or the amount of traffic was particularly low.  Sometimes I re-use the hiding place, using new clues and/or a new route to take boxers to the location.  Other times, I determine that I had enough trouble with that box and decide that the<br>
 location just isn't a good one.<br>

find a two of the oldest boxes in WI on my firat week of boxing. I <br>
didn't really seek them out because of their age. They just happened <br>
to be in the area that I was vacationing. They were only visited or <br>
at least loged in by 4 or 5 boxes a year. So maybe the limited visits <br>
is the reason that they have lasted so long. I say please keep some <br>
of your oldest boxes in place.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I definitely have the "older, historical" letterboxes on my radar - even<br>
if they are reported as status unknown.  When I started I think there were<br>
a total of 46 in my entire state and I was determined to get them all. <br>
When I managed to whittle the list down to about 15 to go, the new box<br>
numbers were climbing faster than I could get to them.  Now I don't even<br>
try to get every one, but I still want to find all the active boxes that<br>
were out there when I started in April, 2004.<br>
<br>
I haven't heard an update on a number of my older boxes, and I have been<br>
wondering if I should go and pick them up and retire them.  I believe if I<br>
haven't received an attempted-but-not-found report, that the boxes are<br>
most likely still in place.  If I get a report of -ewww, it's all wet and<br>
moldy - then I will probably retire that type.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough my Dora series has not been recorded for several<br>
months, and I put 4 new logbooks out last summer.  It will be FOUR years<br>
old in August.  Many new boxers tell me that this was their first<br>
experience and they really enjoyed them.  They are also in spots I think<br>
would be easy to get muggled.  But they are surviving!  I never expected<br>
them to last this long, and since I have several logbooks from the past,<br>
if they go missing I will not be sad.  <br>
<br>
With  the price of gas, we cannot letterbox every weekend.  I study the<br>
clues for every letterbox and then hand-pick a few, but not all.<br>
<br>
I will be in the Milwaukee area at the end of June for another commitment<br>
and I have prioritized my list -- I must have Triangles, Triangles,<br>
Triangles Everywhere (1&2)  and Milwaukee County Parks Series.  I don't<br>
know if Acorn's Happiness is still out there, but I would like to get that<br>
one too.  If I can manage a trip in August, I want to visit the RenFaire. <br>
Oh, there are more to find, but they will have to wait.  I look at the<br>
titles as much as I do the actual hunt; I am easily amused.<br>
<br>
I posted a note on the OHIO board at AQ.  We live about 1 hour from<br>
Cincinnati and SW OHIO, an  early letterboxing hot spot.  I was shocked to<br>
be the First Finder on 4 great boxes in Hamilton that were placed more<br>
than 4 months ago.  I think there are just too many new boxes to choose. <br>
I am not a prolific planter, but I am ruminating over some major project<br>
ideas.  I don't want to get distracted anymore than I already am.<br>
<br>
I don't think it's necessarily a good idea to reseed/saturate an area with<br>
an historic box just to increase traffic because I fear the historic box<br>
could become unduly jeopardized.<br>
<br>
Very good TOTW!<br>

 Please leave the historicals (oldies but goodies? ) in place. I like <br>
finding the older boxes as much as i like being a First Finder. <br>
 I agree with others, i like seeing the other sig stamps. <br>
<br>
I also agree i like ones that are history/area related. <br>
<br>
Obviously, some boxes become endangered and need to be moved, retired. <br>

I hope to find a lot of those Old Boxes  this year. <br>

Some of us don't plant many boxes any longer because, among other reasons, we have so many boxes already out there that it is already difficult to maintain them without adding additional boxes.  But I love planting boxes, always have, always will -- even more than seeking boxes, and making clues, particularly puzzle clues, and I'm feeling a withdrawal the past couple of years.  So I am mulling over ideas to bring in some of the older boxes and put out some new boxes and am trying to choose -- very difficult.  Leave the older ones?  Leave my personal favorites?  Leave the ones that get the most finders?  Leave the ones with good clues?  Leave the ones with good hikes?  Leave the ones in awesome places?  Pull them all and start over?<br>

My hope is that if you do decide to "retire" some, maybe we can set up a last chance area to list these with a deadline.  My family chooses our searches mostly by area, we're still new enough that we look at where we can find 3 or 4 close enough together to make an afternoon of it.  But if we knew that a box would soon disappear (and it was planted by one of our favorite planters!) it would certainly influence our choice.<br>

Thanks for your input everyone! Some of us don't plant many boxes any longer because, among other reasons, we have so many boxes already out there that it is already difficult to maintain them without adding additional boxes. But I love planting boxes, always have, always will -- even more than seeking boxes, and making clues, particularly puzzle clues, and I'm feeling a withdrawal the past couple of years. So I am mulling over ideas to bring in some of the older boxes and put out some new boxes and am trying to choose -- very difficult. Leave the older ones? Leave my personal favorites? Leave the ones that get the most finders? Leave the ones with good clues? Leave the ones with good hikes? Leave the ones in awesome places? Pull them all and start over?<br>

For B and me, how long a box has been out is rarely a factor. We <br>
prioritize mostly on planters (there are people whose boxes we adore <br>
and will drive hours out of our way to find them) and difficulty. We <br>
are both suckers for mystery boxes and those that are more than a <br>
drive-by find. Personally, I love boxes that involve several hours of <br>
hiking to find, though B is a little less enthusiastic about this! <br>
And though we have found several that are "historic" in the sense <br>
that they were among the first planted in Michigan, it wasn't why we <br>
hunted for them. Just a nice bonus. :-)<br>
<br>
I think that the boxers who have planted many of the historic boxes <br>
should plant some more, not to freshen up an area, per se, but <br>
because I like finding boxes by those people! (I am looking at <br>
SpringChick, azobox, and Grandvilla and Mobiusklein here!)<br>
<br>
Anyway, just my two cents. <br>

Otherwise, we like them in this order...awesome places to see/remember, great clues/adventure, older ones with great logbooks to look through (we love history and we are sentimental so we would like to see a couple old ones in each area stay around forever), great hikes (but that really goes back to awesome places to see), and you should, of course, keep your favorites.  Hope that helps! By the way, our priorities are based on a family with 3 young children...the clues/adventure is what they go for (well, our 6 year old anyway, the 3 year old is starting to get it and the baby doesn't care...yet!).<br>

According to LBNA only 36 boxes were planted in 1999, 43 boxes in 2000, 205  <br>

There may have been more boxes planted in those early years, that have since gone missing or been retired, and so wouldn't show up in the current totals.  But, no question about the exponential increase in planted boxes, year by year.<br>
<br>
Personally I think there's an extra bit of intrigue with the boxes that have been in place for 4 - 5 years, or more... I think maybe it's just because I've seen the clues out there for so long, and have had them on a list to find, or have plotted them out on a map, or whatever it might be, that once I finally have the opportunity to find them, it's like making a long-awaited visit to a famous landmark.  Also, how can you not get a kick out of seeing a logbook that's stamped "The Dragon - P13 F30"  or  "Wisconsin Hiker & Martini Man - F10" or the like???<br>

<br>
YES!  YES!  TJ MIch hits the nail on the head!....When this topic first came to our attention, I <br>
could only say that we really enjoy the thrill of finding an older box..it being a <br>
survivor/thriver  type thing.  But, TJ Mich's point of how we read, solve, re-read, print off, <br>
ruminate over clues (and maybe clues in far off locations...like Michigan!), and for reasons <br>
as varied as boxes, haven't gotten around to actually getting the box.  BUT, we still hold <br>
out the hope that someday we might get to actually follow the clues that are embedded <br>
into our little letterboxing psyche's.  We can almost picture every turn and rock <br>
mentioned.  As soon as I read TJ Mich's post, I immediately thought of a dozen or more <br>
boxes that fit the bill.<br>
<br>
We have box clues printed from the dark ages...back in 2002.. that are wrinkled and <br>
running with old purple ditto ink (OK, not that old..ditto ink was even before Dartmoor!) <br>
They even have the old LBNA map around them that I still hold dear and near that I <br>
think..."Maybe this year we can get up there and see if this is still in place"....<br>
<br>
Also, for those who enjoy the more challenging puzzle clues...if they are like me, Tiptoe, <br>
(Tonto not so much...) and you have spent hours, weeks, months (or years in my case - I'm <br>
not the brightest, you know...) to solve them.  They happen to have been posted a while <br>
back, they are in a distant state, but you hope and dream that you will eventually get to <br>
them....How disappointing it would be to find out that they have been pulled.  But, how <br>
awesome to finally get to stamp into a box that only a few have stamped in since 2002!<br>
<br>
This recently happened to us out in Arizona.  We had clues for a box that we had taken out <br>
with us for the last 3 years that required more than a little  bit of scramble and some <br>
sleuthing to get to.  It had been out there for centuries in letterbox years.  I can't describe <br>
the thrill that it gave us to see that only Pete and Wanda and a few local folks had found it <br>
in all those years.  It was so much more satisfying to ink our little boots into that log than <br>
the hundreds previous.  I know the placer is not local, and it is debatable that they were <br>
able to maintain it...and it didn't get visitors often enough to keep it's status up to date via <br>
feedback.  But, WOW!  Was it sweet to find it after obsessing over it for so long.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can certainly relate to the comments about boxes with puzzling clues.  Oh the countless hours spent muddling over MapSurfer clues...  and even though realistically I know I may never get to most (any?) of them, there will always be that glimmer of hope that one day my path may lead to one...  It would really be disheartening to think that they would be pulled before I got there.<br>
<br>
That is definately something to consider as I contemplate which boxes to leave and which to pull.  Since the puzzle clues are usually some of my favorite clues, they would rank pretty high on my list of keepers anyway, unless they are planted in troublesome locations -- like the Mystery Mink letterbox.  One of my favorite sets of clues and a location that would seem to be fairly safe, but I must have replaced that box 4-5 times already.  As much as I like it, it may have to be the end for this one even though I have yet another replacement stamp carved.  Although, for the most part I have found that my mystery boxes and those with more puzzling clues seem to fare better when it comes to missing/damaged boxes, which is most likely due to a smaller amount of traffic and less in and out of the hiding spot, making damage and accidental discovery less likely.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello GL friends, this is Wood Thrush over in Maryland. A few weeks<br>
ago I spent four lovely (rainy, chilly) days in the area between<br>
Cincinnati and Columbus, and thought I'd share my thoughts here on<br>
historic boxes and my "vacation" boxing.<br>
<br>
I usually print out all the clues on the two main sites plus any clues<br>
I know about on private sites. Since it's vacation boxing I do a rough<br>
sift and drop boxes that have multiple attempts. (If I were local I<br>
would not care, but I don't tend to take as many chances with vacation<br>
boxing.) I take all remaining clues along with me, just in case I wind<br>
up in a place I had not thought I'd be visiting.<br>
<br>
I do prioritize some "must-visit" boxes and try to get to those if at<br>
all possible. In my case the factors are (in no particular order)<br>
historicity, which I like; cool clues; cool location/hike (as best I<br>
can tell); and boxers I've heard of (either because of their<br>
longevity, their historical importance, their rep for good maintenance<br>
of their plants, their carving ability--this is pretty broad).<br>
<br>
Historic boxes are definitely a factor for me when I am vacation<br>
boxing. I had an absolute blast on my trip, and had it not been<br>
flooding, there are several other historic boxes I would have tried<br>
for. I hope they survived the waters intact.<br>
<br>
I found 25 boxes and attempted another 8 or so that I did not come up<br>
with. My favorite "miss" was Ft. Ancient. I conclude I misinterpreted<br>
the clues on that one. Went in what I believe was the "correct"<br>
direction first for about a mile--but did not go far enough, I now<br>
believe. Retraced my steps and went about 3 more miles in the WRONG<br>
direction, finally concluding I had been right to start with. Of<br>
course, it was dark by then, LOL. But I had a blast and met some<br>
interesting local pottery/artist folks on the trail, and had a nice<br>
long hike in the process. Great location too.<br>
<br>
My favorite box I actually found was The Wisconsin Gas Flame. This box<br>
had it all. It was an older box with awesome stamps in the log, and<br>
the instructions inside the box on "how" to stamp in were a hoot. So<br>
much fun to stamp in the correct manner and then read the log entries.<br>
Excellent, creative carve, fun clues, what could be better?<br>
<br>
Love the older boxes.<br>
