will be in Macomb or Oakland Co. MI. As a back up posible Pine River <br>
Park in St clair Co. I have been working OT and my dad just went into <br>
the hospital so I have not had to much free time to look at parks but <br>
i will have an up date by I hope March 1st. I will try to put <br>
together a list of info. (as much as I can) in the FILES section of <br>
the LB site. You can let me know what I'm missing sense I'm new at <br>
hosting. Fear not this event WILL happen! And by the way, there are <br>
only 2 things left to carve!!<br>

Thanks for understanding<br>
