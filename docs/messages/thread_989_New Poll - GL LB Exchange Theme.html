free to participate.  I understand your concern about some subjects being<br>
more difficult to carve than others, but this is not a carving contest and<br>
even primitive can be good.  One of my favorite stamps was a very simple,<br>
outline-style  lizard I found out east a couple of years ago -- carved by an<br>
8-year old child.  I think that most of us are capable of carving beyond<br>
what we feel is within our limits, but are comfortable where we are at and<br>
are a bit intimidated by going further than that.  You might be surprised<br>
what you can do if you just take your time and take it one cut at a time.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, for any subject there are interpretations that would make<br>
a simpler carving -- for instance a wildlife theme does not necessarily<br>
dictate that you carve an image of an animal detailing every hair on his<br>
body -- there are many suitable images to be found with little or no detail,<br>
simply the animal outline.  Or how about interpretting a wildlife theme by<br>
carving a stamp of animal footprints instead of the actual animal?  Likewise<br>
with a person -- I had an image ready to carve of a well-known individual<br>
who for many years spent summers at the Actor's Colony in Muskegon.  I<br>
didn't end up using it because somebody else beat me to the spot, but the<br>
image (just a face) was quite simple -- half positive, half negative, no<br>
detail, yet it was very clear to see who the person was.<br>
<br>
You get the idea -- stretch the limits of what you think you are capable of,<br>
think outside the box and interpret the theme to make it work for you -- <br>
regardless of which theme is chosen, and I am sure your carving will be<br>
great!<br>

carving. I believe that most of us are capable of<br>
carving a lot more than we think we can. I never<br>
thought that I would be able to carve a person, but<br>
this weekend I tried and carved a pretty good stamp of<br>
Jean Lafitte for my upcoming New Orleans trip. I think<br>
we all get caught up in the details instead of<br>
remembering simplicity. A good transfer method also<br>
helps, for Lafitte I used a 4B soft lead drawing<br>
pencil, outlined a picture from the internet and<br>
rubbed it on the carving medium. If I could find my<br>
scanner, which for some reason is missing, I would<br>
scan in a picture of it. Dang it, where did I put that<br>
scanner?<br>

Just a quick question . . . are you heading down to New Olreans for <br>
Mardi Gras?  I am heading down there next week for Carnivale and I <br>
would love to search for your Lafitte letterbox and maybe meet up for <br>
an exchange.  I was planning on trying to find a few local boxes <br>
while I was down there anyways . . . and it would be great to add a <br>
first finder to that list.  Just give me an email offlist if you want <br>
to meet up down there.  My email is Gr8ful7276 at aol dot com<br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>
