<br/>
Wow, only letterboxing for one year and already almost 250 finds?  No wonder you are starting to get burned out.  I've been boxing for over 3 years and am sitting at 196 finds right now.  I'm sure this relatively low total is due to the fact that boxing is only my 2nd favorite outdoor activity, after trail riding.  And by the way, I have been an avid trail rider for over 40 years - proof that a hobby (or obsession, as my husband has sometimes called it) can indeed last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely hope your enthusiasm returns!  Perhaps a little respite from boxing during the winter months is what you need?  Hopefully you will be rarin' to go again by the time we all gather again at the Silo in 3 months :)<br/>

Funny you should reply to this string again . . . I thought it was dead.<br/>
<br/>
I have been going through a personal crisis of sorts with this hobby. I love <br/>
this hobby and I will never give it up, however, the honeymoon is definitely <br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
I've noticed over the course of the last 6 to 8 weeks that I'm just not as <br/>
excited as I once was. I think this is in large part to my over ambitious <br/>
nature... when I get hooked on something I go FULL throttle. <br/>
<br/>
For example, our one year anniversary is next week (Nov. 25th), our counts <br/>
are P 64 F 243 X 83.<br/>
<br/>
I currently am in the middle of carving my 100th stamp!!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm a bit burned out, I never thought it would happen with <br/>
letterboxing though. Perhaps some of you seasoned veterans of the hobby can give some <br/>
words of encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
I figured with any addiction you have to raise the risk factor to get the <br/>
same thrill you once did... so tonight while driving to Oregon, Illinois for <br/>
work I decided to find Pastors Wife's "John Deere Plow" in the dark during <br/>
hunting season!! There were signs everywhere saying the park was closed due to <br/>
the fact that hunters could bag a deer or two. Don't worry.... no one shot at <br/>
me, though in the dark I may or may not look like a deer.<br/>
<br/>
Beetle, with a last name like Hart there are many options... I will forgo <br/>
the 2nd grade humor though ;-)<br/>
I have no problem with changing my signature stamp... though changing our <br/>
trail name seems to be a little bit of a snag to me.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if I draw to much of my boxing "identity" from our trail name <br/>
or the tape I may have to cut through on LBNA and AQ to change my trailname. I <br/>
must say though, I am very intrigued by "6 of Harts" that you recommended and <br/>
I have even sketched out a few possibilities for signature stamp images <br/>
going on that name.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the long, rambling Email, just kinda down I guess.<br/>
