near Conklin, MI.  I was FF at these boxes -- it has been a while <br/>
since that has happened!  <br/>
<br/>
For anyone who may be heading to these boxes in the near future -- <br/>
in about a week the spring wildflowers will be gorgeous.  The woods <br/>
are covered with them and a few trillium and voilets were just <br/>
beginning to peek out.  Also, there is much poison ivy, so be <br/>
watchful for that (especially near box #3).<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a very nice Saturday morning walk in the park.  Thanks <br/>
to JayBee and M.O.E. for placing this series!<br/>
