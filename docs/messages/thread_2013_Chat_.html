group.  I know that the Wolfs had tried to get this going earlier this <br/>
year and it never really took off.<br/>
<br/>
Is there interest?  Is there anyone who would be willing to be the chat <br/>
facilitator?  There is not a lot involved -- post reminders, assist <br/>
people who have a problem getting into the chat room, be present during <br/>
chat sessions and initiate topics if the conversation is not carrying <br/>
itself.<br/>

chatty kind.  I think probably it is best to leave it rest for a bit.  <br/>
Anyone is certainly welcome to try and organize an impromptu chat <br/>
session at any time they'd like, but for now, nothing is scheduled on <br/>
a regular basis.<br/>
