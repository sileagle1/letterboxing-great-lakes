                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I'm in charge of the workshops for this gathering (and I would kind of like for there to be at least one and no one else has volunteered for sure yet) it seems appropriate for me to teach one :)  I will be presenting a workshop on how I turn photographs into stamp images.  This is a fairly easy method and I have used it for a large number of my stamps, including my beautiful fish tank series and my signature stamp.  <br>
<br>
If you are planning on attending the gathering and would like to participate, please bring with you a simple black and white picture and carving medium.  Small pictures with a lot of contrast work best.  I will bring a few with me for people who show up and want to do the workshop but don't have their own supplies, but my supplies will be limited and probably not very exciting.  This information will be up on the gathering website soon (when I can get hold of Katy and ask her to add it...probably Monday or Tuesday...maybe).  It should be a fun workshop, I'm looking forward to it!<br>
