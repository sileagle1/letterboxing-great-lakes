                    <div class="plaintext-content">On September 20th we went up to Galena with a few of our very closest <br/>
friends (albeit non-boxers).<br/>
<br/>
I re-placed 3 boxes, hid a new box and checked on many others. To my <br/>
knowledge ALL of my boxes in Galena are now in place and ready to be <br/>
found.<br/>
<br/>
I have updated some of the clues. All of my clues can now be found on <br/>
my personal website (have you found it yet??) except for <br/>
the "Memories of a Life Time" for now, you have to Email me for those <br/>
4 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few boxes I have clues to on AQ &amp; LBNA.<br/>
<br/>
The very next week, we decided to head north again. We hit Mount <br/>
Carroll, and boy oh boy are these boxes worth finding!!! Garfan is <br/>
one of the best carvers I know, and so much fun to just hang out with.<br/>
<br/>
Then we headed up to Woodbine to find 3 boxes, Apple River Fort in <br/>
Elizabeth and then on to Galena for the second time in as many weeks.<br/>
<br/>
We found the last couple of boxes in Jo Davies county.<br/>
<br/>
On our way out of town towards Dubuque I decided to run into Stoney <br/>
Creek Inn. My Wandering Moose stamp hadn't been found in a very long <br/>
time and I wondered if it was still in place. If it were in place I <br/>
was going to pull it and re-hide it.<br/>
<br/>
Once I found the box, still in place, I found many many people who <br/>
had logged into the box without logging it on either AQ or LBNA. <br/>
<br/>
On top of that, there were two stamped images in the logbook <br/>
from "The Stoney Creek Gang" who wrote in the log, "we wont tell a <br/>
soul."<br/>
<br/>
I was so excited, and with this I decided to leave the box in place.<br/>
<br/>
So, to all interested in visiting the Galena area, all boxes are in <br/>
place and ready to be found!! <br/>
