Metra has a little something for everyone this long Thanksgiving holiday<br/>
weekend.<br/>

Express in IMAX 3D at Navy Pier's Imax Theatre  where Metra riders receive<br/>
an additional savings.<br/>

and Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year.  As always, the $5 Weekend<br/>
Pass is valid Saturday and Sunday.<br/>
