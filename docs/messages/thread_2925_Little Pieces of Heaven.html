Well ~ good!  Just so happens there is a Little Piece of Heaven in <br>
many cemeteries in Ottawa County, MI.<br>
<br>
However ~ #7 has been pulled due to some nasty poison ivy in the <br>
area.  But ~ if you read the clues, you may still be able to get it.<br>
<br>
#9 needed a correction in the driving directions - thanks to <br>
SpringChick, bless her heart - she is a dedicated one!  (Sorry it's <br>
taken me so long to fix it...)<br>

That's all for now!<br>

If you are in West Michigan and have a chance to do this series of boxes, I<br>
highly recommend them.  I was a little apprehensive about letterboxing in<br>
cemeteries at first, but really enjoyed visiting these places and found some<br>
wonderful history.  The boxes are all very respectfully placed and it is a<br>
nice series of stamps.<br>
