  You were our first on the trail exchange. I think our last count was 8 boxes and the one exchange. Our little one (2 1/2 yo girl) literally fell asleep on daddy shoulders and our 5 1/2 yo boy was starting to yawn while walking so we called it a day. lol<br>
   <br>
  What fun we'd love to go back and plan on doing that at some point to pick up the other 2 permanent boxes we missed. What a great park !!!<br>

Glad you and everybody are continuing to enjoy all the boxes at Maybury.   The Nickerboxer and Little WoodChuck and I had fun finding Snorkeling Troll and Roses and Juleps... not to mention the extra bonus of bumping into the 7 Huckabys and Spartanfans.   We're still hoping to head back once last time this month for TrailTroll's last 2 temporary boxes.  Have to get the complete set, you know!!<br>
