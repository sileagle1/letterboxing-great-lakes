Hi, My family went for a walk on Mother's day today. As we took a snack break under a nice shady tree, my daughter poked around like 6 year olds do and said "I found a treasure!" She pulled a camo-taped box out of a tree crotch. We were very surprised as we have never letterboxed before. Turns out she just happened to pack a little notebook and pencil in her backpack and could sign in. I'm not completely sure this is the exact box you are refering to in this clue because the clues imply a rock pile and this was in a tree crotch, but I recognize the "Wisconsin Hiker" from a green card we saw in there. But of course we did not know anything about clues to find the box - it was an accident! Anyway, everything looked to be pretty safe and dry and this letterboxing stuff looks pretty cool and fun for families. I think we will give it a try!<br>
