                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recall from a trip out east seeing some letterbox clues to boxes<br>
accessible only by kayak or canoe.  I think it is a cool idea even if you<br>
could only get to them via water.  I've considered doing a "boat to it"<br>
series along the Lake Michigan shoreline, but just haven't had the time to<br>
make work of it.  I also have one to plant on an island at a lake in<br>
Michigan where a person would have to have some sort of watercraft (or be a<br>
really good swimmer) to get there.<br>
<br>
There is nothing that says letterboxes have to be accessible by foot or that<br>
every letterbox needs to be accessible to every person.  Some of these more<br>
remote and obscure boxes turn out to be the most prized finds, just because<br>
of the effort to get there and the fact that you have found a box many<br>
others will pass by because it is not so quick and easy.<br>
<br>
Of course if you place boxes that are a bit more difficult to get to, you<br>
also have to be willing to accept that there may not be so many finders.<br>
Personally that doesn't matter to me -- I'd rather have 3 people who had to<br>
really work to get a box (i.e. difficult clues, hike, location, mystery,<br>
etc.) -- and therefore got an immense sense of satisfaction when the box was<br>
finally found, than 30 people who drove up to the box on the way to the<br>
grocery store.  Quality vs quantity.<br>
<br>
Go for it, great idea!<br>
