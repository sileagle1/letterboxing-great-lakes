<br/>
I'm sad to hear that this box may be retired.  I was told that there is a sign that was placed at the beginning of the trail informing us that "This is no longer a letterbox location,"  but the box is still in it's hiding place.  So maybe the ranger is hoping that someone will pick up the box and retire it.  <br/>
<br/>
Rather than loose the original logbook with all that history, maybe someone should contact The Dragon and make arrangements with him to retrieve this box and return it to him.  Maybe it can be placed in a different location.  <br/>

<br/>
  First, the oldest box in IL is/was the one in Evanston. It has been <br/>
  missing for quite some time. It was amazing that it survived as long <br/>
  as it did as the place was very tenuous. I personally found it and <br/>
  checked on it a couple of times and verified it was missing. Without <br/>
  checking my records, I'm sure it was placed before 2000.<br/>
<br/>
  As for WI, I've been trying to get up to Door Cty. to check on <br/>
  placement dates. The main reason is that we are trying to have a 10 <br/>
  year anniversary gathering for WI and I needed to know the date of <br/>
  the placement of Cave Point and to verify that it was the first <br/>
  plant, as there is some dispute as Beetle brought up. My memorory <br/>
  needs clarifying, but I beleive that Cave Point IS the first in Sept. <br/>
  1998 and Mink River was placed in the spring of 1999 (sloppy 9 looks <br/>
  like an 8 in the log?).<br/>
<br/>
  Just a note on Mink River...it may not be there much longer. A <br/>
  ranger contacted me to remove it, but we have tried to contact him <br/>
  MANY times without any response from him. Personally, this has led <br/>
  me to believe that he either doesn't have the authority he said he <br/>
  had or the email I got was a fake. As for now, I'm not removing the <br/>
  box until he contacts me again.<br/>
