                    <div class="plaintext-content">11 months ago I got myself into what has become one of the largest projects I've ever worked on. A project much bigger than myself . . . a project that I alone could not do.<br>
<br>
With the help of Pitties & Shorty, we are about to see this project to fruition. <br>
<br>
The past year has been amazing!! I can't tell you the thousands of hours spent on-line researching and getting just the right image. Or the hundreds of hours spent carving . . . or the 4 days it took me to type everything up into a nice story clue.<br>
<br>
Just so you know, you can multiply the above paragraph three times over!!!! This project, with the exception of the logbooks (shorty & pitties did all of those -- thanks guys!) has been equally carried out by all three of us. I am blessed to have worked with Pitties & Shorty on this project ---- and blessed that we have another LARGE project brewing with the GLG!!!<br>
<br>
Now that the end is so close, all my carvings are done, all my story/clues are done. Now all that is left is the big reveal . . . Pitties, Shorty & I have been dreaming of the big reveal for months now!<br>
<br>
We pushed ourselves to get this all done, well before GLG -- giving you all something to look forward to -- better yet, giving you a reason to come back to Illinois and our neck of the woods.<br>
<br>
This has been our baby for nearly a year, we trust you all to take good care of it. Soon, this project will be just as much yours as it is ours!<br>

DREAMING!  Are you kidding?  You can sleep knowing that all of us have gotten NO sleep in days trying to figure out what the random clue words and numbers mean that you've been teasing us with!  When the reveal comes...don't be surprised if you find a bunch of zombies walking around with clue sheets uttering words like "Mississippi"..."Green"...and Tiptoe's favorite..."HUNK"!!!...BTW is that in reference to Matt or Shorty?<br>

I completely agree with Hart x6, this has been an amazing adventure. It has been a true joy working with Hart x6 & Shorty this past year. Over 1,000 posts back & forth to each other, an entire winter spent carving & then intense spring planting. Finally, our seemingly-random hinting will be done and you should be able to put 2 & 2 together, unlocking this secret we are so desperate to share. Please contact us off board if you think you have the keys to enter....<br>

11 months ago I got myself into what has become one of the largest projects I've ever worked on. A project much bigger than myself . . . a project that I alone could not do.<br>
<br>
With the help of Pitties & Shorty, we are about to see this project to fruition. <br>
<br>
The past year has been amazing!! I can't tell you the thousands of hours spent on-line researching and getting just the right image. Or the hundreds of hours spent carving . . . or the 4 days it took me to type everything up into a nice story clue.<br>
<br>
Just so you know, you can multiply the above paragraph three times over!!!! This project, with the exception of the logbooks (shorty & pitties did all of those -- thanks guys!) has been equally carried out by all three of us. I am blessed to have worked with Pitties & Shorty on this project ---- and blessed that we have another LARGE project brewing with the GLG!!!<br>
<br>
Now that the end is so close, all my carvings are done, all my story/clues are done. Now all that is left is the big reveal . . . Pitties, Shorty & I have been dreaming of the big reveal for months now!<br>
<br>
We pushed ourselves to get this all done, well before GLG -- giving you all something to look forward to -- better yet, giving you a reason to come back to Illinois and our neck of the woods.<br>
<br>
This has been our baby for nearly a year, we trust you all to take good care of it. Soon, this project will be just as much yours as it is ours!<br>
