                    <div class="plaintext-content">While lost in cyberspace in the fall of 2002, Tiptoe came across the <br>
LBNA carving page and couldn't believe that there actually existed a <br>
hobby...er world... that encircled all of her and Tonto's favorite <br>
things.  We love hiking, travel, nature, history, art and people.  <br>
Letterboxing has it all!  It took us until February of 2003 to find <br>
our first letterbox which happened to be on the Appalachian Trail... <br>
in the snow...As posted before, I was so moved by this experience, <br>
that I actually cried.  Tonto thought it was great, but he saves his <br>
tears for the big stuff in life...like finishing the Around the <br>
World in 80 Days series!  Just kidding!<br>
<br>
We've found that our friends, family and ...our adult children (Yes, <br>
that is a truthful oxymoron) think we have lost our minds.  One <br>
friend always puts on our answering machine the same following <br>
message..."I guess you two aren't home..probably doing that stupid <br>
match-booking thing you do.."  "Match-booking?  (Spring Chick, do <br>
you think we could invent a new twist to the game?)<br>
<br>
We letterbox whenever we get the chance.  We've even fallen into the <br>
powerful hold of letting the boxes dictate trip itineraries.  This <br>
has resulted in many shared adventures together that otherwise <br>
would've never happened. (Sarah, of Leapin' Lizard fame, hear us on <br>
this one!)...We are grateful for those times together even though <br>
much of the time we are arguing with each other! (Kiss Me Kate and <br>
Barefoot Ankh can attest to that)But, love conquers all..even <br>
letterbox feuds!  It has proven to be the best marriage therapy of <br>
our 26 years togehter.<br>
<br>
We aren't the swiftest boxers ..we've reached a little over 400 <br>
actual found boxes in 12 states in the four years of boxing.  We are <br>
the great procrastinators having only planted a handfull of boxes, <br>
but those have been enjoyable as well when we hear from grateful <br>
visitors...We have thoroughly enjoyed the Gatherings/Events where <br>
we've collected another 100+ "non-found" assorted stamps, and the <br>
coveted 98 exchanges.  Getting to know fellow boxers has been such a <br>
treat...It is the creative, warm, fun-loving, clever folks that make <br>
this such a terrific hobby..and put a face behind the boxes.  <br>
<br>
FREE words of wisdom to new boxers: the tendency to go at <br>
letterboxing full throttle at first may bring more frustration and <br>
disappointment than if you allow yourself to experience all the <br>
different layers of the sport a little at a time.  Each box has a <br>
unique spin...and will give you a little more understanding of the <br>
complexities that aren't always evident from the start.  Get several <br>
finds under your belt before placing - it will pay off in the long <br>
run.  Like savoring that box of fine chocolates.  (Ask Forrest Gump <br>
about that...I'm sure he was also a letterboxer!)  We still are <br>
often pathetic clue-decipherers, box finders and box placers (think <br>
flood plains)...always something to learn...and figure-out. But it <br>
is such a thrill when you are right!<br>
<br>
Only bad thing, is real life and work have this nasty way of getting <br>
in the way! But, that is where the stealth and sneakiness that <br>
letterboxing has instilled in us pays off...Tonto has become an <br>
expert at making a sale or troubleshooting on his cell phone while <br>
simultaneously proding a dead tree with a stick!  Thankfully, <br>
clients don't have a clue he is knee deep in poison ivy rather than <br>
in a suit at some office!  Oh, the joy of technology!...Now if only <br>
I could get out of the classroom as readily!<br>
<br>
Autumn is upon us and brings along our favorite time to box!  So, if <br>
you hear squabbling in the woods and see a couple that look like <br>
Jack Sprat and his wife...ask for an exchange...and lend a hand at <br>
finding that "stupid match-book!"<br>
