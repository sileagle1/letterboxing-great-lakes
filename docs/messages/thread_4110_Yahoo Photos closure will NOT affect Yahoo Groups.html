Hold on, that's not right -- Yahoo Groups is not affected by their <br>
decision to shut down Yahoo Photos. This comes straight from Yahoo's <br>
moderator central group, where they've specifically said that Groups <br>
are completely different from the personal Yahoo Photos site, and <br>
that the Photos option in Yahoo Groups is not changing at all.<br>
