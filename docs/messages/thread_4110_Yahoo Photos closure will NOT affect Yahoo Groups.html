&gt;I just heard through another yahoo group that the Photos option is <br/>
&gt;leaving Yahoo groups at<br/>
&gt;the end of the summer. Here is the link that was posted. Just <br/>
&gt;thought we might want to get<br/>
&gt;a head start to save any or all of the group photos.<br/>
<br/>
Hold on, that's not right -- Yahoo Groups is not affected by their <br/>
decision to shut down Yahoo Photos. This comes straight from Yahoo's <br/>
moderator central group, where they've specifically said that Groups <br/>
are completely different from the personal Yahoo Photos site, and <br/>
that the Photos option in Yahoo Groups is not changing at all.<br/>
