Re the winery in Genoa - the owners have a wine-tasting every Saturday <br/>
afternoon.  And in any event, if you happen to be there on a day other than <br/>
Saturday, they usually will give you a sample nip of whatever wine you might <br/>
be considering.  NamVet is quite fond of their Kishwaukee Blue (the bottle <br/>
with the blue heron on the label) but my favorite is their Prairie Dog . . . <br/>
in fact, we killed a bottle of that last night while munching on some of the <br/>
snacks/fruit/desserts we managed to bring home from the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
<cough cough=""> and for anyone thinking of a visit, you might check out the <br/>
clues for the "Cogberry Wine" mystery box :)<br/>

We DITTO DITTO DITTO all the other wonderful comments! You did a great<br/>
job organizing it--nice park and lodge, beautiful weather, delicious<br/>
food, great stamps. All that, and a bird CD as well! I'm going to<br/>
need to look for that prairie winery. Don't know what the wine tastes<br/>
like, but those labels are a work of art! It was nice meeting some new<br/>
boxers, and getting to know some other boxers a little better.<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU for a wonderful gathering!<br/>
