But this was another one for the good memories book. WiHi and I enjoyed ourselves immensely. Any letterboxing crowd is a good crowd, but we know so many of you know that it's exactly like a family reunion.<br/>
<br/>
Atomic Beans: You guys did a superlative job and no amount of thanks is enough. However, if any one needs a highly detailed map of the Castle Rock trails published, I'm sending them your way as I bet you are now the resident experts.<br/>
<br/>
Again many thanks and well wishes and looking forward to 2016!<br/>
