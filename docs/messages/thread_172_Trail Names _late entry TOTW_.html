Bindle Bum had no input into what his trail name would be. (grin)  <br>
<br>
I stumbled on letterboxing while surfing the net one night, link <br>
hopping.  I think it began with an image search on google, but I'm <br>
not even sure of that.<br>
<br>
I was instantly captivated by the idea and within hours had carved <br>
my first stamp. LOL ... hacked up an erase with a kitchen knife at <br>
2am!  Went to Michael's the next morning to purchase "the real <br>
stuff" and created our signature stamp.<br>
<br>
I didn't know ANYTHING about signature stamps at this point. I <br>
hadn't even been out to look for letterboxes yet. (grin)  I thought <br>
our signature stamp had to be something we could both share. LOL!  <br>
So, I tried to come up with initials for the stamp which could apply <br>
to either or both of us.  <br>
<br>
Background:  we're passionate about sailing and inordinately fond of <br>
our 'good old boat' Bindlestiff.  You can see where this is going, <br>
can't you?  (grin)  <br>
<br>
Deeper background: Bindlestiff is a synonym for hobo or gypsy. My <br>
spouse is former military ... we once moved 9 times in a five-year <br>
period. <br>
<br>
OK, so the initial "B" and a sailboat image were going to be a part <br>
of the signature stamp.  From there I just tried to come up with <br>
something that would go with "Bindle" and fit both/either of us.  <br>
So, it became a double "BB" (Bindle Babe and Bindle Bum) a sailboat, <br>
and a 'bindle' aka: hobo bundle-on-a-stick.<br>
<br>
Note: as with many things on the internet; Bindle "Babe" and <br>
Bindle "Bum" have NOTHING what so ever to do with how we look in <br>
real life. ROFL!!<br>
<br>
The first one I carved, I was still working in "reverse image" mode. <br>
(ie: I carved out the lines and left the background as the part that <br>
stamped) Once I felt more comfortable with carving, I carved it the <br>
other-way around.  I also learned that our stamp is a little on the <br>
large side, so I carved a tiny sailboat, which we use as <br>
our 'alternate' signature stamp.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
