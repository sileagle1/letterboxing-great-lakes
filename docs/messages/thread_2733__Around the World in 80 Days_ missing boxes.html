encountered by "80 Days" visitors.<br>
<br>
Box number Two seems to have been swept away by water.<br>
(evidence was reportedly found donwstream)<br>
Box number Five has trail blockage due to downed trees.<br>
<br>
AtW maintenance crews are being notified and will be dispatched as<br>
soon as they are available, though it may take several days.<br>
(Kind of like the power company -- "full service will be restored as<br>
soon as crews can get to the more remote sites")<br>
In some cases, reconstruction may be necessary.<br>
<br>
We are sorry for the disruption and apologize for your inconvenience.<br>
<br>
Your patience is appreciated.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Travel Team<br>
