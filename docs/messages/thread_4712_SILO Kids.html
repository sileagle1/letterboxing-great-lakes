Although I am not "officially" signed up on AQ yet for the event, we <br>
are planning on going. I will be bringing all my kids (11,10,&5) and <br>
also our 8 year old foster daughter, if we still have her then. <br>

Actually, they're Little Darlings!  It's so refreshing to see children and their parents doing things together as a family, especially something like letterboxing. Just good clean fun!   Last year, they were the spreaders of the cooties.  I'm still laughing about all the cooties I found in my stuff.  <br>
<br>
All children are more than welcome to attend.  If they bring their signature stamp and their logbook, there will be plenty to keep them busy and they can eat lunch too.  <br>
