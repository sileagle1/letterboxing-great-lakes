                    <div class="plaintext-content">A belated thanks to Dartmoor Dreamer and her able assistant "I'm with her"(aka husband) for hosting a great event this past Sunday!<br/>
<br/>
She asked us to do some "homework" during the month before the event. It required us to undertake some optional tasks and research not only our own logbooks, but also some letterboxing history.  Upon arriving at the event we turned in our homework so our scores could be tallied and then received a general area map, some clues (&amp; photos to accompany many of the clues) and a scavenger hunt spreadsheet.<br/>
<br/>
While everyone filtered into the event location (a nice roomy area) they also dropped off treats for the snack table and an assortment of items and decorations which were quickly recognized as "HIPS (hidden in plain sight) boxes.  Conversation, munching, exchanges and stamping into the HIPS boxes ensued until most of the group was assembled.<br/>
<br/>
We then got our official instructions from Dartmoor Dreamer, who encouraged us to form teams to tackle the hunt.  Martini Man and I teamed up with the Red Cat and ArtGekko.  Before heading out in the van, we all quickly paged through some bibles (which were handy since we met at a church!) to decipher one of the clues.  Then we were off, with Martini Man at the wheel, Red Cat at her Smart Phone, and ArtGekko and I studying up the spreadsheet to see what items we could complere to get points.  We had 3 hours before we had to be back, but the time flew by as we hunted boxes, took photos, answered questions and searched for items.<br/>
<br/>
When we returned we turned in our sheets and continued chatting and stamping.  We were pleased to see that Gooble Gobble had stopped by to spend some time with the rest of the group. Dartmoor Dreamer then announced the contest results and everyone received prizes.  Eventually people trickled out, well past the official event ending time.  <br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of fun doing the hunt and it was really great to chat with these MN boxers, many of which we haven't seen in a couple of years.<br/>
<br/>
We really appreciated all the effort DD put into creating and executing the event!<br/>
