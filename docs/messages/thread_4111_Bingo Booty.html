<br/>
The various pieces of carving media inspired me to finally create a new signature stamp to replace our well-worn, original TJ_Mich (the first stamp I ever carved, back in 2003) so I look forward to "re-exchanging" with lots of folks this weekend!   Even though we're now permanently settled in Wisconsin, we'll always be TJ_Mich... just an emphasis on the Lake instead of the state.<br/>

==============================<br/>
<br/>
Well, Azobox said he won't be hosting  the Side Wagers game this year.<br/>
However since I'd hate to see this "tradition" fall by the wayside, I've<br/>
decided to step in to host it instead.  I've taken the liberty of copying<br/>
his rules from last year and setting up the game for this year.  Here's the<br/>
scoop:<br/>
<br/>
Side Wagers 2009<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Side Wager:  A wager on a particular team, or side, to win a contest<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you'd again like to add some excitement to the Letterboxing Bingo game,<br/>
enter the Side Wagers Game. Email the date you think the game will end to<br/>
kotlarek@wi.rr.com<br/>
<br/>
When will SpringChick pull the item that finally and completely fills in<br/>
some player's card?  Again, this is the Big Game here, not the five interim<br/>
games. The date will be determined by the claiming of a successful card by a<br/>
BINGO player (and its certification by SpringChick).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your guess must be submitted before January 1, 2009.<br/>
<br/>
Mail to kotlarek@wi.rr.com<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the subject line, put "Sidewager".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The winner's prize goes to the person who is closest *before* the day the<br/>
Bingo Game ends or actually hits the date on the dot. If you choose February<br/>
15th, for example, and someone else chooses the 20th, and the game ends on<br/>
the 19th, you win. In other words, you'll hold all of the days until the<br/>
next guesser hits the calendar. (But you don't know who has chosen which<br/>
days or how far apart they've fallen  -- and neither does SpringChick!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If two or more players choose the same date the first guesser is given the<br/>
date and another available date will be assigned to anyone else who chooses<br/>
the date already taken. This will be done by moving out in the calendar<br/>
until a date between your choice and the next one chosen is available.  So,<br/>
if you choose Feb 20 and it's already taken, and the next date chosen is the<br/>
24th, you'll be assigned the 22nd.  If there is another player already on<br/>
that date and it is not available, you'll move to the next available date.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A prize will be awarded to the lucky winner.<br/>
<br/>
You do not need to be a player in the big game to participate.<br/>

Wow - the Great Lakes gang has some great ideas and contributed great booty!  I feel very lucky to have come in second and gotten all these wonderful prizes.  Thanks to all - and mostly, thanks to Familyof6 for running it this year.  And thanks to SpringChick for having this idea in the first place, several years ago, to keep us occupied during the first quarter of the year.<br/>

&gt; Now it's OFFICIALLY over! <br/>
&gt;  I got my booty box today!!! Some great items in there!  Whoever donated the "new and improved Make your own hitchhiker kit", including a piece of PZ cut...love it!  I also love the 3 handy safety whistles, although my ears are telling me different, now that the kids found them!  <br/>
&gt; I think i got enough fixings to make at least 4 boxes!<br/>
&gt; Definitely got me in the mood for boxing!!!<br/>
&gt; Thanks everyone for the great winter fun!<br/>
