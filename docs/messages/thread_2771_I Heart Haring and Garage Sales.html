<br/>
I Heart Haring is alive and well.  We've updated the clues due to <br/>
some park renovations that changed our landmarks.<br/>
<br/>
We will be having another garage sale on July 21 and 22 from 7am <br/>
until 4pm.  Our Garage Sale Treasure box will be available, if you <br/>
can find us.<br/>
<br/>
We are recarving the final stamps for the Vive Montmartre and <br/>
Sternennacht series this week and will have these stamps available <br/>
at the garage sale also, for those of you who missed them on your <br/>
original attempt for these boxes.  After the garage sale is over, we <br/>
will be replacing them in their respective parks.  (We will need to <br/>
update the clues for Vive Montmartre at that time since the original <br/>
hiding space has disintigrated.)<br/>
<br/>
We have a few more boxes ready to plant and hope to do so this week <br/>
before the garage sale, so stay tuned for new clues.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
