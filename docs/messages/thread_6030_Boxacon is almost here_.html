<br/>
We are getting close to Boxacon, the gathering in Waukesha in Wisconsin October 3rd.  If you were planning on sending a box for the event, please drop me an email to get the address to mail it on to me.  If you are planting your own boxes, let me know and get me the clues once you have it planted so I can start working on clue packets.  The website has a list of boxes, guests, and potluck information if you want to see where we are at right now.  See you all in several weeks!<br/>
