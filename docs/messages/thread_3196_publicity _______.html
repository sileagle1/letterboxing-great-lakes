`Letterboxers' are on a quest for a rubber stamp<br>

ALBANY, N.Y. -- Any hobby can become addictive. <br>
But to folks such as Turtle Run, Mookie and <br>
others, the thought that any boulder or patch of <br>
woods they pass might be hiding a "letterbox" can be excruciating.<br>
<br>
Compared with most people's idea of buried <br>
treasure, the average letterbox is usually just a <br>
plastic food storage container -- doesn't look <br>
like anything special. All it contains is a <br>
rubber stamp (often hand-carved), an inkpad, and <br>
a logbook and a pen. The fun is in the design, and in the finding.<br>
<br>
Using clues posted on Web sites such as <br>
www.letterboxing.org and www.atlasquest.com, avid <br>
letterboxers travel around the area and the <br>
country to collect stamps from boxes with names <br>
such as "Snakes on a Grave," "Where the Elf <br>
Hides" and "The Sagamore Canoe" for their own logbooks.<br>
<br>
They can be planted anywhere from a chink in the <br>
side of a brick office building to the top of a <br>
mountain, and may involve a 15-minute walk <br>
through a park, a quick stop at a highway rest <br>
area or an all-day hike to locate. Once found, <br>
letterboxers mark the box's logbook with their <br>
personal stamp, often leaving a comment about the hunt.<br>
<br>
Although the letterboxing craze in America is <br>
only a few years old (the activity got its start <br>
150 years ago in England), it's growing. One <br>
Albany area group is hoping to expand <br>
letterboxing's popularity even more with a <br>
program called "questing," which helps children <br>
learn about their community through the creation of letterbox walking tours.<br>
<br>
A frequent letterbox creator is Martha Starke, <br>
also known as "Mookie," who has taught <br>
stampmaking and clue writing to kids at her home <br>
in Greenfield, N.Y. Starke is now applying for a <br>
grant to do a questing project with the Saratoga <br>
Mentoring Program of Catholic Charities, which <br>
matches children from single-parent homes with adult volunteers.<br>
<br>
Two years ago she held a questing workshop for <br>
students of the Waldorf School of Saratoga <br>
Springs, N.Y., who were studying geology and <br>
printmaking. The Waldorf quest investigated the <br>
nearby Petrified Sea Gardens, a private preserve <br>
featuring the fossils of ancient sea creatures. <br>
Starke showed the students exploration techniques <br>
such as sound mapping, in which they simply sat in silence and listened.<br>
<br>
"We heard birds and running water -- and <br>
construction vehicles," she says. "That's how we <br>
learned that the Sea Gardens are owned by a quarry."<br>
<br>
History soon became as important as geology. The <br>
students discovered that weddings have been held <br>
there, and some people have had their ashes scattered there.<br>
<br>
"Then you decide on the story you want to tell," Starke says.<br>

Contact the author, Kathy Ceceri<br>
<br>
worldcrafts@jjctech.com<br>
<br>
She's apparently a prolific author in the areas of<br>
home-schooling, ancient crafting, and 'local'<br>
reviewing.  Her work has been angrily contested by<br>
several readers in editorial, particularly her theater<br>
commentary.<br>
<br>
I doubt it will matter in the long run, but at least<br>
it's a place to confront the source.<br>

  Oh please tell me that it's not true! Our boxes will be doomed! It won't be long until the US Dept. of Homeland Security and the FBI learn about letterboxing and then they will be breaking down our doors and pulling us out of our beds in the middle of the night to interrogate us under hot lights about this subversive hobby of hiding boxes throughout the USA. I don't want to go to a prison camp!!!<br>
