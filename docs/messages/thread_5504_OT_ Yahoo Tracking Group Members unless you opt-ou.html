Yahoo is Tracking Group Members<br/>
<br/>
If you belong to ANY Yahoo Groups - be aware that Yahoo is now using<br/>
"Web Beacons" to track every Yahoo Group user. It's similar to cookies,<br/>
but allows Yahoo to record every website and every group you visit, even<br/>
when you're not connected to Yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
Look at their updated privacy statement at<br/>
http://info. yahoo.com/ privacy/us/ yahoo/details. html<br/>
<br/>
http://info. yahoo.com/ privacy/us/ yahoo/details. html<br/>
(You may have to cut and paste the address into your browser.)<br/>
<br/>
About half-way down the page, in the section on *cookies*, you will see<br/>
a link that says *WEB BEACONS*.<br/>
<br/>
Click on the phrase "Web Beacons." On the page that opens, on the left<br/>
find a box entitled "Opt-Out."<br/>
<br/>
In that section find "opt-out of interest-matched advertising" link that<br/>
will let you "opt-out" of their snooping. Click it and then click the<br/>
opt-out button on the next page.<br/>
<br/>
*Note that Yahoo's invasion of your privacy - and your ability to<br/>
opt-out of it - is not user-specific. It is MACHINE specific. That means<br/>
you will have to opt-out on every computer (and browser) you use.*<br/>
<br/>
Please forward this to your other groups. You might complain, too, but<br/>
I'm not sure if anyone is listening. I remember when they signed all<br/>
users up to get spam and we had to opt out of that a few years ago.<br/>
