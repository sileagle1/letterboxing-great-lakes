A friend in our hiking club emailed me a link to letterboxing.org after <br>
he heard something about it (I think on a radio program).  He thought I <br>
might be interested in it.  I think this was approximately May 2003.<br>
<br>
I read everything I could find on the Internet, told my hubby about it <br>
and he also was interested, had some sig stamps custom made and we <br>
finally went out to look for our first box in July 2003.  We've been <br>
hooked ever since!<br>
<br>
By the way, the friend who sent me the link is known to many of you <br>
as "Merlin".  Yes, he also became a boxer!<br>

A couple of years back, I developed an obsession with the idea of driving<br>
Route 66.  I read a lot of sites about road trips on 66.  Then one evening<br>
I was searching for stuff about one of the iconic 66 landmarks -- the <br>
Catoosa blue whale -- and one of the results was the clue for a box there<br>
on LbNA.  I read the clue and thought, "Whoa, this is something weird. <br>
Someone has some kind of box hidden there!  But what is it?"  I went to the<br>
main LbNA page and read the FAQ.  I was immediately fascinated by the<br>
idea of people hiding these secret stashes all over the place.  I looked up<br>
some boxes in Michigan and saw that there was one at the turnaround at<br>
the end of US 41 north of Copper Harbor.  I had been there and so I thought<br>
to myself, "I was standing right near that box and didn't know it!"  I was<br>
enthralled.  Unfortunately, the same evening, I finally got the phone call telling<br>
me that I didn't get a job that I had flown out to Las Vegas to interview for<br>
the previous week.  That was crushing, but learning about letterboxing<br>
kind of distracted me from feeling too bad.  As soon as my husband got<br>
home from work I told him all about letterboxing and insisted that we had<br>
to start doing it.  By the end of the week we had carved our stamps, gotten<br>
logs, and found our first box, "Red Cedar Box," during heavy snow!  (I would<br>
not be dissuaded from going on my first hunt, no matter the weather.)<br>
<br>
Incidentally, I just got back from a trip to the UP, and I finally got that US 41<br>
box that had captured my imagination back then.  :)<br>

& I got hooked.  We'd been dating a few months; one<br>
day I started talking about a local landmark called<br>
Squire's Castle here in the Cleveland area.  Deedle<br>
had never heard of it, so as I tried to find<br>
information online to send him, I came across clues to<br>
a letterbox that had been hidden around there and<br>
pretty much had the same reaction as Heather.  Here,<br>
Deedle had been doing his own search, found the same<br>
link, and when I hinted that I thought I was going to<br>
take up a new hobby he replied, "Is it letterboxing?" <br>
He thought it sounded just as intriguing I did!  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read about it in a blurb in Family Fun about 6 or so years ago. Pulled the article and just set it aside for awhile. I happened to come back across it right before a vacation to upper WI did some research and we decided to give it a try. <br>
   <br>
  Our first attempt we found nothing but a chewed up plastic container. Our second attempt was Red Arrow Park. We found it. Left and went immediately to a Walmart to buy a stamp, inkpad and a notebook. Went back the next day and stamped in. We used our store bought stamp that trip and sat and designed our own sig stamp the second night at dinner. I did alot of research on the finding and planting of boxes but not really on the alias' of letterboxing. <br>
   <br>
  We came up with a sig stamp that is basically a combination of the letters of our last name. Once our children started getting interesting in stamping in themselves and having their own logbook we just went and bought them stamps with their initial. Sometime they stamp in sometimes they don't :)<br>
   <br>
  When they are interested enough to come up with their own persona's then we'll help them come up with a stamp and help them carve it.<br>
   <br>
  What we love most about letterboxing is that we can spend time together doing something fun that takes us to places we never would have thought about going before. <br>
   <br>
  On a trip back to upstate NY where I'm from it took us to places I had passed almost every day growing up and had never once stopped at. <br>
   <br>
  It's been a great way to teach our children about so many things. Following directions, rewards for hard work, enjoying and having respect for the outdoors, respect for others and their property, math, reading a compass and history. Of course I'm probably preaching to the choir here. lol<br>

Magazine this past spring. The issue featured reprints of its best<br>
articles over the years - including the letterboxing article from 6<br>
yrs ago that Cindy of DUCA Family mentioned.<br>
<br>
Honestly, it's been kind of bugging me lately that many people seem to<br>
get offended by articles in family magazines. This is not a private<br>
pasttime. We should be excited by the exposure and encourage<br>
responsible promotion of letterboxing. The articles I've seen do<br>
sugggest people learn more about it, provide resources for research,<br>
and/or give good solid instructions.<br>
<br>
I commend Coffee Beans (and Atom 118!) for asking this question. It<br>
serves as a reminder that we ALL heard about Letterboxing from<br>
SOMEWHERE ELSE. If it weren't for magazine articles, we'd all be<br>
spending a lot of money on trans-Atlantic flights to pursue this<br>
passion of ours!! I, for one, am thankful for the Family Fun article I<br>

Long about May of '04 a gal in my knitting group at church came in totally excited about this new thing she had done that weekend (Memorial Day weekend) with her Mom.  "It was so fun!" she proclaimed and proceeded to tell the rest of us about it with intense excitement.  One of the other ladies in our group was a rubberstamper and she asked a few questions...but mostly the rest of us ~ who obviously enjoy entertaining ourselves while sitting on our butts ~ looked on.  When she was finished showing us the clue sheet and talking about walking for a really long time for the second box...I looked at her and said "Cindy ~ you mean you tromped around in the woods for 2 hours and you found a rubberstamp for all your trouble?"  Poor Cindy replied, "Well yes, but it was so much fun!"  To which I replied...."Dang!  Sounds like exercise to me."  Earned me a round of laughter...which of course is what I was after... ; )<br>
<br>
Then around August of afore mentioned year...Granny came to visit.  This little family had no cash to speak of, and a whole 4 days of entertaining of Granny to do.  So, I emailed Cindy and said..."Hey, what was the thingy about the woods and stamp and whatnot?"  Cindy - bless her sweet little heart was happy to oblige.  I printed off some local clues and the kids and I were ready ~ Granny, however - was not.  Seems she had the same silly idea her daughter did...you know, about the exercise...<br>
Jump to Monday - bored kids, school is yet to begin..."Hey," I says "go grab that compass Dad bought last month and we'll give this letterboxing a try."  Off we go to hunt up a couple of turtles.  We followed along and did real good....when we got to the first box, and it was exactly where it should be...I jumped up and down I was so excited!  (Brings you back to your first find don't it?)  My sweet children looked at me and said "Mom, are you crying?!"  Never mind that....onward.<br>
At dinner ~ we regaled Dad with our adventure...along with how we tried and tried to find a Sphinx in with turtles.  On the way home, I happen to glance at the name of the park and noticed it was not the same as the Turtles home....Dad says "I know that park!  I can take you there!"...all manly like.  And thus he did!  And back to find Who was at Hager too!<br>
<br>
Two days later we became the Doglvrs ~ complete with appropriate stamp that we just happened to have around the house.<br>
<br>
Ahhhh, the good 'ol days!  ; )<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I first read about letterboxing in early 2002 in somebody's Blog -- they had read about it in the Smithsonian article and were going to give it a try (they lived in CT).  I did a little research and was very quickly disenchanted when I found that there were only 3 boxes on the entire west side of the state (Michigan), the closest being about 90 minutes south of me.  So I kind of forgot about it.<br>
<br>
A few months later, just before we were headed to Chicago for the weekend, this same person who I had previously read, mentioned it in their Blog again (they took up the hobby for a short while but never stuck with it).  This rekindled my interest and I checked out the box situation in Chicago.  Although downtown Chicago boxes were rather sparse back in 2002, there were a couple of them that we decided to look for while we were there.  I picked up a rubber stamp (yes, store-bought -- it actually said 'Spring Chicken' but I chopped off the last two letters) and a plain spiral bound journal to take with us.  Our first adventure was the original Chicago Underground box -- oh, what an adventure this was!  From there we headed up to the original Magic Hedge box -- another great adventure!  Needless to say, vagrants and dead bodies in sleeping bags did not scare us off and we were hooked!<br>
<br>
Once we got back to Michigan, I decided that if I was gonna play this game, it was going to have to be as a planter -- at least until it got off the ground.  Thankfully Grandvilla & MobiusKlein, as well as Man On The Moon & Feather (no longer active) learned about it around the same time and there were actually people who went looking for those first boxes I planted!  Oh the joy of receiving that first e-mail telling me that somebody had found one of my letterboxes -- I was blown away that there were actually other people doing this!  Around the same time Azobox started planting boxes down in the Kalamazoo area and I actually had something to look for now and then.  The rest, as they say...  is history.<br>

We first read about letterboxing in Ranger Rick (nature magazine for <br>
kids), although I think they called it questing.  It sounded like a <br>
fun activity--a good excuse to get out in nature--and the lure of <br>
collecting stamps.  We (or at least I) never do anything without <br>
researching things (which is probably why most of the boxes that we <br>
have placed involved researching something).  So we read all about <br>
boxing on LbNA because we wanted to do it "right".  We carved some <br>
very crude sig stamps out of erasers using an Exacto knife and <br>
stapled some paper together for log books (why buy log books if we <br>
didn't like the activity--that was 2 log books ago!).  Out we went <br>
for our first box--and came up empty (but the kids and I enjoyed the <br>
search).  Two months later, we searched again and found it and we <br>
were hooked.   Another year later and we were ready to start placing.<br>

Having lived in downtown Chicago, I know what she is talking about.  <br>
Many of the main streets in downtown Chicago have upper and lower <br>
levels.  Because the lower levels are somewhat protected from the <br>
elements, many vagrants sleep down there.  I have had to walk around <br>
them or step over them many times.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had driven through the lower streets of Chicago before (taxis seem to prefer this route) so it wasn't a total shock when we went down looking for the Underground LB.  What we didn't expect though was to have a few homeless types begin to follow us around -- I suppose we did look a bit out of place and like we didn't really know where we were going.  It was hard to shake the entourage and be discreet when finding and stamping in at the box.<br>
<br>
The comment about dead bodies in sleeping bags was in regards to an encounter at the Magic Hedge LB.  We walked through an area of very tall thicket and in the middle of it we came upon a ratty old sleeping bag with swarms of bugs hovering over it.  There was obviously something in the sleeping bag, the form of which could easily be construed as a body...  but neither of us was brave enough to investigate.  It was about that time that we realized we had misinterpretted the clue and didn't even need to be in the thicket -- didn't take much arm twisting to get us out of there.  After we found the box and were headed back home, we realized we probably should have checked out the sleeping bag situation a little more closely.<br>
<br>
So these two boxes were our intro to letterboxing.  After a while we came to realize that not all letterboxes offered quite this type of adventure, although for those of you who have done Matt the Rat boxes, you know that they are pretty representative of the bizarre places he plants his boxes.  We actually came to enjoy tracking down his boxes when we would come to the Chicago area -- always sure to provide a venture into the unexpected.<br>
<br>
When they say that letterboxing brings you to places you may not otherwise have seen, this is what they mean...<br>

  Having lived in downtown Chicago, I know what she is talking about. <br>
  Many of the main streets in downtown Chicago have upper and lower <br>
  levels. Because the lower levels are somewhat protected from the <br>
  elements, many vagrants sleep down there. I have had to walk around <br>
  them or step over them many times.<br>

<br>
I read about Lb'ing in the online (GS) ScoutingLinks newsletter, at<br>
least a year if not longer before I officially started.   Being rather<br>
paranoid about looking for boxes by myself (I can thank my dad for<br>
that - thanks, Dad - I know you're reading this!!), I was hesitant to<br>
try it (now he's probably mad I didn't ask him to join me sooner!). <br>
So I waited until March '04 when my daughter and I went up to the MOA<br>
(see clues to FOOW8).  I don't remember what it was that reminded me<br>
to look up the LbNA website at that time (maybe it was a discussion of<br>
hand-carved stamps on the AB Altered Books yahoo group??), but I was<br>
excited to see DebRock's Bass Ponds boxes so close to the Mall.  I<br>
stamped in with a old (and I mean OLD!) stamp made when I was a kid, a<br>
picture of me when I was about 4 years old (see, I was destined to be<br>
a boxer since childhood).  But I carved my first sig stamp (I carve a<br>
new one each year for my "anniversary".) upon my return, when I<br>
started looking for local boxes.<br>
<br>
(BTW: Yooperann's Cars on a Stick was right in my "backyard", which<br>
was very exciting, but of course I procrastinated on actually going<br>
out to look for it.  By the time I actually did, it was missing. <br>
Bummer!)  <br>
<br>
And speaking of Dad (Boxer-in-TRAINing), those who remember how<br>
miserable he was feeling at the June Gathering will be happy to know<br>
his foot hasn't bothered him since, and he is hot on the trail of your<br>
boxes!  (he's a little shy about speaking up here on the list...)<br>
