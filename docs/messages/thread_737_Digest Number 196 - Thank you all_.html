I would like to thank you all for answering my questions here and off list.<br/>
It has been a real help and I think I'm a little better prepared now ot go out. I also have a <br/>
better idea of the kinds of jornals and inks that I will want to bring with me for the stamps <br/>
I collect for future use. <br/>
Good to know some of you are "neighbors"  -perhaps we will meet up some time :)<br/>
I'll let you know if I can convince my husband to go out with me this weekend or not - I <br/>
think it would be morefun todo as a pair than single, but if I can't break him in to the idea <br/>
I may very well just go out by myself for awhile!<br/>
