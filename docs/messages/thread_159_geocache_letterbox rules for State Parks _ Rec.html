Parks &amp; Rec department, so I'll quote him, and thereby not get it wrong.<br/>

The State Park and Recreation Bureau lands; require us to register our<br/>
caches with the specific park manager. The caches may stay in place<br/>
for 1 year. There is currently a $35.00 cost, but that is supposed to<br/>
cover for multiple caches. Right now, the P&amp;RB hasn't yet published<br/>
the revised guidelines, but we have been assured that these are the<br/>
current agreements.<br/>

To throw in my own two cents on this one, the only thing that I really<br/>
don't like about the current agreement is the part about registering<br/>
for a specific park, rather than for the whole park system.  If anyone<br/>
on this mailing list shares my sentiment on this, please log on to<br/>
Migo and let Sandrich know.<br/>
