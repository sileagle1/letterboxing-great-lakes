Hello!  I'm in a bind!  We are teaching brownie age girls (2-3 graders) how to<br>
letterbox.  Its Nov 3 from 1 to 3 pm at one of our camps outside Lebonon, Ohio. <br>
I have several adults that would help lend a hand for roughly 34 girls.  We have<br>
a budget.  I just need someone who loves letterboxing to help girls make some<br>
simple stamps and pads....pre-hide some boxes....help them to know how to find<br>
them...and to create some new letterboxers in the state!  We also have a badge<br>
with requirements on letterboxing that would help in the planning. Would you all<br>
know anyone that would be interested in doing that for our Girl Scout Council? <br>
If so - you can contact me via email or my number is 937-279-6534. Thank you<br>
very much for any help or resources!  <br>
