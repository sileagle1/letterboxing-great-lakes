                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've returned from Pokagon after successfully planting 12 trail boxes yesterday. We got them placed in the nick of time; rain came mid-afternoon.  The boxes are sturdy and we should be fine.<br>
<br>
The most recent extended weather-forecast for Angola, IN show Fri-Sun: cloudy, High-low 70's; Low -49.  Sounds great.  <br>
<br>
Bring bug spray.  I used some inside the park and was fine. I made the mistake of washing it off at the house afterward.  I've never had a tick, but all this talk has me concerned.  I wore a hat on the trails and I don't have a dog.  Be prepared.<br>
<br>
Water will be available at sign-in.  Definitely take some.  We refilled at the Spring Shelter and that water was COLD and delicious.  The campers present said it tasted much better than the water in the campground.  <br>
<br>
Definitely bring your hiking stick.  Some trails are dirt and mulch; some are hilly and sandy.<br>
<br>
****** SHELTER LOCATION ****** <br>
We have the Apple Orchard Shelter.  To the best of my knowledge there is no electrical service there.<br>
<br>
The event will officially begin at 9AM.  I will be there in advance to set up.  Clues will be distributed after the shelter is ready.<br>
<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
Thanks to Atomic Beans for hosting a pre-event gathering Friday night.  I signed up today and will do my best to make it.  I will be adding a Sunday event to gather up the temporary boxes and have lunch at the Inn.  I definitely will be soliciting your help.  I've been forbidden to do this alone.  And, if you want a last opportunity to get something you missed, this will be your chance.<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
We may have some geocachers join us.  I received an email from a couple who are thinking about hosting a geocaching event at Pokagon.  The park interpreter encouraged them to contact us.  I've sent a welcome and hope you will extend your generous spirit with them as well.<br>
<br>
I may still receive a couple of shelter boxes for our event.  Please check the listing of event boxes.  If I have a listing and its status says "unavailable" that means I haven't received it.  Active status is for all boxes that I've received/planted/completed with logbooks - ready to find and record.  If you had planned to mail it in advance, and haven't done so yet, you may want to carry it with you.  If you want it listed with the Clues Packet/Letterbox checklist, I will need to get the letterbox title soon.  I am printing the clues Wednesday at work.<br>
<br>
Enough for now - I will be cross-posting this at Atlas Quest shortly.  Four days and some change!<br>
