<br>
Twirl Girl (a HS senior who was at SILO6 last year and will be at SILO7 next weekend) is going to be holding a special letterboxing mini-event at Hines VAMC tomorrow towards earning her Girl Scout Gold Award.  She's going to be introducing the activity to some of our vets in the Extended Care and Spinal Cord Injury units.  She's made some adaptations such as larger base to the stamps and eliminating ziplocks to make things easier to handle.  She's planned this to become a permanent activity for Recreation Therapy to use with the vets on their own or with visiting family, with hopes that they'll catch the bug and want to explore finding more letterboxes. <br>
<br>
I'm very proud of all she's done and can't wait to tell you more about how it goes tomorrow!<br>
