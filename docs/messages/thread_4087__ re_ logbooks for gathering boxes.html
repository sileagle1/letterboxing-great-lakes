I was wondering about logs for temp boxes planted at the <br/>
gathering.    For those of you that have planted boxes at gatherings <br/>
before, how many people on average stamped into each box?  I'm sure <br/>
it's way more than would stamp into a normally planted box.  I'm also <br/>
certain it's not all 166 that are attending (to date).  But, how do <br/>
you make your books?  Do you bring spare logs and check the box <br/>
throughout the day to replace the log if needed, or do you make a log <br/>
big enough to fit 100+ stamps?<br/>
<br/>
I made a mirco box and made two log books, just in case.  But, I'm <br/>
thinking of planting a regular sized box that could maybe fit a <br/>
larger journal.  But, I don't want to waste a bunch of cardstock unnecessarily.<br/>

signatures with 6 sheets each); if space is an issue, letterboxers can<br/>
stamp both sides.  I won't mind.  Fun with Dick and Jane is a larger book<br/>
with 72 pages.  My personal book better be big enough .. it has 192<br/>
pages!!<br/>
<br/>
I've already calculated there are more than 166! Some of the attendees<br/>
with boxes listed in our database have not signed up at AQ, but they have<br/>
camping spots.  My not-so-little spreadsheet will be printed in the next<br/>
couple of days.  So anyone getting ideas for last minute PT's, I just<br/>
might miss'm this round.  I have 42 with answers!<br/>

PS - I just picked up a framing job.  I took a picture along the trail to<br/>
finding Corbeau (the first letterbox planted in Indiana).  I submitted it<br/>
for the 2008 AQ calendar, but I just had to have it hanging in my house. <br/>
Anyone interested in seeing it?  I never made it to Corbeau (we weren't<br/>
prepared for the excursion); we'll go back this fall.<br/>
