                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently met a wonderful group of women of all ages who gather on the 4th<br/>
Saturday of each month to scrap till their heart's content!  It's an all day<br/>
event, 9am-5pm, with a potluck that usually has a theme.  They meet at the<br/>
Westchester library service center in Chesterton (not the library itself). <br/>
It is loads of fun!  I hope to see some of you there.  I know I hope to be<br/>
at the next one!<br/>

Where do you go scrapping in Watertown?  My 2 girlfriends and I go for <br/>
a scrapping weekend every year, but the place we normally go to closed <br/>
down unexpectedly because of insurance issues  :~(   In fact, we should <br/>
have been there this weekend.  We'd like to find another place, but we <br/>

Well what do you know....  Talk about a small world.  I'm a Valpo grad <br/>
as well!  Have either of you been back to the campus to see what's gone <br/>
up since you've graduated?  Dare I even ask when you did graduate?  <br/>
It's a pity, imo, that there aren't actually more boxes around <br/>

I graduated in '04 and was there for a lot of the stuff going up,  the <br/>
new library, the new Met building behind Scheele, a lot of the <br/>
shopping, and still a lot has changed in less than 5 years.  Although, <br/>
I'I'm amazed that nothing has gone in near Walmart where that <br/>
entertainment place used to be.  IS the new union as cozy in areas as <br/>
the old one?  I rather liked that there was a fireplace in the old one <br/>
even if it didn't get used.  I'm also curious about the flags and the <br/>
Round Table area, not to mention Jesters.  As for Walmart, I'm GLAD it <br/>
was there.  It was one of the few things that a lot of us could go to <br/>
when we were there without cars.  Those night Walmart runs were great <br/>
for relieving boredom and such.  Even got to see a ghost while walking <br/>
beside the cemetery on one such trip.<br/>
