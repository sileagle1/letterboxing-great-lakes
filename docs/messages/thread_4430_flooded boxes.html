Speaking of tieing down boxes, does anyone have any post-flood status <br>
updates on boxes that were near the rivers?  I haven't checked <br>
individual clues, but was just wondering in general if boxes were lost, <br>
and if so, were the clues updated accordingly?  We probably won't be <br>
heading down to IL until November, but was curious.  We're hoping that <br>
all, or at least most, of the boxes survived!<br>

(And in refence to my previous posting...I did not confirm that FOOW9: <br>
Hoffman Tower is missing, but given the conditions by the Swinging <br>
Bridge, I think it's most likely.  The entire area of FOOW4 is <br>
unrecognizable, there are so many downed trees and plant debris.  It is <br>
still muddy, but passable.  I may try again, but it doesn't look <br>
promising.  Darn!  And I really liked that Hoffman Tower stamp.  But <br>
there is one consolation...its sister stamp was sent to Artdog in Indy <br>

Box #1 from my Long Grove boxes is reported missing by an experienced<br>
boxer -- will have to check on it Sunday -- but it may or may not be from<br>
it's nearness to water -- it's had a lot of problems before due to careless<br>
finders.<br>
