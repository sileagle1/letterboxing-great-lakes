the LbNA patch and three small ones to commemorate what were<br/>
significant PFX numbers to me. <br/>
<br/>
If you're interested in seeing the patches I'm talking about, they're<br/>
on the letterboxing.org page under regalia.  Here's the link:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/regalia/orderforms.htm<br/>
<br/>
I have stumbled across enough geocaches while either looking for a<br/>
place to put a box or while out doing some boxing, that I joined the<br/>
Mich geocache org. They also have patches and I have one of them on my<br/>
pack as well.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to adding the LbGLK patch and think the dark green<br/>
one will show up better from a couple of feet away.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your thoughts about putting out patches as FF prizes, but<br/>
speaking just for myself, I'm not likely to be adding many more<br/>
patches. I'm pretty happy with how my pack looks now.  (Besides the<br/>
fact that it is a killer to hand sew through the plastic-backed nylon<br/>
on the flap of my backpack. LOL) <br/>
<br/>
A PFX500 patch would be another nice commemorative, but I don't think<br/>
LbNA has one, I think it would have to be a special order.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Wisconsin Hiker for all the effort that's gone into<br/>
this patch project so far.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; LOOKS FANTASTIC!!!  I can't wait to get it!!!!  I want to have a<br/>
collection of patches on my LB pack (anyone else have a collection of<br/>
patches on theirs?  If so, what are all your patches of?  I'd include<br/>
more box-related patches as first finder prizes in my boxes if I knew<br/>
a lot of boxers did this.) <br/>

On the order form, you can designate your own amount and letters:<br/>
<br/>
Available Letter Designations: P = "planted",  F = "found",  X =<br/>
"exchanged",<br/>
E = event stamps, S = # of States letterboxed<br/>
Available Denominations:  10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400,<br/>
500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like PFX500 is available, although combining letters seems<br/>
questionable.<br/>
