Dreams often have a meaning and a valuable life lesson.  Yes, we value those hand carved stamps, but I'm not disappointed if there is a nice store bought stamp in a  letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I still remember the letterbox dream I had, or should I say nightmare!  I was on an upper ledge and the box was down below on a lower ledge.  I jumped down to the ledge, found the box, stamped in, then I realized....I can't jump back UP.  I was stuck on the ledge!  Nightmare!  <br/>

<br/>
Dreaming about letterboxing?  Hmmmm?  We all know....we can stop at any time.......<br/>

Last night I had a dream. I was on a field trip with my junior high class to a national park. I stumbled across a tupperware container.<br/>
<br/>
I was thrilled and brought the classes attention to the plastic box I had found. As soon as I picked it up I realized it was not a letterbox, rather a geocache. <br/>
