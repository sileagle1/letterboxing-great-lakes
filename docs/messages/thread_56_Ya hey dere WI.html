pronounced it just like me - Oouuhdy :)  I'm saying I liked the <br>
accent so much, I took it with me!  My reason for posting is that I <br>
searched the LBNA site for any boxes located in Maribel Caves county <br>
park.  Did I miss it?  Has anyone been there?  I swear it's the best <br>
kept secret in all of WI!  Especially on a hot day!  Everywhere you <br>
walk in the woods, their are little vents in the ground pumping out <br>
air conditioned like cooooool air from the labyrinth of caves below.  <br>
But beware of the stinging nettle patch, I'm thinking that was worse <br>

There are no boxes there (yet).  Thanks for the idea!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh my, run, don't walk, to check it out!  The best effect is really <br>
in hot weather when you really appreciate the cool, but I wonder <br>
about cold weather, if the caves below are warmer...I know that <br>
stream I had to jump into after the stinging nettle really only felt <br>
best in summer...but anyway the possibilities for hiding spots and <br>
building a trail are endless!!!!  I think I may get to go up that way <br>
in a couple of weeks but won't have time to play, just work <br>
stuff....otherwise, I might beat someone to it :)<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck and it's a small world, maybe someday I'll be back to add a <br>
stamp.<br>
