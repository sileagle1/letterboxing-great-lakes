in hot weather when you really appreciate the cool, but I wonder <br/>
about cold weather, if the caves below are warmer...I know that <br/>
stream I had to jump into after the stinging nettle really only felt <br/>
best in summer...but anyway the possibilities for hiding spots and <br/>
building a trail are endless!!!!  I think I may get to go up that way <br/>
in a couple of weeks but won't have time to play, just work <br/>
stuff....otherwise, I might beat someone to it :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and it's a small world, maybe someday I'll be back to add a <br/>
stamp.<br/>
