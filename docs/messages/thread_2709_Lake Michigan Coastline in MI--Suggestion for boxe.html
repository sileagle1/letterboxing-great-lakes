Have fun,<br/>
There are some very nice ones in Leelanau County - SpringChick is<br/>
responsible for most.  I left two that Leelanau County two weeks ago. <br/>

You could acutally make it a SpringChickBoxAThon!  On the way to<br/>
Fishtown, there is one called Whaleback that has an awesome stamp.  Have<br/>
fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned from a W. Michigan boxing adventure, and one of the <br/>
ones we had a chance to look for was the Fishtown box. Sadly, we <br/>
couldn't find it.... but we couldn't really root around for it <br/>
because it is in a pretty busy area. Hopefully it hasn't already gone <br/>
missing! (And Fishtown is really neat and we were glad we had a <br/>
chance to visit it.)<br/>
<br/>
We both really liked SpringChick's Happy Feet and Block House boxes, <br/>
which are in a beautiful park. Also, BindleBabe's Fill 'Er Up series <br/>
is nearby, which is a lot of fun. And there are a TON of mystery <br/>
boxes in the area, if you want to play detective!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you want to do a one-stop-shop I would suggest Saugatuck area. 1) <br/>
it is beautiful and there is stuff to do, and 2) there are alot of <br/>
boxes in one area. My suggestions would be The Dragon's Back!! It is <br/>
very beautiful and is located in Saugatuck State Dunes Park. There are <br/>
other boxes in that same park by SpringChick and azobox. And there are <br/>
others too.<br/>
