If you do not hear from us again after the holiday weekend, assume the worst fate has befallen us and be warned.  If you dare follow on our trail to brave the beast yourself, please pick up our bones and give us a decent burial in Lake Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
Off we go, then!  (clip clop, clip clop)  <br/>
