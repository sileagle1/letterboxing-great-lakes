Letterboxing sees modern-day revival<br>

<br>
Parks, often tucked away in quiet neighborhoods or behind commercial areas, are places of great wonder. <br>
There lie hidden treasures: homes for all manner of wildlife and evidence of changing seasons. <br>
There are other, less obvious treasures in many parks and other public places, known only to those who practice the 19th century pursuit of letterboxing. <br>
Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in public places, usually parks. They post clues online as to the boxes' whereabouts. <br>
Inside the letterbox is a rubber stamp and a notebook. People who search for letterboxes -- and anyone can do it -- must bring along a rubber stamp, notebook, pen and compass. <br>
When they find the letterbox, they add their own stamp to the book and stamp their book with the stamp that was inside the letterbox. In each book, a notation is made: when and where the box was found. <br>
Letterboxing has its roots in 1854 England, but it has been revived in the past seven or eight years in the United States. <br>
Tom and Jill Hemr are former area residents who got involved in letterboxing when they lived in Detroit. <br>
"We found out about it in the winter of 2003," says Tom Hemr. "We attended a gathering of letterboxers, the first one in Michigan, and we met several people there." <br>
The Hemrs learned more about letterboxing -- and they got hooked. <br>
Letterboxing is a bit stealthy -- in a good way -- and that adds to the intrigue. <br>
"You kind of do it undercover," says Hemr. "You don't do it in front of anyone." <br>
For that reason, letterboxers are reluctant to advertise exactly where they've stashed their letterboxes. Suffice it to say there are some hidden locally. <br>
In most cases, the weatherproof boxes are hidden in the stumps or hollows of trees. The boxes are usually sealed in plastic bags to further protect them from the elements. <br>
"Also, you try to hide it so it is not exposed," says Hemr. <br>
Letterboxers are encouraged to be neat and considerate when they do their stamping, carefully wiping off the stamp in the box. <br>
Stamps are a big part of letterboxing. Hemr says that when people start this hobby, they are often content with ready-made stamps. But as they get into it more, they often create their own stamps. <br>
"They're usually hand-carved," he says. "Hobby stores have kits that allow you to carve your own." <br>
Letterboxers track the boxes they've found and the friends they've made. <br>
The hobby attracts a mix of people, said Hemr. It's often a family activity. <br>
"Kids can do it, too," says Hemr. <br>
There's a code of conduct for letterboxers, and of course, the hobby had its own jargon. To learn more, access www.letterboxing.org.<br>

<br>
Very good!  That's the best article I've seen yet, I believe!  It <br>
strongly underlines the stealth and covertness, it doesn't give <br>
anything away, urges people to read more before they start out.  Good <br>
job, TJ_Mich!<br>

  Subject: [LbGLK] Article in our hometown paper<br>
<br>
<br>
  I think I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that we were asked to do an interview for the newspaper in our hometown in Michigan's U.P. (Marinette-Menominee Eagle Herald... www.eagleherald.com) The resulting article appeared this morning and I thought folks would enjoy seeing it. <br>
<br>
  It even got a photo on the front page with the caption "Is there a letterbox hidden in this tree? No one knows for sure. Letterboxes -- weatherproof containers holding notebooks and a stamp -- are hidden around the Marinette-Menominee area. They are hidden furtively and retrieved by other letterboxers who carry stamps and notebooks of their own. The hobby has about 20,000 followers in the United States, but it began in England in the 1850s." (The tree pictured in the photo does not have a box in it... as far as I know. Looks like it could though!)<br>

  Letterboxing sees modern-day revival<br>
  Published Thursday, December 21, 2006 <br>
<br>
  By MARY JOHNS <br>
  EagleHerald staff writer <br>
<br>
  Parks, often tucked away in quiet neighborhoods or behind commercial areas, are places of great wonder. <br>
  There lie hidden treasures: homes for all manner of wildlife and evidence of changing seasons. <br>
  There are other, less obvious treasures in many parks and other public places, known only to those who practice the 19th century pursuit of letterboxing. <br>
  Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in public places, usually parks. They post clues online as to the boxes' whereabouts. <br>
  Inside the letterbox is a rubber stamp and a notebook. People who search for letterboxes -- and anyone can do it -- must bring along a rubber stamp, notebook, pen and compass. <br>
  When they find the letterbox, they add their own stamp to the book and stamp their book with the stamp that was inside the letterbox. In each book, a notation is made: when and where the box was found. <br>
  Letterboxing has its roots in 1854 England, but it has been revived in the past seven or eight years in the United States. <br>
  Tom and Jill Hemr are former area residents who got involved in letterboxing when they lived in Detroit. <br>
  "We found out about it in the winter of 2003," says Tom Hemr. "We attended a gathering of letterboxers, the first one in Michigan, and we met several people there." <br>
  The Hemrs learned more about letterboxing -- and they got hooked. <br>
  Letterboxing is a bit stealthy -- in a good way -- and that adds to the intrigue. <br>
  "You kind of do it undercover," says Hemr. "You don't do it in front of anyone." <br>
  For that reason, letterboxers are reluctant to advertise exactly where they've stashed their letterboxes. Suffice it to say there are some hidden locally. <br>
  In most cases, the weatherproof boxes are hidden in the stumps or hollows of trees. The boxes are usually sealed in plastic bags to further protect them from the elements. <br>
  "Also, you try to hide it so it is not exposed," says Hemr. <br>
  Letterboxers are encouraged to be neat and considerate when they do their stamping, carefully wiping off the stamp in the box. <br>
  Stamps are a big part of letterboxing. Hemr says that when people start this hobby, they are often content with ready-made stamps. But as they get into it more, they often create their own stamps. <br>
  "They're usually hand-carved," he says. "Hobby stores have kits that allow you to carve your own." <br>
  Letterboxers track the boxes they've found and the friends they've made. <br>
  The hobby attracts a mix of people, said Hemr. It's often a family activity. <br>
  "Kids can do it, too," says Hemr. <br>
  There's a code of conduct for letterboxers, and of course, the hobby had its own jargon. To learn more, access www.letterboxing.org.<br>

in WI, yet, I have seen them several times in OK.  A nastier danger <br>

there!!  Yuck, yuck, yuck!  Maybe not as huge a deal here, but some <br>
of the spiders that live in OK I have zero desire to be bitten by, <br>
LOL!  I spent 15 years avoiding them when I lived there only to find <br>
one in a baggie when I was visiting my Dad and letterboxing while we <br>
were there!<br>
