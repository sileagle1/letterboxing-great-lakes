Likewise, if anyone else will be attending any other gatherings and staying at a hotel, let me know and you can bring Room Service along.<br>

How long will it be there?  We got in late tonight, but it was just barely light enough for us to get our boxes hid on the trail and make it to the last 30-45 minutes of the Sock Hop.  See you tomorrow at the event!<br>
