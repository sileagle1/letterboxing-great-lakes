Have fun!  We were in the far northeast regions of WI, almost to the U.P. on Monday and the fall colors were fabulous with a bright blue sky behind them.<br/>

Hey Pugnasties, we'd like to meet you "in person" sometime!  Perhaps <br/>
the "Wedding" event in Chicago on November 10....?  You'd have a chance <br/>
to meet about 60 of your fellow boxers.<br/>

<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=381<br/>
<br/>
We've not done much to publicize it other than a few posts here and <br/>
there.   It will be an indoor event not far from downtown Chicago.  Some <br/>
folks (mainly Fungus Woman) have signed up to carve some event boxes, <br/>
and others have volunteered to bring some food or festive supplies (I <br/>
mean you, Nitrocat!).  If you'd like to carve a box, please do!  And if <br/>
you want to bring any food, please let me know so I can list it on the <br/>
event page.  The event will mainly be a chance to exchange travelers, <br/>
sig stamps, and event stamps...and will be a chance for all of the new <br/>
boxers in Chicago to get together.  As a bonus, Coffee Beans and I will <br/>
be planting a few temporary urban boxes in the surrounding <br/>
neighborhoods.  There are also a few permanent boxes nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully it will be a fun afternoon!<br/>

Most events are posted on AtlasQuest, but Atom118 &amp; CoffeeBeans have also mentioned it on this board.  Here's a link to the AQ listing:  http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=381<br/>
Hope you can make it!<br/>

P.S.  If I remember correctly, their "real" wedding isn't until springtime.<br/>
