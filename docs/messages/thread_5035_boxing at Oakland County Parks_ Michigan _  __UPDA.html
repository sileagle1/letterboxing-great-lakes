&gt;Even though, I didn't get a response from the original post, I am<br/>
&gt;going to update what happened at the meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the update, Heather!  I mean to reply to your first post, <br/>
but forgot.<br/>
<br/>
Based on your time line, it could be me that sparked their thought <br/>
process on changing the guidelines to include LBing.  I contacted <br/>
them last winter (2006) about my Jerome box. (The name you mentioned <br/>
sounds like it might be who I talked to also)  Seems like they <br/>
changed their policies since then.  At that time, you were supposed <br/>
to get a license (no fee) and use the special Geocache trails.  But <br/>
there weren't any requirements on being a member of the geocaching <br/>
site.  If I remember correctly, they had a rule about the length of <br/>
time the box could remain in a spot before it had to be moved or removed.<br/>
<br/>
Since Jerome was only there for a few months, I decided to take my <br/>
chances and ended up planting my box without the permit, but I did <br/>
follow all their other guidelines.  I didn't get the permit mainly I <br/>
didn't want to deal with the hassles for a temp box.  I kind of got <br/>
the feeling you had to have the exact location approved before <br/>
planting.   Did she say anything about that?  Or as long as they're <br/>
off the regular trails they're okay?  Do you have to get a permit <br/>
still or nitify them of the plants somehow?<br/>
