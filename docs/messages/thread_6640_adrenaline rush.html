                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not feeling the crash so much as the crud.  We had to leave early due to my lead trail dog Aina doing something nasty to her knee.  Fortunately, after her vet visit today it turns out she has not ruptured her cruciate ligament as I had originally feared (no surgery, yay!), but the knee is swollen so she's on restricted activity and anti-inflammatories for the next two weeks.  Turns out it's a good thing we left early anyway as Liam was running a fever Saturday night.  Then I've been fighting a sore throat, fever, and runny nose since Sunday and am just now starting to get over it (I hope).  On the plus side, Liam hasn't had a fever or runny nose since Sat.  In spite of the weather, injuries, and after-crud we still had a good time.  Thanks to all the event organizers for putting on such a wonderful event and thanks to all the wonderful letterboxers who attended in spite of the exciting weather to help keep our spirits up.<br/>
