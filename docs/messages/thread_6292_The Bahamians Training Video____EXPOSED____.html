Secret footage of a rogue Bahamians, Bahama Mama and Martini Mon, has recently been discovered to prove that these "so called" peaceful olympians are not so peaceful after all. With all that "Yah Mon" and happy go lucky wit that they are so cleverly using to, do we say it, to brainwash their competition, we can't help wonder what their "real" intent is and if they are truly "out for blood".

Bottom line, we suspect that Miss Bahama Mama and her cohort may actually be planning a terrorist activity to upstage their competition. Only time will tell if we can break their code.<br>
