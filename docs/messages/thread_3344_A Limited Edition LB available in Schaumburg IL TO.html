<br/>
In conjuction with a local radio station's holiday food drive, Kiddy Writer and I have gotten <br/>
together to create a limited edition letterbox. This letterbox will only be available from me <br/>
during the radio station's broadcast time at a local Culver's restaurant. You can get this <br/>
letterbox by making a donation to the food drive and by saying a special phrase.<br/>
<br/>
I will be there from 3-7 PM tomorrow only [Wed] as that is when they are broadcasting <br/>
live.<br/>
<br/>
Kiddy Writer is providing the stamp, and the logbook was handmade by me in a Tim Holtz <br/>
class last spring. It has been on display in a local art show all summer and is quite special, <br/>
if I do say so myself. :-) [it's also made with alcohol inks which are activated by water, so <br/>
no way could I ever leave it outside anywhere]<br/>
<br/>
All further information can be found on AQ and Letterboxing.org. I am sure you can all <br/>
find the information yourselves. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping to meet lots of [well, a few] letterboxers and add to the holiday food drive <br/>
donations. So spread the word. And come by for frozen custard and a hello if you get a <br/>
chance.<br/>

I just found out I am bringing the train from Urbana to Chicago on<br/>
Nov.30th, would have liked to try to have collected this one!<br/>
Can anyone share w/me on boxes that might be close to the train<br/>
station that are accessable. We get in around 8am and leave out around<br/>
8pm.<br/>
Would like to do a little boxing if they are there.<br/>

If your train comes into Union Station, you might want to check out <br/>
the boxes listed on Atlas Quest - there is one right in Union Station.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for being interested! I am assuming you are taking the train to Union Station, in <br/>
Chicago? This one is a good 30 miles out, in the suburbs so probably not accessible from <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
There are many boxes listed in Chicago<br/>
<br/>
This one is downtown [a very long walk from Union Station though]<br/>

<br/>
Maybe this one<br/>

This is in the Loop:<br/>
