<br>
In conjuction with a local radio station's holiday food drive, Kiddy Writer and I have gotten <br>
together to create a limited edition letterbox. This letterbox will only be available from me <br>
during the radio station's broadcast time at a local Culver's restaurant. You can get this <br>
letterbox by making a donation to the food drive and by saying a special phrase.<br>
<br>
I will be there from 3-7 PM tomorrow only [Wed] as that is when they are broadcasting <br>
live.<br>
<br>
Kiddy Writer is providing the stamp, and the logbook was handmade by me in a Tim Holtz <br>
class last spring. It has been on display in a local art show all summer and is quite special, <br>
if I do say so myself. :-) [it's also made with alcohol inks which are activated by water, so <br>
no way could I ever leave it outside anywhere]<br>
<br>
All further information can be found on AQ and Letterboxing.org. I am sure you can all <br>
find the information yourselves. :-)<br>
<br>
I am hoping to meet lots of [well, a few] letterboxers and add to the holiday food drive <br>
donations. So spread the word. And come by for frozen custard and a hello if you get a <br>
chance.<br>

I just found out I am bringing the train from Urbana to Chicago on<br>
Nov.30th, would have liked to try to have collected this one!<br>
Can anyone share w/me on boxes that might be close to the train<br>
station that are accessable. We get in around 8am and leave out around<br>
8pm.<br>
Would like to do a little boxing if they are there.<br>

If your train comes into Union Station, you might want to check out <br>
the boxes listed on Atlas Quest - there is one right in Union Station.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for being interested! I am assuming you are taking the train to Union Station, in <br>
Chicago? This one is a good 30 miles out, in the suburbs so probably not accessible from <br>
there.<br>
<br>
There are many boxes listed in Chicago<br>
<br>
This one is downtown [a very long walk from Union Station though]<br>
<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br>
boxnum=836&boxname=Chicago_Underground<br>
<br>
Maybe this one<br>
<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=9547&boxname=Ilin<br>
<br>
This is in the Loop:<br>

boxnum=10059&boxname=Fitness_Challenge_#1:_Downtown_Marathon<br>

Hope that helps somewhat.<br>
