Absolutely.  I love Spring Chick's annual Letterboxing Bingo Game.  We're getting to a point in the game where people are getting closer to another BINGO.  So I guess, we will all have to wait today.  But the anticipation is intense.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Come on Spring Chick...I just need a couple winning words.  Letterbox Bingo - it's not a addiction and I can stop at any time.  LOL  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Just wondering.  Is there anyone who waits several days before checking the words?  Or are we all jumping on the computer first thing each day for the Bingo word of the day before our eyes are even fully open?   I confess, that's me.  <br>

For several weeks, I've been 'close' to a few Bingo patterns, but I'm not saying anything because I don't want to jinx my chances.  Checking my Bingo word of the day is my first thought when I wake up each morning.  I need to get a life.  We are all at the mercy of Spring Chick.  She doesn't take brides either.  Tee Hee!  This is definately the longest, slowest Bingo game.  I wonder if we could list it in the Guiness Book of World Records?  <br>
