                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortunately, there was not enough interest for a gathering on the<br/>
date I picked, so this gathering will NOT happen in July.  I'm kicking<br/>
around an August date, but actually would like to see whether someone<br/>
else is interested in organizing the whole thing now.  We just put an<br/>
offer on a house and, needless to say, are going to be going a bit<br/>
crazy over the next month or so and I won't have time to deal with<br/>
gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry and thanks!<br/>
