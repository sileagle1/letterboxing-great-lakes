Oh, me, me!  After making, writing out, and addressing my Lunar New Year's cards (made with the boar stamp I carved last night) I put on my snow suit and took the dogs to the forest preserve.  Talk about cold!  The dogs had little balls of slobber frozen to the fine whiskers around their lips and the wind was so cold it blew right through my snow suit!  By the time we left I had a grimace frozen to my face and my nose was so cold you could have pierced it and I wouldn't have noticed.  But I wasn't the only crazy one, we met a new friend and her two frozen owners on our short hike.  The dogs, by the way, didn't take any notice of the cold and would have been happy to spend another 40 minutes out on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
Then I went and spent this evening making myself a brand new bright yellow (fleece!) kimono to keep myself warm for the rest of the winter.  Now all I need are some fleece-lined tabi socks and I'll be all set.  In the mean-time I'll have to make due with the warm wool socks Flying Dragon knit me for Christmas.  Bring on the cold, I'm ready for it!<br/>

I ventured out of the house to the car to a Holiday Inn Jacuzzi room <br/>
for my birthday.  Out of the room, back into a car with stiff frozen <br/>
leather seats, brrrrrrrr (still can't feel my bottom) home.  Now I'm <br/>
planning on hibernating until spring!<br/>

It was too cold to go snowshoeing around the property, so we stayed indoors where it was warm and sipped coffee, tea, and hot chocolate.  I taught some of the women to make secret message, Morse Code necklaces.  Some of my former letterbox workshop participants were at the camp this weekend.  Good to see them again.  After most of the women went to sleep, several of us stayed up till 1:00 - 2:00 am to carve stamps for future letterboxes and postals.  I'd say it was a good weekend.  <br/>

  Sounds like it has been a productive day for you! I've been <br/>
  spending the day making books, but I don't think they will ever be <br/>
  logbooks -- they are a little too big for that -- just trying to <br/>
  learn some new formats and binding stitches. I did carve one stamp <br/>
  (not for letterboxing though), and laid out the graphic for a <br/>
  gathering stamp I have to carve. Love these cold, snowy days!<br/>

  &gt; Well, I'm up to 5 stamps carved now (listening to music, Whadda Ya <br/>
  &gt; Know &amp; Prairie Home Companion throughout the day). It's actually <br/>
  &gt; kinda nice staying home all day, it's something we rarely do! Now <br/>
  &gt; I'll switch gears to getting some logbooks and boxes ready for <br/>
  what <br/>
  &gt; I've carved, then go back to carving again!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Hopefully next weekend will be a bit warmer so I can plant a box <br/>
  or <br/>
  &gt; two...<br/>

  Camp!<br/>

  &gt; &gt; Yup...me too, I carve my stamp for the SILO gathering, and made <br/>
  a <br/>
  &gt; logbook...then I put together a stack of prizes for another LBing <br/>
  &gt; group I'm in....then starting tracing images for a series I'm <br/>
  working <br/>
  &gt; on to be planted in the spring (will it ever come?!)...<br/>

  &gt; &gt; Well with a temperature of 3 degrees, and windchill of -18 <br/>
  &gt; degrees, Martini Man &amp; I are holed up for the weekend. We each <br/>
  have <br/>
  &gt; carved 3 stamps already, including our stamps for the upcoming <br/>
  SILO <br/>
  &gt; event.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Is anyone actually venturing out this weekend?!?<br/>

  our <br/>
  &gt; BINGO cards this morning!<br/>

I was at Girl Scout camp this weekend with 25 whacked out adult volunteers.  It may have been freezing outside of the troop house, but we were warm inside, and laughing ourselves silly!  Everything seems hysterical when you stay up too late.  <br/>

  I ventured out of the house to the car to a Holiday Inn Jacuzzi room <br/>
  for my birthday. Out of the room, back into a car with stiff frozen <br/>
  leather seats, brrrrrrrr (still can't feel my bottom) home. Now I'm <br/>
  planning on hibernating until spring!<br/>
