                    <div class="plaintext-content">FINALLY, we were able to get to the park when no one else was hanging <br/>
around at the bandshell, it only took us numerous attempts.  Eggs 1-7 <br/>
are back in their homes for the remainder of egg hunting season.  <br/>
Sorry about the hiatus since Saturday, but we wanted to insure their <br/>
safety from the grasps of small children who were at the park for <br/>
their own easter egg hunt.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully the weather will be nice this weekend for some easter egg <br/>
hunts.  We will be pulling the eggs permanently on April 30.<br/>

Happy Boxing!<br/>
