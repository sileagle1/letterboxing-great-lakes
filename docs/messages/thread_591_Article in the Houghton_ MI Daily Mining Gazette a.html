                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hooboy!  I was just coming to post that the article has been picked <br/>
up by the AP and showed up in today's Marquette Mining Journal.  But <br/>
that one doesn't mention me so I was pretty surprised to see that I <br/>
was mentioned in the original which I hadn't read till just now.<br/>
  And speaking of UP letterboxing, which I did some of last week, I'm <br/>
happy to report that my Sugarloaf and Mystery Model Town boxes are in <br/>
good condition and well-visited (it's so nice to place boxes and <br/>
still have them there two years later!).  I was also only the second <br/>
person to sign in at the Hogback box--a great hike I hadn't done in <br/>
40 years.  It says something that it and Sugarloaf are essentially <br/>
across the street from each other and yet it's only had two visitors <br/>
compared to at least a dozen at Sugarloaf.  (What it says, of course, <br/>
is that you can do one in 20 minutes and the other took us 2 and a <br/>
half hours!)  <br/>
    On the way back through Wisconsin I also picked up Red Arrow Park <br/>
in Marinette and Badger Park in Pestigo.  Both in cities I'd been <br/>
through dozens and dozens of times.  Both in beautiful city parks I <br/>
hadn't previously even known were there.  Of course that meant it was <br/>
6:30 in the evening before we left Peshtigo, giving us a mighty late <br/>
evening arrival back in Chicago, but sleep is overrated anyway.<br/>

They also mention YooperAnn and <br/>
&gt; FungusWoman...<br/>

&gt; By JANE NORDBERG<br/>
&gt; Gazette Writer<br/>
&gt; COPPER HARBOR  Barbara Oxford takes a reading of 41 degrees, walks <br/>
&gt; 41 paces into a forest, submerges her hand into the hole of a dead <br/>
&gt; log and gingerly removes her quarry, a plastic box.<br/>
&gt; The box contains a rubber stamp, an ink pad, and a notebook filled <br/>
&gt; with imprinted marks and messages from residents as far away as <br/>
&gt; Chicago and as close as Torch Lake.<br/>
&gt; "That was easy," she says, spreading the box's contents on the <br/>
&gt; forest floor before making her own stamp in the box's notebook, and <br/>
&gt; using the stamp in the box to document her discovery in her own <br/>
&gt; notebook. "Sometimes it takes me an hour or more to find it," she <br/>
&gt; says.<br/>
&gt; Oxford is a letterboxer, part of a growing breed in the U.S. Part <br/>
&gt; sport, part treasure hunt, letterboxing is said to have started in <br/>
&gt; England 150 years ago when a Victorian hiker inserted his calling <br/>
&gt; card in a bottle, threw it into a Devon pool and issued an <br/>
&gt; invitation to those who found the bottle to add their own card. <br/>
&gt; Recent articles in "Time" and "Smithsonian" magazines have spurred <br/>
&gt; the hobby's popularity. Since 1998, over 9,000 letterboxes have <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; deposited in public places throughout the U.S. There are also <br/>
&gt; documented letterboxes in Africa and Central America.<br/>
&gt; According to the main letterboxing Web site, Letterboxing.org, <br/>
there <br/>
&gt; are 46 letterboxes hidden in the Upper Peninsula, including four in <br/>
&gt; the Copper Country: two in Keweenaw County, and one each in Baraga <br/>
&gt; and Houghton counties. <br/>
&gt; Lured by the "Hwy 41 Letterbox" in Copper Harbor, Oxford followed <br/>
&gt; the directions on the Web site given by Tim Kuehl, also known <br/>
&gt; as "The Dragon."<br/>
&gt; Kuehl, who resides in Wisconsin, has placed 68 boxes around the <br/>
&gt; Midwest. During a trip last year to Michigan, Kuehl placed boxes at <br/>
&gt; Canyon Falls in Baraga County and two at Copper Harbor.<br/>
&gt; Anonymity is key; letterboxers take great pains to avoid being seen <br/>
&gt; discovering the boxes, and they carefully hide it again for the <br/>
next <br/>
&gt; person to find.<br/>
&gt; Many, like Kuehl, take on personas to hide their real names. <br/>
&gt; Yooperann and Funguswoman are just two letterboxers who may have <br/>
&gt; Michigan connections.<br/>
&gt; Although the instructions Oxford followed were fairly <br/>
&gt; straightforward, she also likes the challenge of the solving more <br/>
&gt; difficult clues. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; [The Mining Gazette online version ends here, but from our <br/>
&gt; EagleHerald print copy, I'm including the following additional <br/>
&gt; text.  There may be more text in the Mining Gazette print copy.]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Some people make you do math, word puzzles, or figure out lyrics <br/>
&gt; from certain songs," she said.<br/>
&gt; The inexpensive, accessible nature of the sport encourages a <br/>
diverse <br/>
&gt; following.  Its combination of solving puzzels while being outdoors <br/>
&gt; is attractive to families.<br/>
&gt; Other than a stamp, a notebook, and a compass, letterboxing <br/>
requires <br/>
&gt; no equipment to start out.<br/>
