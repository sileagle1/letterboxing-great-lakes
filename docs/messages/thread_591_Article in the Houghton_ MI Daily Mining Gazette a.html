                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hooboy!  I was just coming to post that the article has been picked <br>
up by the AP and showed up in today's Marquette Mining Journal.  But <br>
that one doesn't mention me so I was pretty surprised to see that I <br>
was mentioned in the original which I hadn't read till just now.<br>
  And speaking of UP letterboxing, which I did some of last week, I'm <br>
happy to report that my Sugarloaf and Mystery Model Town boxes are in <br>
good condition and well-visited (it's so nice to place boxes and <br>
still have them there two years later!).  I was also only the second <br>
person to sign in at the Hogback box--a great hike I hadn't done in <br>
40 years.  It says something that it and Sugarloaf are essentially <br>
across the street from each other and yet it's only had two visitors <br>
compared to at least a dozen at Sugarloaf.  (What it says, of course, <br>
is that you can do one in 20 minutes and the other took us 2 and a <br>
half hours!)  <br>
    On the way back through Wisconsin I also picked up Red Arrow Park <br>
in Marinette and Badger Park in Pestigo.  Both in cities I'd been <br>
through dozens and dozens of times.  Both in beautiful city parks I <br>
hadn't previously even known were there.  Of course that meant it was <br>
6:30 in the evening before we left Peshtigo, giving us a mighty late <br>
evening arrival back in Chicago, but sleep is overrated anyway.<br>

there <br>
