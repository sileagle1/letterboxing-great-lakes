Woo hoo!  Can't believe Bulldawg & Shell are coming all the way from VA!  For those of you who read our recent blog entries, these are the people we hiked with in Maryland/West Virgina while we were out east over the Labor Day weekend.<br>
Sounds like at least 4 states will be represented at the OCT 6 event - Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin & Virginia.<br>

  I am sorry but I will not be able to make it to the gathering on Oct. 6th.  I have a wedding to go to, I am not too sure about Nerd or Babe.  I don't know if you are ready to meet the Babe, she is nuts.  Nerd and I are tame compared to her.  Hope everyone going has a great time and hopefully see everyone at the next gathering.<br>

Hey, aren't the Babe, the Nerd and the Rat planning to attend? I think some of them don't live TOO far away from the Quad Cities....<br>

We love crazy people, send her on down :-)<br>
 <br>
Now that we know where your allegiances are (so, a wedding is more  important <br>
than us, eh?).  Perhaps I'll see ya again at at the "Letterboxing  Wedding" <br>
gathering on Nov. 10th ~ seems fitting anyway.<br>
 <br>
I hope Nature Nerd, and yeah I guess, Hiker Babe can make it . .  . Sorry we <br>
will miss you.<br>

Ok, so I'm really bummed now.  I have the chocolate revel bar STAMP <br>
from the GLK gathering, but I didn't realize there was actual <br>
chocolate revel BARS that went along with it somewhere.  I don't <br>
think I had any!<br>

Oh my, you missed out!  We're still trying to work it out to get to <br>
your intriguing Road Rally.  If we do, we'll bring some bars with us!  <br>
Maybe we'll leave them at the starting point to distract the other <br>
rally participants (evil laugh!!)<br>
