My Fellow Letterboxers, <br>
<br>
New Straitsville, Ohio is a small town that is famous for two things: a fire burning since 1884 and 175 illegal moonshine stills. In 1884 a group of miners had a labor dispute. They sent a burning coal car into a mine with its endless supply of fuel. No more dispute. Lesson to be learned here is not to tick off the locals. During Prohibition stills ran in the hollers and mineshafts. The Straitsville Special was known in every speakeasy across the country. Lesson to be learned here is to stay on the good side of the locals. The Moonshine Festival has a working still and moonshine burgers, moonshine pie, and moonshine doggies. I anticipated a good time, but it didn't quite come out the way I planned. Don't get me wrong, the festival was great, but what is up with the ATF revenuers forbidding tasting of the hooch? As if that was not bad enough, none of the food included moonshine! Talk about misleading. <br>
<br>
The Scioto Trail State Park is located in the Scioto Trail State Forest. The Scioto Trail is the best hike for experiencing Ohio's untamed wilderness. Once a Shawnee trail it makes an 11.2-mile loop across the foothills and hollows. If the views aren't enough for you the morel mushrooms are abundant. <br>
<br>
I drove down to Chateau Laroche in Loveland, where chivalry is not dead. The Knights of the Golden Trail (K.O.G.T.) are insuring that valor, skill and manners live on. In their own words the purpose of K.O.G.T. is "to save modern civilization from degradation and degeneration, just as noble knights saved Europe from the Dark Ages." They welcome any man who believes in the ideals of the K.O.G.T. to join them. Silver Eagle, from what I was told, had joined their ranks in the not too distant past. The knights were much pleased to have such a gallant gentleman among them. Unfortunately he failed the rescuing fair maidens class. Seems he only believes in rescuing barefoot fair maidens from Texas. It was with heavy heart that the K.O.G.T. banned him from knighthood. But, I did not come here to talk about revenuers, mushrooms or chivalry; I came to talk letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Wow, Ohio, 1,400 something letterboxes! Not bad for a small state. Shame, Ohio, only 30 something mysteries. Can we talk percentages here? Maybe you should consider hiding mysteries instead of stills. Letterboxes are in good shape in the Buckeye State. Sturdy containers and mostly hand-carved stamps. Remember to keep them well covered; a covered box is a happy box. When hiking know your limits; don't try that 11.2 mile trail when you have only walked from your car to the local mall. Forest fires are deadly, so be careful with all flammable substances, especially in the spring and fall. Hunting is big in Ohio; wear orange during hunting season. Think safety. <br>
<br>
Sincerely, <br>
<br>
