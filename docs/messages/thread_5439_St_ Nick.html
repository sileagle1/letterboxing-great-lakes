always hung up STOCKINGS on DEC 5; didn't use shoes.  In the Milwaukee area<br/>

school saying everyone else had gotten something from St. Nick the night<br/>

Nowadays the kids seem to get a big variety of things, including small toys.<br/>
However when we were kids, our stockings were filled only with fruit, candy<br/>
and nuts.  This was our first introduction to pomegranates a kazillion years<br/>
ago - St. Nick left some in our stockings one year.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm wondering if the prevalent celebration of St. Nick's Day in Wisconsin partially stems some from religious practices brought to the area, since he was a saint and all.  St. Nicholas is, among other things, the patron saint of Byzantine Catholics, which was the religion of many Eastern European immigrants.  Despite the large number of Byzantine Catholic churches around Cleveland, though, we don't have area-wide St. Nick celebrations like they do in Wisconsin.  Although we knew of the tradition, my brother &amp; I never left our shoes out for St. Nick.  But, at our religion classes Christmas party each year, the party was held as close to St. Nicholas Day as possible and our priest dressed up as St. Nicholas to pass out presents.  We were also given a cookie with a picture of St. Nicholas somehow glued onto the cookie.  Oh, those cookies were horrible!<br/>

When I was little, my sisters and I would set out our wooden shoes (which Grandma and Grandpa had gotten for us in Holland, Michigan) on Dec. 5.

As a kid, I honestly think I enjoyed St. Nicks Day more than Christmas. We dont have any Little Lizards, and John doesnt have a pair of wooden shoes, but St. Nick still seems to make it to our house every Dec. 6. :) I just have to make sure John doesnt leave out his running shoes. (Eeww.) Hang the stocking instead, honey. <br/>

the one my mom made.  It was made of green felt in the shape of a Christmas<br/>
tree with 25 red pockets that each contained a Bible verse plus three little<br/>
treats (cos there were three of us kids).  Think miniature candy canes or<br/>
Hershey kisses.  It was terrifically exciting to be the child allowed to<br/>
open the pocket and read the verse.  It also made a nice Christmas wall<br/>
hanging.  Now you've got me wondering what happened to it.<br/>

&gt; I'm of Dutch descent (Sara of Leapin' Lizards) and it was that side<br/>
of my family that introduced me to and celebrated St. Nick's Day.<br/>
Saint Nick is the common name for Nicholas of Myra, a Bishop of Myra<br/>
in Lycia of Anatolia (or modern-day Turkey). You can read all about it<br/>
in David Sedaris' hilarious essay "Six to Eight Black Men." Highly<br/>
recommended.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I was little, my sisters and I would set out our wooden shoes<br/>
(which Grandma and Grandpa had gotten for us in Holland, Michigan) on<br/>
Dec. 5. On the morning of the 6th. we'd find them filled with candy<br/>
and small giftsthink stocking stuffersand sometimes even an ornament<br/>
for the Christmas tree. As a kid, I honestly think I enjoyed St.<br/>
Nick's Day more than Christmas. We don't have any Little Lizards, and<br/>
John doesn't have a pair of wooden shoes, but St. Nick still seems to<br/>
make it to our house every Dec. 6. :) I just have to make sure John<br/>
doesn't leave out his running shoes. (Eeww.) Hang the stocking<br/>
instead, honey. <br/>

&gt; I think it's more cultural than geographic. Being of Bohemian/Czech<br/>
&gt; lineage, we celebrated MikulṠ as kids. Perhaps it's the strong<br/>
&gt; Germaninfluence in the Milwaukee area that makesSt. Nickseem a<br/>
&gt; Wisconsinism.<br/>

&gt; Hmmm - My mom had never heard of it and she grew up in Peoria, IL. I <br/>
&gt; lived in IN til I was 12, then spent 15 years in OK and we will not say <br/>
&gt; how long here - not telling my age, lol, but I had never heard of it. <br/>
&gt; Wondering if because in OK, we were in Southern Baptist territory and <br/>
&gt; similar landscape in IN, perhaps. Maybe that is why we had not heard of <br/>
&gt; it. Doesn't mean it was not, there, of course - just means I managed <br/>
&gt; not to be in the right place at the right time to learn of it until I <br/>
&gt; moved up here and Mr. CatHerders family celebrates it.<br/>

While getting my graduate degree down in FL, one of the other guys in <br/>
my office had an advent calendar on his desk and I was the only other <br/>
person in the office that knew what it was since we grew up with them <br/>
as well and we always looked forward to the chocolate behind the <br/>
doors.  I kinda miss them now, but I do still see them in some of the <br/>
stores.  In fact, I think I saw one at Borders the other day, not <br/>
entirely sure....<br/>
As to celebrating St. Nick's day, my family's predominantly Austrian <br/>
and my mother used to live in a Polish neighborhood so I think that's <br/>
where we got it ourselves.<br/>
