time that goes into planning a great day.  the park is awesome.  we <br/>
found 4 boxes,one bonus box, one cootie, 29 exchanges, great lakes and <br/>
event stamp, and 4 personal travelers...........not a bad first event <br/>
for a couple of newbies.  <br/>
<br/>
just want to say thanks to everyone that was there, both the veterans <br/>
and those who like us are new to boxing.  everyone is so welcoming and <br/>
helpful.  meet lots of new friends today.  was nice to see those that <br/>
post on different sites to put a face with them.....and i wish i hadn't <br/>
listened to rat tail and left my camera in the van........this is my <br/>
first boxing without taking photos of the "plant/finds" and then no <br/>
photos of new friends.<br/>
<br/>
can't wait for another event.<br/>
