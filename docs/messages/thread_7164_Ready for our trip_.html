I created one for each state we will visit (Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming).  In addition to that, I have a box we won at an event to plant, Shorty gave us one, SunnySideUp gave us three and ArchaeoFrog gave us five.  That means we will be busy planting 14 boxes on this trip!  That will give our friend HalfEmpty something to hunt for since there aren't any/many boxers in his area.<br>
<br>
Of course we've also got a list of boxes to find in each state, so we're hoping the weather will cooperate for seeing the sites and hitting the trails.<br>
