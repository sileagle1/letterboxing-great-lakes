were indeed our 4-corners Bingo winners -- they tied for the win on <br>
3/14/07 with the word Linda Fay.  Congratulations to you both!  Please <br>
send me your mailing address in private e-mail.<br>
<br>
BTW -- I am waiting until the end of the game to send out the prizes <br>
so I know how many ties there will be and to save on postage if I need <br>
to send more than one prize to the same person.<br>
<br>
The remaining games are "X", perimeter and full card (1st, 2nd, 3rd <br>
place for full card).  Several people are closing in on the "X"!<br>
<br>
Good luck to all!<br>
