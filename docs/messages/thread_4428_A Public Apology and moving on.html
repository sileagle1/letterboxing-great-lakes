I emailed it to you privately, but I wanted to say it here as well. an <br/>
apology isn't needed. Somewhere there's a college student with a <br/>
rubber stamp in his pocket who knows what really happened, and that's <br/>
the guy who should be apologizing. <br/>
<br/>
Boy, do we ever need a better topic! Did i ever tell you guys about <br/>
the time someone emailed to say they found a dead cat on top of a <br/>
box?  <br/>
<br/>
What's the most amusing thing y'all found when out looking for <br/>
letterboxes?<br/>
