We received the cootie later in the evening and didn't have a chance to stamp in and pass it on that night.  We will pass it on the next time we meet some fellow boxers.<br/>
However we did pass along a different cootie earlier in the day.  I laughed when I saw Chris's photos because you can actually see me slipping it into someone's pouch (I think it turned out to be TrekkieGal's).  Look at the photo entitled "Red Cat tries to stay warm" and you'll see me doing the "cootie drop".<br/>
