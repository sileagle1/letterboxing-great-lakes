Sorry to say that the M Clan won't be at the gathering, WI Hiker.  <br>
The addition of a new member in January (it's a girl!) makes travel <br>
hard.  3 kids under 4 - hiking on a trail is difficult, but fun.  <br>
We'll look forward to seeing all of your stamps in the permanent <br>
boxes whenever we get a chance to head over.  The "working 2 jobs" <br>
thing also makes it difficult.  We'll meet some of you folks before <br>
too long.<br>
<br>
But we'll be out there a lot this summer (and we've already started <br>
the fun this spring).  Glad to say that most of our boxes in the <br>
Madison area are in good shape.  Still need to check on the Swiss <br>
Village Series.  Reports of Heidi's demise concern me.<br>

If given the chance, try out the Chicago boxes. We did a pile of them <br>
last weekend and had a great time! I even found some remote (to me)  <br>

Hit Atom 118's boxes. Very cool Chicago history.<br>

Unfortunately, I also heard from someone a looong time ago who clued me in<br>

came along who was upset enough to vandalize the box?  Or maybe it didn't<br>
have the proper permit that the county now requires and the county came<br>
across it when "cleaning up"?  But there wasn't all that much cleaning going<br>
on in that area.  Well, whatever reason, there have been a few folks who<br>
couldn't find the box.  I tried every "possibility" out there.<br>
