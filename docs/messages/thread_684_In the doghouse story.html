Oh!  Oh!  I've got scores!  Let me think of the best one...with two dopey greyhounds at home it shouldn't be too hard.<br>
<br>
Ok, so greyhounds are the fastest dogs, and one of the fastest land mammals on earth, right?  They can go from zero to 40mph in less than three strides, and trust me, if you've never seen one of those suckers go, they're LICKETY SPLIT FAST!<br>
<br>
But since they live such a horrible, scripted life in the racing industry, a lot of things that "normal" dogs are used to are completely foreign to them when (if) they're lucky enough to be adopted.  Like my boy Harvey and the hardwood floors, or Stella and the windows (their lives at the track have no glass, so the concept of windows is a tricky one for them).<br>
<br>
All the dogs are tested for cat-compatability before they're adopted out, and some of the hounds have a higher chase instinct than others.  Stella, for instance, was tested to have a "high" chase instinct, and therefore was NOT cat safe, while my boy Harvey was tested to have a "low" chase instinct.  <br>
<br>
Well, I think the people who tested them must have been smoking something, as you'll see.<br>
<br>
It was a fine Sunday afternoon in early spring.  The temperature was still chilly enough to warrant me keeping the bird feeder filled, which, being in the city, meant that I was keeping the pigeons, starlings, and squirrels well fed.  It was those squirrels that drove Harvey crazy.  CRAZY (he was tested to have a quote-unquote "low" chase instinct, remember?) Harvey kept insisting that he had to go outside, but I'm too smart to be tricked by that- I knew he just wanted to get the squirrels.  <br>
<br>
When I *did* let him out, I would first throw myself at the screen door a couple of times, yelling "booger booger booger!" at the squirrels, hoping to scare them off.  Thinking I had effectively cleared the yard of squirrels, I let Harvey out.  (My chase instinct might be low, but my scare instinct is v.v. high)<br>
<br>
I might be smarter than Harvey, but I sure don't have better eyesight, because he saw one squirrel who hadn't been terrorized by my verbal assult (image!), and took off after it.  Zero to forty in less than three strides.  Man he was fast!  Dog and squirrel took off behind the garage, leaving a little dog-and-squirrel-shaped dust cloud behind.  I shook my head at the folly of mammals when suddenly-<br>
<br>
 a horrible yelp- one single canine scream came from behing the garage- then nothing.  My husband and I flew out of the house, calling for Harvey.  Slowly, limping horribly, Harvey came from the side of the garage.  Following Harvey was a blood trail that led up to one if his hind legs.  <br>
<br>
(Interesting side note, I never knew I got faint at the sight of blood until it was the blood of one of my family members.  This odd little quirk would resurface when my husband sliced open his thumb with a utility knife and the baby clocked herself in the forehead with a heavy frame- we're an accident prone family)<br>
<br>
I ran to Harvey, and saw that his hind leg was sliced from the webbing between two of his toes up quite a ways.  He must have been so intent on chasing that dang squirrel that he didn't stop for the fence, and cut himself on the sharper section down at the bottom.<br>
<br>
Remember, this is a Sunday afternoon, right?  Which means that the only vet open is going to be an emergency vet.  And the only emergency vet was can find is by my parents, 20 minutes away.<br>
<br>
So, bloody dog in tow, we pile up into the car, and drive out there.  The whole time I'm crying, begging Harvey not to go to sleep (I had vague M*A*S*H memories about blood loss and sleeping, but when I was calmer, I remember that was a *head wound* Hawkeye had suffered, and not a foot injury).  We get there, they look at Harvey, decide he needs some pretty extensive stitches, and take him away.  40 tense minutes in the waiting room later, a groggy Harvey is led out.  He promptly collapses in the waiting room, too drugged up to keep walking.  My husband bends down, lifts up my 80 pound boy, and takes him to the car while I pay.<br>
<br>
The bill came to something in the area of 500 dollars, and that doesn't even count what we had to pay to get dog blood out of the car.<br>
<br>
So Harvey was in the dog house (as soon as his foot healed, I couldn't stand being mad at him while he looked so pathetic).  There was a silver lining, though.  While at the emergency vet, they tested Harvey's blood.  Turns out that greyhounds are usually good blood donors, and the vet would pay for Harvey's blood.  We told Harvey that if he ever chased a squirrel again, we'd make him donate enough blood to pay off his 500 dollar vet bill.<br>
<br>
And Stella?  The one with the high chase instinct?  Wouldn't even look twice at a squirrel, even if it came up and bit her on the nose.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
