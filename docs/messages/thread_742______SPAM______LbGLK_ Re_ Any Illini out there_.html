(Not too successfully, since I never tell anyone I sell things, lol!) <br>
If anyone ever wants fun little stamp pads for a great price, I am happy to help!<br>
I really want to do this with my older grade (7-12) scouts. <br>
If any of you are nearby and have the same age troop that would want to join us, let me know!<br>
