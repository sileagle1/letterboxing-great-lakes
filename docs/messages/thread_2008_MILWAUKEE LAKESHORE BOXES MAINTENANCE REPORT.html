<br/>
Today was a perfectly eerie day along Lake Michigan -- inspiring clouds, strong winds, <br/>
crashing waves -- so we decided to perform annual maintenance of our lakeshore series <br/>
boxes.  All of the following info has been updated on the corresponding LBNA clue pages <br/>
as well.  Here is the update:<br/>
<br/>
1.  South Shore Series<br/>
<br/>
The south shore series boxes are missing. The City of Milwaukee or County of Milwaukee <br/>
appears to have removes 100s of trees, poured an asphalt path, and rebuilt the <br/>
breakwater along what was a wonderful natural area on the southern shore south of <br/>
downtown.  This is the new "extension" to the Oak Leaf Trail and the bicyclists do indeed <br/>
have a nice path to get them from point A to point B.  Unfortunately, in the process all <br/>
three boxes were destroyed by the workers.  The box status has been changed to REPAIR <br/>
on the LBNA site and we will replace the boxes in the next few weeks.  <br/>
<br/>
2.  Lake Park Series<br/>
<br/>
The Lake Park Series was our first placement of boxes.  This is one of our favorites places <br/>
in Milwaukee and so we were glad to see that 2 or the 3 boxes are intact and in-place.  <br/>
Maintenance was done on box 1 -- new camo-box, new logbook, and double-bagged <br/>
contents.  Box 3 was similarly maintained and verified.  Box 2 is missing.  The box will be <br/>
replaced in the next few weeks and the LBNA site will change to reflect the replacement.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  Shipwrecked Series Box 1:  Spiderbox<br/>
<br/>
Our favorite plant is still in place -- healthy and warm -- while crying out an SOS for <br/>
visitors.  Great walk along the lake today -- the winds were pushing the water up toward <br/>
Michigan ( storm surge for sure, maybe a seiche?  http://www.geo.msu.edu/geo333/<br/>
seiches.htm )  and the beach was well exposed for walking.  No shipwreck souvenirs but <br/>
lots of rocks and shells. <br/>
<br/>
4.  Shipwrecked Series Box 2:  The Lost Schooner<br/>
<br/>
The Lost Schooner was confirmed even more lost -- missing with no sound of a mayday to <br/>
be heard.  One can only guess that it has slipped below the crashing waves of Lake <br/>
Michigan and now lies at the bottom of the brink.  For those of you that visited this great <br/>
shipwreck along the shore, you know the STRONG ATTRACTION that the box had for the <br/>
location.  Thus, we are convinced that the box was taken because the forces of nature <br/>
should not have been able to remove the box from that spot.  Lily stopped to visit and she <br/>
decided to come home with us for some hot tea since the wreck was no longer present.   <br/>
We hope to find the wreck and return it to the shore but salvage operations will take at <br/>
least a few weeks.  <br/>
