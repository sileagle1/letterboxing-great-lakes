I was looking at the Geocaching permit, and it has now been changed to "Geocaching/Letterboxing Application and Permit" and has separate sections for geocaches and letterboxes.  Is this new?  Hopefully this means that the Minnesota State Parks will now permit letterboxes!<br>

Here's the link to the permit form:<br>

<br>
MN State Parks have allowed letterboxes for at least four years. They just had you fill out the same form as the GCers, though it never said "letterbox" anywhere on it. <br>
<br>
Last weekend I finally went out and got the GPS coordinates for the locations of the four boxes I had planted (and pulled) for the Spring Fling at William O'Brien. Now I can submit the forms and hopefully get them planted permanently before snowfall!<br>
<br>
I have two more planned for Interstate as well. :)<br>
