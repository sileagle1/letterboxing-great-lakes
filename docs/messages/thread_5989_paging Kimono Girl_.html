I'm trying to contact Kimono Girl about her LB K9 patch that she sells.  <br/>
Can't seem to contact her via AQ, so Ish suggested this group.<br/>

Is Kimono Girl having her little dragon pretty soon???  We had several people inquire about her K9 patches after we brought them out to the Back To Our Roots event in Vermont as our raffle offering.  Looking back in the archives this is all we could find...thread<br/>
#19957	New letterboxing patch <br/>
I believe we contacted her directly and she sent us her address  -  they were $2 a piece.<br/>

After this weekend though I'm officially "grounded" since the insurance doesn't want me traveling more than 50 miles from the hospital in the last 4 weeks.<br/>
