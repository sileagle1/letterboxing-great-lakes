But as long as there are two similar but different hobbies that exist out there, there will be people who find stuff and wonder 'What is this?" or "What should I do with this box I found?" or  "Oh, maybe I'll just take it home, and contact the placer...but then maybe I'll forget to contact the placer and time will pass....oh well."  That last statement usually sparks the resentment.  <br>
<br>
We don't need to 'blame each other.  I think the real blame should be focused on.....those SQUIRRELS!!!  They're laughing at all of us!!!  Geocachers and Letterboxers UNITE!  <br>

  Geocachers take things. Letterboxers don't.<br>
<br>
  Letterboxers resent having their stamps 'swapped' for kitche. Geocachers resent the resentment.<br>
<br>
  There's fancier ways to explain, but that's the nut of the problem.<br>
