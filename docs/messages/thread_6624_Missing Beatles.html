That was an awesome series!!  Did it seem like they disappeared due to critters or floods or park cleanup or vandalism or......<br>

We had an incredible amount of rain this spring; flash storms with strong winds and low area flooding.  It's possible that 3 of the boxes were blown away or floated away, but then again there is work being done in that area, so I will never know 100% for sure.  I'll try to replace these three boxes because I just enjoy walking through the area and the clue is fun to read.  <br>

I hope you are able to re-carve (yeah, I know . . . without Krait) and  <br>
re-plant this one.<br>
