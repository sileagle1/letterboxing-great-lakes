                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks JSleuth for posting information about our Just Married HH!! It <br>
is a week from our first Anniversary!! I was wondering if it made it <br>
out of MD at all. Looks like it is back in MI. If you could tell me <br>
how full it is or any info on how it looks, or interesting tid-bits I <br>
would love to know (I know I spoil the fun, but I can't wait it could <br>
be years before I see it again!). <br>
