I'm telling ya... karma always wins out in the end!  Did you ever see <br>
the movie The Craft?  "Whatever you put out there, comes back to you <br>
times 3".  I'm thinkin' you're in for it, buddy.  Of course, your <br>
voo-doo doesn't seem all that effective, so you probably don't have <br>
much to worry about in the payback arena.  Unless of course <br>
intentions count more than actual outcomes!<br>
