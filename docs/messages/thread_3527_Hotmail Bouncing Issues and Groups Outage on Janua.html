Subject: [yg-alerts] Hotmail Bouncing Issues and Groups Outage on January 5<br>
<br>
We've had reports that some Yahoo! Groups members with Hotmail and MSN<br>
mail accounts have been bouncing since approximately December 29,<br>
2006. The error message many of you are reporting is "550 Command<br>
rejected for policy reasons."<br>
<br>
We are working with our contacts on the Hotmail team to understand why<br>
this occurred and will let you know when the problem has been<br>
resolved. We appreciate your patience and we apologize for the<br>
inconvenience this has caused.<br>
<br>
We also want to acknowledge an outage the U.S. and International<br>
Groups sites experienced early today (Pacific time). Users who<br>
attempted to access their groups on the Web experienced timeouts on<br>
their browsers between the hours of 12:45 a.m. and 2:15 a.m. Pacific.<br>
This issue has been resolved and we are investigating solutions to<br>
prevent similar outages in the future.<br>
