                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  I just wanted to toss in a few additional thoughts<br>
regarding SILO 3.<br>
<br>
1)  Floats - The floats don't need to hold stamps and logbooks.  I can<br>
see where some designs might very well end up with a sealed box, and<br>
that's fine.  If there happens to be a stamp and logbook inside a<br>
float, that's cool too.<br>
<br>
2)  Carving Workshop - Beetle has been wonderfully complimentary in<br>
her notes about the carving workshop, and I'm looking forward to<br>
sharing some of what I've learned as I've worked on stamps over the<br>
last couple of years.  But to me, the ideal situation would have us<br>
sitting around a large table, sharing ideas of what's worked for us in<br>
the past, perhaps doing some carving, and helping one another past<br>
some parts that might get us all hung up if we were sitting at home<br>
carving by ourselves.  So I'll be preparing some of my thoughts, but<br>
I'd love to get your ideas as well.<br>
<br>
That said, please feel free to bring carving medium, carving tools,<br>
images, etc.  For those who are interested, the workshop may finish,<br>
then transition into a time to just carve and try some new things.<br>
<br>
That's all I have for now.  I can't wait to see the stamps, floats,<br>
masks, and of course, all of you on the 15th!<br>
<br>
Best Regards,<br>
<br>
