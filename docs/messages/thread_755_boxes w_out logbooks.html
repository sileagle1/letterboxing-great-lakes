<br>
Yes, my Hidden Village series is a 5 box series and only the clues to the first box are posted...you have to get the rest of the clues from the other boxes.  Since it is a series that can be (and is intended to be) done in one day and the clues form a loop, I only put a logbook in the first box and the last box.  That way I can see who started and who finished the series but don't end up with 5 identical (or at least nearly identical) logbooks.  It also means that the boxes between the first and last can be smaller and that people can stamp in more quickly (which turns out to be a good thing since one of the boxes ended up practically on the trail...not an ideal location but it was the best spot I could come up with since I was looking for a specific element).  <br>
