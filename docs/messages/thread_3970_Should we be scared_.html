website, and here's the text from the one I received<br/>
just now:<br/>
<br/>
No matter your age, youve no doubt been on a treasure<br/>
hunt before. But now, theres a whole new way to enjoy<br/>
this age-old favorite. Its called geocaching, and<br/>
its a great way to combine time in the beauty of<br/>
Ohios outdoors with quality time with the entire<br/>
family. Geocaching is a high tech, kid friendly sport<br/>
that involves using a handheld global positioning<br/>
system (GPS) to find a geocache, usually a waterproof<br/>
container holding trinkets, hidden in natural areas.<br/>
<br/>
With more than 7,000 geocaches hidden throughout Ohio,<br/>
theres literally adventure to be found at every turn.<br/>
If youre looking for popular hotspots for geocaching,<br/>
youre sure to find it at one of Ohios 74 State<br/>
Parks. In particular, youll want to focus on Salt<br/>
Fork State Park in Cambridge, Ohios largest state<br/>
park. Home to more than 2,000 geocaches, you and your<br/>
family can easily spend days happily hunting the area!<br/>
<br/>
Its easy to see theres no better way to find outdoor<br/>
fun than in beautiful Ohio. And dont forget youll<br/>
receive future emails with even more ways to enjoy<br/>
your time in Ohio!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There was even a link in the email for a special<br/>
"geocaching package" at Salt Fork State Park.  Could<br/>
you just imagine if "geocaching" was replaced with<br/>
"letterboxing"?  Publicity can be good, but this just<br/>
makes me want to shrink back into my little<br/>
letterboxing hole and have people say the secret<br/>
password if they want to enter.  I don't want to<br/>
re-open the whole "Letterboxing &amp; Publicity, good or<br/>
bad?" can of worms, I just thought others would be -<br/>
um - interested in reading this, too.<br/>
