She'd been receiving some cards the past week from family members and friends she doesn't ordinarily receive cards from.  "Why is everyone crossing out birthday and writing Easter?" she asked me.  Then this morning I gave her a white gift bag that said "Happy Birthday!  Happy Easter!" all over it.  "Where did you find a bag like that that says both things?"  (Must not have had her morning coffee...usually she's a little quicker on the uptake...hello, Mom...I stamped it!)  Inside there were 39 more birthday cards.  She had a good time opening them all and noting where everyone was from and hearing how I'd been plotting behind her back.<br/>
