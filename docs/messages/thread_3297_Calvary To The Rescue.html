Rescue box for a couple weeks. The cemetery is doing fall clean-up and <br/>
removed all of the rocks, leaves, and sticks that were covering it. <br/>
Management knows it's there, but I'm not sure about maintenance. At <br/>
least they left it set in the open and didn't throw it away. I'll <br/>
check back in a couple weeks and take something to rehide it again. <br/>
