I have pulled all of my boxes out of Silver Springs State Park <br>
temporarily.  I have been muggled badly.  Three of six boxes were <br>
missing the logbook, two were strewn hither and yon, and for one the <br>
only thing I was able to find was the stamp.  Several of the boxes <br>
were lock n locks, so I doubt it was animals.<br>
I intend to replace them in the Spring with better clues and much more <br>
secure hiding places.  <br>
