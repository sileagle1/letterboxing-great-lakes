I always check out the various dollar store containers, but you do have to<br/>

currently has some that look promising.  I found some cute little<br/>
rectangular snack size boxes at the Container Store - a pack of 4 for $5 -<br/>
with good seals.  I think those are the ones you've been using lately,<br/>
aren't they, CMoon??<br/>

I have had very good success with the tape from Gander Mtn. I have used the<br/>
cloth camo and it's not shiney at all. It seems to conform to different box<br/>
shapes.<br/>
<br/>
I have not been aware of any scent.<br/>
