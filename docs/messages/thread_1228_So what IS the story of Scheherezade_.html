Whoops, forgot to say that Sheherezade was the wonderful storyteller who <br>
told tales until her murderous bridegroom fell asleep. Thus she managed to <br>

Aahhh, The story of the beautiful and wise Scheherezade.<br>
It begins with a king so consumed with fear and hatred for women, that  <br>
he decides to marry a new every night and then have them murdered!<br>
All the women in the Harem are terrified, the women in the city<br>
whisper fear filled gossip.<br>
The kings Vizier has a daughter named Scheherezade.  She hears the<br>
terrible news and tells her father that she will marry the king!<br>
The king marries Scheherezade and that night she tells him a wonderful<br>
story and just before dawn she begins another story but, she has grown<br>
tired and "just wait until tomarrow night" she says.<br>
She tells him stories for 1,001 nights until he is cured of his fear<br>
and hatred and they live happily ever after.<br>
Thus, we have "Arabian Nights" by Burton<br>
Oh I do so love stories and that is why I chose the name and my<br>
letterboxes that I place will reflect my love of all tales!<br>
Scheherezade <br>
