Just got back from a weekend at GS camp.  My buddy Pippin was the chief cook<br/>
and I was at her beck and call (it's a joke) as her assistant, so we stayed<br/>
warm in the kitchen (she makes one heck of a great spinache lasagna, may I<br/>
suggest you talk her into making it for a future Gathering??).<br/>
<br/>
We had 31 Cadette/Senior level (though we aren't supposed to call it that<br/>
any more...but "11-17 teen Scouts" sounds goofy to me) girls for what was<br/>
called "Me Weekend", as in "all about me" (=them!).  They were allowed to do<br/>
whatever they wanted (within reason!), but we did provide some suggestions,<br/>
and one thing of course was introducing them to the various boxes we've been<br/>
hiding at camp since summer.  Most of the girls did participate, and they<br/>
really enjoyed it.  Carving stamps and coming up with trail names ("Lemon<br/>
Sniffer"?!?!) was their favorite.  While we didn't use "real" carving<br/>
materials, we had a variety of  regular eraser materials which suited their<br/>
carving mania quite well.  I provided a history of the hobby and basic<br/>
"rules" (both verbally and in the form of handouts for them to take home).<br/>
I found some dual tip art makers on sale for 45 cents (!!!) so each got one<br/>
to take home.  I included in the handouts some of the more winter-friendly<br/>
clues (indoors and/or near the lodge we were staying in) and hid three<br/>
special-for-the-weekend stamps ("WhatZITtoya" was an empty Stridex jar<br/>
containing the log and stamp of a girl's face with a red zit on her nose.<br/>
They had to ask me to borrow my jar of Stridex to obtain it.).  That wasn't<br/>
enough for one group in particular, who managed to hunt out several others<br/>
which were frozen but they managed to pry loose (had to double-check that<br/>
they hid them well again!).  That group also placed their own box to add to<br/>
the collection.<br/>
<br/>
Since we haven't been announcing the boxes at any of our council leader<br/>
meetings or anything, we thought this would be a good way to get the girls<br/>
themselves interested, and then they can disseminate the info to their<br/>
troops (this was a council-wide event, so they were from a number of<br/>
individual troops).  Watch out for a bunch of new boxers in the near-west<br/>
Chicago suburbs.  I only hope they learned their lessons well, and that I<br/>
instilled (=pounded into their heads) the "rules of the sport with no<br/>
rules"!<br/>
<br/>
Note to CMoon:  I found S'mores...first finder!  And a whole slew of finders<br/>
right on my heels!  Great hiding place!<br/>
