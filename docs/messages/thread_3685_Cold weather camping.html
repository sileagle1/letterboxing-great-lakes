Unlike the winter campout a couple weekends ago, this time we slept inside a building rather than outside in ground tents.  Our cut off for winter sleep outs is 15-20 degrees.  This weekend, it was too cold to sleep outside in tents.  Besides, I already have my winter camping patch.   So I wasn't being silly this weekend...,,,,OK, maybe we did a few silly things.  But I'm not telling.  <br>
