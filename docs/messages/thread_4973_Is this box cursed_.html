                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a letterbox that seems to attract the unusual.  It's in Paoli <br>
Indiana, so it doesn't get visited very often.  It was originally <br>
planted under a deep bed of myrtle.  Last year, a prison work crew had <br>
come through and cleared all the brush.  Fortunately, a nice inmate had <br>
signed in with his inmate number, and he moved it to a hollow tree <br>
nearby.  This year, I went back to check on it, and there was a duck <br>
nesting next to it!  I thought the duck had adopted the container, so I <br>
apologized for interrupting it and went to get my camera.  When I <br>
returned, I realized that the little nester hadn't moved.....at all.  A <br>
couple of pokes with a stick confirmed that the guardian of my box was <br>
DEAD.  Yuck.  I promptly moved the box, and have updated the clues.  <br>
The name of the box is Morel Madness - I hope the duck didn't eat a bad <br>

Yikes!  No corpses, but I did find a live snail on one of mine.  Yuck.<br>

I can't believe the inmate logged in!  Did he email you to tell you <br>

One of my "80 Days" boxes was surrounded by the remains of a bird<br>
(well, mostly wings and feathers), but it was pretty gross.<br>
I did have to move the 'material' to get at the box.<br>
(It was Augusta, for those who searched that series).<br>

That box you are refering to was our first find -- and I am only learning now that you *did* wash it . . . LOL we had the van smelling of hand sanitizer for a week... we all practically bathed in the stuff after reading in the logbook of your horrendous experience.<br>

Yes, we found a dead cat decaying and stuck to the top of the letterbox. It <br>
was sad and disgusting. The box is near the road, so we hope the cat was <br>
there by accident! We went to a nearby vet office, coincidently, and washed <br>
up the container for the next finder. That was our 3rd find - but luckily we <br>
weren't turned off to letterboxing in general.<br>

As for interesting finders, I've never had a prison inmate sign into<br>
any box I've found, but back in 2004 when I started boxing I found<br>
these two messages in two different boxes:<br>
<br>
"Navy Seal on night training mission, the water is cold!" (A box near<br>
the shore of Lake Michigan, underneath dense brush).<br>
<br>
"7/9/04 -- Had fun finding this, but not who we are looking for --<br>
Milwaukee Police." (hollow tree in forest)<br>
I've found a couple of boxes with messages, "Looking for mushrooms, found this by mistake."<br>
<br>
And one of my favorite box finds, "Nowhere, Man" (look up the clues its near Laramie, WY) was found by a FED-EX driver fixing a flat tire. He put a one dollar bill in the logbook and wrote asking other people to add a one dollar bill to his. So that, one day, if a desperate human being HHiker or someone else who broke down should find the box they would have a few dollars for food/gas (even though the closest food/gas to that box is a hundred mile drive, because the box is . . . "Nowhere, Man!!")<br>
