                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a letterbox that seems to attract the unusual.  It's in Paoli <br/>
Indiana, so it doesn't get visited very often.  It was originally <br/>
planted under a deep bed of myrtle.  Last year, a prison work crew had <br/>
come through and cleared all the brush.  Fortunately, a nice inmate had <br/>
signed in with his inmate number, and he moved it to a hollow tree <br/>
nearby.  This year, I went back to check on it, and there was a duck <br/>
nesting next to it!  I thought the duck had adopted the container, so I <br/>
apologized for interrupting it and went to get my camera.  When I <br/>
returned, I realized that the little nester hadn't moved.....at all.  A <br/>
couple of pokes with a stick confirmed that the guardian of my box was <br/>
DEAD.  Yuck.  I promptly moved the box, and have updated the clues.  <br/>

(well, mostly wings and feathers), but it was pretty gross.<br/>
I did have to move the 'material' to get at the box.<br/>

That box you are refering to was our first find -- and I am only learning now that you *did* wash it . . . LOL we had the van smelling of hand sanitizer for a week... we all practically bathed in the stuff after reading in the logbook of your horrendous experience.<br/>

Yes, we found a dead cat decaying and stuck to the top of the letterbox. It <br/>
was sad and disgusting. The box is near the road, so we hope the cat was <br/>
there by accident! We went to a nearby vet office, coincidently, and washed <br/>
up the container for the next finder. That was our 3rd find - but luckily we <br/>
weren't turned off to letterboxing in general.<br/>

I've found a couple of boxes with messages, "Looking for mushrooms, found this by mistake."<br/>
<br/>
And one of my favorite box finds, "Nowhere, Man" (look up the clues its near Laramie, WY) was found by a FED-EX driver fixing a flat tire. He put a one dollar bill in the logbook and wrote asking other people to add a one dollar bill to his. So that, one day, if a desperate human being HHiker or someone else who broke down should find the box they would have a few dollars for food/gas (even though the closest food/gas to that box is a hundred mile drive, because the box is . . . "Nowhere, Man!!")<br/>
