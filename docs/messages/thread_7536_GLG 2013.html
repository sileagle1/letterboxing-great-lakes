                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's great to have a potential volunteer to host in Ohio!  As far as I know,<br>
SpringChick still does the official selection of the host, or organizes a<br>
poll if there are multiple hosts/locations that volunteer.  You may also<br>
want to contact her directly.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
My husband & I hosted the GLG in 2006 (and another event prior to that).  I<br>
generated some notes afterwards that I have passed along to several others<br>
that have hosted in subsequent years.  However it sounds like you already<br>
have experience hosting an event, so are probably a "pro" already!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We've never been to Hocking Hills but have heard a lot about it over the<br>
past several years.  It sounds like a VERY nice park and we'd love to have<br>
an excuse to get there.  Perhaps you can get some assistants that live<br>
nearer to plant boxes. However hosts can select any location that is<br>
convenient for them.  Things to keep in mind:<br>
<br>
- Expect 100-150 attendees<br>
<br>
- It is good to have cover/shelter for a large group in case it rains<br>
<br>
- Good to have enough acreage & trails to spread boxes out a bit.<br>
<br>
- Many people like to come for the whole weekend, so a campground at the<br>
park or nearby is a plus (same for hotels)<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
A host can choose a theme themselves, or open it up to discussion and/or a<br>
poll.  When we hosted in 2006 I created a poll on this board (there is a<br>
specific POLLS feature on this message board) and listed several possible<br>
theme ideas. People had a few weeks to vote on their favorite theme and the<br>
one that got the most votes is what we went with.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
My husband & I prefer to be out on the trails to find boxes and then spend<br>
our time at the shelter simply eating and socializing, so the only stamping<br>
we do there is for exchanges.  Tabletop boxes therefore aren't of much<br>
interest to us.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
# of boxes?  Hmmmm.... enough to keep us busy on Saturday and possibly even<br>
Sunday.  Since we are hikers, we like it when an event uses all the trails<br>
within a park and spreads out the boxes.   We really appreciate events where<br>
the boxes are kept out for at least the entire weekend or a week if they<br>
can't be permanent boxes.  With a large event it is also a very good idea to<br>
group boxes into loops with different starting points.  That way you reduce<br>
the likelihood of having mobs of people converging at the same box.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Great Lakes Gatherings have always been potluck in terms of food and that<br>
has worked out well.  If grilling facilities are available you can suggest<br>
that some people may want to bring charcoal as their contribution and others<br>
hot dogs/sausages or other grill items.  Meal and group photo could be<br>
either mid-day or at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Glad to see someone in Ohio getting the ball rolling for next year!!<br>

beautiful.  Burr Oak is another great park.  It has only one shelter but<br>
the park is under-used enough that there are rumors the park may be closed<br>

I think I have it... checked out location...looks good -- the date is more<br>
than likely going to be in July (there is an event in the works for June for<br>
Ohio and I want to be there) May is just too soon to plan properly. So July<br>
it will be. I am looking at the last weekend. The park does have camping and<br>
there are hotels nearby. I will let you all know more details after I get<br>
the shelter reserved. <br>

FAQ file about the GLG event:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Q.  Who hosts the event?<br>
<br>
A.  Each fall, the moderators of the LB Great Lakes Yahoo! Group will<br>
solicit the list for volunteers from the eligible state(s) to host the event<br>
for the following year.  During the first six years of the event, an<br>
eligible state is any state that has not previously hosted the event. After<br>
all states have had a chance to host and a schedule is set, the next state<br>
in the rotation is the eligible state.  In the event there are no willing<br>
hosts from an eligible state, it will move to the next state in the<br>
rotation.  If more than one person/state volunteers, a poll will be used to<br>
allow group members to choose their preference of location.<br>
<br>
SpringChick is the moderator/owner of this board and she has always made the<br>
official announcement/confirmation as to who hosts the event.  You may want<br>
to look at the Gatherings folder in the Files section of this board to<br>
review the file with more info about the annual GLG.  This link might get<br>
you there directly: <br>

It is rather difficult trying to keep up with both AQ and Yahoo groups.  I have communicated with Spring Chick.  <br>
