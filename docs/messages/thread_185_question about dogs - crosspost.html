Here's a question that'll likely get a variety of reactions.but here<br/>
we go:<br/>
What are recommended responses to encountering dog(s)on the trail?<br/>
Here's the situation: The park does not require leashes or have any<br/>
posted dog related rules. I was walking on the trail when I saw an<br/>
energetic, young hound-type dog with another hiker who was far behind<br/>
me. I heard the dog running up behind me and then past. He stopped<br/>
and then turned and ran back to me and jumped with his front paws on<br/>
my chest.<br/>
I sharply commanded, "down"! Eventually he ran away. But then twice<br/>
more during this short hike the same dog did the same thing.<br/>
What would you have done?<br/>
I admit that I am not a dog-person.<br/>
I'm especially interested in what ideas you dog lovers would suggest.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

That's a perfect case of poor dog ownership.  The hiker should A) have control of his/her dog at all times, even if there is no leash involved and B)have apologized to you and then made sure the dog didn't approach you again.  <br/>
<br/>
As a dog lover, I would never put my dogs in danger by allowing them to approach stange people.  Sure, you're a well-mannered human, but there are plenty of people out there who, in the same situation, would have responded with kicks and punches- not something I'd like my dogs to go through.<br/>
<br/>
But, the owner you met obviously doesn't share the same philosophy as I do, so I guess YOU have to be the responsible party.  If you're the brave type, you could talk to the owner (if you can see them), and explain what that dog did, and could they please make sure it doesn't happen again?  This is, of course, assuming that the wayward dog owner is simply not aware of the ruckus their dog is causing.  Some people, I'm sure, know, and just don't care.  In which case, I suggest you just start screaming in a high pitched voice, and yelling "I'm a lawyer, I'm an injury lawyer!  Get your dog away from me!"  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
I know someone on the other list who carries pepper spray just for that reason, but again (as a dog lover), I'd hate to suggest that.<br/>
<br/>

what my response would have been.  When I was a meer 10 years old I <br/>
encountered a German Shepard that ended up biting my back side and <br/>
I've been pretty leary of dogs since.  I'm sometimes pretty direct <br/>
and would let the owner know for sure.  But then again, who knows, <br/>
maybe a scream of terror would say it all.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you handled yourself well.  The dogs needs a new <br/>
owner that cares enough to not let him run loose.<br/>

something like that happen. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people out <br/>
there that just plain do not think. My husband is not a dog lover as he was <br/>
bit as a child. This can be a very traumatic thing for the rest of ones <br/>
life. I have taught him several ways to counteract when something like this <br/>
happens (depending on whether the dog is friendly or not). You will never <br/>
be able to stop people from being stupid but that is what gives you the <br/>
right to ask the owner to please keep his dog from "attacking" you.  Pet <br/>
the dog or hold his collar till the owner shows up and explain that you do <br/>
not appreciate his dog mauling you even if it is in a friendly manner. <br/>
Maybe it will sink in and maybe it won't but at least you tried. Don't let <br/>
one bad apple spoil the whole bunch, Okay?<br/>
