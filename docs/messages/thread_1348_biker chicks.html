With my other boxes, I do like to tie in the hiding place or something in<br>
the clues to the title, but my problem is I don't have hiding places yet.<br>
It's hard to name one "Biker Chicks:  26th Street access spur".  That was my<br>
rationale behind "hurricane names".  It would be a cute way to designate<br>
them ("Hey, nice job on Gertrude!"  "Josephine looks like she needs a new<br>
logbook.").  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Any other opinions??<br>

I like the idea of the names - like hurricanes. Or we can do Biker<br>
<br>
Chicks: Whatever .....  something that relates to the stamps. I can go for<br>
either. How many are participating so far? I have one and Kookaburra has<br>
one, Pippin too right?<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I think we can do ok by placing under our existing trail names and<br>
referecing the series in our clues. But I am open on that too. It is time to<br>
get them out there I guess. Mighty fine boxing weather.<br>
