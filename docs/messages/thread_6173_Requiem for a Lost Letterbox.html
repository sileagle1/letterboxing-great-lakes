It appears that Cemetery Stroll #3:  Forest Park Flapper is a goner.  She disappeared a year or so ago when they bulldozed the small cluster of rocks she was hiding in.  I replanted her again in that nice deserted part of the cemetery, but alas, they REALLY went to town with the bulldozer this time.  It wasn't just a little stand of rocks they removed this time, but a huge stretch of downed trees and rocks, etc.  I tried looking for her yesterday, but she is probably in the middle of one of the big piles of debris :~(   I guess the one downside of planting in camo'ed boxes is that it makes them harder to find at a time like this.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of me wants to replant (so that ALL of the cemetery strolls are available), but part of me wonders if she is--indeed--cursed.<br/>
