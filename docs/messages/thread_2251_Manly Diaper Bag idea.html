                    <div class="plaintext-content">Awesome idea, Look back a couple days and read my TOTW reply. I use a diaper bag as my trail bag. I won't list all the things here again that it holds but it is the best bag ever! Find me on June 3rd at Lapham Peak and I'll show you the bag. Funny story: my wife and I had our first child 5 months ago. We were at a garage sale last summer and I happened to come across the diaper bag I use as my trail bag before she did. I picked it up and she said " That will be a nice travel diaper bag", au contrair I said, this has Letterboxing written all over it. A small, fun, discussion ensued over said diaper bag and I won out. I found it quite funny that I was arguing ( kind of ) over who would get the "diaper" bag. <br>

small "little tripper" bag and a larger "Do It All" bag.  We've given <br>
several as gifts and they have been a hit for a variety of purposes, <br>
even after it functions as a diaper bag.  Here's a link to the small <br>
one (can click on the photo on the upper right side for big bag info):<br>
