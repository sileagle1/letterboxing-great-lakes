Although reservations cannot be made until January, we are planning to host<br/>
the event at Blue Mounds State Park, a half an hour outside of Madison, WI,<br/>
on Saturday, June 9th, 2012.  Camping is available at the park, and there<br/>
are many hotels and even other campgrounds in the surrounding area.<br/>
<br/>
Our theme for the gathering is Cartoons!  While the 'Bird Patrol already has<br/>
the lock down on the Smurfs, there are near endless possibilities, and we<br/>
hope it will be a lot of fun for all.<br/>
<br/>
More details will emerge as we get closer, but for now, mark your calendars<br/>

You know, Deedle &amp; I really have to start planning things better.  In 2006, we had to miss the Great Lakes Gathering because silly us decided to plan a wedding for the weekend after.  Last year we missed it again because it was the 5th anniversary of that wedding, and for some reason didn't feel like celebrating it with mosquitoes and mud.  And now this year we're going to have to take a pass again, because Baby Bug is due on June 3, 2012.  As anxious as we will be to take Baby on their first letterboxing adventure, we should probably wait until they're more than just one week old (assuming baby is born when expected).<br/>

<br/>
Would anyone be interested in a pre-gathering event? I have fond memories of<br/>
pizza parties and this time I hope to have a couple extra days for local<br/>
boxes or along the way from Chicago. I'd be happy to find a local place to<br/>
get a bite and some exchanges if there is interest.<br/>

Since there is interest, I'll look in to finding a decent sized venue that can have a good sized, rowdy crowd.<br/>
