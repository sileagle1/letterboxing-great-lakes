                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today Peabody and I went to look for Wisconsin Hiker's Year of the Pig <br/>
LB.  I've tried 3 previous times - she and Martini Man checked on the <br/>
box after our third try, and replaced the last landmark.  Why go out in <br/>
snow that's over our knees in places? To meet my quest to find all <br/>
the "findable" boxes in the county by the end of the year - this was <br/>
the last one! Of course we had to talk with the nice police officer who <br/>
happened to pull into the park right after us.  I thought we were going <br/>
to have to 'fess up about LBing after he asked in a friendly way what <br/>
we were gonna do - we said hiking.  This place is a former search radar <br/>
site that protected the skies of Milwaukee until the '80's.  He <br/>
suggested trying snowshoeing as it is lots of fun, "Like walking on a <br/>
cloud".  That's two conversations with police officers for me in a <br/>
week - NOT normal.  The other one was a warning about lights not <br/>
working.  Anyway.  We found it!  THANK YOU Wisconsin Hiker and Martini <br/>
Man for your help with finding this box - and for your kind patience <br/>
with my many questions and comments over the last six months!<br/>
