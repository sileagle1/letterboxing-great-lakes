The press does research most information. Maybe AQ and Letterboxing.org <br/>
should have a Media/Press information page. It would detail the <br/>
important information. The reporters won't have to read the whole <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually letterboxing.org has a link for media/press inquiries and Choi forwards those inquiries to veteran letterboxers in the area where the inquiring publication is located.  This is how the Time Magazine article was routed as well as the Grand Rapids Magazine article.  The Time Magazine article was pretty innocuous as compared to some that we have seen lately and considering their position, they were very accommodating and abided well within the guidelines we gave them.  The Grand Rapids Magazine article also was very well written and also quite respectful.  Not only did this guy "get it" but he was able to present two different boxing perspectives in his story and elude to the cloak &amp; dagger philosophy.  He also asked permission before mentioning any boxes or writing about his own letterboxing adventure -- yes as part of his research he actually went letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately most reporters don't bother contacting the LbNA site in this way, rather they look up clues for letterboxes in the area they cover and then contact the placers, thinking they are going to get the "real" story from the real people rather than the canned media answer.  This is compounded by the fact that many veteran letterboxers, shunning publicity, don't reply or agree to talk to reporters, thus they end up with less experienced, exuberant, "oh golly, this is the greatest thing in the world" new letterboxers.  The Grand Rapids Press recently ran an article in which the woman who was interviewed went on and on about her involvement in letterboxing -- to read it you would have thought she was like a veteran straight from Dartmoor and had planted hundreds of boxes, etc.  Strange thing was -- nobody around here had ever even heard of her before.<br/>
