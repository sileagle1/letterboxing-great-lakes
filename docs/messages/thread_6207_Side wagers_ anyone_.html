                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Ok, so it seems that neither WiHior Azo are running a side wagers game this year. I will pick up the ball! It's a lot of fun and adds another dimension to the bingo game. Hopefully my attempt will not be too lame! <br>
<br>
Side Wagers 2010 info:<br>
<br>
Side Wager: A wager on a particular team, or side, to win a contest <br>
<br>
If you'd again like to add some excitement to the Letterboxing Bingo game, enter the Side Wagers Game. Email the date you think the game will end to baliddle@sbcglobal.net <br>
<br>
When will SpringChick pull the item that finally and completely fills in some player's card? The date you want to guessrepresents the first full card winner"Big Game", not the five interim games. The date will be determined by the claiming of a successful card by a BINGO player (and its certification by SpringChick). <br>
<br>
Your guess must be submitted by January 10, 2009. <br>
Mail to baliddle@sbcglobal.net<br>
In the subject line, put "Sidewager". <br>
<br>
The winner's prize goes to the person who is closest *before* the day the Bingo Game ends or actually hits the date on the dot. If you choose February 15th, for example, and someone else chooses the 20th, and the game ends on the 19th, you win. In other words, you'll hold all of the days until the next guesser hits the calendar. (But you don't know who has chosen which days or how far apart they've fallen -- and neither does SpringChick!). <br>
<br>
If two or more players choose the same date the first guesser is given the date and another available date will be assigned to anyone else who chooses the date already taken. This will be done by moving out in the calendar until a date between your choice and the next one chosen is available. So, if you choose Feb 20 and it's already taken, and the next date chosen is the 24th, you'll be assigned the 22nd. If there is another player already on that date and it is not available, you'll move to the next available date. <br>
<br>
A prize will be awarded to the lucky winner. <br>
You do not need to be a player in the big game to participate. <br>
