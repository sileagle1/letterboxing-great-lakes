  We're heading to Mackinac for a few days in August and wonder if <br/>
  anyone has any current status information about the seven boxes listed <br/>
  on the island.  I'd love to find some but with some 'non-boxes' among <br/>
  us I would really like to skip any known to be missing.  I'd also love <br/>
  anyone's opion on any 'don't miss this one' boxes.  You can let me <br/>
