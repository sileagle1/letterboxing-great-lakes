                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
We had a great 3-day weekend, letterboxing mostly in Door County, <br>
WI.  For those that don't know where that is, it is the "thumb" of <br>
Wisconsin that extends into Lake Michigan, sometimes known as "The <br>
Cape Cod of the Midwest".<br>
<br>
We had FABULOUS weather - no rain, not too hot, not too cold!  We <br>
found all 15 boxes we set out to find in the county and had many <br>
great views of sun sparkling on the water, great hikes through woods, <br>
beaches, bluffs, etc.  Of course the boxes contained many great <br>
stamps to commemorate our journeys.  Thanks to all of you who plant <br>
boxes (I can't say this enough!).  We also found time to do some wine <br>
tasting and eat some great meals.<br>
<br>
We were especially pleased to find some of the oldest boxes placed in <br>
WI, including that believed to be the first box placed in the state.  <br>
Before leaving, we planted another box in the county (clues posted <br>
soon), then adopted an older box in the Green Bay area, met some new <br>
boxers and did an exchange (their first meeting with other boxers) <br>
and found 4 more boxes enroute home.<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to our next 3-day boxing weekend in MI on Labor <br>
Day weekend.  Hopefully the weather will be as good - from what I <br>
have read, I have no doubt that the boxes will be plentiful and the <br>
stamps delightful!<br>

best Swedish pancakes ever.  The goats on the roof are kind of a neat touch<br>
also.<br>
<br>
There are not a lot of sandy beachy areas such as we have over here on the<br>
Michigan side of the lake -- mostly rocky shorelines there, but you may find<br>
a few.  A great lakeside park to visit is Cave Point County Park which is on<br>
the Lake Michigan side, south of Bailey's Harbor & Jacksonport -- there is a<br>
nice scenic drive that runs up the Lake Michigan side of the peninsula.<br>
Cave Point is not as busy as the nearby Whitefish Dunes State Park and has<br>
some very neat rock ledges and rock formations along the water line that are<br>
somewhat like caves (thus the name).  Here is a link that gives a nice<br>
overview of the park.  It was one of our favorite little out-of-the-way<br>
places in Door County.  I believe dogs are allowed on leash at all Door<br>
County County parks.<br>
<br>
http://www.doorcountynavigator.com/html/gems/cave.html<br>
<br>
Whitefish Dunes State Park, just up the road from there, is somewhat busier<br>
than Cave Point, but it is is one of the great sandy beach areas in Door<br>
County.  They do allow dogs on half of the beach area there (I think the<br>
south half).  It is supposedly the best place to watch a Door County<br>
sunrise.<br>
<br>
Lots of great galleries and shops and so much to see -- do take time to ride<br>
some of the back roads and view the countryside and some of the awesome<br>
barns in the area.  And of course the lighthouses are awesome.  We took our<br>
boat over and rode out to a few that are on islands in Green Bay.  Found out<br>
the hard way why the water up at the tip is known as the Devil's Door -- I<br>
have never been so scared in the boat ever...  and it was smooth and calm<br>
when we left land.  You can see several of the lighthouses from land though.<br>
Of course, Cana Island is a favorite, but I also really liked the big red<br>
one out on the end of the pier at Sturgeon Bay.  The other lighthouse in the<br>
Sturgeon Bay area is used as a summer home for Coast Guard personnel and is<br>
off-limits to tourists.  But we asked real nice if we could take some<br>
pictures and they were very friendly.<br>
<br>
Door County is one of my very favorite places and I am sure you will have a<br>
great time there!<br>

Hi, I joined this group a short time ago and have been lurking  (sorry) BUT I <br>
have to pipe up on this topic!  If you are going to  Door County, you MUST do <br>
the Washington Island Letterboxes (by Leapin  Lizzards!)  They are <br>
WONDERFUL!!!  I HIGHLY recommend  them!!!  Not only do you get the joy of searching, but <br>
hers take you  on a FABULOUS sight-seeing tour!!  Totally worth the $$$$ to <br>
go over  on the ferry. <br>
 <br>
We go every year so if you want to e-mail me off the list, I can give  you <br>
some ideas of where to go and what to do!<br>
