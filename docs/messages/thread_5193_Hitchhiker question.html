I am heading to Chicago for the weekend, and thought I'd do some <br/>
boxing.  I would like to hide my first HH in an existing box and <br/>
wondered if anyone had any advice on stamps and containers.  I recently <br/>
picked up a HH in a box and it was a small, beautiful little stamp in a <br/>
neat glass tube container with a lid.  I still have not received my <br/>
carving supplies to make my own stamps that I ordered from Dixie on <br/>
line, so would it be weird to do a small store-bought stamp?  I fear my <br/>
signature stamp is too large for a HH.  Should I put it in a case or <br/>
just a ziploc bag?  Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Popcorn Lady (love that name)!  You can use a store-bought stamp for a HH if you want to.  Although I think the preference is hand-carved, there is nothing that says it must be.  The thing you will find with a store bought stamp, especially for a HH, is that the majority of the stamps sold by retail stores have wood backings, which can make the stamp a bit bulky.  The idea with a HH is to make it small enough to fit easily into most existing letterboxes along with the box contents already there.<br/>
<br/>
Some people do use separate containers for HH's, but most of the time they are just a bagged log and stamp, which leaves them smaller and more flexible to put into a letterbox.  The glass tube container you found sounds interesting, but I'm not sure how well the glass will hold up over time and it would be a mess if it broke inside a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun in Chicago -- some great boxes there!<br/>

Every hitchhiker I've ever found (14), and also the 3 I've launched, have <br/>
been hand-carved stamps.  Sometimes the HH and its logbook have been just <br/>
inside a plastic baggie, and sometimes inside a very small container such as <br/>
a film canister.<br/>
<br/>
You probably know this already, but the HH stamp image is stamped into the <br/>
logbook of the host letterbox, and the host stamp into the HH logbook.  As <br/>
the HH moves from box to box, the stamp image from each host box shows its <br/>
travels.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck boxing in Chicago!<br/>
