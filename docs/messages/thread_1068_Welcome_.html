each other Saturday at the Paw.  She was actually in the Cyberdog (the back<br>
portion of the building) while the rest of us were meeting in the front.<br>
Anyway, I told her all about the great people in this group, so here she is<br>
as a new member!<br>

Have the boys picked out their trail names yet?<br>
