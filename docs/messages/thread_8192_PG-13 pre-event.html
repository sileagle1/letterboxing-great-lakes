                    <div class="plaintext-content">Special thanks to TJMich and HowD Girls for hosting the pre-gathering <br/>
event!  They have posted it on AQ with the clever name PG-13: The <br/>
Pre-GLG13 Get-together: Letterboxers Strongly Cautioned! They have <br/>
picked a park that is about 1 mile south of the Lowden camping grounds <br/>
in a city park that boasts parking, a shelter, bathrooms, and a nice <br/>
playground.<br/>
<br/>
As for the actual gathering, we will start to give a bit more <br/>
information/reminders about the event next week, after the Memorial day <br/>
weekend.  Last reminders to send us donations to get the 'Supporter <br/>
Series' carved by Coffee Beans (ie, rare!)  and clue packets early for <br/>
the suggested donation of $10/adult or $25/family.<br/>
<br/>
A few notes about the park.  The trails are generally nice and wide, <br/>
mostly grass or dirt, and very doable with most any sort of off-roading <br/>
stroller.  There is 8-10miles of trails adjacent to the gathering <br/>
shelters between the north and south trails, and we are going to end up <br/>
planting most of the boxes there.  However, the trails do seem to be <br/>
lined with a decent amount of what looks like poison ivy.  We are trying <br/>
to avoid planting boxes in those areas, but we can't guarantee it!  <br/>
Also, all the trails seem to have at least one big hill along the way, <br/>
if not a few.  On the plus side, we are planting the boxes a bit closer <br/>
than originally planned to make up for the ups and downs.  Finally, <br/>
although we haven't had any run-ins yet, I wouldn't be surprised if <br/>
there are ticks around.<br/>
<br/>
almost time for the GLG!<br/>
