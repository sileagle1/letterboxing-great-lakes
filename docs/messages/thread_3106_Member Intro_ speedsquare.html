I stumbled upon letterboxing via the internet in the summer of 2003 through a link at the <br>
Carving Consortium.  Like many, I needn't look further than the LbNA home page; I was <br>
instantly addicted.  The Smithsonian article seemed vaguely familiar, but I spent most of <br>
the 90's confined to long hours in a small cell (cubicle, if you prefer.)<br>
<br>
We've returned to our Hoosier roots, after living years in Chicagoland and God's Country, <br>
Wisconsin.  But when we left in 2000, there probably weren't many boxes to be found.  It <br>
took a lot of talking ... well, begging ... to convince the silent one (aka lutjanus apodus <br>
indianensis) that this was something we BOTH could do for enjoyment.  He has spread the <br>
word at his workplaces and does a respectable and respectful explanation of the entire <br>
hobby.  His audience is mostly teachers, so it's not a tough sell.  Many of them say things <br>
like "ooh, that sounds so cultural."  He responds, "you have the CULT part right."  He <br>
enjoys that.  He doesn't complain and he keeps me from my stupidity in the woods.  Only <br>
bruises so far.  But he draws the line at Gatherings.  Not that we have cooties, but he <br>
likens it to the GenCon in Indy.  He's just not that social with total strangers.  He is thrilled <br>
that I have found other friends to go boxing with.<br>
<br>
We moved from Indy to Richmond, IN in July.  We still haven't sold the old place, so we are <br>
staying closer to home.  We're closer to the SW OHIO boxing mecca and I look forward to <br>
getting to other parts of Ohio.  And Michigan.  And Pennsylvania.  And Kentucky.  And <br>
back to Chicago and Wisconsin.  Did I mention I'm addicted?<br>
<br>
I have several boxes to plant and more to come next spring.<br>
<br>
For the record,  I have exhausted RUSH COUNTY for the 2nd time.  There are no more <br>
boxes at the present for me to find.  Still have to hit some newer ones in Fayette County.<br>
<br>
I have thoroughly enjoyed meeting many of you and look forward to future gatherings.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on, but it is getting late.<br>
