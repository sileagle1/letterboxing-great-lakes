Hi Bindle Babe, DogLvrs, and those I otherwise met, emailed, or who recognize my stamp - <br>
 <br>
I am still out here, living and letterboxing in Maine (and planting a few here myself).  I keep tabs on the Michigan activity, and had the chance to go out with my folks and best friends (Sisu - mom; Can Man - dad; friends Thumbs Up! and Becky from the Land of Mid) while on an altogether-too-short visit home for Thanksgiving.  In addition to your four boxes, BB, we attempted (SC's) HitckHiker Hostel along Lake Michigan with no success.  The wind was more than nippy blowing off off the lake, and each of us missed (even with a significant amount of scanning and questions like "could that be it?") the key landmarks identified in the clues.  Perhaps we'll try again on my next visit home (in two weeks for Christmas). More likely, with the colder weather, we'll look for boxes away from the biting winds of the Lake. <br>
<br>
I've had a good time boxing out here in the Pine Tree State (another state with the White Pine as it's state tree), though the boxes are more spread out.  Boxing is now a three hour minimum road trip for me, and it's offered a great way to explore this state.  I even surpassed the F200 mark this summer while attending my first gathering - Boxing By The Bay - in August.<br>
 <br>
Hope all boxers are well in my home region of the Great Lakes.  The ocean (along which I am now fortunate to live) is beautiful, but for me it can't compare to the beauty of Lake Michigan.<br>
 <br>
Wishing you all well, <br>
KelticKara<br>
