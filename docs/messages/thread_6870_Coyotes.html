Katy is right.  The coyotes were free roaming in the wild.  They were captured, tagged, and I should have said released again as part of a program.  They don't seem to be bothering people or pets.  They don't appear to be aggressive unless they are cornered.   The website - "urban coyote" ....sounds like a good letterboxing trail name.  Any takers?  <br>

While they are not a serious danger to humans, the little dogs in the <br>
neighbor hood are as risk.  But they must be getting enough food somewhere, <br>
becasue we still have rabbits and squirrels and other critters in the <br>
neighborhood.<br>
Local officials take no stand on coyote packs, other than we have to give <br>
them a wide berth and be careful.  Even if we trap and relocate them, we've <br>
been told that they will return.  Evidently, they have been known to return <br>
from being released 100 miles away.<br>
One neighbor tried to take up a collecion to have a bow-hunter come in and <br>
kill all of them, but we've been told that anoher pack will jsut re-take <br>
over the territory.<br>
That said, we live very near Graue Mill, and Bemis Woods. If you're <br>
letterboxing over there, be aware that there are tons of coyoes over there <br>
too.<br>

While they are not a serious danger to humans, the little dogs in the <br>
neighbor hood are as risk. But they must be getting enough food somewhere, <br>
becasue we still have rabbits and squirrels and other critters in the <br>
neighborhood.<br>
Local officials take no stand on coyote packs, other than we have to give <br>
them a wide berth and be careful. Even if we trap and relocate them, we've <br>
been told that they will return. Evidently, they have been known to return <br>
from being released 100 miles away.<br>
One neighbor tried to take up a collecion to have a bow-hunter come in and <br>
kill all of them, but we've been told that anoher pack will jsut re-take <br>
over the territory.<br>
That said, we live very near Graue Mill, and Bemis Woods. If you're <br>
letterboxing over there, be aware that there are tons of coyoes over there <br>
too.<br>

I can thank the Warner Brothers for my first impressions of coyotes.  I only learned a couple of years ago that coyotes were native to Indiana.  I thought they only lived in the warm southwestern states.<br>
