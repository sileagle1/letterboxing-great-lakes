                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many of you will be happy to know that I'm spending my winter break<br/>
working on the webpage for this series (since the snow hindered my<br/>
plans to work on boxes outdoors).  I'll be uploading and testing the<br/>
new webpage soon.  If you are going to check it out, be advised that<br/>
it will take a while to load especially if you have dial-up, but I<br/>
hope you feel the wait is worth it!  It probably also works best on IE.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I have not recieved the clues to many of the boxes,<br/>
so I'm requesting that if you have clues to send me, please send them<br/>
soon.  I know that a number of the missing clues are my fault - either<br/>
boxes I need to hide, or boxes I've just sent out to their placers. <br/>
(BTW, Papeseed - PLEASE contact me!!!) Although I would like the clues<br/>
ASAP, I would rather the boxes be well hidden and clues be<br/>
well-written, rather than be rushed.  In general, it would be nice to<br/>
have this series all set by May 1 for the summer letterboxing season.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, all boxes have been sent to their placers (except<br/>
for the one I need to send to Papeseed).  In case you're wondering,<br/>
here's a list of the clues I have and don't have:<br/>

occasionally prevents those "pop ups".  Just try the link again <br/>

alternate site w/o the neat features:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For now, any links in green are boxes that have clues and are ready <br/>
to be found.  Any in red are not ready.  When all the clues are <br/>
ready, all of the links will turn yellow like the rest of the page <br/>
text.  At that time, I'll also set up the links on the LBNA site and <br/>
let the box creators know how to do the same for their boxes.  Until <br/>
all the boxes are in place, I'd prefer to keep site visitors within <br/>
our own GL group.  (This will help me monitor my bandwidth allotment <br/>
anyway.)<br/>

Enjoy, and keep getting those clues in to me!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">At the behest of the Fischer Queen, this humble Fool journeyed through Lincoln's <br/>
realm on a quest for the Holy Grail.<br/>
<br/>
A great spotted hound threatened me on the path to the "Grail Beacon,"  yet all the <br/>
time he was baying at me with slavering jaws, he wagged his tail. I proceeded on to <br/>
victory.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing my journey, I was nearly undone by sucking mud that threatened to <br/>
swallow me and devious clues that nearly confounded me. However, I found a knight <br/>
lying prone and grievously wounded; I offered assistance but he assured me, "It's just <br/>
a flesh wound." <br/>
<br/>
I met "Sir Bedevere"who had already received the visits of other worthy knightsin <br/>
the woods where he appeared to be hiding from an infestation of muggles.<br/>
<br/>
I wandered on and heard troubadours singing of Sir Robin who "When danger reared <br/>
its ugly head, he bravely turned and fled."  Unlike Robin, I persevered, crossing a <br/>
treacherous path requiring a finely honed sense of balance, and found another <br/>
treasure.<br/>
<br/>
I sought the "Catapulted Cow" and traveled on through the woods, but my knees <br/>
shook as I found my way toward an awful roaring.  At the top of a hilljust where I <br/>
believed my path should bea huge yellow beast, spouting reeking black smoke and <br/>
tearing up the earth, had eaten my road.  This monster was so unnerving that I have <br/>
retired to a hermitage where I will pray for guidance before I battle the beast.<br/>

<br/>
At the behest of the Fischer Queen, this humble Fool journeyed through<br/>
Lincoln's<br/>
realm on a quest for the Holy Grail.<br/>
<br/>
A great spotted hound threatened me on the path to the "Grail Beacon,"  yet<br/>
all the<br/>
time he was baying at me with slavering jaws, he wagged his tail. I<br/>
proceeded on to<br/>
victory.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing my journey, I was nearly undone by sucking mud that threatened to<br/>
swallow me and devious clues that nearly confounded me. However, I found a<br/>
knight<br/>
lying prone and grievously wounded; I offered assistance but he assured me,<br/>
"It's just<br/>
a flesh wound."<br/>
<br/>
I met "Sir Bedevere"who had already received the visits of other worthy<br/>
knightsin<br/>
the woods where he appeared to be hiding from an infestation of muggles.<br/>
<br/>
I wandered on and heard troubadours singing of Sir Robin who "When danger<br/>
reared<br/>
its ugly head, he bravely turned and fled."  Unlike Robin, I persevered,<br/>
crossing a<br/>
treacherous path requiring a finely honed sense of balance, and found<br/>
another<br/>
treasure.<br/>
<br/>
I sought the "Catapulted Cow" and traveled on through the woods, but my<br/>
knees<br/>
shook as I found my way toward an awful roaring.  At the top of a hilljust<br/>
where I<br/>
believed my path should bea huge yellow beast, spouting reeking black smoke<br/>
and<br/>
tearing up the earth, had eaten my road.  This monster was so unnerving that<br/>
I have<br/>
retired to a hermitage where I will pray for guidance before I battle the<br/>
beast.<br/>

&gt; Ok, the site is up and (hopefully) ready for your amusement.  If you<br/>
&gt; find any bugs, let me know.  (Any web designers out there who want<br/>
&gt; to give me, a fledgling, advice, feel free.) I've only tested it on<br/>
&gt; IE, so I don't know how it'll work on other browsers.  Any links you<br/>
&gt; click on will open a new window, and I've noticed that IE<br/>
&gt; occasionally prevents those "pop ups".  Just try the link again<br/>
&gt; until it pops up.  It worked for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you want all the "bells and whistles" and to have lots of HG<br/>
&gt; amusement, go to the regular page at:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; http://geocities.com/the_lb_dragon/Search_for_the_Holy_Grail.htm<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have dial-up and don't want to wait a while, here is the<br/>
&gt; alternate site w/o the neat features:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; http://geocities.com/the_lb_dragon/Search_for_the_Holy_Grail2.htm<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For now, any links in green are boxes that have clues and are ready<br/>
&gt; to be found.  Any in red are not ready.  When all the clues are<br/>
&gt; ready, all of the links will turn yellow like the rest of the page<br/>
&gt; text.  At that time, I'll also set up the links on the LBNA site and<br/>
&gt; let the box creators know how to do the same for their boxes.  Until<br/>
&gt; all the boxes are in place, I'd prefer to keep site visitors within<br/>
&gt; our own GL group.  (This will help me monitor my bandwidth allotment<br/>
&gt; anyway.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enjoy, and keep getting those clues in to me!<br/>
