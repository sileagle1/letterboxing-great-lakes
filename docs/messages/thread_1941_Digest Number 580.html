Beautiful letterboxing weather! My in-laws picked me up at the airport <br/>
and took me to Duke Gardens to find Grey Matters (first finder!) as a <br/>
means of introducing them to letterboxing. Sad to say, I don't think <br/>
they "got it". Oh, well. Can't convert everyone - and we wouldn't <br/>
want to anyway!<br/>
<br/>
I believe the Tarheel box is not too far from my hotel. I hope they <br/>
let us out of our training sessions early enough (ie, still daylight) <br/>
that I can snag it before I leave Thursday.<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let people know that I finally found a new home for my <br/>
Lucky Leprechaun box. Jigsaw had found the box vandalized in July but <br/>
luckily found all the pieces and mailed the stamp and water-damaged <br/>
logbook to me. (THANK YOU AGAIN!) The stamp is now back in a box with a <br/>
new logbook and a slightly new location. The clues have been updated, <br/>
but if you have already found this box, there is no reason for you to <br/>
return - it is the same stamp (my very first hand-carved stamp).<br/>
<br/>
This weekend we also put a new logbook in Wirth Park, but left the <br/>
original which is almost full. Also checked on Diamond in the Rough <br/>
and Capone's Cargo which were both OK.<br/>
<br/>
Also planted a new box - clues will be posted soon...<br/>

What a gorgeous weekend!!! We brought some friends out letterboxing <br/>
with us on Saturday to help get them into it. We met Merlin and Ardea <br/>
on the trail at one of CMoon's boxes. A first for us, and naturally <br/>
for our newbie friends. (We're kind of newbies ourselves, we've only <br/>
been boxing since July). It was great meeting them on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
We went out today to plant our first series in Elgin, IL. When we <br/>
were done with that, we headed back out to the Haunted Trail series to <br/>
get box 1, which had been missing when we were there rain-boxing last <br/>
weekend. While we were there, we met the Irish Frogs. We want to <br/>
thank CMoon, Kookuburra, and Squeek for this great series that seems <br/>
to have everyone meeting on the trail. It's almost like a mini <br/>
gathering in of itself, and the stamps are great. Besides the Irish <br/>
Frogs, we also saw 5 deer. Last week, we're pretty sure we saw a <br/>
wolf, or the world's largest coyote.<br/>

I would love to make a box for the 2006 Gathering to whom ever is <br/>
hosting it. What do you guys think the theme will most likely be? Has <br/>
there been one in WI as of yet?<br/>

We want to extend our thanks to Cmoon, Kookaburra, Squeek, <br/>
FungusWoman, Snoozer, Nature Nerd, and Jar the Ladybug for providing a <br/>
really great weekend of letterboxing in the La Grange/Brookfield area <br/>
of northern Illinois. Also, a big thanks to Martini Man and Wisconsin <br/>
Hiker for "clueing" us into this lode of letterboxes. Perfect weather, <br/>
great hikes, leaves swish-crunching underfoot, Pumpkin Ice Cream <br/>
at "Sit..Sit..Stay, and excellent stamps all made for a much <br/>
appreciated re-creational time.<br/>
And to top it off (Wonder of Wonders!!) we got our first "on-the-<br/>
trail" exchanges with Cottontails, Cake Baker, and K8E. How much <br/>
better can it get??? <br/>
Again, thanks to all.<br/>
Merlin and Ardea <br/>
