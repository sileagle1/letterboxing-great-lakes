permission to do another one, then I will post it online and then I can <br>
email my address off-post.  This garage sale is one our sub-division <br>
does one day each year.  There are over 200 houses in here but we never <br>
know how many people will participate.  It can get crazy.  I always sell <br>
hot dogs and pop too.<br>
<br>
Azobox---thanks for the tip!  I will go in that direction to see what I <br>
can find out!  I appreciate it.<br>

Trailtracker--clearing a path so I can buy more PZ-Kut!  :)<br>

Sale Letterbox" of The Dragon's is here in time for our community yard <br>
sale tomorrow!  I just emailed my clues to The Dragon to post and I also <br>
just posted them on the state board where the box will be tomorrow.<br>
<br>
This is a VERY cute stamp and there are such great signature stamps <br>
inside the two logbooks as well!<br>
<br>
Thanks so much for the help in getting me this letterbox and letting us <br>
play as well!<br>
