                    <div class="plaintext-content">We second the thanks for a fun event!  The VERY tasty hot sandwiches helped warm us up from the cold winds (as did the yummy mac &amp; cheese that Tiptoe brought).  And the ever-popular Revel bars gave us a good sugar surge.  The BLUE tarps that were hastily hung at the shelter to block some of the wind did indeed help us "Beat the Winter Blues".  Although it was quite chilly today, we were all thankful that there was NO rain.  This meant we could get out to find the numerous boxes.  The Nature Trail at the library was my personal favorite since the trees proved to be an excellent wind block.  <br/>

It was nice to see several of our long time letterboxing friends and we also got to make 7 new exchanges.  We're looking forward to seeing even more people at the 10th Annual Great Lakes Event in Wisconsin on June 9!<br/>
