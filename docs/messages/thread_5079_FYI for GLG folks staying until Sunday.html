<br>
I was just checking out the Afton State Park website again and saw this <br>
posted on the homepage:<br>

<br>
Visitor Alert!<br>
Join us for the Great Minnesota Picnic on Open House Sunday, June 1: <br>
Admission to all Minnesota State Parks and Recreation Areas is FREE <br>
that day - no vehicle permit is required. So pack your picnic basket, <br>
come on out, and enjoy a great summer tradition - a picnic in the park! <br>
Camping fees, however, remain in effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
So for those of you who are staying through Sunday to find more <br>
boxes...you won't have to pay to enter the park again! Yea!! Just <br>
thought I'd spread the word  =) See you all on Saturday. <br>
<br>
