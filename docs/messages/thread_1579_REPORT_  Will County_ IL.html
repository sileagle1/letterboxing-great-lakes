a cool part) and found 1 box at Messenger Marsh and 3 boxes at Messenger<br/>
Woods near Homer Glen, IL, all placed by Howling Coyote.<br/>
<br/>
Found out just how old my maps are.  Homer Glen isn't even on them.  Will<br/>
have to stop by Chicago Motor Club and get a few updated ones.  So I was<br/>
heading out for rural Homer Township instead of Homer Glen.  :-) Only it was<br/>
not-so-rural-anymore Homer Township.<br/>
<br/>
All 4 boxes in very good shape.  Stamps very cute.  I could be carving for a<br/>
hundred years and I won't get letters this nice.<br/>
<br/>
The last of the three boxes at Messenger Woods took me a bit longer than<br/>
scheduled.  Well, actually, more than a bit.  But by the time I found the<br/>
box I was rotflmao at myself.  I don't want to give anything away for others<br/>
who might go searching, so I won't go into detail, but I know those woods<br/>
and I thought I knew exactly where box #3 was.  Wrong!  I ended up searching<br/>
three times instead of one.  So I guess I could say that I went looking for<br/>
six boxes and found three. Dumb dumb dumb.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I found, or that found me, was horseflies.  Was bothered by no<br/>
ticks, very few mosquitoes, but a couple of large horseflies were real pains<br/>
at Messenger Marsh.  The variety of birds at the Marsh was wonderful, and<br/>
the stamp was well worth the drive down there.<br/>
