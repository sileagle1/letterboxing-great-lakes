Deedle & I took a break from our wedding planning<br>
mayhem this past weekend to do some letterboxing<br>
Toledo-way, and on the way home we had a chance to<br>
check on our Duck Tape box.  His home, the 6 trunk<br>
tree with his middle initial carved into one of the<br>
trunks, had been remodeled - and we don't think the<br>
remodelers had his permission.  Two of the trunks had<br>
been sawed off, and a third, the one with his initial,<br>
had been cracked off.  The Duck was nowhere to be<br>
seen.  <br>
<br>
We will probably replace this box, since The Duck is<br>
near and dear to our hearts, but he won't make a<br>
reappearance until late summer at the earliest.<br>
<br>
The Duck may be gone but not forgotten, and thank you<br>
to all who made the journey to visit him!<br>

Can't you just fix it with camoflugue duct tape?<br>
