                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well said, Big Brat of Brat Pack IL. Who said: {Our kids considered it finding a "buried treasure", and we supervise them when they rehide the box. If we feel it's not hidden good enough, we go and show them how to hide it so it's covered and looks like nothing is there.}<br>
<br>
I think this is excellent and wondered why it was such a dilemma. It seemed obvious to me to "watch" your kids and "teach" them correctly if they did it wrong.  Nothing wrong with doing it wrong the first time and "learning" from this. I would think all kids would get into the hiding part. Make a game of it; can you hide it where you found it better than before with no visible trace to Muggles?<br>
<br>
Thanks Big Brat! Travel'n Turtle<br>
