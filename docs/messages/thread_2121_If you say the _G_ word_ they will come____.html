afternoon meeting new letterboxers and lunch to boot! It was <br>
especially nice to finally meet Sil Boxer!  Another thanks to <br>
Prairie Dog for bringing the photograph she took of us on the trail <br>
a while back!  Tonto was disappointed he couldn't join in the fun, <br>
but what the heck....someone has to work to support this addictive <br>

Wow!  All I did was say "hey, if anyone wants to meet for a mini-gathering"<br>

 ========================================<br>
<br>
Wow! is right!  We figured we'd see 3-4 other people for lunch on Wednesday<br>
and were therefore VERY surprised at the big turnout.  We had a great time<br>
chatting with folks we had met before and meeting some others we only "knew"<br>
from posts or seeing their stamps in logbooks.  As usual, there were a<br>
flurry of exchanges which we managed to fit in around the food.  Thanks to<br>
FungusWoman for initiating this gathering and for posting some photos so<br>
quickly!<br>
<br>
We spent the last 3 days of 2005 boxing in Northern IL and still have a LOT<br>
to come back for on future trips.  We didn't realize that when we "headed<br>
south" for part of our holiday week that we would be leaving the snow<br>
behind.  Yes, although WI still had (and HAS) snow on the ground, only a 90<br>
minute trip to the south left it behind.  It made it much easier to find<br>
those "faint trails" mentioned in the clues.  Unfortunately it wasn't<br>
actually WARM, but I guess upper 30s is OK for December.  It sure is a lot<br>
less crowded on the trails in the winter, so it is easier to actually<br>
retrieve the boxes without being seen. It is also interesting to see the<br>
lakes/rivers/ponds with various ice formations.  One looked like it had "ice<br>
bubbles" erupting from the center and it was odd to cross a long bridge over<br>
ice.<br>
<br>
We spent Thursday in the Brookfield area at the impromptu gathering and also<br>
finding several FungusWoman boxes (really liked the Chicago Portage<br>
sculpture) and the interesting "Christmas Around the World Series" by the<br>
Waltzing Pigs.  Friday we were a bit further west and north.  We especially<br>
enjoyed the hike at "Poo Shoe" and the funny stamp.  However our boxing on<br>
Friday was cut short in mid-afternoon by sleet which quickly turned to rain.<br>
We checked into our hotel and read instead.  Luckily this morning it was dry<br>
and we were out on the hunt early in the day.  We can't believe how many<br>
nice forest preserve areas there are in Illinois - lots of great spots<br>
tucked in the residential communities.  Our longest trek was when we went<br>
"fishing" for those colorful "Fish of Belize".  My toes were starting to get<br>
a bit cold on that one, even WITH my liner socks on.  We had a lucky last<br>
day of the year - we found every box we looked for!  (For a short while we<br>
thought "Baby Boy" had been kidnapped, but luckily we found him safe & sound<br>
after a bit more looking.)<br>
<br>
Happy New Year to all of you and we're looking forward to more letterboxing<br>
fun in 2006!<br>

  I feel like Santa Claus passed by my house and forgot to drop off presents on Christmas!<br>
   <br>
  LOL!  Seriously though, glad everyone had a really good time, I'll be waiting and looking forward to the next gathering  :-)<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

I was bummed to find we missed the mini-gathering as we were in Ohio <br>
(we did find 3 letterboxes while we were there, though).<br>
<br>
Hope there will be another mini-gathering over the winter that we can <br>
make it to.<br>
