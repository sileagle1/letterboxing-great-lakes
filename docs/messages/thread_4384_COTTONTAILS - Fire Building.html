They attend those Scouting Challenge Camp Weekends.  Great fun and those girls really know their stuff.  In a few weeks, I'll be judging a knots and lashing station at a GS Teen Jamboree.  It's also time to start practicing my Wig Wagging and Whistle Signal skills.  <br/>

  If you want to have some real fun, try starting the fire with a bow and <br/>
  spindle, or flint and steel. Some of the "competitions" we went to had <br/>
  that as an event: Start a fire using friction or flint, keep it going <br/>
  long enough to boil a quart of water, fastest time wins! We had <br/>
  another one that involved one match and a bucket of water on a board <br/>
  tied to a string but it would involve diagrams to explain...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like to build useful lashing projects at camp....Chippewa kitchen, work tables, washing stations...etc.  Yes, you absolutely should contact your local GS council.  However, as of October 1, the local councils in this area are 'realigning' into one council - Girl Scouts of Greater Chicago and Northwest Indiana Council.  Wait till then to contact the new council.  Right now, everything is changing and up in the air. The realignments are nation wide per GSUSA's plan.  It will be a good thing.<br/>
I find myself using the basic 8 knots at work, at home, and especially when I'm hauling things in my car and I have to tie the trunk closed securely.  I'm sure my knot tying skills have raised more than a few male eye brows at the Home Depot while loading my little Saturn.  But as for fire building, GS only build safe fires, no larger than needed, and no accelerants...unlike other youth groups I've seen at work.  We saw a group of dads and daughters marching down a hill with flaming, home made torches (toilet paper in metal coffee cans attached to long poles) and our jaws dropped because the little girls were trying to carry these tall flaming torches!!!  Common sense?  Is there any left in the world?  <br/>
<br/>
With all our little ones, you'll be in Scouting for years.  It's a good program!  We need to talk.  <br/>
