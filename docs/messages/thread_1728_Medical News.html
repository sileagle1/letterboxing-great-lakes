                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm so happy for your good news! I do understand your confusion, anger<br>
and frustration during the recent time of terrible uncertainty. It<br>
must have been very difficult for all of you. <br>
<br>
Two things come to mind as I read your message. First, maybe it wasn't<br>
"bad film" at all; maybe it was all the prayers, thoughts, and good<br>
vibes being sent into the universe on her behalf. Miracles do happen;<br>
I've seen them occur. <br>
<br>
Second, as a nurse, I sometimes have my own frustrations with<br>
Physicians, but I am so very thankful that I live in a part of the<br>
world that allows me, and those I care for, to have access to those<br>
Physicians with relative ease. I've been to parts of the world where<br>
this is not case at all.<br>
<br>
Yes, it is the "practice" of medicine, but remember, only humans need<br>
to practice, and what Physicians practice is the gift of healing that<br>
they have been given.<br>
<br>
Celebrate the good fortune, count the blessings and be thankful,<br>
because I've seen that when people focus on the opposite aspect, their<br>
world is a much darker place to dwell. <br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

This is wonderful news indeed!  I would have to echo the sentiments of BindleBabe...  don't discount all the prayers and positive thinking -- prayers are answered, miracles do happen.  Whatever the case, I am sure you are happy beyond words -- be thankful to have received such a blessing.  When things like this happen, it is a lesson to us all that life is not to be taken for granted...<br>
