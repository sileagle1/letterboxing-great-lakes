                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hehe, well, that's sorta why we had to get the grail quest done sooner <br>
rather than later (well, not really :P).  Our wedding isn't going to be <br>
until next spring though, and we managed to have some time earlier this <br>
spring for a few weekend road trips. :)  And it's a good thing we did, <br>
at the rate gas prices are going up.  I've seen a couple stations here <br>
in Chicago where the premium gas is up to $3.99... eeek!<br>
<br>
But anyway, really, once we got going with the quest, we built the whole <br>
thing up and just really wanted to finish the quest first.  I know, I <br>
know -- it wasn't all about the competition (although there were a few <br>
other boxers out there hot on our trail which kept us going... you know <br>
who you are ;) ), but we are both dorks and wanted to be more "cool" in <br>
the eyes of our fellow letterboxers in the region by finishing the <br>
quest... and finishing first just adds that much more to the "cool" <br>
factor. ;)  And yes, we realize that "cool" can also be read as "crazy," <br>
as our families keep telling us. :P<br>
<br>
But we had so many memorable (again read that to be "crazy") trips doing <br>
these boxes that made it all worth it.  For example, our last box ended <br>
up being "The Old Man from Scene 24," which we did at dusk on Saturday <br>
April 7th, right during that huge snowstorm that hit Cleveland and <br>
prevented the first weekend of the Indian's home baseball games.  No, we <br>
hadn't looked at the weekend forecast (granted that was silly of us, but <br>
really would you have thought that there would have been *that* much <br>
snow... at the beginning of April?!).  Of course, after driving from <br>
Chicago to Cleveland (oh, I didn't mention that we didn't take the most <br>
direct route in any way/shape/form --seriously, I dare you to even try <br>
to guess--, but if I tell everyone that, we will just be forever marked <br>
as "those crazy Chicago boxers" no "those cool Chicago boxers" and Atom <br>
will never let me live it down, so I won't), we weren't going to *not* <br>
get the box, so we trudged through the park at dusk through at least a <br>
foot of snow and still heavy snow falling and found our last Grail box. :)<br>
<br>
So anyway, if you have the time/resources for the quest and are up for A <br>
LOT of driving around, it's definitely worth it -- lots of memorable <br>
experiences and new places to see. :)<br>

Yes, we'd like to also offer our belated congratulations to CB & A118 <br>
they are very dedicated knights of the quest!  We have to admit that <br>
we weren't as motivated to finish the series after we found the Grail <br>
box. We decided that would be our personal thrill.  So all honor & <br>
glory (and "coolness") go to the dedicated knights who actually <br>
perservered through harsh conditions to actually finish the series!  <br>
We don't have any current plans to get the remaining boxes, so we <br>
won't be cluttering the field for the race for 2nd & 3rd.  I know <br>
there are more of you out there that have made excellent progress - <br>
hope to hear of you successes soon!<br>

P.S.  Our 29th anniversary is June 10.  Lots of summer weddings in <br>

were at that April 6th home opener.  And we stayed<br>
till the bitter end when the game was finally called. <br>
At least the team officials had a sense of humor about<br>
it.  As we waited for the game to start, they had the<br>
"Home Opener" graphic on the scoreboard and had<br>
photoshopped the image to read "Home Snowpener."  The<br>
make-up game was this past Monday (we had exchanged<br>
our tickets for another date, though - one of our<br>
group is out of town this week) but I read that they<br>
were giving away a trip to Peek n' Peak, snow removal<br>
service, and the leaf blowers they'd been using to<br>
clear the field that day.  <br>

Now that the quest is done, we can move on to planning the wedding... <br>
which as it turns out will be on the 1 year anniversary of the Wormy <br>
Wanderers: May 18th, 2008. :)  And it's still early and we haven't <br>
worked anything out yet, but in addition to the actual wedding, Atom and <br>
I are also going to plan an informal "Letterboxing Wedding" for November <br>
18th, 2007 (T minus 6 months to the actual wedding), which will be <br>
indoors and probably setup very similar to the SILO.  You can sign up on <br>
AQ and more info will be given as we work it out.  So yes, we're going <br>
to be really busy with a lot fun things over the next year!<br>

Hehe, well, that's sorta why we had to get the grail quest done sooner <br>
rather than later (well, not really :P).  Our wedding isn't going to be <br>
until next spring though, and we managed to have some time earlier this <br>
spring for a few weekend road trips. :)  And it's a good thing we did, <br>
at the rate gas prices are going up.  I've seen a couple stations here <br>
in Chicago where the premium gas is up to $3.99... eeek!<br>
<br>
But anyway, really, once we got going with the quest, we built the whole <br>
thing up and just really wanted to finish the quest first.  I know, I <br>
know -- it wasn't all about the competition (although there were a few <br>
other boxers out there hot on our trail which kept us going... you know <br>
who you are ;) ), but we are both dorks and wanted to be more "cool" in <br>
the eyes of our fellow letterboxers in the region by finishing the <br>
quest... and finishing first just adds that much more to the "cool" <br>
factor. ;)  And yes, we realize that "cool" can also be read as "crazy," <br>
as our families keep telling us. :P<br>
<br>
But we had so many memorable (again read that to be "crazy") trips doing <br>
these boxes that made it all worth it.  For example, our last box ended <br>
up being "The Old Man from Scene 24," which we did at dusk on Saturday <br>
April 7th, right during that huge snowstorm that hit Cleveland and <br>
prevented the first weekend of the Indian's home baseball games.  No, we <br>
hadn't looked at the weekend forecast (granted that was silly of us, but <br>
really would you have thought that there would have been *that* much <br>
snow... at the beginning of April?!).  Of course, after driving from <br>
Chicago to Cleveland (oh, I didn't mention that we didn't take the most <br>
direct route in any way/shape/form --seriously, I dare you to even try <br>
to guess--, but if I tell everyone that, we will just be forever marked <br>
as "those crazy Chicago boxers" no "those cool Chicago boxers" and Atom <br>
will never let me live it down, so I won't), we weren't going to *not* <br>
get the box, so we trudged through the park at dusk through at least a <br>
foot of snow and still heavy snow falling and found our last Grail box. :)<br>
<br>
So anyway, if you have the time/resources for the quest and are up for A <br>
LOT of driving around, it's definitely worth it -- lots of memorable <br>
experiences and new places to see. :)<br>
