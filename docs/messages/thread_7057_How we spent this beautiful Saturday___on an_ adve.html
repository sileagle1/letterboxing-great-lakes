Good day to go letterboxing.  Mr. Beetle agreed to go with me to revisit a letterbox which I was unable to find last year due to overgrowth conditions and large, unleashed, barking dogs.   Good that my hubby came along.  Today, my foot sank deep into a mushy clay hole in the ground which was covered with leaves.  The ground just grabbed my hiking boot and pulled it off my foot.  He reached deep into the hole and retrieved it for me.  We climbed through the  'debris field,' and passed two homeless shanties near the location, but I found the letterbox.  I just don't understand why he doesn't enjoy this hobby as much as I do.   LOL!  ---Beetle<br/>

Wow! Two set of adventures today! Glad you were all successful in your<br/>
hunts.<br/>
<br/>
We're hoping to get out for some finding &amp; re-planting tomorrow if the<br/>
storms stay away.<br/>

We too had a letterboxing adventure today. Fortunately we didn't have to<br/>
ford any streams with a baby filled stroller over our heads! Our hats go off<br/>
to the Atomic Beans!<br/>
<br/>
Tonto had work in Springfield (IL) yesterday, so Tiptoe decided to go along<br/>
with the hopes of maybe getting in a few boxes today before heading back<br/>
home. It stormed all night long and we were certain the trails would be<br/>
water logged. They did prove to be a bit soggy, but nothing resembling GLK<br/>
2010! <br/>
All was fine except... (hard as this may be for some of you to believe),<br/>
Tiptoe left her glasses at home and couldn't read a thing. But worse, she<br/>
left ALL of her letterboxing gear at home as well!<br/>
Tonto had an old pair of glasses in the glove box that she could at least<br/>
make out some things, a quick stop at Hobby Lobby for new markers, sketch<br/>
book, and a piece of rubber...she was carving away in the car in route to<br/>
the first box. It is about the worse thing any of you will ever see! Blame<br/>
it on the bumpy car ride, shortness of time (minutes), shovel gouge, and<br/>
blurry vision! But with the quick carve of "TnT" , we had a "hand carved"<br/>
sig stamp and we were ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
We were enjoying the beautiful spring day finding the boxes, but as we were<br/>
finishing up one longer trail, we were striping down to the bare<br/>
essentials...it had reached 85 degrees! Our bodies were just not used to hot<br/>
humid weather! We went from winter to summer in a flash! <br/>
<br/>
We found a few drive by's as we blasted the air conditioner in the car.<br/>
Headed for another box in a lakeside park, but it was swarming with so many<br/>
people that there was no way we could grab the box without half of the<br/>
people in central Illinois witnessing two very strangely "undressed" folks<br/>
poking around their picnic/fishing activities.<br/>
<br/>
We also made the observation that LOVE must've been in the air...around many<br/>
bends in the trails we ran into young (and old couples) embracing/kissing<br/>
etc....we could hear Old Owl telling Bambi, "Yes. Nearly everybody gets<br/>
twitterpated in the springtime. For example: You're walking along, minding<br/>
your own business. You're looking neither to the left, nor to the right,<br/>
when all of a sudden you run smack into a pretty face. Woo-woo! You begin to<br/>
get weak in the knees. Your head's in a whirl. And then you feel light as a<br/>
feather, and before you know it, you're walking on air. And then you know<br/>
what? You're knocked for a loop, and you completely lose your head!" <br/>
<br/>
We also saw a bald eagle soaring right overhead, white pelicans, red bud and<br/>
magnolia's blooming! Take heart all of you further north...Spring is coming!<br/>
(or should we say Summer!) FYI.....Beware that HOT &amp; Humid stuff is headed<br/>
north toward Chicago tomorrow (Sunday)...with possibilities of storms that<br/>
could turn tornadic!<br/>
<br/>
A good drive back up to Chicago following old Route 66..eating at Palm's<br/>
Cafe (a throw back blue plate special restaurant in Atlanta), picking up<br/>
some Funk's Grove SIRUP..and a few more drive by's before heading home, made<br/>
for a great day....but now too tired for any twitterpating on our part!<br/>
