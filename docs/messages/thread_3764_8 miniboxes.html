6. Cootie count at the SILO<br>

7 cooties passed through my hands, but none came home with me that I know of :)<br>
<br>
I'd like to belatedly thank the Brat Pack for the origami gift bags with stamps.  What a lot of work must have gone into this project!<br>
<br>
A question:  do the 8 miniboxes hidden at the SILO event count as "finds" in my total?<br>

Count whatever you wish to count whichever way you wish to count them. Those<br>
8 boxes did have clues you had to follow to find them, though by the end<br>
they were pretty much just "out there". The others all being in open view<br>

Yeah, if they have clues, we generally count them as Finds, even if they are<br>
easy finds. If they don't have clues, we just add them to our<br>
"Miscellaneous" count. But as FungusWoman said, use your own personal rules.<br>
