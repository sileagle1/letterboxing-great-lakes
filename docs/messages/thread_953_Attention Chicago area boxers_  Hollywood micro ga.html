I would love to come. Unfortunately, that's the weekend my winter training with Grandmaster Jeung is supposed to start, so I'll have to wait for it to come in the mail. On the bright side, there should be lots of interesting stamps in the logbook for me to check out by the time it makes it down to me.<br/>

you guys doing??  Good to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so here's the scoop for anyone interested...(sorry it took me so long<br/>
to figure out, but I was waiting to hear about the time of another<br/>
appointment I have that day).<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, January 8th, 2:00 pm at the Paw.  The Paw and Cyberdog Cafs are<br/>
located at 8420 Brookfield Avenue in Brookfield, Illinois, across the street<br/>
from the Hollywood/Zoo Stop on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe line (the<br/>
one that runs Union Station to Aurora).  708-485-8448.  I believe they are<br/>
only open until 4:00 that day.<br/>
<br/>
If you get there early before I do, be sure to ask for the Red Bulldog<br/>
(letterbox).  It is located in the Cyberdog, which is the smaller internet<br/>
cafe located in back, off the west side of the building.  If the snow melts<br/>
by then (!!!), Hurray for Hollywood is also nearby.<br/>
<br/>
I'm participating in ScoutDogs' Mutts Art Schwap, and I'll bring along my<br/>
5-piece (including "accessory" stamps) Ozzie and Earl stamps if anyone wants<br/>
to stamp them.<br/>

I might be there, depending on how things go, I'll be easy to spot,<br/>
that's for sure.  I'll be the one ordering three hot chocolates, one<br/>
breastmilk, and a prozac latte please.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If I get ambitious, I might even get a personal traveller carved.  I<br/>
have a great idea, but as usual, very limited time to do such thing.<br/>
