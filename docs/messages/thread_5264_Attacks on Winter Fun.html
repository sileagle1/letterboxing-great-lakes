                    <div class="plaintext-content">My theory is that certain types of carving rubber are more prone to<br>
absorbing smells.  A few years ago I had put out 4 boxes for an event,<br>
all in completely different areas of a park and every one of the<br>
stamps (the pink stuff in this case) was gnawed completely off the<br>
wood backing within the first week of being placed.  I was totally<br>
perplexed because I had been using the pink stuff pretty consistently<br>
and not had any problems with critters getting at the stamps before<br>
that.  When trying to figure out what was different about these<br>
boxes/stamps that would make them so enticing to critters, it occurred<br>
to me the I had made fish one evening while the stamps/boxes were in<br>
process on my dining room table and the whole house had smelled like<br>
fish for a couple of days.  I am always very careful about food smells<br>
on my hands when handling boxes, but had never given any consideration<br>
to smells the rubber may be absorbing even before being put into the<br>
box.  Of course I'll never *know* that was the reason those stamps<br>
were mauled, but all other things being equal it was the only thing<br>
that differentiated them from others I had done.  It may explain why<br>
the pink stuff, being more supple more porous than PZKut, therefore<br>
more apt to absorb smells, seems to be more of a target for critters.<br>

That really makes a lot of sense!  I would think that raccoons (who would be<br>
able to open ANY kind of box with their little hands) would be attracted to<br>
the fish smell.  It still doesn't tell us about the blue tops though.maybe<br>
that plastic is also more porous than the cream ones.  Hmmmm  Terrio<br>
