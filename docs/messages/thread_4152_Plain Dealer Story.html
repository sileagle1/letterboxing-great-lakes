We just posted a story on letterboxing and Ohio history on our blog,<br/>
which you can read at this link:<br/>

<br/>
and then this morning we received a note from a reporter at the<br/>
Cleveland Plain Dealer, looking for letterboxers from northeast Ohio<br/>
to interview for a story.  His comment and contact info is below the<br/>
story.<br/>
<br/>
Thought I would pass that along -- it would be great to get word out<br/>
about letterboxing in Ohio!<br/>

<br/>
I kind of like letterboxing still remaining "under the<br/>
radar" in Cuyahoga County.  Especially since so many<br/>
of our area's boxes are hidden in the Cleveland<br/>
Metroparks.  There currently is no letterboxing policy<br/>
in the Cleveland Metroparks, even though there is a<br/>
geocaching policy.  I'm afraid that if letterboxing is<br/>
brought to the forefront as geocaching is, the<br/>
Metroparks will then instill a "one size fits all"<br/>
policy, making the letterboxers fill out the same<br/>
paperwork as the geocachers, rather than create<br/>
something specific for the letterboxes.  Even though<br/>
the hobbies are similar, they're still different. <br/>
I've looked over the Metropark's geocaching form<br/>
before, and in its current state I don't think it<br/>
would work well for letterboxing.  I'm of the mindset<br/>
with letterboxing and the Cleveland Metroparks of<br/>
"don't ask, don't tell."  It's worked for us for the<br/>
past however many years.  I'm afraid that an article<br/>
about letterboxing in the Cleveland area's major<br/>
newspaper would jeopardize so many of our area's<br/>
already existing plants.  <br/>
<br/>
I also feel that if Mr. Sangiacomo is serious about<br/>
doing an article on letterboxing, he'll take the<br/>
initiative to contact some of the area's placers. <br/>
I've been contacted twice before by reporters from the<br/>
area's Sun News paper who took the initiative to seek<br/>
out active letterboxers rather than just post a "I<br/>
want to do an article on this, please contact me"<br/>
message.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, it's up to each individual to decide if<br/>
they want to go to the media or stay hidden about<br/>
letterboxing.  If someone does decide to talk to the<br/>
media, please take into account the concerns that have<br/>
been posted on this board numerous times before about<br/>
previous letterboxing articles, and try to stress to<br/>
the reporter that letterboxing is about more than<br/>
running through the woods looking for plastic<br/>
containers.  <br/>
