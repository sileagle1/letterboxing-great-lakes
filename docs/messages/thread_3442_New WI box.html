Clues for a new Wisconsin box were posted today by Kayakin' Monkey, a <br/>
very new boxer.  Guess where she placed it?  Chippewa <br/>
county! ...which means that WI is now ALL GREEN!!  So instead of my <br/>
hand-colored map, you can see the official letterboxing.org map here:<br/>
<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxStateRegion.php?state=wi<br/>
<br/>
(thanks to the letterboxing.org volunteers for getting the map <br/>
updated so quickly!)<br/>
<br/>
I've invited Kayakin' Monkey to join this message group, which she <br/>
didn't know about.  She and her mom apparently started boxing very <br/>
recently - I think she said the first box she found was on NOV 24.  <br/>
However it sounds like her mom is also very enthusiastic and they <br/>
have plans to place more boxes in Chippewa county.  So even though it <br/>
was the last county with a box, it sounds like there will be more.  <br/>
Maybe "seeding" some of those counties will pay off with a few more <br/>
boxers in that part of the state.  I know these two "newbies" already <br/>
found one of the boxes we planted on Thanksgiving weekend <br/>
(FungusWoman's tribute box to her dad).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who helped get WI "totally boxed"!  We started <br/>
publicizing this little project mid-year.  At that time there were <br/>
boxes in 42 counties and 30 counties without a box.  Martini Man &amp; I <br/>
pitched in to cover several of them and were pleased to see that <br/>
others also got out there to help the cause.  These placers even <br/>
included some out-of-staters!  Here's a list of those who helped in <br/>
the project:<br/>

WTG You guys!  I miss seeing "Italy" in the center of your state, but <br/>
I'm happy you're all green now!<br/>
<br/>
I'd be green with envy over your greenness, but MI is all green now, too.  LOL<br/>
