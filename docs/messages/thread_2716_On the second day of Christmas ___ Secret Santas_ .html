messages in the folder yet.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I received an email confirmation from Katy, that was "sent" on FRIDAY.  It <br/>
took Yahoo 4 days to send it to me!!!<br/>
<br/>
I didn't expect this scenario.  So here is what I am proposing:<br/>
<br/>
1.  If you sent an email to me about being a Secret Santa, please check the database for <br/>
your name.  If you don't see your name among the 19, I haven't received your email.  <br/>
Please resubmit you request to my other email address - ruhlette AT MAC dot com.<br/>
<br/>
2.  If, after reading the Secret Santa guidelines in the Files section, you decide you'd like to <br/>
participate after all, send me an email with your snailmail address today or tomorrow.  I <br/>
will create a second bucket and pull a second set of names.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Please email me to confirm the letterboxer's name you have been assigned.  That way I <br/>
will know the yahoo mail has been sent/received.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience,<br/>
<br/>
