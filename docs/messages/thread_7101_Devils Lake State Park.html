So, if we could only get one or two LBs at DLSP, which ones might y'all <br>
recommend? I'm hoping to go letterboxing on Mother's Day with my <br>
less-than-enthusiastic kids (16 & 10). I've never been there, so don't know <br>
really where to start.<br>

Start with the "vertical climb" on the SE side while everyone is fresh, and take plenty of snacks and fluids. Take your time and enjoy the views, etc.  The hike will be good training for the 16 yo CC runner...:-)<br>

If you have never been there before, I think the kids will find it<br>
interesting.  Much better views and rocks formations than the IAT!  The<br>
Balanced Rock trail is definitely a work out, but our young nephew scampered<br>
up it like a billy goat.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We made it all the way around!  Can hardly believe that was only 3.5 miles - with the elevation changes it seemed much farther.  Alas, the concessions weren't open yet for the season.  Might have to go back for that malt.  DS said we should go back so DH and I can go LBing and he and his sister can go kayaking/canoeing.  LOL.  We found 2 of the four LBs we sought.  At the park entrance I did pick up postcards and a DLSP Centennial MUG! <br>
<br>
The next day I went out closer to home determined to get some mystery boxes - I got them (4) and 14 more!  It was neat to get my first TattooBob and Kimberly boxes; see the evolution of Lock Shock and Barrel's carving; follow nearly the same route Dragon did a few weeks ago;  be the FF in five years for three boxes; and go through a labyrinth for F1000!  :)<br>
