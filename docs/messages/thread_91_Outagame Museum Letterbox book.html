I was the letterboxer who mentioned the clues at the Outagamie County <br/>
Museum.  As I mentioned, these do NOT seem to be "our" clues, but a <br/>
whole untapped source of boxes not on the LBNA site.  The LBNA site <br/>
lists only one box for Outagamie county, so it's difficult to imagine <br/>
the county would charge $10 for one clue. It seems to be their own <br/>
particular program.<br/>

Have you seen (or purchased this book)?  I've sent them an email to find out<br/>
how many box clues are included in the book.  Several of us MKE LBer's were<br/>
at dinner together tonight (kind of an offshoot of our hiking club<br/>
activities) and were thinking of getting a book that we might share and pass<br/>
around  amongst ourselves.<br/>
