more from a perspective of an overwhelmed newbie -- yikes!  I don't <br/>
have enough time to do all of this -- where should I concentrate my <br/>
efforts?<br/>
<br/>
My main focus is definitely this list.  The others...<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo Groups:<br/>
<br/>
-  Letterbox-usa ("big list"):  I very rarely read this any more as <br/>
I don't usually find much there and it can be so confrontational.<br/>
-  Travellers:  Get e-mail, scan for word of my HH, delete messages <br/>
as they come in.<br/>
-  Newboxers:  I usually scan a few times a week just to see if <br/>
there is anything I can lend some perspective on. <br/>
-  Event Boxes:  Get e-mails because of being a moderator there, but <br/>
don't participate in much discussion there.<br/>
-  PLB:  Only head over if there is something specific I am looking <br/>
for.<br/>
-  Other regional groups:  Scan maybe a couple of times a month.<br/>
-  A few other specialized Yahoo! groups (webmasters, art girls, <br/>
etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Other:<br/>
<br/>
-  AtlasQuest:  Don't have my boxes listed there any more.  Get the <br/>
digest and scan discussion threads every now and then.<br/>
-  Mark Pepe Blog:  Make my way over a few times a week<br/>
-  Other LB Blogs:  As I get time or am aware of something I want to <br/>
read (I need to make a better link list of these).<br/>
<br/>

p.s.  Sorry the Bingo word has not come through yet...  I did post <br/>
it, honest...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Besides LbGLK, I also keep up with 6 or 7 message boards on AtlasQuest... mostly just the main AtlasQuest discussion page, and general topics such as Stamp Carving, Event Planning, Premium Member page, etc.  I really like how the message boards on AtlasQuest allow you to display dozens of messags per page -- makes it easy to skim the postings, reading only the ones that catch your eye, instead of having to open each message separately.  Also, I appreciate that the boards tend to stay pretty well on-topic, so that you can follow the areas of interest to you.  Finally, it's nice that AtlasQuest remembers which messages you have already read -- even if you log in from different computers.<br/>
<br/>
  Another nice feature on AtlasQuest is that the "My Page" shows not only the new postings from your selected message boards, but also shows all new articles from SpringChick's and Mark and Sue Pepe's letterboxing blogs.  So I can keep up on those too, without having to check them individually every day.<br/>
<br/>
  I used to follow the "big" list (Letterbox-USA) but there were so many flame messages, uninteresting tangents, etc. that it got hard to keep up.  I enjoy our regional list a lot more.  The volume is manageable, and I can read and enjoy every message.<br/>

I subscribe to many of the boards, the "big" national board and several <br/>
regional boards. I get individual emails from most of them that I <br/>
belong to. I usually join a regional board when we're planning a <br/>
vacation trip to that area since they discuss the local conditions, <br/>
etc.  It has also proven to be a great way to get advice on where to <br/>
go, where to eat, any known missing boxes AND make plans to get <br/>
together with some local boxers when we're in their area.  Sometimes <br/>
after our trip I change my settings to "no email", but sometimes I <br/>
continue with the emails because we've actually met some of the people <br/>
that are posting and we like hearing what they are up to.  Some of the <br/>
groups (Mid-Atlantic in particular) are quite amusing.  Right now I <br/>
read the following regional boards:  Great Lakes, Pacific Northwest, <br/>
Mid-Atlantic, Southeast (might make a trip down there in April) and <br/>
Texas (waiting to hear when/if anyone finds the 2 boxes we planted in <br/>
November, then will probably drop these emails).<br/>
<br/>
I also check in on AtlasQuest fairly frequently.  I like the ability to <br/>
see what blogs have been updated and link to them directly from AQ (in <br/>
addition to Mark Pepe's &amp; SpringChick's, I also enjoy reading the Green <br/>
Torgtugua's and dvn2rckr's blogs).  I also check the AQ Events page to <br/>
see all the upcoming events around the country in case some of them fit <br/>
into our vacation plans (or we MAKE a vacation plan around an event!).  <br/>
Usually also scan the "recent messages", but don't follow any <br/>
particular boards.<br/>
<br/>
I also like to check on Pete's Hitchhiker site occasionally to see <br/>
where the various HHs we've found have traveled since we saw them.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, I'm addicted to the hobby!<br/>

I check LbNA and log in to AQ several (okay, more than several) times each day.  I have <br/>
LbGLK on individual mail, but I put the others on digest mode: the big list, travellers, <br/>
southeast, new boxers.  I really enjoy AQ and I love how friendly everyone is.  I am a <br/>
