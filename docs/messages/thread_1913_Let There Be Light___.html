has a lantern (and necessary fuel) they would be willing to bring, it <br/>
would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
The shelter has electric, but I could not find any lights.  It is in <br/>
the trees, there are partial walls and it is all dark brown wood, <br/>
which made it seem a bit dark when I was there last weekend.  I <br/>
thought about bringing some electric lights, but there is only one <br/>
outlet (I am bringing a power strip) and as several people will be <br/>
using the power for crock pots, I didn't want to overload the <br/>
circuit.  So I was thinking lanterns would be a good source of light <br/>
in the shelter if we can round up a couple of them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

  Not to mention that lanterns (depending on type and brand) have<br/>
  1000-2000+ BTU to help take any damp chill off ... given what the NOAA<br/>
  forcast is:<br/>
<br/>
  Saturday: Showers likely, mainly after noon. Mostly cloudy, with a<br/>
  high near 50. Calm wind becoming north northwest between 5 and 8 mph.<br/>
  Chance of precipitation is 70%.<br/>
<br/>
  Saturday Night: Showers likely. Cloudy, with a low around 37. North<br/>
  northwest wind between 6 and 11 mph. Chance of precipitation is 70%.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope everyone has a great time at the gathering ... we'll be<br/>
  winterizing  for my mother-in-law (a widow) up north this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>

Northern Mich today ... I'm hoping you all are having wonderful<br/>
weather for the fun and boxing down near Yankee Springs!<br/>
<br/>
I stumbled onto Letterboxing very soon after you (SC) hosted the first<br/>
 Great Lakes gathering... just my luck! Here was this way cool event<br/>
hosted almost in my backyard (so to speak) and I missed it ... had to<br/>
wait about a year for the chance to meet up with other boxers at a<br/>
gathering.  The Sweetest Day Mini Meet was very small, the weather was<br/>
really rotten (fierce winds, rain, sleet, snow and we had to stamp<br/>
into the last boxes by flashlight -- thanks to Bad Dog for being<br/>
prepared for that!) but geez oh pizza ... what fun, what memories!<br/>
<br/>
Don't you guys forget to post to let the rest of us in on how things<br/>
went!  I'm really looking forward to hearing about everything. Did<br/>
anyone ever offer to be the scribe and take notes at the Round Table<br/>
Fourm?  That's something I REALLY am sorry to be missing out on.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
