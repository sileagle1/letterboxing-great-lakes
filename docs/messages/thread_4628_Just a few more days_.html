the gathering in October, but my Fall 2007: Harvest will be retired on <br>
Friday.<br>
<br>
I plan on pulling it sometime Friday morning, so if you were planning <br>
to look for it Friday or really want to look for it, but can't do it <br>
until this weekend, let me know and I'll leave it until Monday.<br>
