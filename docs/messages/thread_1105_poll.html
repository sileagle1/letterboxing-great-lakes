get two as I edited it!<br>
The first one didn't turn out the way I wanted.<br>
For those of you going to the gathering I wanted to know a few feelings on <br>
the shirts so please help by voting.<br>
I looked into the patch idea but those with experience (my mom is a <br>
goldwing groupie and has done this kind of stuff for years) said that your <br>
shirt would get to heavy.<br>
So t-shirt vs. golf shirt<br>
gathering logo vs lbGLK logo<br>
price issue<br>
Thanks everyone... details as soon as poll is over<br>
