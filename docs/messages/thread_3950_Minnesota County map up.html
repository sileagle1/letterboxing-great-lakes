<br/>
I just uploaded a Minnesota state map with the counties for tracking<br/>
coverage of letterboxes in the state. So far I've only marked the ones<br/>
from the LBNA site. I haven't done an AQ search at all.<br/>
<br/>
I'm assuming that WOM, mystery boxes and otherwise secret or not<br/>
widely published boxes should NOT be included in this map? Any other<br/>
tips for making this work? :)<br/>
<br/>
You can find it in files section, under Maps. Spring Chick, you<br/>
created that folder and all the other files in there are yours, so let<br/>
me know if you want me to move it. It just seemed like a logical place....<br/>
<br/>
Cheers! :)<br/>

Pine counties, but won't be able to place boxes until July.  I'll let <br/>
you know if we can cover any of the other "border counties" later <br/>
this spring/summer.<br/>

P.S.  Dose anyone know if Illinois &amp; Indiana are competing to see <br/>
which of them will fill their counties first?<br/>

I've been a  bit curious myself.  I've made a partial map of IL  (mainly <br/>
the north half)...but many of the southern counties are a bit far for us <br/>
to plant.   BTW, as far as I can tell, there isn't a box in Kankakee <br/>
county.  If no one has it claimed, I have two boxes I'd like to plant <br/>
near Bourbonnais (ideally in the next month).<br/>
