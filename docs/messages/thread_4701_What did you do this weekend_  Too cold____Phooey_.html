                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some may think it is insane, some may hold admiration.........This weekend away from the grind of home responsibilities and work allowed for some cold weather boxing.  We traveled to the middle of Michigan to celebrate a new baby coming into the world. (For those of you who suggested boxes, thanks.)  And what better way to celebrate new life, by risking your own and getting frost bite on the tips of your ears and fingers!!!!!  Ok so maybe bringing all of the boxes to the car was a good idea, but when you think that the box is closer than it really is, take your earmuffs and gloves.  You never know how hard it is to get a rock out of frozen dirt and wood chips hurt when they're cold.  But success was had, my daughter got to go on her first out of state boxing trip (even though she slept in the car the whole time as my wing man watched.)  But when she was awake and seeing daddy run to put the box back, so he could get to the next one before the sun went<br>
 down was priceless.  AND we got our Frankenmuth Fudge for the trip back to Chicago.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all of those boxers that placed and maintain their boxes, because we actually found all of the boxes we were going for.  As I type this, I think I can start to feel the tips of my fingers again.<br>
<br>
Hope everyone had a great weekend.<br>
