Not sure if this is the right board or not , but I have a report from<br/>
Pigeon Creek in West Olive:<br/>
I was up there a few days ago , and oh my! They are logging- in a big way!<br/>
Most of the trails = especially the horse side and the side by the campground<br/>
are closed due to the logging operation, but from what I could see,<br/>
ALOT is changing up there..<br/>
If you have boxes in those areas, you may want to keep an eye on<br/>
when they'll let you back in, so you can [hopefully] locate your box <br/>
and/ or update<br/>
your clues if you need too.<br/>
I was very unhappy with the closures, as this was to be my first trip <br/>
there of the season,<br/>
couldn't hunt the boxes I was hoping to find!!<br/>
Hope this update will help someone out, gemgirl65<br/>

Our family was there two weeks ago going after more of the Wing Thing boxes we missed, and had no problem with three of the boxes on the Lodge side of the park.

  Ok --- I just returned from Pigeon Creek...<br/>
  From what I can tell the lodge side of the park is not<br/>
  being worked on... I'll say yet --- as I didn't go<br/>
  through the whole park.<br/>
  I walked all around the campground and there was no<br/>
  logging evidence there at all.<br/>
<br/>
  The Horse trail side is a different matter all<br/>
  together. That side has been completely compromised. <br/>
  : ((<br/>
  There are giant sweeps of trees cut down and trails<br/>
  that were heavily wooded are now open fields. Some of<br/>
  the trails are being re-defined, but we saw some trail<br/>
  map and trail marker posts lying on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
  I will be sending emails to the folks who's boxes we<br/>
  checked on... <br/>
  I managed to find one of my boxes that was in the<br/>
  middle of it --- but obviously I knew exactly where to<br/>
  look. I didn't have the time to check on all of mine<br/>
  in that side of the park... the Hitchhiker Hostel is<br/>
  still there snug and sound.<br/>
<br/>
  We live about 20 minutes from here, so we'll be going<br/>
  back again... probably next week Sunday or Monday.<br/>
  If you have specific boxes you'd like checked on,<br/>
  don't hesitate to let me know.<br/>

When we found your box, we had friends with us that we were introducing to letterboxing.  Your box was the first find for them-and they were very impressed with all the extra effort shown in presentation.  I won't give anything away, but it was definitely a great box to find! I hope that all that is going on at Pigeon Creek is just Spring maintenance, and the boxes there won't have to be rehidden-or worse yet-lost forever.  This is an awesome park and a close location for us.<br/>
