I can give you some advice about family-friendly boxes in and around Indy.<br/>
 I just replanted a missing stamp and I have a family friendly series at<br/>
Southeastway Park.  Just email me off list for any recommendations.  I<br/>
haven't been to ALL of the newer boxes yet.  There are some nice parks<br/>
around the state to visit as well.<br/>

Seems like many people have found Letterboxing by reading that magazine. I have 2 sons as well and they get so excited when someone finds the box they placed. We also are pretty new to it, we have been boxing for about 2 months now.<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

WOW!  We went on a marathon tour today.  Didn't really intend for it <br/>
to be this long of a day!  Very eventful.<br/>
<br/>
We started at this one bizarre park with all these concrete bridges, <br/>
benches and sculptures that looked like they were made from <br/>
trees.  There were 7 boxes in that park, with one confirmed missing <br/>
and one we didn't find/possibly missing... so we found a total of 5 <br/>
there... plus a hitchhiker!<br/>
<br/>
Then we headed to another park, but couldn't find the box.  Not sure <br/>
if we looked in the right place, but the last seeker who posted on <br/>
lbna couldn't find it either, so, it may be missing.<br/>
<br/>
Then we headed off to a huge plant conservatory/garden that was the <br/>
most gorgeous place!  Will have to go back to spend more time.<br/>
<br/>
After this, we headed to three other parks and found three more <br/>
boxes.  For two of them, we were the first finders!  We also found an <br/>
unexpected geocache box!<br/>
<br/>
So total stats:<br/>
9 letter boxes found<br/>
2 first finds!<br/>
1 hitchhiker!<br/>
2 unfound boxes<br/>
1 geocache box found<br/>
2 sore feet<br/>
1 sore butt<br/>
1 sopping wet muddy foot<br/>
and 1 fabulous day spent outside!<br/>
<br/>
If you get down to the souther part of Michigan, Hillsdale and <br/>
Lenewee counties, you really should check out the<br/>
"Intrigue and Aiden Lair series" and the "Butterfly New Beginnings" <br/>
boxes.  Very cool settings, great boxes.<br/>

Okay, I wanted to come back and say welcome to you like others have <br/>
already done and congratulate you on your marathon day!!   There are <br/>
others that have been addicted to this hobby longer than I have, but I <br/>
clearly remember those first marathon days that solidified my drive to <br/>
find more boxes!  The poor people that I worked with back then had to <br/>
endure my unending enthusiasm for a box that had become such a "trophy" <br/>
to me for one reason or another.  I'm sure everyone else sat at their <br/>
computer and read your email with a big honkin' smile on their face like <br/>
I did!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Last, thanks so much for sharing specifically about those boxes in the <br/>
Hillsdale area etc.  That is great for me to know as I try to plan a <br/>
trip up north!<br/>
