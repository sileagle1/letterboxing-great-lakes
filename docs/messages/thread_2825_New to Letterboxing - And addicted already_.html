                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello! <br/>
A few local folks recommended I join this group, and I sit here <br/>
already recognizing several names from our finds! (Isnt it funny how <br/>
you 'know' people you have never met?)<br/>
<br/>
We already had "Beetle Day" several days ago, and our first find <br/>
was "Decaffeinated". <br/>
<br/>
We have been out the past 4 days, and will likely head out for one <br/>
local one this afternoon... I can't resist!<br/>
<br/>
Im happy to find a place where everyone can talk, and share <br/>
information - I letterbox with my family (My husband and 2 year old <br/>
son) and Im really hoping to run across some others of 'our kind' <br/>
out on the local trails!<br/>
<br/>
We are getting ready for our first plant soon, and are <br/>
just 'scouting' for the right location! So glad to be here - and <br/>
can't wait to 'meet' some of the people we have already, well... met <br/>
in a way while we were stamping!<br/>
