You might need to "refresh" the webpage in your browser to get the new uploaded page.  It should say 2011 in red near the top.<br/>
<br/>
I am SO VERY SORRY if I delayed anyone this morning.  My allergies were just killing my eyes last night and I couldn't keep them open to type.<br/>
<br/>
There will be some tweeks to the clue page later on, particularly the two missing clues in red and updates on some of the letterpeople as information comes in.  I hope to beef-up this year's story line as well, but the message clues will remain the same.<br/>
<br/>
Again, sorry for the delay.<br/>

<br/>
Also a possible Bristol gathering is in the works.  A weekend with ALL the new and old boxes in place.  Details soon... (Good grief! That's over 70 stamps to be had in one little town!)<br/>
