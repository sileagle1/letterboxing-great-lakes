                    <div class="plaintext-content">...so I completed the virtual Kimball Library<br/>
Letterbook today. Lots of fun!<br/>
<br/>
I also FINALLY found Johnny Appleseed yesterday. I<br/>
also found the Sputnick hitchhiker, which was a nice<br/>
surprise. Another surprise, my hitchhiker, the<br/>
Princess Pat has escaped from Kokiwanee and had a nice<br/>
rest at Johnny Appleseed! I'm sooooo happy...I was<br/>
afraid that no one was ever going to rescue her! Still<br/>
no sign of Johnny's Love....<br/>
<br/>
...fall trips...well, I don't have any particular<br/>
places that I go every fall, but this fall I plan to<br/>
spend many a weekend letterboxing around SW Michigan<br/>
and central IN. Still have 4 boxes of the Hofma series<br/>
to go...and maybe sand dunes are more friendly when<br/>
it's not 90 degrees...so I have lots of places to go<br/>
this fall. This weekend is supposed to be gorgeous<br/>
here, so i'm heading out to Fort Custer and other<br/>
points along the way. <br/>
