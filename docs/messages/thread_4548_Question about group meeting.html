&gt; I joined this group after the big meeting in West Michigan - is <br/>
&gt; there <br/>
&gt; any way that I can get the clues if the boxes are still in the <br/>
&gt; park. <br/>
&gt; I believe the hunt was on Saturday and I found the group on <br/>
&gt; Tuesday. <br/>
&gt; I am still kicking Mr. Kelly as he did not let me know this was <br/>

It would be a rare occurrance that letterboxers would be so organized<br/>
that their get together would be called a 'meeting'.<br/>
That said, the Michigan Fall Gathering, "It's A Wing Thing" did result<br/>
in some permanent boxes in west Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
Consider Wisconsin Hiker's clue to be an excellent beginning.<br/>
