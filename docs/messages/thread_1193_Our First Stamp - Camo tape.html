&gt; Well after months of procrastination, we have<br/>
&gt; FINALLY carved our first <br/>
&gt; stamp.  It's a simple one but it came out pretty<br/>
&gt; darn good for a first <br/>
&gt; try.  Hopefully within the next few weeks, we can<br/>
&gt; find it an <br/>
&gt; appropriate hiding place and get our first plant out<br/>
&gt; there.  I was <br/>
&gt; wondering if someone could tell me where to find<br/>
&gt; some camo-tape for our <br/>
&gt; box.  I looked at Walmart and Meijer but they don't<br/>
&gt; seem to carry it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another first this weekend was finding our first<br/>
&gt; geocache.  I got a <br/>
&gt; handheld GPS for Xmas and have been dying to try it<br/>
&gt; out.  We were <br/>
&gt; successful in our find but . . . I still enjoy<br/>
&gt; letterboxing more :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will definitely post here once our first plant is<br/>
&gt; ready. Can't wait <br/>
&gt; to get one out there!!<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
