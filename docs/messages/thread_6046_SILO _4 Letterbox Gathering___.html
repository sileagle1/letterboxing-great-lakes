Costumes are never 'required' but there is a history now of letterboxers coming dressed for the theme...because we're all just looking to have a good time. SILO is the best cure for letterboxers who will be experiencing winter in the midwest cabin fever.  <br>
<br>

What amazes me is that people are already starting to ask about the next SILO Gathering and it's 6 months away!  Well, if last year's theme is any indication - Let the good times roll...and continue to roll on!  <br>

So YOU bought a bunch of PZ Kut and that left none for the rest of us.  Currently, there is no grade A or B white for sale.  This is a national emergency!   I'm down to my last 4 slabs, and I'm starting to worry.  <br>

Since letterboxers are already starting to ask - "When is the next SILO Letterbox Gathering?", Lock and Beetle are proud to announce plans for SILO #4. It will be held on Sunday, February 28, 2010 at the Silo Restaurant in Lake Bluff, IL. Theme: Comic Book Characters There's a wide open theme certain to inspire many creative event stamps. And we all know that letterboxers are a bunch of creative 'characters' , so we hope yo see you then. <br>
<br>
The event is not posted yet. Lock will take care of that later in the year. However, we thought it might be a good time of the year to post the theme, before Halloween, so families could keep their eyes open for comic book character masks, costumes, jammmies, capes, etc. and plan ahead. <br>
<br>
SILO #4 will surely be a Kodak moment. Boxers in disguise. See you then!<br>

Costumes are never 'required' but there is a history now of letterboxers coming dressed for the theme...because we're all just looking to have a good time. SILO is the best cure for letterboxers who will be experiencing winter in the midwest cabin fever. <br>
<br>
What amazes me is that people are already starting to ask about the next SILO Gathering and it's 6 months away! Well, if last year's theme is any indication - Let the good times roll...and continue to roll on! <br>

Costumes are never 'required' but there is a history now of letterboxers coming dressed for the theme...because we're all just looking to have a good time. SILO is the best cure for letterboxers who will be experiencing winter in the midwest cabin fever. <br>
<br>
What amazes me is that people are already starting to ask about the next SILO Gathering and it's 6 months away! Well, if last year's theme is any indication - Let the good times roll...and continue to roll on! <br>

Since letterboxers are already starting to ask - "When is the next SILO Letterbox Gathering?", Lock and Beetle are proud to announce plans for SILO #4. It will be held on Sunday, February 28, 2010 at the Silo Restaurant in Lake Bluff, IL. Theme: Comic Book Characters There's a wide open theme certain to inspire many creative event stamps. And we all know that letterboxers are a bunch of creative 'characters' , so we hope yo see you then. <br>
<br>
The event is not posted yet. Lock will take care of that later in the year. However, we thought it might be a good time of the year to post the theme, before Halloween, so families could keep their eyes open for comic book character masks, costumes, jammmies, capes, etc. and plan ahead. <br>
<br>
SILO #4 will surely be a Kodak moment. Boxers in disguise. See you then! <br>
<br>
Your SILO co-hosts <br>

Beetle (aka Carol) <br>

Lock (aka Scott) of Lock Shock and Barrel <br>

  Since letterboxers are already starting to ask - "When is the next SILO Letterbox Gathering?", Lock and Beetle are proud to announce plans for SILO #4. It will be held on Sunday, February 28, 2010 at the Silo Restaurant in Lake Bluff, IL. Theme: Comic Book Characters There's a wide open theme certain to inspire many creative event stamps. And we all know that letterboxers are a bunch of creative 'characters' , so we hope yo see you then. <br>
<br>
  The event is not posted yet. Lock will take care of that later in the year. However, we thought it might be a good time of the year to post the theme, before Halloween, so families could keep their eyes open for comic book character masks, costumes, jammmies, capes, etc. and plan ahead. <br>

Look in the mirror.  Your noses are growing longer.  500+ and still going!  Yeah right, you can stop at any time.  LOL!  Then there's that newly diagnosed condition - first finder's syndrome.  Sound familiar?  Tee Hee<br>

Costumes are never 'required' but there is a history now of letterboxers coming dressed for the theme...because we're all just looking to have a good time. SILO is the best cure for letterboxers who will be experiencing winter in the midwest cabin fever. <br>
<br>
What amazes me is that people are already starting to ask about the next SILO Gathering and it's 6 months away! Well, if last year's theme is any indication - Let the good times roll...and continue to roll on! <br>

Since letterboxers are already starting to ask - "When is the next SILO Letterbox Gathering?", Lock and Beetle are proud to announce plans for SILO #4. It will be held on Sunday, February 28, 2010 at the Silo Restaurant in Lake Bluff, IL. Theme: Comic Book Characters There's a wide open theme certain to inspire many creative event stamps. And we all know that letterboxers are a bunch of creative 'characters' , so we hope yo see you then. <br>
<br>
The event is not posted yet. Lock will take care of that later in the year. However, we thought it might be a good time of the year to post the theme, before Halloween, so families could keep their eyes open for comic book character masks, costumes, jammmies, capes, etc. and plan ahead. <br>
<br>
SILO #4 will surely be a Kodak moment. Boxers in disguise. See you then!<br>

Yes, we are a 'support group' but other addicts don't make for a good support team if you are trying to kick the addiction.  Now if you are looking for encouragement...you've come to the right place.  We are an authorized 12 step program (or as some would say - a 6 pace program).  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Then of course, there is the annual BINGO group therapy sessions during the winter months.  Treatment is conducted my Dr. Spring Chick.  <br>

LBA (Letterboxing Anonymous) That sounds like a great idea! Hello everyone, Lighthouse Keeper here. Just joined the group. Have been following through One Love Journeying recently but thought I should get on the bandwagon so to speak. I'm excited for this new event. My mind is realing from the carving possibilites! Also excited for the event in Minooka Park! Hope everyone has had a productive boxing summer!<br>

One Love Journeying and I are so excited for our first major event! Good to be on the board... does anyone know how to set up e-mail so that messages automatically get sent to your inbox? I have my yahoo account set up to send to my gmail account but for some reason it doesn't seem to be working that way.  Any suggestions?<br>

<br>
LK<br>
=================<br>
<br>
You should be able to do this by doing the following:<br>
<br>
1.      Go to the message board<br>
<br>
2.      Click on "Edit Membership" near top of page (under banner ad)<br>
<br>
3.      Under "Step 1" you can add a new email address then choose it as the<br>
one that you would like group message sent to.<br>
<br>
4.      Under "Step 2" choose either Individual Email or Daily Digest.<br>
<br>
5.      Click on "Save Changes" at bottom.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>
