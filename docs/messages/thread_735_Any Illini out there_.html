Hi All!  You all seem so connected, but you also seem close to each <br>
other as well, Ohio mostly correct?  Are there any people from <br>
Illinois (suburbs of Chicago) out there?  It would be fun to have <br>

Yes indeed -- there are quite a few of us here! Where in the suburbs are you? I grew up on <br>
the North Shore, went away to college and law school, and now live downtown in the South <br>
Loop, which explains the somewhat far-flung nature of my boxes.<br>
<br>
Happy boxing!<br>

subvert all our friends...  We venture up north as often as our schedules <br>

them ourselves).  I'm jealous of any one who lives somewhere that they<br>
can do a box or two in an afternoon, since anymore it is definitely a day <br>
trip for us.  <br>

Hi Grapevine Girl, <br>
I'm from the Chicago suburbs so I figured I would introduce myself. <br>
We are the Wormy Wanderers (Julie & Jason) and we live in the Chicago <br>
suburb Woodridge (its near Naperville).  We are relatively new to <br>
letterboxing.  We've been involved in it since early August of this <br>
year and we are hooked.  Well I'm probably more hooked than my <br>
boyfriend. Sometimes I feel like I'm dragging him out of the house <br>
with me.  There are a lot of other IL people in the group as well as <br>
a ton from MI.  Everyone has been very helpful on this site - its a <br>
great group.  But if you are ever interested in going boxing in the <br>
greater Chicago area - let me know . . . I'm almost always up for <br>
some boxing :) <br>
<br>
Julie (Wormy Wanderers)<br>

represented state on the list.....<br>
....and I'm definitely the only N. Indiana boxer that<br>
I know of on the list (unless you Hoosiers are<br>
lurking!)<br>
<br>
Anyway...thanks for all of the great suggestions for<br>
logbooks. I carved some stamps last night for a future<br>
series to be planted this winter sometime and am<br>
thinking of making more creative books for these<br>
boxes. Artdog's Halloween boxes have inspired me to<br>
make nicer logs, as her's are the cat's<br>
pajamas!!!Scrapbook store, here I come!!!<br>
<br>
As far as organization...right now all of my stuff is<br>
divided into three bags: My trail pack that contains a<br>
log book, bag of markers, stamp pads, and my personal<br>
stamp, bug spray, compass (which I accidentally left<br>
in Indy and have to get a new one), hitchhikers,<br>
kleenex, beach glass from Lake Michigan, random<br>
change, and a lighter (for god knows what reason). My<br>
backpack which is exclusively used for long trips and<br>
plants. It has ziplocs, first aid kit, and a bunch of<br>
other garbage in it. The last bag is a messenger bag<br>
in which I keep a rubbermaid with glue, scissors,<br>
carving tools, twine, soft lead pencil, small pieces<br>
of carving material. I also have Mapsurfer's book, big<br>
pieces of carving material, extra log books (index<br>
cards bound), a big binder full of clues, maps, and<br>
other miscellany. I really need a desk....<br>

Hi  All!  You all seem so connected, but you also seem close to each  <br>
other as well, Ohio mostly correct?  Are there any people from  <br>
Illinois (suburbs of Chicago) out there?  It would be fun to  have <br>
some local connections as well.  Fear not my midwestern  friends, <br>
I've got on board with this letterboxing and am willing to  go all <br>
over the country to do it!!!  :)<br>

On a sadder note, I will be pulling my remaining boxes to take down with me during Thanksgiving.

So get yer butts out there before they're gone!<br>
