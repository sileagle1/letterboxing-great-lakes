Yikes!  Thanks for the reminder!  I've been fighting a cold and feeling sorry for myself since Christmas Eve and had completely forgotten about Bingo!  We'll get our cards filled out and emailed today.</div>

What?!?!  Only 23 players signed up so far!?!    We usually have a lot more than that.  Last year there were 43 players and the all time high was in 2010 when we had 73 players.

<div>I sure hope more people get their cards filled out and sent to Atom118 in the next 4 days.  The more players, the merrier!  (Translation: the more people to moan and groan or triumphantly call Bingos, and the more people to stick pins in the Bingo Master
 voodoo doll.)</div>
