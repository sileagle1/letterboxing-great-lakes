<br>
Locate the H. Wallace Caldwell Memorial Bridge spanning the <br>
DesPlaines River between downtown Riverside, Illinois, and <br>
unincorporated Riverside Lawn.  To find this letterbox, in addition <br>
to your regular supplies, you will need a canoe and paddles.  Insert <br>
the canoe into the river and board it.  Paddle upstream.  At the <br>
point where the DesPlaines joins the Illinois River, take a right.  <br>
Continue to paddle.  You may need to stop for lunch.  And dinner.  <br>
And for the night.  Or two.  Anyway, keep paddling.  When you reach <br>
the Mississippi, take a left.  Oh, and did I mention to watch for the <br>
box along the way?  If you reach the Mississippi delta, you've gone <br>
too far.  Maybe.<br>
