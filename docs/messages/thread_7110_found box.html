Subject: [LbGLK] found box<br>

Â  <br>
Today I got an email from a 'boxer who found a box out in the open while searching for another box.  They wanted to know if I could send them the clues so they could put it back in it's proper place<br>
It's 4-H Horsemanship, carved/planted for the County Fair Fall Gathering in Sep. 2008, if I remember.<br>
Can anyone send me the clues for that box, or perhaps the owner would like to get it back?<br>
Thanks! Heather<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's my box.  The finders contacted me also, and I explained that the box was planted for the County Fair event in 2008.  If the clues are still out there, I can't find them, so I asked them to pull the box and send it back to me.  I also don't know what happened to my Funnel Cake box from the same event - I never did find that one.  If somebody is still maintaining the boxes from the County fair event, please let me know where the clues are.  Otherwise, this one's coming home to mama!<br>
