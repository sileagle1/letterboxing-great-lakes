If you'd like to attend vicariously through a piece of rubber, please see the "other" tracker posted on AQ called "We *WISH* we were living and breathing...".  If you bring your stamp and give it to me at GLG, I'll give you an opportunity to stamp the image of the main stamp I've carved (the tracker does not mention it, so (spoiler alert!) it's going to be a surprise bonus stamp).<br/>
