You know what?!  I had a great cup of coffee at the<br>
'06 Great Lakes Gathering!  I wonder if I had the same<br>
great coffee as you did Tiptoe...and Stargirl for that<br>
matter...<br>
<br>
All that talk of coffee in the kitchen with you Tiptoe<br>
and "J" of TJMich.... <br>
<br>
Now you've got me wondering....HA!<br>
<br>
#12 was The Pigs for us!  With Trail Troll along! <br>
WooHOO!<br>
Earlier in the day we were under the classic "newbie"<br>
spell of forcing the clues to work at the first spot<br>
we noticed...  Uhhh....Mrs. Doglvrs - what's that<br>
advice you give to all those people who email<br>
you...."If you can't find the box, maybe you haven't<br>
gone far enough"  -- Sheesh!<br>
Well -- never hurts to take your own advice!<br>
<br>
<br>
And what is it with cooties clinging to us?!  As if I<br>
didn't get enough cooties when I was at the WNY<br>
gathering...."Daddy's Girl" got one planted on her<br>
yesterday!  It must be from 2 years ago at the Oct.<br>
gathering...that one I started....huh.  That's ok<br>
though....'cause I think "the skull" managed to off<br>
load the one he had in his pack.  ; )<br>
<br>
Sports Nuts?!  Wild Woodies?!  Where were ya girls?<br>
<br>
Still re-living the day....Mrs. Doglvrs<br>

<br>
We always go far enough!...it's just in circles and back and forth! <br>
Our favorite line is..."We must have gone too far, let's turn <br>
around.."  Only to find out later that we were so close when we <br>
turned around!<br>
<br>

<br>
Tonto and I are still hearing the little soundbites in our head of <br>
conversations from the gathering...But our favorite that we are still <br>
getting a chuckle over is the following we overheard out on the trail <br>
while trying to find the elusive flying porker....<br>
<br>
"Stephanie!  Get back here! says dear old Dad to his daughter (who is <br>
running ahead on the trail being thoroughly entertained with a wooden <br>
stick "hand" that she is experimenting with it's many uses).<br>
<br>
"WHY?" shouts back the teen as she keeps on going.<br>
<br>
"BECAUSE I SAID SO!"...shouts Dad while moving quickly in her <br>
direction mummbling under his breath.<br>
<br>
We're glad to see that parenting tactics haven't changed that much <br>
over the years!  But, I have to say, I've even tried this tactic on <br>
Tonto when he is off on his forays looking for a box...without <br>
hesitation I can testify it doesn't work on husbands either!  I think <br>
I'll find me a wooden stick "hand" with a finger to wag!..or maybe <br>
one with a hook!<br>

We have to heartily agree with everyone.  We had a great time.<br>
We didn't find as many boxes as we would have liked.<br>
Next years gathering we will try to leave the junior varsity at<br>
home.<br>
It was great to meet new boxers and catch up with those of you<br>
who we met at other events or on the trail.<br>
A special thank you to Spring Chick and Azobox for a wonderful<br>
gathering.  <br>
And also to Tiptoe and Tonto for letting our little guy "find" the box we<br>
looked for together on his own. <br>
