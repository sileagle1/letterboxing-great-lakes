                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had an opportunity to check on two of my Signs of the Zodiac boxes the other day:  Leo and Virgo.  Both are exactly where they should be, but some of the landmarks in the clues are either gone, or have been changed.  I won't have a chance to update my website until next week.  If anyone has printed up the clues, be advised they are out of date.  On the exceedingly slim chance that somebody is going to go after these boxes this very weekend (July 18-19) - email me for updated clues :)<br>
