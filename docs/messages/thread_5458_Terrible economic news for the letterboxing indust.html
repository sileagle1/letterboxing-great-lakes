Newell Rubbermaid plans job cuts<br>
by Atlanta Business Chronicle <br>
Newell Rubbermaid Inc. has announced it will make job cuts in 2009 as well as freeze wages and salaries, temporarily shut down certain plants due to the recession and cut its earnings expectations for the fourth quarter and year.<br>
The consumer products company said it will cut 800 to 1,000 jobs from its global salaried work force, plus it will enact a wage and salary freeze. Newell Rubbermaid spokesman David Doolittle said the company still plans to move its Graco baby products business into the Atlanta headquarters, creating 200 jobs in the process.<br>
In addition, the company is implementing temporary shutdowns at a number of manufacturing facilities so that it can shrink inventory levels.<br>
We are seeing extraordinary volatility, weaker-than-expected demand and customer inventory reductions across virtually all geographies and market segments, with trends worsening as we near the end of our fourth quarter, Mark Ketchum, president and CEO, said in a prepared statement. The unprecedented rapidity of the economys decline makes it difficult to anticipate an economic rebound any time soon. Our expectations are for a more challenging business environment in 2009 than any weve seen to date.<br>

Newell Rubbermaids (NYSE: NWL) brands include Sharpie, Paper Mate, Waterman, EXPO, Rubbermaid, Calphalon, Graco, Goody, BernzOmatic, Irwin and Lenox.<br>
