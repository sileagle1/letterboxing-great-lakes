   <br>
  I'm going to have to stop the daily email from the list as I can't keep up with it right now.<br>
  If you need to contact me about a box, please email direct, and I will try to respond as I am able.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
