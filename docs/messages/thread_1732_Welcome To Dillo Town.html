Flying Dragon is over 6 feet tall and I had a hard time retrieving it without dropping/breaking it even while sitting on his back!  If I had been by myself (and I almost was) there's no way I could have reached it.

And I have to appologize for not re-covering it but it was all we could do to get it back in it's hiding spot.<br>
<br>
It was a cute stamp though, good job!  We were a bit confused by "GYOB" but that was a great idea.  Definately more exciting in color.<br>

I guess I will have to figure out something for the cammo since the<br>

Great job on the FTF.  It hasn't even been approved on the geocaching<br>
site yet so all those geocachers will be imoressed at how quick you are.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the report.<br>
