                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, I'm finally in the area with some free-time and bumming that I<br/>
missed the Mystery Gathering.  So I just put together a contest for MI<br/>
boxers which I hope will spark some carving ideas, get us excited and<br/>
encouraged about getting our counties all "covered" with an active<br/>
letterbox. (Competative? Who, me?! LOL!!)<br/>
<br/>
WHO CAN PLAY: <br/>
1.  Players must either be residents of MI or ABLE (not just willing)<br/>
to place a box here BEFORE Thanksgiving (yes, that would be Thursday,<br/>
November 23 of  2006  for you nit-pickers) <br/>
<br/>
2.  You can play as an individual, a family, or a team but please<br/>
don't enter yourself in more than one category (ie: individual answers<br/>
as well as team and/or family answers) because it wouldn't really be<br/>
fair and MI is know for being picky about what's right and wrong<br/>
<br/>
PRIZES for the Quiz Game:<br/>
1st  prize   a gift certificate from Stampeaz, the PZ Kut folks<br/>
2nd  prize   a Staedtler-Mars Grand eraser <br/>
3rd  prize   #11 carving blades<br/>
4th  prize   #1 carving nibs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
RULES:<br/>
1.  Go to http://tinyurl.com/tzr6g where you will find a file called,<br/>
" Unboxed MI counties QUIZ GAME" (if the link doesn't work, you can<br/>
just go to our group homepage and click on files in the left-side menu)<br/>
<br/>
2. Find the answers to the quiz questions and email them to me.<br/>
DO NOT POST YOUR ANSWERS TO THE LIST!! <br/>
<br/>
3. There is a question for each "unboxed" MI county plus at least one<br/>
bonus question and even a few extra credit points available.  For each<br/>
correct answer you will be awarded a "point" which will translate into<br/>
your name on a slip of paper (ie: the more points, the more slips of<br/>
paper with your name)  All slips of paper with names will go into the<br/>
drawing.  Winners will be selected at random by my Grandson in two<br/>
weeks ... on Saturday, November 4th  (2006) and announced on the list<br/>
by 11pm that night.<br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>
