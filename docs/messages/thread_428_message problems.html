Is anyone else having problems getting all the emails from this group?  For some reason, there are messages on the yahoo groups site that I'm  not getting sent to my mailbox...?  I made sure my preferences are set to individual emails, so I'm out of troubleshooting ideas.<br>

I think it's a generic Yahoo problem -- this kind of problem is quite <br>
common for Yahoo Groups users. I've noticed the same thing today with one <br>
of my Yahoo groups where I was not getting messages that were on the site; <br>
on other groups I was getting replies before the original messages. But <br>
within the last hour or so, I received several dozen Yahoo Groups messages, <br>
including ones that had been posted hours earlier.<br>
<br>
It might also be a problem somewhere between Yahoo and your ISP where your <br>
messages are being delayed (and this might be the case even if you are <br>
receiving other email messages fine). You can check to see if this is the <br>
case by going to the LbGLK groups site, then clicking "My Groups" on the <br>
right side above the blue bar, then click "Email preferences." Click <br>
"Bounce history" (for the email address you use with the group, if you have <br>
more than one email address set up in your Yahoo profile) and see if there <br>
are a lot of soft bounces today for your messages. (A "soft bounce" just <br>
means that Yahoo couldn't connect to your ISP's mail server for some <br>
reason; they will try several more times to connect before they give up and <br>
don't send a message. A "hard bounce" is one where your ISP's mail server <br>
says that they have no account with your user name, for instance.) <br>
Occasional soft bounces are normal, so there's nothing to worry about, but <br>
if you have a lot in recent days, it may be that your ISP is having problems.<br>
<br>
My guess is that this is a Yahoo problem that will go away soon enough....<br>
