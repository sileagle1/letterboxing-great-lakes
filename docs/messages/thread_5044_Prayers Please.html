We are so sorry to hear about Matt. We will be praying for you, Matt and your whole family. Mark was in the hospital last fall and the prayers of family, friends and strangers kept me going. I'll be thinking of you all.<br/>
What hospital is he in? The e-card gives me a choice of West, 7th Street or Terrace Park Campuses.<br/>
God be with you,<br/>
Jody of The K Crew<br/>
Lord, we pray that Your peace will be with the Hart family as they deal with this illness. Father, we pray that You would bring healing and comfort to Matt and his family, hold them all in Your hands.Give wisdom and knowledge to all who are providing medical care to Matt. We ask this in Jesus name. Amen<br/>
