                    <div class="plaintext-content">After an event, it's always difficult to log 'finds' because some boxes have stamps but no logbook, or we forget to jot down all the information.  Then it hit me!!!  Whenever we list any type of box on AQ or LBNA, the listing is assigned a NUMBER!  If we write that number on the stamp and logbook or both, and on the wooden clothes pin containing a cootie (ha ha), that listing number holds the key to ALL the information we need to list our finds.  For SILO 7, I started writing the AQ # on the back of my stamps and in the front of the logbooks, but I may have missed a few.  This might be something we can remember for future letterboxing event.  The GLG is next.  See everyone in June.  <br/>
