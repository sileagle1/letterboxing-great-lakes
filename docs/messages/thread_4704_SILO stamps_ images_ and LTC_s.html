                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just the images, TG, since you will be attending.  The boxes <br>
themselves won't be hidden...it's just going to be a frenzied Stamp-o-<br>
rama type event (that's why we list the boxes as event stamps rather <br>
than traditional finds).  You can just bring the box(es) with you <br>
that day.  But I want the images stamped ahead of time so I have them <br>
all ready to mail to non-attending contributors.  We have a number of <br>
out-of-area and out-of-state stamps coming in.<br>
<br>
If you want to send a stamp but won't be attending, still send the 12 <br>
images to me, but send the stamp and log to Beetle.<br>
<br>
We also plan on doing some in-person LTC-swapping that day.  Cards <br>
can be theme-related or not.  Anyone interested who can't attend and <br>
wants to participate, let me know off-list, and then mail them to me <br>
when you're ready.  I'll mail your swapped-out cards back to you.<br>
