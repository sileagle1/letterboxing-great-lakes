I received an email from someone that was unable to find the "just us <br>
chicks" at Willow Metropark. I checked on it today, and it remains <br>
where it was placed. There is only one log entry so far. I double <br>
bagged it.<br>
FOr anyone that had trouble finding it, here's an additional <br>
clue..there are 112 footfalls from the corner of the picnic place to <br>
the victory sign.<br>
Also, I made a typo in the directions to the Park. It is 1.3 miles from <br>
the expressway exit to Vining road, not 3.1 as previously stated.<br>
<br>
Have fun<br>

I truly believe it's the victory sign that confuses people, but thought <br>
the clue was ingenious.<br>
