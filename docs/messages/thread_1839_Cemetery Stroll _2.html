believe we were second finders after Team Taco (good to see you guys back on<br>
the trails!), who beat us only by a few days!  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
In all my years of living in the area, I'd never entered any of those<br>
cemeteries.  Pretty interesting!  Good clues and location.   Lots of workers<br>
around, and even a few picnickers.  (Kind of funny - we heard this animated<br>
conversation coming from a woman eating a Whopper while sitting on a<br>
tombstone.  Looked like she was talking to herself (or a dead relative??)<br>
until we eventually saw her companion lying on the ground nearby.)<br>
