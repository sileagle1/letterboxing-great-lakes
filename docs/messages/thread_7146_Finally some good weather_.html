Surprisingly there weren't many mosquitos in our area, but when we went further south in Wisconsin we did have to break out our bug spray.  Sunny Side Up posted many clues while we were in New Mexico and we were happy to finally have a chance to get out and hunt for her boxes.  We even got to ride our bikes for several of them!<br>
<br>
We saw Dragon logged into our last box of the day, which he had also logged into on Saturday, noting it was HIS last box of the day.<br>
<br>
Did anyone else get out boxing this weekend??<br>
