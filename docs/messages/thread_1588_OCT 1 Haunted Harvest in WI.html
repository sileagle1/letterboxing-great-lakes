                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm pleased to announce that I have been contacted by the renowned <br>
ringmaster Felka Lechsinska.  She is a comrade of Phineas Boch and <br>
they have agreed that she will bring a select group of Boch's <br>
Traveling Circus performers to the wilds of Wisconsin for a short <br>
stay.  Phineas was notified of the October 1st Harvest Gathering and <br>
he  agreed that it would be an appropriate venue with a worthy <br>
audience.  (I'm not certain if they know it may be a <br>
somewhat "haunted" gathering, but I'm sure they are brave & strong <br>
performers...)<br>
<br>
In this excursion to the Midwest, Felka has informed me that they<br>
will be requiring an admission price - the ability to solve some <br>
clues!   Yes, they will be appearing in secluded stages that you will <br>
need to find during your visit to the gathering.  As a special <br>
kindness, the troupe has agreed to stay in the area for a few weeks.  <br>
This will allow us more time to savor their performances.<br>
<br>
I'll forward any additional information I receive from Felka as we <br>
prepare for the gathering.   www.hauntedharvest.homestead.com<br>
