Everything moves so slowly in my house.  I got this invite for this <br>
group a while ago, and just this instant had any time to accept it.  <br>
Yay!<br>
<br>
Brief Intro:  I'm Delirium, live in SE Michigan, and have been letter <br>
boxing with my husband and daughter for just about two years now.  In <br>
fact, our first letterboxing trip took place when the baby was 18 <br>
days old.  I am an enthusiastic boxer, but dreadful at actually <br>
locating them.  Thank goodness for the better half, who usually can <br>
find what I'm missing.  <br>
<br>
I had to miss the Gathering last year (argh!), but am bound and <br>
determined to make it this year.  Anything I can do to help, please <br>
let me know!<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Delirium<br>

Welcome! I hope to see your very cool stamps in more boxes in west MI <br>
this spring and summer.<br>
During a recent maintenance run, I noticed that you and your <br>
entourage successfully negotiated a couple of the Kalamazoo area <br>
boxes.<br>
C'mon back....we've got more.<br>
