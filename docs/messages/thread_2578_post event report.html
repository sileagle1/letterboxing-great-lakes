                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  I can't  believe I'm the first to report in!  But then again, it<br/>
shows what a great event it was that either (1) everyone is too tired<br/>
to get up to report, or (2) smart enough to stay an extra day to<br/>
search longer for more boxes.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to be in<br/>
the latter group.<br/>
<br/>
What a great day!!!  Perfect facilities, perfect hosts, perfect<br/>
weather, perfect food, perfect raffle prizes, perfectly wonderful<br/>
time!  The boxes were wonderful, those we had time to find. Next time<br/>
I've got to hook myself up with one of those Power Boxing groups that<br/>
manage to find like half the boxes before lunch! -- Nah -- I had a<br/>
blast with the group I was with.  I've never been so inky in all my<br/>
life - multicolor boxes on the trail?  Bunch of overachievers in this<br/>
group!!!  Just teasing - the images were all fabulous!!  The TESS<br/>
boxes were a great bonus - nice job, everyone, and thanks to SC for<br/>
bringing them along.  (Who made that logbook?  rhetorical question -<br/>
don't answer, Mrs.!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to WI Hiker and Martini Man for planning this all and<br/>
being the best hosts around!<br/>

PS:  Boxer-in-TRAINing reports this morning that his feet are feeling<br/>
better, and is ready to go out to search for more boxes! Even Papillon<br/>
admitted she had a good time.  Now THAT says a lot!!!<br/>
<br/>
PPS:  Papillon did an excellent job of driving all the way home - even<br/>
 WHEN THE DEER RAN IN FRONT OF THE CAR ON THE TOLLWAY!!!!!!!!  Yikes!<br/>
 A young doe ran in front of us - paused - turned around and lost her<br/>
footing inches away from the front passenger-side fender.  Fortunately<br/>
she was not injured, and was able to run away, but Papillon's<br/>
heartrate sure increased after the experience, as did BIT's and mine!<br/>
