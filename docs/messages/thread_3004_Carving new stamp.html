I have changed my signature stamp a couple of times over the past 4 years -- mostly because I just got bored with it and wanted a different design.  The first couple had my trail name on so there was not a question who it was.  The latest incarnation does not my trail name on, but I do sign my name when I stamp in most boxes.<br/>

  I want to do away with our store bought trail stamp, but I think I <br/>
  want to change the image a bit. Do you think it is ok to change the <br/>
  look of the image to something different? I don't know if people will <br/>
  know it's me.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sure, go ahead. Lots of us have changed our sig stamps from the images<br/>
we used when first getting started.<br/>
<br/>
Some do it when milestones are reached i.e F-100; some do it when the<br/>
older stamp disintegrates, some do it when they just get tired of the<br/>
old one.<br/>
My sig stamp inlcudes my trailname as part of the stamp so when I<br/>
changed over to the present one, it was still obvious that it was the<br/>
same person. If you customarily sign your name, it'll still be clear<br/>
that it's doubledragonletterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
