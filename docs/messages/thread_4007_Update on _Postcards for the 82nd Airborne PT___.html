                    <div class="plaintext-content">I will try to make this as concise as I possibly can. I wanted to<br>
be sure to let everyone from the S.I.L.O., the Hoosier<br>
and the Schoolhouse events and others who contributed via snailmail<br>
know what a tremendous impact those 150 postcards and the Girl Scout<br>
cookies had on my son and his platoon TODAY in Afghanistan!!!<br>
<br>
Today I got the very first detailed email from my son since January. <br>
The absolute cliff note version is that is has been pure hell for<br>
them.  The living conditions have tested even the toughest soldier. <br>
Many days since getting to their two different mission locations, they<br>
have been without both food and water.  They had to dig foxholes into<br>
rocky soil in the side of the mountains and from what I can tell lived<br>
in those fox holes for weeks trying to keep scorpions out.  They have<br>
been living without electricity or running water and have had to have<br>
everything airlifted in to them.  This is all in either frigid temps<br>
or as high as 120 degrees.<br>
<br>
They have been working with NATO forces, helping Afghan citizens,<br>
farmers and political leaders stop the Taliban from acts of terrorism<br>
and major, MAJOR drug trafficking that eventually makes it way to the<br>
US--if not stopped.  The joke is that there are so many drugs, that<br>
their sandbags could be filled with the drugs rather than sand?!  In<br>
Greg's email, it comes sailing through that they are making a decisive<br>
difference over there!  <br>
<br>
The bads news is that 2 soldiers have been killed in action.  The<br>
American soldier is the first KIA for them in their Company in 3<br>
deployments.  He was a Sergeant in the 82nd ABN and the other one was<br>
a Dutch recon soldier. Today they got back to their base camp for the<br>
first real R&R since January.  They also had memorial and ramp<br>
ceremonies for both soldiers to send their remains home to their<br>
families.  Please, please say a prayer for all these soldiers and for<br>
the families of those who lost their loved one.<br>
<br>
Timing is everything.  TODAY, all those packages of Girl Scout cookies<br>
and all those wonderful notes, postcards, handmade and artistic cards<br>
of Tiptoe's students were there waiting for them---and it had FAR MORE<br>
of an impact to uplift these men than you will EVER know.  The email I<br>
got from my son was priceless.  He went out of his way by sharing the<br>
VERY postive things they have accomplished over in Afghanistan and<br>
just how INCREDIBLE and HEART WARMING it was for them to each have a<br>
special package waiting for them!  Greg could not say it enough!  <br>
<br>
To the Schoolhouse event attendees, all of those wonderful Easter<br>
basket donations, beef jerky for every soldier(wow Van Man!!!),<br>
JBBK98's students handmade coptic stitch message books, socks and cash<br>
donations are all being assembled into the next major round of care<br>
packages so that these are ready and waiting, following their next<br>
mission!  FungusWoman, you really helped get me started on the right<br>
foot! There have been cash donations for shipping and the St. Barbara<br>
medals which have helped make ends meet. Dr. Watson, your generosity<br>
and support cannot be matched. You are an amazing human being!!<br>
<br>
So many people have gone way above and beyond in so many different,<br>
thoughtful and creative ways.  Hawkeye from GA, Safari Man, Granny<br>
Butterfly & Coffee Mug, Rosmarinus, R-gang, Scoutdogs, scrapper,<br>
Chicago Dogs from...well, you know! :) To the S.I.L.O. and Hoosier<br>
event folks, those soldiers are paging through your postcards and<br>
notes right now!!! FW, would you please let your church folks know<br>
this for me as well??  You all have made a difference in the lives of<br>
soldiers who don't always feel or hear the support! I don't know what<br>
else to do but to say thank you and to give you the feedback you very<br>
much deserve!  Thank you for supporting these front line troops! <br>
<br>
A very grateful Trailtracker<br>
