I live in illinois...(near starved rock area)  where would i go  to get <br/>
supplies to make my own box.  I guess I mean like the stamp to  carve.  I've been <br/>
looking, but I can't find any-or maybe I am looking  in the wrong place.  Any <br/>
help would be appreciated.<br/>

	Dick Blick is my favorite source for good-quality erasers to carve<br/>
to make stamps -- and the tools to carve them with! www.dickblick.com will<br/>
get you there, if you don't have any in your area (they are a<br/>
northeast-illinois company, originally).<br/>
<br/>
	I've been compiling some lists of links to places to get, online,<br/>
supplies for starting letterboxing On The Cheap, and will be posting it<br/>
when I've gotten it beaten into shape and have time.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm personally a big fan of Dick Blick.  You can go online (www.dickblick.com, I think) and order Mastercarve (which is my medium of choice).  It comes in the biggest, most wicked looking chunk you've ever seen.  It looks like a blunt force weapon has been delivered to your door and it lasts forever.<br/>
<br/>
Or, if you have Michael's, they carry that Speedball pink stuff.  There are some on this list who have a nearly cult-like devotion to it- even going so far as to note differences in barcodes (*grin*  You know who you are).<br/>
<br/>
And if you're not sure you're ready for a big hunk of any carving medium, regular erasers really do make excellent stamps.  My first couple stamps were done on erasers, and they're holding up just fine.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, since I neglected to read the other replies to this post, I'm probably repeating the very good advice others have given you.  In which case, sorry!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
