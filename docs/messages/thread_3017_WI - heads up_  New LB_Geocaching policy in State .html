                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got an email from the ranger at Rib Mountain.  There is a new <br/>
Geocaching/Letterboxing policy for the WI State Parks.  Doesn't sound <br/>
like there is a fee, but there is a compliance form to fill out so <br/>
they are sure the boxes are in a "safe location."<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the DNR is going through all LBs listed and determining <br/>
whether they are in a SP and emailing people if they are.  So far I've <br/>
got nothing else - just Rib Mtn.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like the WI geocachers got their wish from the DNR :p<br/>
Thanks a bunch!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, the same thing happened in some of the parks here near Cincinnati <br/>
Ohio. I filled out the forms, add the "registration number" to the outside <br/>
of all my boxes and never heard another thing about it.  It was supposed to <br/>
be renewed each year and that was about two years ago.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion:  Play along and they leave you alone.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, when I told them how many letterboxes I had hidden in the park, <br/>
they let me fill out one form, list all the boxes on it and use just one <br/>
registration number.  I have since then pulled some of the boxes to make way <br/>
for other placers but no one else has placed in there that I know of.<br/>
