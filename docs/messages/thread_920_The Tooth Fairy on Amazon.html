Hi <br>
If you are not a regular to Amazon, during the holiday season they <br>
are doing a new mini movie each week.  This weeks is the Tooth Fairy <br>
and it is delightful and has distinct letterbox overtones.  If you go <br>
to www.amazon.com it is on the first page.<br>
<br>
Enjoy - I do most my letterboxing with very young children (I'm the <br>
crazy Aunt that every family has one of) and this really made me <br>
think about some of the clues my buddies come up with for me to <br>
decipher!  I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.<br>
<br>
Happy Holidays<br>

OMG ... that was a great little flick! Thanks so much for sharing the<br>
info with us.<br>
<br>
Last night I forwarded it to a friend of mine in Portland, OR who's<br>
daughter uses Tooth Fairy as her trail name.  This morning I got a<br>
really cute note back from her. Don't you love it when you can make<br>
someone (esp a kid) smile?<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

You are welcome - I felt the little girls "fun" challenged captured <br>
the essence of what I enjoy about letterboxing - I'm just a old kid, <br>
5.2 years old (I count in decades)<br>
