                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Wisconsin Hiker!  I am presently getting ready to post more information.   Yes, <br>
folks, if you haven't made lodging reservations, do so as fast as you can.  In some parks, <br>
reservations are snapped up one year in advance.  If you haven't signed up to attend the <br>
event, please do that soon before we hit the maximum of 150.<br>
<br>
I planned to post most of the information here, but I worry that my posts would get lost <br>
with the Bingo activity.  Plus, the sign-up list at Atlas Quest is nearly 100 already.  I think <br>
it makes sense to post there.<br>
<br>
I cannot vouch for local lodging options and their suitability.  If you need additional <br>
assistance, please let me know.  Due to other obligations, I just didn't have the resources <br>
to create a website for this event.  I am doing my best to see that this event is very low-<br>
stress for me, and not competing for the blast-of-the-century award.<br>
<br>
LOCATION REVEALED - We will be using the Apple Orchard Shelter.  Pale Puppy Posse <br>
contacted me and offered to spearhead the Potluck.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!  Look for <br>
those details at Atlas Quest.  <br>
<br>
I haven't delegated the "OFFICIAL EVENT STAMP" yet.  No takers?  I have a simple design in <br>
my head that I will work on later today.<br>
<br>
WE NEED TRAIL BOXES!!<br>
We have permission to place 12-15 temporary boxes for our event.  I'm going to create 15 <br>
listings at AQ. <br>
<br>
Guidelines for trail boxes - <br>
<br>
1. All Things Green (15 boxes max) - please submit your idea to me for listing in the <br>
series posted at AQ.  For this series, please design your stamp to use GREEN ink only (no <br>
metallics, unless you provide the ink with the box).  Any GREEN IDEA is acceptable.  Since <br>
we are emphasizing "green" I'm suggesting the design not exceed the size of an LTC <br>
trading card (2.5x3.5?).  Why?  Simple!  After the event, these stamps can be returned to <br>
the owners to be recycled!!!  An added bonus - we can create uniform logbooks and have <br>
each container look more official.<br>
<br>
Deadline for mailing - March 15, 2009.  <br>
Include in mailing - stamp; green inkpad (optional).  In return you will receive the logbook <br>
created for your stamp, including the event stamp, and all the finders during GLG 2009. <br>
And of course, your stamp.  If the stamp is lost you agree not to hold speedsquare et al <br>
responsible.<br>
<br>
Shelter Boxes (series) --<br>
<br>
1. The Conservation Movement<br>
2. The 1920's &  1930's<br>
3. Our State Parks (favorites from each GL state)<br>
<br>
These will be listed as Travelling Event Boxes at Atlas Quest. No restriction on size and <br>
color.  It would be nice to see at least 2 submissions from each of the Great Lakes States.  <br>
Contact me with your requests/reservations.  No limit set at this time.<br>
<br>
Deadline for Mailing - April 15, 2009<br>
I will send the mailing address under separate cover.<br>
<br>
Letterbox trading cards (LTC') - will be welcome, especially if they incorporate any of the <br>
themes listed above.<br>
<br>
If you are available Tues-Thurs before the event and want to help plant, contact me off-<br>
list.  I may be able to offer lodging at Clear Lake.<br>
<br>

 I highly doubt there will be 150 letterboxers inside the shelter at<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree with Wisconsin Hiker on the number of people<br>
issue. The building that we've used for the fall gathering in MI has a<br>
limit and we've come close both times as far as sign-ups, but it's not<br>
been a real issue because not everyone shows up and people come and go<br>
during the day -- especially when the meal is potluck and the weather<br>
is nice.<br>
<br>
I was mostly concerned with information being available to folks who<br>
don't use AQ.  With the smaller localized and themed events, if<br>
somebody wants to use AQ as the delivery method for info, that is<br>
their choice as it is their gathering and they can do it however they<br>
want.  But the GLG is "our" gathering -- all of us here at the GL<br>
Yahoo group -- and should be easily accessible to everyone without<br>
requiring use of another web site they may not use.<br>
<br>
If there is anything you need help with here at the group or keeping<br>
track of anything, please let me know... I'd be happy to help out.<br>

<br>
I am totally in agreement that this is "our/LbGLK" gathering and will approach it from this perspective.  I'm trying to find a polite way to woo everyone over here and have only a minimal amount of information on AQ for this event.  I am prone to anxiety (okay, read: control freak) and leaving crumbs everywhere makes that possiblity come alive.<br>
<br>
I just completed the addition to the database to include everyone who has signed up at AQ.  If there are others here that plan to attend (and don't want to be listed/come unannounced, let me know and I will add you to my personal count).<br>
<br>
Please check the database for changes later.  I have a couple of box reservations to add.<br>
<br>
More tomorrow and later this week.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You're right.  And since quite a few trails are moderate, finding all the trail boxes may take <br>
all day.  I'm planning on taking several days to plant them.  I'll stop worrying for now.<br>
