IL, have been temporarily pulled. The "Great Medallion Hunt" is taking <br>
place in Princeton until September 8th and everyone will be searching <br>
through the local parks looking for the medallion. I will replace the 2 <br>
boxes after the 8th. Thanks!<br>

 <br>
I've moved my "Channel Cat Series: The Quarter box #4 Leaf" and have  updated <br>
my clues as my original spot would soon be under water. OH, my "Channel  Cat <br>
Series: Isle of Capri" will soon be moving as well, every time I've past the  <br>
little park I hid the stamp in I've seen homeless men sleeping right near the  <br>
spot! <br>
 <br>
I went to pull my "Campbells Island" box and found the "tree that looks  like <br>
it might hide a letterbox" mentioned in my clues has fallen down . . .  right <br>
down the middle of the path to the river!!<br>
 <br>
I didn't have my chain saw with me so I will have to let the box go under .  <br>
. . AGAIN! <br>
 <br>
Don't know when (or how) I will ever be able to get to this box, but  someday <br>
I will probably announce that I have once  again saved this box  from an <br>
untimely death. <br>
