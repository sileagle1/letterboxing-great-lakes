There is another one we found, and again there is a quick walk to it if you bypass much of the information. <br/>

  Do NOT do any boxes by KazooDog half are missing. I would suggest <br/>
  Azobox's and if you want alot of boxes in one area I would go to <br/>
  Saugatuck Dunes park!!!! Spring chick has some there and there is an <br/>
  awesome walk on "The Spine of the Dragon" (if you do this one, just <br/>
  a clue when in dought go up). You said some in the group don't like <br/>
  to walk on dunes and stuff, well if these are adults you can drop <br/>
  them off down the road in downtown Saugatuck. There are lots of <br/>
  shops and places to grab a bite. The Saugatuck Park is a MUST see!! <br/>
  I really loved this park, beautiful! Hope this helps!!<br/>

  &gt; Next month is a long-planned letterboxing trip with a very dear <br/>
  friend<br/>
  &gt; and member of our group...Mrs DogLvrs!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Our current plan is to spend an overnight in the K'zoo area <br/>
  hunting up<br/>
  &gt; boxes, since this is pretty new boxing area for both of us, and it <br/>
  is<br/>
  &gt; a "target rich" enviroment. (grin)<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Does anyone know of any quick and easy drive-by boxes on the way<br/>
  &gt; between Grand Rapids and K'zoo?  You know when you put the two of <br/>
  us<br/>
  &gt; together, we can just be driving along somewhere and find ourselves<br/>
  &gt; overcome with the NEED to get out and find a box.  Heck we even <br/>
  pulled<br/>
  &gt; my laptop out of the trunk at a truck stop and paid for a quick<br/>
  &gt; internet fix so we could find boxes on the way to the WI gathering<br/>
  &gt; last year!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Also, and K'zoo area boxes that should go on our "must do" list? <br/>
  &gt; Please keep in mind that one quarter of our team simply refuses to <br/>
  do<br/>
  &gt; uneven ground such as sand dunes or hikes much more than a mile<br/>
  &gt; round-trip. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Thanks in advance for any and all help in planning our Spring get-<br/>
  away<br/>
  &gt; letterboxing adventure.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>

little off and the box was not in great shape (it was, in fact, <br/>
cracked and the log book was wet)... so I would say this one is a <br/>
possible find (if you are persistent!) and you run the risk of a <br/>
damaged stamp (unless KazooDog has updated or replaced them. We have <br/>
never heard back from our little email update we sent.)<br/>

&gt; Actually, we have found some of kazooDog's boxes. There is the 5 <br/>
Senses one that is a short walk. I want to go back this summer when <br/>
it's in it's glory. The fish hatchery one is a bit of a walk, there <br/>
is a shortcut but you wouldn't know it unless you know where the <br/>
microbox is. There is another one we found, and again there is a <br/>
quick walk to it if you bypass much of the information. <br/>

&gt;   Do NOT do any boxes by KazooDog half are missing. I would suggest <br/>
&gt;   Azobox's and if you want alot of boxes in one area I would go to <br/>
&gt;   Saugatuck Dunes park!!!! Spring chick has some there and there is <br/>
an <br/>
&gt;   awesome walk on "The Spine of the Dragon" (if you do this one, <br/>
just <br/>
&gt;   a clue when in dought go up). You said some in the group don't <br/>
like <br/>
&gt;   to walk on dunes and stuff, well if these are adults you can drop <br/>
&gt;   them off down the road in downtown Saugatuck. There are lots of <br/>
&gt;   shops and places to grab a bite. The Saugatuck Park is a MUST <br/>
see!! <br/>
&gt;   I really loved this park, beautiful! Hope this helps!!<br/>
