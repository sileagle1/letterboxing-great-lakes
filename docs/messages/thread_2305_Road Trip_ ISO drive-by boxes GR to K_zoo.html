and member of our group...Mrs DogLvrs!<br>
<br>
Our current plan is to spend an overnight in the K'zoo area hunting up<br>
boxes, since this is pretty new boxing area for both of us, and it is<br>
a "target rich" enviroment. (grin)<br>
<br>
Does anyone know of any quick and easy drive-by boxes on the way<br>
between Grand Rapids and K'zoo?  You know when you put the two of us<br>
together, we can just be driving along somewhere and find ourselves<br>
overcome with the NEED to get out and find a box.  Heck we even pulled<br>
my laptop out of the trunk at a truck stop and paid for a quick<br>
internet fix so we could find boxes on the way to the WI gathering<br>
last year!<br>
<br>
Also, and K'zoo area boxes that should go on our "must do" list? <br>
Please keep in mind that one quarter of our team simply refuses to do<br>
uneven ground such as sand dunes or hikes much more than a mile<br>
round-trip. <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any and all help in planning our Spring get-away<br>
letterboxing adventure.<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>

As far as Kalamazoo area boxes, my recommendations (taking into <br>

area)...<br>
<br>
My absolute favs are the Slim boxes, but they may be a bit of a hike, <br>
so other than those...<br>
<br>
First in the Zoo<br>
Zoo Two<br>
Woods in the City I and II<br>
Celery Flats<br>
Asylum Birds<br>

The last two are a bit further hikes, but I don't think a mile and no <br>

Have fun!<br>

I want to go back this summer when it's in it's glory. The fish hatchery one is a bit of a walk, there is a shortcut but you wouldn't know it unless you know where the microbox is. There is another one we found, and again there is a quick walk to it if you bypass much of the information. <br>

  Do NOT do any boxes by KazooDog half are missing. I would suggest <br>
  Azobox's and if you want alot of boxes in one area I would go to <br>
  Saugatuck Dunes park!!!! Spring chick has some there and there is an <br>

little off and the box was not in great shape (it was, in fact, <br>
cracked and the log book was wet)... so I would say this one is a <br>
possible find (if you are persistent!) and you run the risk of a <br>
damaged stamp (unless KazooDog has updated or replaced them. We have <br>
never heard back from our little email update we sent.)<br>

quick walk to it if you bypass much of the information. <br>
