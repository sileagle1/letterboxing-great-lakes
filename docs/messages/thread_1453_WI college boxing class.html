Digests of messages from the Group.<br>

The thread about the college boxing class in WI caught my eye.  In <br>
Message 3689 I posted about how boxes from my Hauntings Series on the<br>
old Traverse City State Hospital went missing.<br>
<br>
Seems the University of Chicago has an annual scavenger hunt and<br>
without asking permission or contacting me in any way, my letterboxes<br>
ended up as part of this years hunt.<br>
<br>
I got an email from one of the students who said their team not only<br>
found the box, but since they didn't know what letterboxing was about,<br>
they TOOK the box with them!  <br>
<br>
She said she'd like to return my box, so I gave her my address but as<br>
of yesterday, I still haven't had my missing boxes returned.<br>
