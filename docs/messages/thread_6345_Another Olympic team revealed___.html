Don't let the togas fool you...these toga lovers are out to win! Also, I wouldn't be surprised if they butter up those Swedes again this year. In fact, I could swear I saw them buying some new slippers. ;-)<br>

Well we know dat da Greeks invented athletic contests and started de<br>
Olympics WAAAAYYY back in ancient times.  Da Greek Spartans be focused on<br>
training and usually excel in many events, including de Iditarod.  In<br>
addition, dey even have all sorts of gods givin' em good luck.  So we be<br>
very lucky dat dey have a little somethin' dat slow dem down dis winter!<br>
However dey still be IN DA GAME and we be keepin' a close eye on da greasy<br>
ones....<br>

Not only were we flying like the wind but we had to take time out to rescue a kitty twenty feet up in a tree. No idea how long she had been there but she was cold and frightened. Thought she would bite and scratch me to death but as soon as I got her in my arms she started purring... <br>
