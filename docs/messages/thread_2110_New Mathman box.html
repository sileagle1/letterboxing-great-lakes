students are working on the final pieces of Mathman boxes 19, 20, and<br>
21 (coming in January), I jumped the gun a bit and made one for my<br>
freshmen to do over break.  Look for Mathman 18 - Washington County<br>
History on the LBNA site now!<br>
<br>
This is a winter friendly box and is the first to feature the new<br>
"Mathman" bonus stamp!  Try your luck!<br>
<br>
Note: For some reason part of the directions in Clue 8 got deleted,<br>
but I think you can figure out what to do if you try for the box<br>
before I can fix the deletion.<br>
