Subject: Beetlegram about Listerine<br>
<br>
<br>
Greetings to everyone!   <br>
I am sharing this information with my friends, neighbors, Girl Scout friends, camping buddies and letterboxers.     <br>
A friend wrote to me and here is what she told me about Listerine and mosquitoes!  I'm not sure why it works, but I'm willing try it.   Does anyone know what is in Listerine that might repel or kill mosquitoes?<br>
Beetle<br>
<br>
 <br>
The best way of getting rid of mosquitoes is Listerine, the original medicinal type. The Dollar Store-type works, too. I was at a deck party awhile back, and the bugs were having a ball biting everyone. A man at the party sprayed the lawn and deck floor with Listerine, and the little demons disappeared. The next year I filled a 4-ounce spray bottle and used it around my seat whenever I saw mosquitoes. And voila! That worked as well. It worked at a picnic where we sprayed the area around the food table, the childrens swing area, and the standing water nearby. During the summer, I dont leave home without it.....Pass it on.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I tried this on my deck and around all of my doors. It works - in fact, it killed them instantly. I bought my bottle from Target and it cost me $1.89. It really doesn't take much, and it is a big bottle, too; so it is not as expensive to use as the can of spray you buy that doesn't last 30 minutes. So, try this, please. It will last a couple of days. Don't spray directly on a wood door (like your front door), but spray around the frame. Spray around the window frames, and even inside the dog house if you have one.<br>

Does anyone know the "safety" level for the human body and DEET?  Regular<br>
OFF has something like 15% DEET, and Deep Woods Off has something like 25%<br>
DEET.  OK, fine.  I've been using those two products for years and no ill<br>
effects to date.  I haven't died of cancer or seizures yet and I'm 54.<br>
<br>
But the flood water skeeters around here have been horrible lately,<br>
particularly in lower lying woods areas, because of the August rains.  I<br>
have a spray that I've never really used because I didn't look at the DEET<br>
content until after I bought it.  It's a spray for human skin, not just<br>
clothes.  (I do have a product that's only meant to be put on clothes and<br>
should never be put directly on human skin.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, this stuff I found at Walmart has 40% DEET.  Anyone know if that's<br>
actually OK to use?  I would never ever use it on kids........I wouldn't<br>
even recommend the Deep Woods Off for kids.......but what about adult<br>
humans?  In the territory we were in this past weekend, the Deep Woods Off<br>
made a really good attempt but we still got eaten.<br>

<br>
The concentration of DEET correlates to the length of time that it is <br>
effective.  Higher concentrations = longer length of protection.  An <br>
article I looked at (from Annals of Internal Medicine--so I think <br>
that should be pretty reliable)  mentioned concentrations of up to <br>
100%.  Here's a link to the article:  <br>
<br>
  http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/128/11/931#T2<br>
<br>
The article seemed to be saying that higher concentrations are OK if <br>
the conditions warrant, but daily use of a high concentration <br>
probably isn't a great idea.  It also mentioned that the Am Acacemy <br>
of Pediatrics suggests no greater than 10% on small kids.<br>

I smear Off insect repellent on my skin but I spray the Repel on my clothes; my bandana, collar, shirt cuffs, pant legs, socks.  It is suppose to keep mosquitoes away fro 10 hours.  I hesitate to spray it directly on my skin.  But I does work.  It kept the mosquitoes off me for an entire day while I conducted an outdoor education training course for Girl Scout leaders.  The woods were buzzing with the pesty little blood suckers, but they didn't get any free samples of me.   With all the West Nile hype, I do what I need to do to keep them off me, but I'd recommend something less toxic for children.  <br>

  Speaking of DEET..............<br>
<br>
  Does anyone know the "safety" level for the human body and DEET? Regular<br>
  OFF has something like 15% DEET, and Deep Woods Off has something like 25%<br>
  DEET. OK, fine. I've been using those two products for years and no ill<br>
  effects to date. I haven't died of cancer or seizures yet and I'm 54.<br>
<br>
  But the flood water skeeters around here have been horrible lately,<br>
  particularly in lower lying woods areas, because of the August rains. I<br>
  have a spray that I've never really used because I didn't look at the DEET<br>
  content until after I bought it. It's a spray for human skin, not just<br>
  clothes. (I do have a product that's only meant to be put on clothes and<br>
  should never be put directly on human skin.)<br>
<br>
  Anyway, this stuff I found at Walmart has 40% DEET. Anyone know if that's<br>
  actually OK to use? I would never ever use it on kids........I wouldn't<br>
  even recommend the Deep Woods Off for kids.......but what about adult<br>
  humans? In the territory we were in this past weekend, the Deep Woods Off<br>
  made a really good attempt but we still got eaten.<br>

I got camping so I need the strong stuff! I bought a small pump spray bottle of Repel 100% DEET with no other ingredients listed. I smear Off insect repellent on my skin but I spray the Repel on my clothes; my bandana, collar, shirt cuffs, pant legs, socks. It is suppose to keep mosquitoes away fro 10 hours. I hesitate to spray it directly on my skin. But I does work. It kept the mosquitoes off me for an entire day while I conducted an outdoor education training course for Girl Scout leaders. The woods were buzzing with the pesty little blood suckers, but they didn't get any free samples of me. With all the West Nile hype, I do what I need to do to keep them off me, but I'd recommend something less toxic for children. <br>

It's a little pump spray bottle and I assumed that a little would go along way. The packaging said it protects up to 10 hours.  So I only used a little bit.  But it did the trick.  I saw those blood suckers flying all around me while we took a hike around the camp, but no bites.  I can't say the same for those who didn't read their handout info. or their training manual and didn't bring sunblock, repellent...some wore sandals.  Their toes must have been ripe for snacking!  ITCH ITCH ITCH!<br>
<br>
With three campouts within the next month, I'll really put this stuff to the test.  <br>
I wouldn't recommend 100% DEET for children.  I didn't even want to spray it directly on my skin.  <br>

I know someone said that listerine doesn't work, but I thought I'd <br>
mention this, since it's related.  Yesterday, I was running late for <br>
work, so as I was rinsing my mouth out with mouthwash, instead of <br>
staying in the bathroom for a minute or two and spitting it in the <br>
sink, I took my dog out the back door to go to the bathroom and I <br>
spit the mouthwash into the flower bed outside the door. When I came <br>
home last night, there were about 2 dozen flies swarming around that <br>
exact spot!  I have no idea if they were attracted by the mouthwash, <br>
but that's the only thing I can think of that would bring them <br>
there.  It wasn't actually listerine, but a no-brand version of the <br>
orange flavor mouthwash.<br>
<br>
I hate flies!  I think I'd prefer the mosquitos.  So, no spraying <br>
listerine for me!<br>

My strategy--when in the vicinity of mosquitoes--is to stand as close <br>
as possible to my daughter.  She is a real mosquito magnet, so they <br>
leave me alone.  We have a picture of her when she was 3 and we were <br>
camping for the weekend.  She was so bitten up that one eye was swollen <br>
shut.  <br>

  Same thing happened to us this past weekend. We were<br>
  in Findlay, Ohio - another area recently affected by<br>
  major flooding. We practically BATHED in our Deep<br>
  Woods Off and still had a bunch of mosquito bites all<br>
  over us by the time we got back to the car. And we<br>
  were only out for about half an hour!<br>

I know what you mean though, we took our whole family out boxing and my 18 m/o twins can't swat them away from their face. Seriously, I thought we would be called into DCFS . . . <br>
