people's interest in the whole treasure hunt game concept.<br>
<br>
Here is a link to an article in yesterday's Grand Rapids (MI) Press <br>
about letterboxing.  It was on the front page of the Living section, <br>
along with a great big old picture (not shown in the online <br>
version).  As far as letterboxing articles go, this one is kind of <br>
boring and doesn't really grab my interest, particularly the <br>
title... although the part about following the HH progress is <br>
interesting -- what I want to know is how they managed to get HH <br>
reports in Alaska and we can't even get them here in the civilized <br>
world?<br>
<br>
But on the positive side, the article doesn't really give enough <br>
information that somebody could head out the door and go <br>
letterboxing without doing some further research -- which would <br>
hopefully give them enough information to be a responsible <br>
participant.<br>
<br>
I'm not really sure who the people are that they talked to, except <br>
the last guy mentioned, I have run into him on the trail before.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you are in West Michigan, be prepared for some new <br>
players...  and most likely some missing boxes.  I guess that is <br>
just the nature of the beast with publicity.<br>
