                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, I think it would absolutely kill me to find an image and copy it.  My<br>
creativity would feel so mentally suffocated.  My twisted and somewhat<br>
demented brain gives birth to the images I use.  Then I draw, redraw, redraw<br>
 and redraw it until the paper has a hole in it, and I realize that I<br>
basically suck at art and settle for whatever I come up with (aka -<br>
stickmen), which usually has absolutely nothing to do with my original<br>
thought.  So when you find a stamp you can't identify and it makes you have<br>
a puzzled look on your face, just shake your head and know it's mine.<br>
<br>
"12-step program confession..."  LOL.  Yes to all of the above (though I'm<br>
not sure what the term "lock 'n lock" means.  I'm guessing it means a<br>
container of some sort?  <br>
<br>
In addition to boxes, clues, and stamps all calling out my name, I'm also in<br>
the process of planning the coming semester of teaching letterboxing to<br>
about eight teens.  <br>
<br>
I've got the basics down - carving stamps, making logbooks, recording clues,<br>
field trips to finding them, and more.  Any suggestions for other things I<br>
can add to the class???  <br>
