                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we weren't the BINGO winners (and aren't likely to take 2nd or <br/>
3rd place either) but we aren't complaining - we had a fabulous <br/>
weekend!<br/>
<br/>
While we were waiting for the last few Wandering in Wonderland <br/>
gathering boxes to arrive, we headed out to the La Crosse, WI area to <br/>
join our hiking club for some hiking along the Mississippi River.  On <br/>
Saturday we did a challenging 10-mile hike up on the bluffs and on <br/>
Sunday a 5-mile hike on a river dike, nice and close to the water.  <br/>
Fabulous weather in the low to mid-70s, sunny skies, sparkling water, <br/>
lots of birds (including herons, egrets, hawks and an eagle), and <br/>
newly leafed out trees, including many flowering trees.  Quite the <br/>
spring spectacle!  <br/>
<br/>
Of course we incorporated some boxing on our weekend trip.  We <br/>
checked on two of our boxes.  Heron's Habitat is in great shape, but <br/>
hasn't had a visitor since OCT 2004.  You can easily bike to this box <br/>
on the river dike.  Wildcat Mound Wolf needed a new box, due to some <br/>
cracking, but contents were in perfect shape.  Very few visitors to <br/>
this box also.<br/>
<br/>
We also placed two boxes.  One of my own and one for someone else who <br/>
is doing a national series.<br/>
<br/>
We managed to find 12 boxes.  Amazingly we were first finders at 7 of <br/>
the boxes, even though some had been placed last fall.  Two other <br/>
notable events for us were finding our first Iowa boxes and finding <br/>
our 1,300th box (Y's Mac, with very cute clues).  Unfortunately we <br/>
weren't able to find Dragon's Tunnel #1 box and we have notified him <br/>
accordingly.<br/>

had seven first finders after the thread that was running through here <br/>
last month.  I guess if boxers in Northern Illinois want a first find <br/>
they should head North of the border ;P<br/>
<br/>
Many congratulations on your 1300!  I would rather that than a BINGO <br/>
win any day!  (of course a bingo second or third wouldn't be bad.)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately no boxing for us over the weekend, just yard and <br/>
housework (finally! the lawn is mowed.)  We have been carving though <br/>
and hope to get some boxes placed soon.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I'd say you'd need to go northWEST to be a FF.  Boxers in the<br/>
Milwaukee area are pretty quick out of the house (or the office during<br/>
lunch) when a new clue is posted in this area!   I don't think there are<br/>
really any boxers in the west portion of WI.  The boxes in that area have<br/>
all been placed by  other people when they are traveling to/through the<br/>
area.  Therefore it isn't until one of us gets out that way that the box<br/>
gets found.<br/>
