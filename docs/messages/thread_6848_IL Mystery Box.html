                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although there was some rain, we were out & about enjoying the 50 degree temperatures in IL today.  We tried to finish a series we had run out of time for last month, but were thwarted by the last box, which was still solidly FROZEN in the mud at the base of a fallen tree.  ARRGH!<br>
<br>
On the bright side, we were very happy to discover that an old mystery box planted by Shutterfly in 2005 was still in place!  The Cottontails were the first finders in 2005, there were 4 finders in 2006, then 3 finders in 2008.  Leapin' Lizards were the last finders in JUL 2008.  The stamp & logbook were both in good shape today after sitting unfound for 2.5 years.  Here's a link if you'd like to search out this older box:<br>
