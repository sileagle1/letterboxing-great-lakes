to see everyone leaving. *sob* We were kicking ourselves all the way home for missing <br>
such a cool bunch of people, nevermind the stamps. I am always very shy around groups <br>
of people I dont know, but all of you made us feel very welcome and at home and as if we <br>
actually knew everyone all along!! For all that we did get to meet, see and do while we <br>
were there, we are sure to miss any future family events if there is a letterbxing event <br>
planned on the same day, hee hee! <br>
<br>
A very special thanks to all of you who helped put this wonderful event together. And <br>
thanks to Dragon who stayed a little late so we could get in a few extra stamps, much <br>
appreciated! We cant wait until the next gathering and we look forward to running into any <br>
and all of you along the trails sometime. Now if we can just find the time lately to get out <br>
there and do some letterboxing. . . <br>
