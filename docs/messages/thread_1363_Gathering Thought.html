                    <div class="plaintext-content">Same deal here -- mine have 48 pages, the first couple being taken <br>
with the box stamp and my sig stamp.  But I am thinking it should be <br>
okay because 1) Probably not every person will find every box and 2) <br>
Some of the people signed up are family groups with a single stamp <br>
between them.<br>
<br>
But just to be safe it would probably be a good idea for people to <br>
conserve space in the logbooks and double up on pages where possible.<br>
