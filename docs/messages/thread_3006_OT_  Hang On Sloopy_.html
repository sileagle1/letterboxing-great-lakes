DD's comment had me do a quick search on the song and<br>
I found this link.  Now, being an Ohioan, I already<br>
knew that this song was indeed the state of Ohio's<br>
_official_ rock song, but if this is the real<br>
resolution that made the song our official state rock<br>
song, I'm glad someone at some point in Ohio<br>
government had a sense of humor!  I mean, c'mon, "If<br>
fans of jazz, country-and-western, classical, Hawaiian<br>
and polka music think those styles also should be<br>
recognized by the state, then by golly, they can push<br>
their own resolution just like we're doing"??? :)<br>

I think I need to create a letterbox based on this. <br>
Add that to my ever-growing list of great letterbox<br>
ideas...<br>
