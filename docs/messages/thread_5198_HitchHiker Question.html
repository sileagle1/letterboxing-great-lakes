                    <div class="plaintext-content">One of the western suburbs of Chicago, Western Springs, has a HH Hostel.  (Traveler's Rest Hitchhiker Hostel) I haven't been there lately, but it is supposed to have 3 HH's "resting" in there.  The idea is to drop off a HH & pick one up.  I might be a good place to view a few before you launch yours.  I currently have 3 HH's that are traveling with me.  I've not been able to drop them because all of the boxes that I've found lately are very small.  They will depart soon though.  It's a great impetus to go boxing if you have a HH to get rid of. <br>
