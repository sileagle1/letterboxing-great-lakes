I'm glad we all bumped into each other today at the Ren Faire.  I will always cherish Joel's personal stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Previous, I found all the boxes except Shakespeare.  Today, Shakespeare was replaced and I now have that stamp too.  I found several letterpersons and we exchanged.  <br/>
<br/>
I stayed till the end of the faire and then walked out later with Kate.  We had dinner and chatted the night away.   We were fairly exhausted at the end of the day, but we chuckled because neither Kate nor I thought to seek out that new clue you handed us.  Maybe I look for it tomorrow on my day off.  <br/>
<br/>
I will have to check to see if you found a location for the two boxes you have in your hands today.  Hmmm....more boxes?  Where might they be?  <br/>

<br/>
  Thanks so much for planning this and sending the information out to <br/>
  all of us who were interested!<br/>
<br/>
  We didnt get to head up for it, but we did end up with a 'Micro' <br/>
  meetup of our own! I got to meet several of the wonderful local <br/>
  letterboxers today at the Bristol Ren Faire - thanks to KissMeKate <br/>
  for 'organizing' this impromptu get together!!!<br/>
<br/>
  Hubby I and Joel enjoyed our day immensely! And found 8 boxes, with <br/>
  even MORE exchanges. Was a great day!<br/>
<br/>

Luckily the day will be just for hubby and me, even tho I know the kids like it too.  Maybe we'll make another trip up there with them before the end of the season.  =)  So, Saturday is definitely on, and I can't wait to see you all there!! (HUGS)<br/>

It will be easy to find the Brat Pack....just listen for six children all talking at one time....mommie, mommie, mommie, mommie, mommie, moomie.  <br/>
Have you ever thought about changing your name?  I'm sure there are days when that sounds like a plan.  <br/>
I hope to see you on Saturday.  I'm going back to work today after being off a week for vacation.  I am hoping that they won't schedule me to work this weekend.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The outside entertainment starts up around 9:30 or so. There's jokes, <br/>
an intro to Robin Hood's adventures, Jane the Queen's Phoole (make a <br/>
note of her outfit so you can find her later!), and the entrance of <br/>
the Queen's courtiers!<br/>
<br/>
The kids, depending on age and interest, might like to follow the <br/>
Robin Hood story throughout the day and/or watch the Queen on her <br/>
daily activities (look on the 11x17 schedule when you come in the <br/>
gate for times and locations).  If you'd like to show off your "bun <br/>
in the oven", might I suggest a short shirt and a visit to the face <br/>
painter near the candied almonds.  He does a wonderful job on bellys <br/>
(one of my friends had a full underwater ocean scene when she came to <br/>
Faire when she was about 7 months along).  There's also a Kid's <br/>
Kingdom, where there's kid-appropriate activities all day.<br/>
<br/>
Barefoot Ankh and I will be at the Faire both days, although Barefoot <br/>
will be working at Mayhawke Armory all day (he'll have his stamp) and <br/>
I'll have some official wenchly activities between 1 and 3pm.  We <br/>
hope to meet you there!<br/>

&gt; About what time does the fun start outside the faire???  =)  This <br/>
way I know how early I gotta get hubby up so we can be there in <br/>
time.  If I can't get him up, then I'll leave without him...LOL   <br/>

entertainment <br/>
