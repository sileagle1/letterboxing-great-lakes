All the time, she was just 'pretending' to play, but she was really doing was waiting for her next opportunity to infect another victim.  And the reason Hart x6 had difficulty finding Skeeter sometimes - she was lurking around the Silo spreading cooties around!  <br/>
<br/>
I checked my ALL my coat pockets today.  I forgot to check inside my letterbox bag.  Nope, those locations were still cootie free.  But NEVER bring a large plastic storage box to an event.  I guess I'm lucky.  That storage box could have had 36 or more cooties inside it! <br/>
<br/>
Next gathering....A medical tent - Cootie Free Zone!  <br/>
<br/>
However, I think I have figured out the symptoms of a person who has been infected with cooties.  Once you have become infected and you discover the cootie, a silly smile comes across your face.  LOL!  Thank you to all who helped make the Silo event another fun social gathering...especially The Brats and the other cootie carvers.  <br/>

<br/>
TOO funny!  I wonder if that really might have happened?!<br/>
<br/>
OK, we'll admit to bringing 5 cooties to the event.  However one was <br/>
only a "passive" cootie held by the doll dressed in the Chinese <br/>
outfit.  This was the "Chinese Silo?" cootie and 17 people actually <br/>
stamped into it!<br/>
<br/>
Another we brought was Maxim's Cooties (started by Beetle at the St. <br/>
Nick's gathering). <br/>
<br/>
And then, I admit it, we also launched 3 NEW cooties (Chinese <br/>
Rooster, Chinese Monkey and Chinese Dragon).<br/>
<br/>
Next - what did we come home with?<br/>
<br/>
1) The "Chinese Silo?", since the doll didn't manage to pawn it off <br/>
on anyone.<br/>
<br/>
2-4) THREE Brat Pack IL cooties:  "You Jest", "Traveling Logbook" <br/>
and "Angel".<br/>
<br/>
5) "The Totem Pole" cootie launched by CinemaBoxers in August (at a <br/>
Ren Faire excursion??)<br/>
<br/>
6) "White Knight" cootie that we had launched OURSELVES at the <br/>
Wandering in Wonderland event in June.  This one was the most fun to <br/>
look at it because all 9 people that had stamped in had in fact <br/>
used "thumb art"!  A nice twist to their usual sig stamps.<br/>
<br/>
We're hoping to dump these all in San Diego next month, but if we <br/>
don't - they might end up in that Jeep (or some tents since we KNOW <br/>
where you all are staying!).<br/>

Just be careful WHICH tents you try...or you might wake the whole campground up with some noisy dog!<br/>
