in the midst of all the gathering excitement and pawed thru Sara's <br>
(of Leapin' Lizard fame) story in Route 66 Magazine like a dog on <br>
diet pills.  I had just enough presence of mind to scan the photos <br>
and know I had to get a copy once I stopped being overstimulated. <br>
<br>
I'm happy to say that very issue of Route 66 Magazine (Summer 2004, <br>
Volume 11/Number 3) is available at Borders, if anyone would like a <br>
copy of their own.<br>
<br>
Great article, Sara!<br>
