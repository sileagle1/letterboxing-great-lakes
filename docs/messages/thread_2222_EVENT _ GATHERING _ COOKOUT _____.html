  party at our house!<br>
<br>
We would like to invite everyone to the 1st Annual (hopefully) Out Of Sight Adventures (OOSA) Cookout in central Ohio on August 12.<br>
There will be food, near-by letterboxes (and geocaches), and prizes.<br>
We will have more details soon.<br>
<br>
P.S. Know of anyone who would like to donate a Letterbox to be planted near the event? Or who would like to loan out an Event box? Please let me know! :)<br>
   <br>
  You RSVP for this on Atlasquest.com or by contacting me at jose_quiti@yahoo.com<br>
