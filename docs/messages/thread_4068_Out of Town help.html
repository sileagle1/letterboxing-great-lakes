and forgot.<br/>
<br/>
When you guys are going to a town you aren't familiar with to go <br/>
letterboxing how do you prepare?<br/>
<br/>
We didn't know the landmarks or streets and we had only a very crude <br/>
map with us out of the road atlas. We didn't have any problems per-say <br/>
with the Champaign Urbana area (perhaps because we only chose drive <br/>
bys). <br/>
<br/>
Do you mapquest everything? Google everything? How well do you plan <br/>
your trip and how do you do so.<br/>
<br/>
We found we were just flying by the seat of our pants as someone (uh <br/>
hmm . . . me) didn't do his "research" I guess I just didn't know where <br/>
to start my "research." <br/>
<br/>
We did, however, manage by the seat of our pants to find all the boxes <br/>
we were after -- thanks to my brilliant wife!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny you should ask that right now - we're in the midst of planning <br/>
several weekend trips, several in other states.  Two years ago when <br/>
we were planning a letterboxing trip, a boxer from Pennsylvania <br/>
(Lightin' Bug) asked us if we used the Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips <br/>
program.  He said that if we had it, he could email us a map of PA <br/>
with many of the boxes "pinned".  I did a little research on the <br/>
software package and then very soon thereafter bought a copy at Sam's <br/>
Club for about $25.  It's a great package, allowing us to zoom in to <br/>
print detail maps and pan out to print overview maps.  It includes <br/>
the entire world, but I think only the USA is extremely detailed.  <br/>
(However I have "pinned" all the boxes in Italy...)   When planning a <br/>
trip, we read the clues and first get to the right city, then can do <br/>
a "search" on an exact address, street names or even park names.  The <br/>
package will zoom right to the street or park you are looking for.  <br/>
We generally mark the start of a letterbox hunt with a blue <br/>
electronic pin (and label the pin with the box name), change it to a <br/>
blue flag if we find the box, change it to a red pin if we look for <br/>
it and can't find it.  We use purple flags for boxes we plant.  The <br/>
software also shows locations of restaurants and hotels and allows <br/>
you to put hyperlinks in your pin labels.  We have used it <br/>
EXTENSIVELY for all our letterboxing ever since we bought it.  (Oh <br/>
yeah, it also has the ability to put in GPS coordinates to locate a <br/>
point.)<br/>
<br/>
When we plan a trip, we usually creat a simple spreadsheet that lists <br/>
the box name, planter, number of boxes, and city for those we plan to <br/>
look for.  We add a column for an estimated hike time or distance (We <br/>
REALLY appreciate it when plnters include this info!). We also add a <br/>
column for what # find or plant the box is and a column for <br/>
comments.  That way we can note if maintenance is needed or anything <br/>
else we may wish to tell the planter when we send them an email about <br/>
the box status.  We organize this spreadsheet based on a route we <br/>
plan to travel and then print it out.  Our spreadsheet always include <br/>
a LOT more boxes than we ever can realistically find, but we figure <br/>
it is best to be prepared with a variety in case the weather is bad <br/>
or to adapt to our plans on that particular trip.<br/>
<br/>
We print out clues for all the boxes on our spreadsheet and then also <br/>
print several maps from the Streets &amp; Trips program.  Some maps are <br/>
an overview to show boxes in relation to each, some to show how to <br/>
get to the general box location from a major road, and some very <br/>
close in to show the details of the surrounding streets names.  We <br/>
staple the maps to the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Based on expereince, we have also found it very helpful to print <br/>
fairly detailed maps on how to get from one box to another!<br/>
<br/>
We then put the clues &amp; maps in a 3-ring binder in the same order as <br/>
our spreadsheet (which was organized by route). <br/>
<br/>
It's a lot of up front preparation, but that allows us to spend all <br/>
our time on the road actually out looking for boxes!<br/>

Well, I'm no expert... but for the upcoming Columbus thing... I've <br/>
searched for clues in all the surrounding areas and for clues within <br/>
real close proximity to all the roads we're travelling on there and <br/>
back.  I've printed copies of all the clues that interested me, <br/>
labeled and grouped them by location.   I've printed maps for all <br/>
those locations, both close up maps and zoomed out maps.  These maps <br/>
are all stapled to the individual clue sheets.  For any parks with <br/>
trail maps, I've printed those as well, and stapled them to the <br/>
clues.  For some, but not all of the boxes, I did Google's satellite <br/>
mapping to see an overview of the area and get some kind of visual of <br/>
the place.  Also, I ordered an Ohio state map, as well as a Columbus <br/>
area street map from AAA.  I think I may do some "X marks the spot" <br/>
markings on these larger maps to get a more overview of where all the <br/>
boxes I want to find  are located.<br/>
<br/>
There are some more mystery type boxes or boxes in which you really <br/>
have to know the area to figure out where you're going. You may have <br/>
to forget about those, if you don't have a local person with <br/>
you.  But, for a couple of those, I've tried googling keywords and <br/>
have figured out some of the locations.  So, I guess that depends on <br/>
what kind of info you have to start with.<br/>
<br/>
When I went to the Denver, Colorado area over Christmas, I did <br/>
similar things... not quite as much since I figured I'd have a <br/>
"local" with me at the time, so I didn't need as much mapping.  At <br/>
that time, I signed up for the rocky mountain LB yahoo group and <br/>
asked for advice/suggestions on "must find" boxes.   There are so <br/>
many boxes there and I had very little time to find them.  The people <br/>
on that group were very friendly and helpful.  I had several of their <br/>
suggestions all lined up.  Unfortunately, when I was there, they had <br/>
an uncharacteristic 24 feet or so of snow (ok, ok, so maybe it was 24 <br/>
inches... still a freaking lot of snow!).  So, we were only able to <br/>
find 1 box.  I have all the clues and stuff ready for next Christmas!, though!<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess my three main pieces of advice are... 1. Google is your <br/>
friend!  2.  Join the regional area Yahoo group and introduce <br/>
yourself, ask for suggestions.  And finally #3...Google is your best friend!<br/>

Microsoft Streets and Trips is software that I like.  I don't use it to it's<br/>
fullest tho, but it looks like it's chock full of stuff.  For planning for<br/>
going from town to town for boxes or even from one end of a city to another<br/>
for boxes, I think MS Streets &amp; Trips does a great job.<br/>
<br/>
I do map out from town to town, box to box, and keep the paperwork in order<br/>
of travel on a clipboard in the car, with a second copy in my backpack.  But<br/>
unfortunately, we're kinda flighty folks and often change things on a whim.<br/>
If we see a billboard with some historical site or such, we might decide to<br/>
take a sudden detour to go see it.  That might bring us in actually closer<br/>
to a box that *wasn't* next on our list.  So we'll quick have to rearrange<br/>
things.  So we map out everything in a general way but we don't get too<br/>
crazy about it because we know ourselves.  I don't think we've yet done<br/>
everything in the order we've set out to do it.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I also belong to AAA, so I stop in there and get any maps or books for the<br/>
cities I'm going to. And now AAA also has online trip planning.  I haven't<br/>
checked it out yet, tho, to see if it can be used the same way the MS<br/>
Streets &amp; Trips can be used as far as mapping from place to place to place<br/>
but from the mailing they sent me on it, it looks like it can be.<br/>
<br/>
If I don't know the area I'm going to, stopping at AAA also gives me info on<br/>
places to see in that area just in case I want to do something besides<br/>
letterboxing.  For example, we have a trip planned to Springfield for 3 days<br/>
at the end of July, but the main focus of the trip will actually be the<br/>
Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum with a little letterboxing on the<br/>
side.  If I didn't have AAA tho, probably everything could be found right on<br/>
the internet.  And I *do* do a lot on the interent.  AAA basically gives me<br/>
starting points of interest.  But then I always google everything to find<br/>
out hours, prices, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I also have an atlas that has detailed maps of the six surrounding counties<br/>
for when I'm not going *too* far out of town.<br/>
<br/>
When it's in my area or out of my area, I always google the particular<br/>
forest preserves we may be heading to.  A lot of them have taken to putting<br/>
some pretty darn good trail maps right online.  And actually, I've found<br/>
that a lot of the online maps are more detailed and up-to-date than the maps<br/>
one gets at the information kiosks and such at the preserve itself.   Any<br/>
recent changes in hours, any prices, etc. are generally all on the place's<br/>
website.  Things can change, and they'll change at the website right away,<br/>
but the change often won't show up in new brochures and maps until they've<br/>
run out of the old brochures and maps and thus have to print new ones.<br/>
<br/>
But the main love of my life is google earth.  It gives atlas type map view<br/>
and it gives satellite views, and it gives "hybrid" view which put the two<br/>
together.  It can be particularly great to print out for forest preserves<br/>
because in many cases, one can even see the smaller trails.  There was one<br/>
letterbox in Kane County that I could even see the "landmarks" in the forest<br/>
preserve on the map.   It can be zoomed in and zoomed out easily and has a<br/>
really nice range of zoom.  Generally.  Sometimes conditions are such that<br/>
it can't get a really really close satellite photo, but other times I can<br/>
practically read the license plates on the cars in a parking lot.  (OK,<br/>
that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it can give really good zoom if the<br/>
conditions are right.)  So I downloaded the google earth info and have the<br/>
icon right on my desktop and I never go searching without first clicking on<br/>
that and checking things out.<br/>
<br/>
usatf.com is also a good one to track out distance if it's a situation where<br/>
you can do that.  It's better actually for when I come back from a trip.  I<br/>
can map out the distance I actually walked and it will also show me the<br/>
elevations.  But a person needs to have a knowledge of where they're going<br/>
in the first place to be able to use it.  It's generally best after the<br/>
fact.  But, like google earth, it also gives atlas map views, satellite<br/>
views, and hybrid views.<br/>
<br/>
I also often stop in and check out Border's Books if I'm heading out of<br/>
town.  The one by me has a nice map section and will often have one map or<br/>

Subject: [LbGLK] Out of Town help<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Meant to ask this question last week after our trip to Champaign/Urbana<br/>
and forgot.<br/>
<br/>
When you guys are going to a town you aren't familiar with to go<br/>
letterboxing how do you prepare?<br/>
<br/>
We didn't know the landmarks or streets and we had only a very crude<br/>
map with us out of the road atlas. We didn't have any problems per-say<br/>
with the Champaign Urbana area (perhaps because we only chose drive<br/>
bys).<br/>
<br/>
Do you mapquest everything? Google everything? How well do you plan<br/>
your trip and how do you do so.<br/>
<br/>
We found we were just flying by the seat of our pants as someone (uh<br/>
hmm . . . me) didn't do his "research" I guess I just didn't know where<br/>
to start my "research."<br/>
<br/>
We did, however, manage by the seat of our pants to find all the boxes<br/>
we were after -- thanks to my brilliant wife!!!<br/>

came up with www.maps.google.com. It's very cool; I have been able to <br/>
push pin all my existing boxes (in 4 states, 1 out at sea, and bunches <br/>
in foreign countries)! I am in the process of push pinning all my <br/>
finds now. <br/>
<br/>
Very cool and free! It even has a mapping tool to connect the boxes. <br/>
Still learning, but worth checking out.<br/>
