                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was out at Lapham Peak today in Delafield and got a chance to check <br/>
on my Wasp In A Wig Series.  I am pleased to say that ALL 5 boxes are <br/>
intact and where I put them.  The clues are tricky.  They are meant to <br/>
be tricky.  You have to work to find them.  I made it that way.<br/>
<br/>
I have received numerous reports that the first box is missing and <br/>
therefore, they couldn't find the rest of the series.  Well, I am happy <br/>
to say, it is intact. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Jigsaw<br/>
