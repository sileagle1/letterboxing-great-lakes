need to add new logbooks to replace damaged or lost ones in 3 boxes.<br>

Sorry to hear of your bad luck and hopefully it won't prevent you from<br>
creating some new boxes - The Cottontails have fantastic stamps!<br>

to call my period of letterbox depression...2005. Yes, all of 2005 <br>
simply bummed me out. Most of my boxes were either: A) Taken by the <br>
Winnebago FP people... B) Not rehidden well by certain people and then <br>
found by animals/people or C) Lost by any other means. Though I did get <br>
three of them back from the FP office, I was still really annoyed with <br>
the concept of letterboxing. I honestly thought I wouldn't get back <br>
into it again. But look what the gathering has done to me! I'm totally <br>
loving the hobby again. :) Let me speak from experience...don't give <br>
up! Think of all the fun people have had hunting for your boxes! <br>
Recarve and replace! (I shouldn't talk...none of mine have been <br>
replaced...lol) You will get back in your groove soon enough. :)<br>
