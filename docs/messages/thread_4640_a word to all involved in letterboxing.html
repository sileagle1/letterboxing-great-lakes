to thank all of the people involved in making this hobby so wonderful.<br>
 I have found my hobby at last!! To all you great folks who carve the <br>
outstanding stamps, put the boxes together and carefully hide them, <br>
then post the great clues - THANK YOU!!!!! You've made this an <br>
outstanding spring, summer and fall for me. To all those who've <br>
answered my tons of questions- I thank you for all your help..<br>
I am anxiously watching for the warm weather , gathering my clues and <br>
mapping out where to go first- another awesome spring, summer and fall <br>
will find me in the wilderness- all thanks to you wonderful people..<br>
 THANKS FOR A GREAT SEASON!!! LOOKING FORWARD TO 2008...see you on the <br>
trails!!!!gemgirl65<br>
