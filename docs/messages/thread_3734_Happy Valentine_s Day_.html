I believe the snow fall at O'Hare was over 8 inches, but the drifting <br/>
is the big problem.<br/>

P.S.  We're early risers during the week since we go to the gym before we go to the office.  As a result we are often awake, dressed and have eaten breakfast before we sit watching out the window for it to be light enough to head out boxing for the day!  (Of course we only have this problem in the winter months with the limited daylight hours.)<br/>
