stamp and the only one that looked good was an image of 2 dragonflies <br>
intertwined together. So we became double dragon. I think if I would <br>
have waited and new that I was going to be into this for the log haul, <br>
I would pick Moon Elf, Elf Maiden or Artemis and my husband wanted to <br>
be the Reaper. I'm thinking of redoing our store bought stamp and <br>
getting back to my love of fantasy by carving 2 dragons intertwined. <br>
But we'll see.<br>
