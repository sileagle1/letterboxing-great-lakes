I know a lot of people are anxious to make travel plans for the <br>
gathering and I was wondering if we might be able to nail down a <br>
location soon?  "Detroit area" leaves the door pretty wide open as <br>
in Michigan anything east of Lansing that fits into a loose triangle <br>
between Ann Arbor, Detroit and Flint is dubbed the "Detroit" area.<br>
<br>
I think I saw in a previous message that you guys were going to try <br>
for something a bit SE of Detroit proper and wanted throw out a <br>
suggestion for Waterloo State Recreation area where we held the <br>
first GL Gathering.  It is a huge park that actually is spread out <br>
over several physical locations, many with miles of very nice <br>
trails -- opportunity for planting boxes is great!  There are <br>
several clean picnic shelters -- nice size with tables, grills, <br>
electricity and restrooms at the shelters.<br>
<br>
The location is convenient for those coming from other states as it <br>
is just a few minutes off I-94, about 1 hour from Detroit proper and <br>
1/2 hour from Ann Arbor and Jackson, so lodging should be plentiful. <br>
<br>
Just a suggestion...<br>

Forget not that the weekend of June 18th is a major NASCAR weekend <br>
in the Detroit area.  While I grant you that the race itself is down <br>
near Adrian in the Irish Hills section, I did a quick hotel search <br>
in Ann Arbor and came up basically with the big zippo as far as <br>
hotels go.  Jackson was pretty much the same.  I did not call about <br>
camping availability at Waterloo State Recreation Area, however its <br>
proximity and the fact that it's a direct shot down to Adrian might <br>
mean that they too are full up for that weekend.  I know I mentioned <br>
this once before to this group and was pretty much told that the <br>
gathering wouldn't be affected - I'm not sure that will truly be the <br>
case.  NASCAR weekends in Detroit have the same effect on hotel <br>
rooms as Notre Dame football weekends or graduation weekend in South <br>
Bend - hotels can and will charge "rack rate".<br>
<br>
NASCAR expanded that weekend's race schedule and added a race, so it <br>
may indeed impact the event.<br>

This is being worked on behind the scenes quite avidly although you <br>
may not see it yet.  TJMich, Team Rabbit, and ChiclidGuy have been <br>
scouting out parks for the last few weeks and should arrive at a <br>
location soon.<br>

Funny, I just entered the season schedule in my calendar for dh!  Traffic will be challenging <br>
- I have taken the back roads from NE Indiana through the Irish Hills to Dearborn, and all I <br>
can say is "get on the road EARLY in the morning."  <br>
<br>

<br>
Been there, done that too!<br>
<br>
I am hoping to come to this gathering, but it's still too early for me to commit without dh's <br>
summer schedule.<br>

are all other areas to look at for lodging.  And unless I've been away from home too long (yes), you probably won't have to worry about the stupendous drawing power of the Detroit Tigers and its impact on lodging.  Now the Strawberry Festival in Belleville is another matter (grin).  <br>
 <br>
And just to throw another log on a fire I'm not around to enjoy, there's also Proud Lake Campgrounds in the Walled Lake area.  And EVERYONE knows how cool Walled Lake is.  The bottom line is, no matter how much I love Southeast Michigan, it's not THAT much of a tourist area, and getting someplace to sleep should be fairly easy.<br>

DH and I will be at the June race weekend - though I'll admit we <br>
usually stay in the Toledo area - that way we're close to Cedar <br>
Point too!<br>
<br>
Ditto on the traffic suggestion though - traffic around the track is <br>
very well controlled, and someone deciding to take the scenic route <br>
through that area may end up in one of the race track's parking lots <br>
whether they want to or not.<br>
