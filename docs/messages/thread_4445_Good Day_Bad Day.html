                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, today I drove to Muscatine & Iowa City for work. While on this <br>
trek I decided to stop and check on my "Archie's Chair" box <br>
(mentioned in a previous post as having the most hits for the clues <br>
than any other box of mine).<br>
<br>
Well, Archie's Chair is missing :-(<br>
<br>
I will re-carve and re-place someday (as it's not every day that I <br>
get out there).<br>
<br>
On a better note;<br>
<br>
1) Goose Chaser's Underground RR is still going strong and in place :-<br>
)<br>
<br>
2) after a few people attempted Fisherman's Corner North and a tree <br>
falling and blocking the path to Campbell's Island, I received notice <br>
that Growly found them (and a few others). So, everything is <br>
there . . . you just have to work at some bushwacking to get to them.<br>
<br>
Oh, don't know if I mentioned on this board or not that my "Quoth the <br>
Raven . . " stamp an animal ate the head off the raven? Well, an <br>
animal did, you can still stamp in and get the body and beak of the <br>
bird. I will re-carve that one as well and get it back in place.<br>
