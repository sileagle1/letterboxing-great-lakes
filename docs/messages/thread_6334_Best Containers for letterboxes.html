I only use lock-n-locks - they are the best choice by far. Wal-mart no longer carries them, but they have them online, at some grocery stores and on the QVC shopping network. I bought my most receive L-n-L's at Hy-Vee. Good luck and happy planting!<br/>

There is a 6oz one that I like and I believe that is the smallest. Some have been able to fit the smallest of hitchhikers in those.  <br/>

  And now for something different....<br/>
  We have been using LnL's for some time and like them, but they are a bit pricey.  I've always liked the idea of a screwtop container as the seal would be pretty secure, easy to use, and weathertight.  But... where to find one that's large enough and is inexpensive?  <br/>
  Well, I just got back from the hardware store, and as I was walking down the housewares aisle to get to the hardware section I spotted plastic storeage tops for Mason jars.  Eight of the wide mouth tops were $6.99.  They wouldn't rust or corrode and a pint wide mouth might be a pretty good size for a LB.  Yes, I know they're glass, but how many times have have you seen a really old, unbroken beer bottle out in the middle of nowhere?  Sure, there are broken ones too, but if some can last out in the open and unprotected for years, how long might one survive in a safe place?  Of course I wouldn't recommend using one where the clues use that hateful phrase, "Look under the rock."<br/>
  Just a thought...<br/>

Before I found out LnLs are carried at Meijer, a couple of the containers I used were the screw top lids.  They are still in use.  I think they are from Ziplock and they are meant for soup.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe in March, I'll go check to see how they are holding up.  The last finds were in November.  No complaints then, but there was no snow too.    <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Something that I don't think has ever been mentioned, but when closing Lock'n'lock (or similar) type boxes, you should always close opposite sides together (i.e., both long flaps, then both short flaps, rather than one at a time going around the circumference of the box).  It prevents torquing, bending, and misaligning the lids.  (I actually learned this little tidbit through my day job...we use super heavy duty boxes with similar latches as anaerobic chambers, and that's what the instructions say to do.)<br/>
