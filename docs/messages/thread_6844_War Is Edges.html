                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, this is my LAST plea/urging/suggestion/rousing for those of you who <br/>
have not joined the Sidewagers game.  I got a decent response from my <br/>
last email and we now have 31 players.<br/>
<br/>
The game starts on the 1st with BINGO.  No entry fees, no complex cards, <br/>
nothing to mail....just (1) pick the date you think the full card on the <br/>
BINGO game will be called and then (2) email me that date along with <br/>
your trail name!<br/>
<br/>
There are still plenty of open February dates to choose from! (and some <br/>
in March, April, May, and even June!)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to everyone on the Bingo and Sidewagers games.   I hope all <br/>
your letterboxing wishes/goals come true for 2011.<br/>
