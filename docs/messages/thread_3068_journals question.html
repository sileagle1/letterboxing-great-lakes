the very least, I include a copy of the clues (which includes the name of<br>
the box), the cardstock with the stamp image on it, the date I found it, and<br>
a map.  At first I was putting all the hitchhikers on one separate page but<br>
when that page got full, now I just put the HH stamp image on the same page<br>
as the box I found it in.<br>
<br>
Then I keep a little index on my computer and printed out listing each box's<br>
page in the scrapbook so that I can find the page quickly if I need to.<br>
<br>
I've seen other boxers, tho, who merely have a book or artist pad they carry<br>

the stamp images.  But that's soooo not *my* style.  :-)<br>

I look forward to the day when we will be at the same place at the same time and I can see your work.  Might you be willing to scan a few pages and post them in the photos section for us to see -- of course, if you do, be sure that you check with the box owner first to make sure it is okay to post the box stamp image.  Would love a little peek ;-)<br>

   <br>
  We always make 2 copies of the stamp. One goes into scrapbook pages doing exactly what you posted. It will have the clues, date found, stamp, journaling, pictures, etc. I rarely seem to keep it to 2 pages but that is my goal.  :) The second copy goes into our 'logbook'. It is basically just a large spiral artist pad that holds 2 stamps (average size) per page. Above or below the stamped image I write the name of the box and the date found. <br>
   <br>
  When it comes to exchanges when there is time I ask for 2 copies so I can scrapbook pages of the gatherings along with all the different stamps and still put a copy in our logbook. If there is not enough time than I just scrapbook the exchanged images. I'm considering photocopying the images for our logbook or just leaving them out of the logbook altogether.<br>
   <br>
  Hope that helps. Remember to do what you want to do. <br>
   <br>
  Oh one thing I've found since I don't stamp onto the clue pages is to write the box name and date off to the side of the image so if you're scrapbooking them weeks or months later it's a quick reference. Comes in handy when you have a great finding day and putting the image with the box name.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">No, I don't go to gatherings.  I kinda have mixed feelings about gatherings<br>
because I really really love the secretive nature of letterboxing.  That's<br>
part of the fun for me.  I'm not really sure I want to know what everybody<br>
else looks like, talks like, etc.  But I've never really had to think about<br>
it all that much because I work Saturdays anyway and it seems like all<br>
gatherings are held on Saturdays.  I don't know if I'd bring my scrapbooks.<br>
I could just see me having to tote a scrapbook into the bathroom at a rest<br>
stop when I stopped for a pit call because I'm so paranoid it might get<br>
stolen out of the van.  :-)  But actually I probably would do just that if I<br>
did ever go to a gathering.<br>
<br>
My scrapbook pages are really too big for my scanner but the next time I<br>
borrow my sister's digital camera, I can take a few photos and post them as<br>
photos.  I can either do some of the pages that don't necessarily include<br>
the stamp image or I can cover the stamp image if I can't get hold of the<br>
placer.<br>
<br>
I have fun with it.  When I get some spare money, I go over to Archiver's or<br>
Creative Scrapbooking and get some little embellishments and stuff.  Instead<br>
of the usual white scrapbook pages, I'll often cover the white page with<br>
"outdoor" themed paper or "seasonal" themed paper.  Or I'll do a watercolor<br>
background myself and use that as the backing page.  When I think about it,<br>
I probably often spend as much time (or more)on scrapbooking a find as I do<br>
on the search itself.  And my letterboxing scrapbooks are really quite<br>
simple.  Nothing fancy.  Some folks who are into scrapbooking are really<br>
INTO scrapbooking.  And make me look very elementary.  So it's really kinda<br>
nutty, I know.  I've been told that scrapbook folks ARE nutty.  But I'm not<br>
a "scrapbook folk"!  I swear I'm not.<br>

Mosey, do you take your scrapbook/logbook to gatherings?  I look forward to<br>
the day when we will be at the same place at the same time and I can see<br>
your work.  Might you be willing to scan a few pages and post them in the<br>
photos section for us to see -- of course, if you do, be sure that you check<br>
with the box owner first to make sure it is okay to post the box stamp<br>
image.  Would love a little peek ;-)<br>
