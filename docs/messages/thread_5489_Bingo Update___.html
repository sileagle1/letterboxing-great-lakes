have your dauber ready?  Have you read the FAQ?  If you have any<br>
questions about the game, please feel free to throw them out to the<br>
list -- somebody else may be wondering the same thing.<br>
<br>
I currently have 59 Bingo cards in my hands.  Since this is everyone<br>
who is showing in the database and today is the deadline, I am<br>
assuming nothing is floating around in the mail and this is the final<br>
group.  However, if you did mail last minute and have not gotten<br>
around to adding yourself to the database, please drop me an e-mail to<br>
let me know your card is still on the way.<br>
<br>
If there is anyone else who has just been so busy with the holidays<br>
and has all of a sudden realized the Bingo due date is upon us and<br>
still wants to join in the fun, please e-mail me TODAY and we will see<br>
what we can work out.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all the cool stuff sent in -- it's going to be a<br>
great round of Great Lakes LB Bingo!<br>
