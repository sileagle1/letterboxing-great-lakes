WooHoo! i have that one and it completes my G's.  ( hint, hint, Spring <br>
Chick ;}  ).   O's are my big gap, so i prob have no hope of the <br>
perimeter.   <br>
<br>
PPE  racing toward that 3rd place...<br>
<br>
PS Spring is definitely near, I have some crocuses blooming, tulips and <br>
daffodils coming up   And those early morning birds woke me up this <br>
morning.  I'm not used to hearing them yet, so i was unable to sleep <br>
through them.  (I am not a morning person.)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here in Urbana the signs of spring are all around.  The morning birds have been quite noisy for several weeks (I know since I walk the dogs around 5:30am...I AM a morning person).  The neighbor's snowdrops have been up for at least two weeks and our tulips are all poking through the ground.  Even the grass is starting to green up and poking through the straw in the back yard.  And most important, I'm starting to go off my coacoa (don't know what it is, since it doesn't seem to be dependent on temperature, but every spring I just suddenly have no desire for my morning coacoa).  Daytime temps have been above 40 for the last week and a half and lows haven't dipped below the mid-20's for at least that long.  Now if we could only get all of this and NOT have mud...that would be perfect!<br>

I'm in Springfield, IL.   and i  too wish we could get to spring <br>
without all the mud.  we end up with a load of towels/rags at least <br>
every other day from wiping the dogs paws off.   Somehow i can't quite <br>
get them trained to do it on their own.  The older one will hand you <br>
her front paws one at a time.   They just finished eating and are <br>
demanding to go out again.<br>
<br>
Oh well, wont be too long and i'll be complaining it's too hot. <br>
