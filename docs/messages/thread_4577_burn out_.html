                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too notice my interests tend to run in cycles, usually lasting about 2 years or so.  In my case, the chronology ran from rubber art stamping to altered books to ATCs to letterboxing (though Lbing actually came from GS sources...).  I find the stamp carving is what really hooked me.  And fortunately the various branches of letterboxing..."Wild", Postal (which I think of more as mail art), and "Live" (aka gatherings and events) has given me enough outlet for carving to keep me interested in all three.  Interest ebbs and flows between the three types.  Wild gives the most thrill, but is the one I have the least time for, so I haven't burned out on it yet; I was doing a lot of postal but had to step back for a while for just that reason.  And thanks to folks like the Atomic Beans who don't mind a few gazillion stamps appearing at events, I keep my Carving Jones under control.<br/>

Wow...I don't know where all that rambling came from, but just wanted to let you know Hx6 (I always read it as "times", though I also read "ol-SENT-rio"), I feel your pain!<br/>

Hart, just let things go with the flow.  If you feel a need to take a <br/>
break from carving for awhile, go for it and then return in a month or <br/>
two with renewed enthusiasm.  Atom and I have had to step back from our <br/>
outdoor letterboxing, partially due to the LB wedding, the actual <br/>
wedding, and just work/life in general.  In fact, we haven't found a <br/>
single box in the wild since the Wild Goose Chase, which is definitely <br/>
the longest we have gone without boxing since we started almost two <br/>
years ago. :(  But at least try to keep up with the boards, and you'll <br/>
be inspired again before you know it! :)<br/>

<br/>
  It was so nice to meet you last weekend at the wedding. You are not alone in your feelings about this hobby.  I think for those of us who are exposed to letterboxing and really love it, it is easy to jump in with both feet and soon find you are in over your head.  <br/>
  Finding my first box was such a rush I couldn't wait to find out what was out there. ( You mean I can stay at home during the winter and have boxes mailed to me?   Rings?  What are rings? Wow! I want to be in all ten of those new rings!)  I found myself on a first name basis with my local postal workers and forgot what my family looked like!<br/>
<br/>
  I also had a rough spell where all my boxes were vandalized within a week. After the first two boxes went missing I realized it wasn't  just a coincidence and didn't get to my other locations fast enough...they were gone. I stopped carving for awhile because it seemed like a lot of time and effort to put into something that someone took delight in destroying. <br/>
<br/>
  So I gave it a few months and just went out to find a box every now and then or went boxing when we went on a vacation.  I evaluated what aspects of the hobby I really liked the best and let the rest fall by the wayside.  I stopped doing postals, I don't do personnal travelers,  I don't even pick up all the hitchhikers I see. In fact I realized last weekend that I love going to the gatherings to see the people and do exchanges so i can put a face to a stamp/trail name.  But I really don't care so much about stamping in to all the boxes at the gatherings. I think I would actually rather sit and chat to the people because they are all so interesting. What I really love are the hikes and where the letterboxes take me. I enjoy planting a box here and there but carving just isn't my passion like it is for Funguswoman.  <br/>
<br/>
  Just take a step back and relax. When the time is right, you will know where your limits need to be and you will feel the joy of the find just like you did when you first started..<br/>
