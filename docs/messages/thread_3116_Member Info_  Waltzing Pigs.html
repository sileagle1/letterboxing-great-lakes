<br/>
Our family trail name is the Waltzing Pigs; individually we are <br/>
BirdWoman (I enjoy bird watchingwhich is a great cover when out in <br/>
the woods), Money Man (my husband's job), Do-Re-Mi Gal (my daughter <br/>
the violinist), and Ball Magnet (my son's nickname one baseball <br/>
season when he kept getting beaned by the ball).  We chose Waltzing <br/>
Pigs as family name because it is a play on our last name andat the <br/>
time we chose the namewe had a guinea pig who was part of the <br/>
family and that was our way of including him/her (we never did <br/>
figure the gender out).  <br/>
<br/>
We started letterboxing in the summer of 2004.  We read an article <br/>
about letterboxing in Ranger Ricka kid's nature magazineand <br/>
thought it sounded really fun.  Being a borderline obsessive-<br/>
compulsive person who has to do things the "right way" (I think that <br/>
comes with the territory of being a critical-care nurse), I went <br/>
directly to the Web site to see how things were done.  We used an <br/>
exacto-knife to carve some pretty crude stamps out of white erasers <br/>
and stapled some paper together to make our first journals.  And <br/>
then the kids and I were off to search for our first letterbox one <br/>
fine summer day.  We had a great time looking for Cars on a Stick, <br/>
even though we never actually found the box.  Time went by and we <br/>
decided to try another boxSUCCESS!  Our first find <br/>
was "Architectural Mystery".  Then we spent a nice fall afternoon <br/>
hunting down a bunch of boxes by FungusWoman (and finding a <br/>
hitchhiker) and we were hooked.  OK, I am more hooked than the rest <br/>
of them but we do all enjoy getting out together and seeing places <br/>
we never would have thought to go toand finding stamps to boot.<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I have found a little over 200 boxesMoney Man lags a <br/>
little behind because he has to work and make the money while we go <br/>
on our little outings.  We started placing boxes about a year ago <br/>
and have placed around 15 boxes.  We've enjoyed meeting fellow <br/>
boxers on the trails and at the 2 gatherings we have attended.  It's <br/>
been fun seeing new and unfamiliar stamps in logbooks as more people <br/>
take up this hobby/obsessionhope to meet more of you out there.<br/>
