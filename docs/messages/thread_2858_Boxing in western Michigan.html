                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, thank you, thank you to Mrs. Doglvrs for spending a wonderful<br>
Friday with me, helping me do some Power Boxing in the Holland-Hudsonville<br>
area of Michigan.  With time being at a premium, I must admit I forewarned<br>
her I was looking for quantity and wasn't above being guided in the right<br>
direction <sheepish grin!>.  I managed to nab around 21 before my cell phone<br>
hailed me back to the "real" world of my Noxer husband, daughter, and hosts<br>
(don't worry, Mrs. - my husband was the only one who considered me RUDE! The<br>
rest didn't care.).  It was a great day!<br>
<br>
I must admit, I could feel the aura of the area, as I traveled in and around<br>
the home bases of so many regionally famous boxers....  If only I had more<br>
time....<br>
