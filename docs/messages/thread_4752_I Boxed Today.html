                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today for work I had a stop in Oregon, Illinois. The last time I had <br/>
a stop in Oregon was November 16th and I found Pastor Wife's "John <br/>
Deere Plow II" after dark during hunting season!! <br/>
<br/>
Today with a forcast of 9-14 inches of snow I raced out there hoping <br/>
to beat the snow... I got there 5 minutes after the snow started <br/>
falling in HUGE flakes so thick it was hard to see anything.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't park at the correct picnic shelter as the road was closed <br/>
off... so I had to walk an extra 3/10's of a mile (just a guess on <br/>
that number).<br/>
<br/>
The snow on the ground from the previous storm was still 3-5 inches <br/>
deep and I clammered and clawed my way down the path.<br/>
<br/>
We had rain fall this afternoon before the snow so it was all a <br/>
sloppy, slushy mess with some puddles and ponds of collected water on <br/>
the pathway.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to find my prize with a bonus of a HH inside!! This is my <br/>
first Trail Rider stamp and its a beauty!! Thanks TR for the <br/>
wonderful find in a great park.<br/>
<br/>
As I walked back, re-tracing my footsteps back to my car became <br/>
difficult as they were already filling back up with the snow that was <br/>
falling.<br/>
<br/>
My socks are still drying out, but it was worth it! Chalk this up to <br/>
my ideal lunch break.<br/>
<br/>
I did drive past White Pines State Park but by now the snow was even <br/>
worse . . . not to mention I already took my lunch break, so <br/>
Wisconsin Hiker, your stamp will have to wait :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Trail Rider for the great excursion!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like quite the lunchtime adventure!  In the past we've also enjoyed a<br/>
bit of letterboxing during our lunch break, if there are boxes near our<br/>
offices.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping we can get out on Saturday, but I just checked the weather and<br/>
they are now predicting even higher amounts of snow - up to 20" in some<br/>
areas!!!!!  We'll see what really happens; there's not much yet....<br/>
