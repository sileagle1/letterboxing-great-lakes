and getting weaker<br>
<br>
So we finally got past that string of "special words" (I have none of <br>
those) and get a "regular" word..... and its one i don't have. :{  <br>
<br>
That's ok, my words will start popping up again soon..... ( I hope)<br>
<br>
In the meantime, i noticed there is a new box in my area.... maybe it <br>
will be warm enough to go get it this weekend.  That should console <br>
me for a bit. (boxes in my area are few and far between.)  I'm even <br>
more excited that there apears to be another/new boxer here. Before <br>
this i only knew of 2 and one had pretty much retired from boxing.  <br>
The other was new like myself.  <br>
<br>
so, one to find and 2 to plant.... Maybe i will take Bingo Dauber <br>
with me so she won't be so lonely.<br>
