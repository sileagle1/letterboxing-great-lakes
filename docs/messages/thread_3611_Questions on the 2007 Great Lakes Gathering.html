fellow letterboxers at Campground 1 (this is the one<br/>
that allows dogs), there are still sites available. <br/>
As of this morning, it looks like there are 2 sites<br/>
left in Row M, and several sites in Row J (J32 - J40)<br/>
which are close to Row M.  <br/>
<br/>
To reserve a site, visit<br/>
http://www.ohiodnr.com/parks/parks/alum.htm  <br/>
<br/>
You can reserve your site online, or by calling their<br/>
1-866 number.  You will have to reserve 2 nights<br/>
(either Friday &amp; Saturday or Saturday &amp; Sunday).  The<br/>
total for the 2 nights will be $62.  <br/>
<br/>
Once you reserve your site, add an entry to the GLG<br/>
2007 Camping Database (located at our Yahoo Groups<br/>
page under databases) to let everyone know where we<br/>
can find you at the campground.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>

You may want to check the maps in the Files section of the message <br/>
board (in the &gt; Gatherings &gt; 2007 Great Lakes Gathering folder).  <br/>
There is a map of the park and the campground.  If you want to stay <br/>
near many of the other people attending the event, you might want to <br/>
reserve a site in the J32-J40 range.  You can find out where everyone <br/>
else is camping by looking in the Database section of the message <br/>
board.  Here you can see a list of people who have already reserved a <br/>
campsite (or hotel).<br/>
<br/>
Check back on the old messages to find out how to reserve a site <br/>
either via the Internet or phone.  I think Deedle &amp; Doodle posted the <br/>
info.<br/>

  Sorry the story isn't all that great. My buddies last name is Oster and when <br/>
  we first met he gave me his Email address -- OsterToaster. So, when coming <br/>
  up with a trail name for him, his wife and son it was a given. :-)<br/>
