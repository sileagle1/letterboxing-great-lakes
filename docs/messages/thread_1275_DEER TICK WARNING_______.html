                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone!<br/>
I hate to add to the fear factor of TICKS but my daughter got bit<br/>
Letterboxing last summer at Saugatuck Dunes State Park.<br/>
Gee, almost a year later now and she has some illness that we cannot<br/>
diagnose. After several trips to the Dr and blood test after blood<br/>
test, we are getting scared.<br/>
Here is some truly frightening case histories of children who<br/>
developed Lyme Disease, most without ever knowing they had a tick,<br/>
rash, etc.<br/>
WARNING: LONG AND SCARY, MODERARTORS PLEASE DELETE THIS THING IF YOU<br/>
FEEL IT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS FORUM OR TOO LARGE!<br/>
<br/>
In June of 1982, a seven year old boy with a three day history of<br/>
severe headaches who was sleeping twenty-four hours a day, no fever,<br/>
recalls a tick bite three months prior to that, had a rash, no<br/>
diagnosis was made. When seen in June, he had papilledema, a CSF<br/>
opening pressure of 450 mm of water. He was assumed to have a<br/>
pseudotumor, given Decadron and lost to follow-up. In January of 1983,<br/>
he developed arthritis and was treated with antibiotics by mouth along<br/>
with NSAIDS. He returned in 1985 because of a chronic headache that<br/>
had been going on for two years. He had an entirely normal neurologic<br/>
examination; no papilledema. Lyme titer at that time was 1:256. He had<br/>
an elevated CSF pressure of 250 with no cells. He was given a fourteen<br/>
day course of aqueous penicillin intravenously. During the course of<br/>
the treatment, his headache went away and eventually he had no more<br/>
bouts of arthritis. So in 1985, we were able to successfully treat a<br/>
patient who had obviously been ill for three years with the diagnosis<br/>
being missed in 1982 when he had the tick bite and the rash. Keep in<br/>
mind that at the time he was seen in 1982, he was given steroids.<br/>
<br/>
In 1983, an eleven year old boy with a history of ECM rash two months<br/>
prior to being seen. Chief complaint when he was seen was severe pain<br/>
in both thighs. Within a few days he developed a facial palsy and then<br/>
a bilateral facial palsy. He had brisk reflexes and up-going toes.<br/>
Spinal fluid revealed 300 white cells and an elevated protein of 81.<br/>
He was started on intravenous penicillin and was treated for fourteen<br/>
days. There was a dramatic improvement with complete resolution of the<br/>
facial palsy. There was no more pain. His reflexes were all<br/>
physiologic. His Lyme titer was weakly positive. At that time, it took<br/>
more than seven weeks to get a Lyme titer and he was treated before<br/>
the results were available because he was so ill.<br/>
<br/>
In 1984, a ten year old boy had a sudden onset of headache with fever.<br/>
He recalls no tick bite or rash. Examination was unremarkable. There<br/>
was no papilledema. Spinal fluid: opening pressure was 190, only 7<br/>
cells. Lyme titer was sent to the State laboratory. Seven weeks later,<br/>
the results were available. His titer was 1:2048. He was readmitted to<br/>
the hospital. This time, spinal fluid white count was 100 cells. He<br/>
was given aqueous penicillin for fourteen days with a dramatic<br/>
improvement. Headache went away. Eventually, his Lyme titer was 1:64.<br/>
He occasionally complains of knee pain but is otherwise doing well.<br/>
During the weeks that we waited for his Lyme titer results, he was ill<br/>
with a very, very severe headache.<br/>
<br/>
A nine year old girl had a complaint of progressive weakness of her<br/>
extremities following a flu-like illness. She was seen in May of 1988.<br/>
She had been sick almost two months by then. Her examination revealed<br/>
a girl who had to hold on to the wall as she walked into the office<br/>
because she was so weak. She had the clinical diagnosis of the<br/>
Guillain Barre Syndrome. She had absent deep tendon reflexes and<br/>
weakness. Her spinal fluid protein was 80. Her Lyme titer was 1:128.<br/>
She was given intravenous ceftriaxone, 2 grams a day for fourteen days<br/>
with gradual improvement and by November of 1988 she was, again, fully<br/>
active, participating in everything with no weakness and no complaints<br/>
but still had absent deep tendon reflexes. She lived in an area where<br/>
there were many ticks.<br/>
<br/>
A five year old boy had a two year history of weakness and arthralgia<br/>
and fatigue. He was seen initially in June of 1988. He had been bitten<br/>
by a tick in February of 1986. Following that bite, he developed<br/>
fever, joint pain, abdominal pain, rashes. Following that, he<br/>
developed weakness, more so on the right than on the left and, indeed,<br/>
did have a very mild right hemiparesis. The weakness became more<br/>
progressive and eventually, at his mother's insistence, not the<br/>
physician's, a Lyme titer was done which was 1:1024. He was given a<br/>
course of ceftriaxone and then had to be retreated with another course<br/>
so he received a total of twenty-eight days. He finished his treatment<br/>
in the summer of 1988 and by December the was able to run, climb up<br/>
and down stairs and climb up onto an examining table. He still had<br/>
hypoactive reflexes but his strength had returned and he was<br/>
considerably better.<br/>
<br/>
A two year old little girl whose parents felt she had become<br/>
excessively irritable was seen. She had a diaper rash that responded<br/>
to no treatment that the pediatrician had prescribed. Because of her<br/>
exposure to field mice and the fact that they do carry the tick, her<br/>
parents insisted on a Lyme titer which was positive - 1:512. Because<br/>
she was irritable and because of the persistent rash, she was given<br/>
fourteen days of ceftriaxone with dramatic improvement in her<br/>
behavior. The rash cleared and never returned.<br/>
<br/>
A six year old girl was seen in September, 1987 with a very mild left<br/>
facial weakness. She does not recall a tick bite but had exposure to<br/>
ticks. She lives in a wooded area. Her Lyme titer was positive -<br/>
1:128. Her spinal fluid protein was 137 mgs. with no cells and a<br/>
glucose of 63. Because of the mild left facial weakness and also<br/>
headache, she was treated for Lyme and responded and did well. She<br/>
received two courses of treatment for a total of twenty-eight days of<br/>
ceftriaxone.<br/>
<br/>
A sixteen year old boy who woke up with bilateral facial palsy was<br/>
seen. He was unable to talk and unable to eat. Also had headache. He<br/>
had been bitten by ticks. Lyme titer was 1:128. He was given<br/>
twenty-one days of intravenous ceftriaxone with a dramatic improvement<br/>
and an unremarkable neurologic examination four weeks after the<br/>
initiation of the treatment. In addition to the ceftriaxone, he was<br/>
also given Prednisone.<br/>
<br/>
A nine year old girl was seen in 1985 initially complaining of<br/>
headache, joint pain and photophobia. Spinal fluid: opening pressure<br/>
was 230, 13 cells and a protein of 50. Titer was 1:256. Treated<br/>
initially with aqueous penicillin. Retreated with ceftriaxone. Has<br/>
been treated again in 1986, 1987 and 1988. She has persistently<br/>
abnormal electroencephalograms and a significant fall-off in school<br/>
performance. She now requires remedial help. She continues to have<br/>
occasional headaches and joint pain. She continues to have abnormal<br/>
EEG's and a persistently positive Lyme titer - 1:256. She will<br/>
probably require more treatment.<br/>
<br/>
A twelve year old boy was seen initially in 1987 for headache.<br/>
Extensive work-up was done including a spinal tap, EEG and CAT Scan,<br/>
all of which were normal. Lyme titer was done and was negative. It was<br/>
elected not to treat him for Lyme because he had nothing else other<br/>
than the headache and the titer was negative. This was unfortunate.<br/>
During the course of that year, his performance in school fell off. He<br/>
had been an exceptionally good student. By the following summer, he<br/>
had a repeat Lyme titer which was 1:256. His examination was<br/>
unremarkable. He was given intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks and<br/>
responded. During the course of the next year, he did better in school<br/>
but by the end of the school year he was, again, complaining of<br/>
headache. Now he also developed severe chest pain and diffuse myalgia.<br/>
He, again, had a positive Lyme titer of 1:256 and his Borrelia urine<br/>
antigen was also significantly elevated. He was then put in the<br/>
hospital and placed on a continuous infusion of aqueous penicillin to<br/>
be treated for twenty-eight days. After about the fifth or sixth day,<br/>
his symptoms began to improve and the chest pain went away and he no<br/>
longer has a headache.<br/>
<br/>
A fourteen year old boy was seen who had a headache for two weeks and<br/>
then developed double vision but no more headache. On examination, he<br/>
only had a mild sixth nerve palsy on the left. Again, denied any<br/>
headache and said he felt well but was concerned about the double<br/>
vision. His Lyme titer was 1:512. His spinal fluid revealed 700<br/>
lymphocytes. He was started on ceftriaxone and treated for twenty-one<br/>
days with complete resolution of the double vision and he has done<br/>
well since then.<br/>
<br/>
A nine year old girl complained of headache. On examination, she was<br/>
found to have papilledema. CAT Scan was normal. Spinal tap revealed<br/>
opening pressure of 280. She was started on steroids and Diamox. Lyme<br/>
titer was positive - 1:128 after being negative twice a few weeks<br/>
before when she first developed the headache. She was placed on<br/>
intravenous ceftriaxone and is now being treated to complete a<br/>
twenty-one day course. She has had some loss of vision in her left eye<br/>
but her papilledema is resolving.<br/>
<br/>
A thirteen year old girl was developing progressive weakness of the<br/>
lower extremities with mild spasticity and brisk reflexes, back pain<br/>
and headache as well as mood swings and depression. Again, at the<br/>
parents' insistence, a titer was done which was positive - 1:256. It<br/>
has been persistently positive. CSF titer was positive - 1:512. This<br/>
girl has been treated now three times, initially with ceftriaxone for<br/>
two courses, fourteen days each, and then a course of cefotaxime,<br/>
twenty-one days. There has been some modest improvement but she still<br/>
complains of weakness and still has brisk reflexes and probably will<br/>
require further treatment.<br/>
<br/>
A twenty month old boy was bitten by a tick on the right buttock.<br/>
Within forty-eight hours, had a classic EM rash. He was seen by an<br/>
infectious disease physician who indicated to the mother that this was<br/>
classic for Lyme. He started the child on Amoxil by mouth. Forty-eight<br/>
hours later, the patient developed fever and a febrile convulsion and<br/>
became very irritable and looked pale. He was admitted to the<br/>
hospital. Spinal fluid revealed normal opening pressure, 6 cells,<br/>
cultures negative. Peripheral white count was normal except for a<br/>
shift to the right. Sedimentation was normal. ELISA, at that time, was<br/>
positive as was the IFA. The IFA was 1:128. The ELISA was 1.23. These<br/>
titers were obtained less than two weeks after the patient became ill.<br/>
Patient was started on intravenous Rocephin and is now in the process<br/>
of being treated. He is slowly responding but continues to be irritable.<br/>
<br/>
A college senior first became ill with Lyme disease at the age of<br/>
about 15. She had numerous courses of treatment because of severe<br/>
headache, arthralgia, rashes, weight gain, weakly positive Lyme titer<br/>
and ultimately began to do better following about four courses of<br/>
intravenous antibiotics. She was placed on Suprax, then ERYC by mouth<br/>
and went to college. She did well and had an excellent year in school<br/>
with only occasional complaints of some headache. That summer she<br/>
developed sudden onset of a peroneal palsy, had a foot drop while<br/>
driving the car. She was admitted to the hospital where here work-up<br/>
revealed normal CBC and Chemistry Battery and Sed Rate but now she had<br/>
a definitely positive Lyme titer, higher than the titers had been<br/>
before and, in addition to this, had cells in her spinal fluid. She<br/>
was started back on intravenous Rocephin and within forty-eight hours,<br/>
the peroneal palsy began to improve and she completed a course of<br/>
intravenous antibiotics for approximately six weeks and then went back<br/>
on medication by mouth and is now, again, doing well.<br/>
<br/>
A six year old girl was diagnosed initially as having Juvenile<br/>
Rheumatoid Arthritis and was treated with medication for the arthritis<br/>
and developed headache, abdominal pain and chest pain. The abdominal<br/>
pain was thought to be due to a gastritis from all the aspirin she was<br/>
taking. Her Lyme titers at that time were positive. She was started on<br/>
Rocephin given, at that time, only a fourteen day course but then had<br/>
another course for twenty-one days on Claforan. After that, she seemed<br/>
well but one year later developed optic neuritis and arthralgia and<br/>
chest pain. She required another course of treatment and was also<br/>
given steroids. Her vision returned and she then relapsed again and<br/>
required a much longer course of treatment. Following the longer<br/>
course of treatment during which time she received intravenous<br/>
Claforan, she gradually improved. Her visual acuity went back to<br/>
20/20. She was essentially asymptomatic and doing so well that she was<br/>
able to do cartwheels. She felt fine and then relapsed again about six<br/>
months later with, again, a complaint of vision loss, headache and<br/>
some joint pain. At that time, she had an abnormal VERS, a weakly<br/>
positive Lyme titer. Her optic discs were slightly swollen. Her<br/>
opening spinal fluid pressure was normal and spinal fluid was<br/>
completely negative. She was then placed on intravenous Claforan again<br/>
along with steroids and again the visual acuity improved. Now her<br/>
EEG's are abnormal and she will, of course, have a follow-up VERS and<br/>
visual acuity will be followed. <br/>

So...<br/>
<br/>
does this mean I have to take off my clothes and dance around after <br/>
letterboxing in the woods?  Or is that just for F1000?  My wife <br/>
already thinks I'm crazy with letterboxing....<br/>

&gt; &gt;Ticks are awful.  They're the one thing that will send me into <br/>

&gt; &gt;tick-borne disease, there are several other diseases that ticks <br/>
can carry <br/>

imbedded for <br/>

lyme (the <br/>

at the <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Hi Everyone!<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I hate to add to the fear factor of TICKS but my daughter got <br/>
bit<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Letterboxing last summer at Saugatuck Dunes State Park.<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Gee, almost a year later now and she has some illness that we <br/>
cannot<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;diagnose. After several trips to the Dr and blood test after <br/>
blood<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;test, we are getting scared.<br/><br/>

So...<br/>
<br/>
does this mean I have to take off my clothes and dance around after <br/>
letterboxing in the woods?  Or is that just for F1000?  My wife <br/>
already thinks I'm crazy with letterboxing....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, so having gone through a year with a close family member having <br/>
Lyme (she's still not 100%, but getting there), all of you should know <br/>
that Deer Ticks and Nymphs (yes, the nymphs also carry Lyme) are <br/>
INCREDIBLY SMALL - as in about the size of the period at the end of <br/>
this sentence.  Deer ticks and nymphs live on the ground, they crawl <br/>
up blades of grass and that's how they manage to attach themselves to <br/>
people and animals wandering by.  A cursory "tick check" won't find <br/>
them - the wood ticks that we're all accustomed to looking for and <br/>
finding are huge compared to Deer Ticks.  So for those of you out <br/>
wandering in grassy areas, particularly if the grass is long and damp, <br/>
find a really good buddy to help you do tick checks, and use a <br/>
magnifying glass if necessary.  This is not a fun disease to have!  <br/>
And for those of you who've seen the information about the "bullseye <br/>
rash" know that only about 10% of the population will get that, the <br/>
rest will just develop the other Lyme symptoms that were talked about.<br/>
<br/>
Off my soapbox now.<br/>
