                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another gorgeous day in West Michigan -- a bit too windy for <br/>
boating, but perfect for hiking.  I headed over to Lake Harbor Park <br/>
in Muskegon and replanted the Sandy Seasons boxes (finally).  I <br/>
slightly relocated the Winter box and modified the clues accordingly <br/>
as I happened upon the geocache in the area.  Hopefully relocating <br/>
the box will help keep it from being continually uncovered and left <br/>
in the open by disappointed cachers.<br/>
<br/>
While I was there I checked up on Arbo's Muskegon Beach Box and it <br/>
is alive and well, but is very lonely -- no visitors since September <br/>
2003!  Perhaps now that there are 5 boxes in that park, this lonely <br/>
box will see some visitors as this would make a nice weekend <br/>
afternoon destination for anyone in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Although I have lived in West Michigan all of my life and have been <br/>
fortunate to have Lake Michigan close by and just a natural part of <br/>
my world, it never ceases to awe me.  As I came up a little crest on <br/>
the trail and it opened up to the lake, I got goosebumps from the <br/>
feeling that I had just happened upon a secret.  The wind was <br/>
kicking up some decent sized waves and the sound of the surf was <br/>
really quite awesome.<br/>
<br/>
We who are have this as a part of our world truly are blessed -- may <br/>
we never take it for granted.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm glad that Arbo's box is still in place.  I set out to find it <br/>
about a month ago and didn't locate it.  I guess I'll have to give it <br/>
another try (especially with the possibility of finding five boxes).  <br/>
Lake Harbor is a beautiful park, and you're right - we are so lucky <br/>
to live in a place surrounded by such magnificent natural beauty.  <br/>
May we be wise enough to protect it and enjoy it.<br/>
