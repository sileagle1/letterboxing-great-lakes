and began spewing blasts of artic air and snow from the north, to <br/>
check on the Sandy Seasons boxes at Lake Harbor Park in Muskegon.  I <br/>
knew the winter box was missing from previous reports and had carved <br/>
up a replacement stamp with the intention of planting the new box <br/>
yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Once there I was delighted to find the Winter box peacefully resting <br/>
in its place, which was a surprise since my visit a few weeks ago <br/>
had confirmed it was missing.  Unfortunately though the box was <br/>
empty and the contents nowhere to be found (okay I admit, I didn't <br/>
look very hard -- it is a very steep hill ;-)  Since the Sandy <br/>
Seasons series had kind of a color-coordinated thing going on <br/>
(really I am not usually so anal), I wanted to use the original <br/>
box.  So I took it all back home -- the empty (very dirty) box and <br/>
the new box.  I also picked up the Spring, Summer and Autumn boxes, <br/>
which were all in good shape.  I will get them cleaned up and try to <br/>
have them all back in place within a week or two -- depends on the <br/>
weather.<br/>
<br/>
While there, I also checked in on Arbo's Beach Box and found it in <br/>
good shape.  Was surprised to see that although the logs of the <br/>
Sandy Seasons series were identical to one another as far as <br/>
visitors who had stamped in, a very different set of boxers had been <br/>
to the Beach Box.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
