Ironically, I thought more of the newbies were using LbNA which is still perceived as the primary source for clues, and they don't know about AQ. But I can only base that on the automatic responses I receive when someone finds my boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Guess it's time to bring my In Memory of All Missing Letterboxes stamp out again.  We never know how or why letterboxes go missing, but it's certainly sad whenever it happens.  We've discussed this before and I don't like restricted find counts either, although I once thought that was a possible solution.  It's not.  I thought 'codes' would make a clue more challenging, but not always, so I have de-coded some of my previously coded clues.  I'm just learning to accept the fact that ..."All things must pass"...including letterboxes.  Nothing lasts forever.  <br/>

Rangers are more aware of suspicious behavior in their parks.  People use cell phones to report any suspicious or unusual behavior.  And then there are those cantankerous  <br/>
<br/>
raccoons who are just playing tricks on us all the time.  <br/>

Yeah, I personally don't think AQ is the answer. It seems to me that most<br/>
newbies flock to that site and that particular "community" generally seems<br/>
to favor publicity and growth. <br/>
<br/>
I actually think my boxes are safer being on LBNA and will work on having<br/>
them be a bit more cryptic in terms of clues.<br/>
<br/>
If rangers are intent on removing boxes, I think they will certainly go to<br/>
AQ in addition to LBNA. If they are taking all the time to go out and hike<br/>
for the boxes, it sure doesn't take a comparable amount of time to look at<br/>
AQ, log any random finds they'd care to and search out more to remove.<br/>

Statistically speaking, the number of boxes disappearing seems to be highly<br/>
correlated to recent articles about letterboxing in various media. This is<br/>
part of what Miss Moon is trying to get across.<br/>
<br/>
I've just received an email from someone who JUST signed up on AQ (today -<br/>
ie. PFX 0) telling me about some issues with my vampire series of boxes. I'm<br/>
beginning to fear for the worst.<br/>
