                    <div class="plaintext-content">[This is a repost of a message I posted just now on the Atlas Quest Ohio Board, but based on the little information I found concerning this plant, I believe the planters may not have used AQ so I'm reposting here to see if anyone knows anything]<br/>
<br/>
of letterboxers from the Ohio area (I'm guessing around Akron, based on where we were today) with an email address "judeandmolly@hotmail.com"?  Deedle &amp; I weren't letterboxing today, instead we were on a bike ride.  But as we rode past a tall post along the trail, the familiar gleam of a blue plastic lid caught my eye, so we stopped to investigate, and sure enough, it was a letterbox.  And of course we didn't have our signature stamp or even a pen to write in the logbook with.<br/>
<br/>
Here's our big mystery, though - we have no idea what the name of this box was, or who the planters were other than someone with the above email address.  I don't want to give away too many details abut the location we were at or the stamp image, in case this box is a word of mouth or mystery plant, but other than the basic "this is a letterbox, please don't throw away, visit www.letterboxing.org for more information, contact us at judeandmolly@hotmail.com" message on the lid of the letterbox, there was no other identifying information.  The log had no previous finders, just the image of the stamp - no box name written, no trail name of the planters, nothing.  So I couldn't look for information for the box by name.  I sent a message to that email address to see what the planters were willing to tell us, but it bounced back to me already.  I searched both Atlas Quest and Letterboxing.com for trailnames that matched that email address, or boxes with clues<br/>
 that fit the location we were at and the image of the stamp but found nothing that matched.  And it appears that the box may have been planted for a while, because the container was inside a larger ziplock bag that had a bit of dirt on it and some holes like an animal had been chewing on the bag.  <br/>
<br/>
So, if you think you may know who the planters were, or the box name, let me know.  If you think you may know but need more information, send me a private message and I'll share more specific details.  <br/>

<br/>
This question triggered possible scenarios ....we hid a box in Door County a year and a half ago, but forgot the clues so we never posted...(we see top shaking your heads...)...and have been waiting to return to re-find and clue the box...if anyone stumbles upon it by accident they will be equally befuddled!<br/>
Secondly, Spring Chick planted one of our boxes for her "Wing Thing" gathering in western Michigan several years ago...we never found our own box, so we have no idea where in the park it is planted...thus no clues!<br/>
Both boxes are true mysteries...even to us!<br/>

Am hoping to pull a lot of the Wing Thing boxes and County Fair boxes within the next month to return to their owners at this year's Fall Gathering.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep. I have a box that was planted for the Fall Gathering and I didn't look for it either. Somehow, the clues are lost and I didn't know where it was. So...I get this email stating that these boxers found another's box...and three feet away was my box! So, I can go off of the clues of this box to pick up mine. If anyone has seen Kiddie Carousel, let me know.<br/>
