Speaking of Naughty - and Nice - okay, Christmas Elves, tell us more<br>
about your rocks!! Very cool!<br>
--klk<br>
<br>
<br>
The Naughty or Nice rocks are perishable, currently.   Santa kept us<br>
too busy to work on weatherproofing.  We were lucky to have them ready<br>
for the gathering.<br>
<br>
The rocks are high tech papier-mache.  Celluclay + water + spray paint<br>
with a stone texture = rock.   <br>
<br>
Mix the Celluclay with water to a bread dough consistency.  Roll it<br>
out.  Wrap the container of your choice with plastic wrap.  Shape the<br>
Celluclay around the container in the rock formation of your choice. <br>
Tuck wads of plastic wrap between the container and the Celluclay and<br>
let it dry overnight rock side up.  <br>
<br>
The next day, remove the wads and the container, and stretch the<br>
cavity a bit since it will shrink as it dries.  Bake the rock in a 200<br>
degree oven for a couple of hours, with the rock hole side up, on a<br>
cookie sheet.  Alternate hole side up and hole side down as needed. <br>
If you do some of the baking in the evening, you can turn off the<br>
oven, leaving the rock in it, at bedtime so the residual heat<br>
continues to dry the rock.  If you bake in several shifts, press on<br>
the inner walls to limit the amount of shrinkage.<br>
<br>
Once the rock is dry, trim the inner walls as needed so the container<br>
fits.  Then, cover the outside with a spray paint that has a stone<br>
texture.  The paint is available in several colors.  We used all red<br>
on Nice and a red base with a lighter topcoat on Naughty.  Our rocks<br>
survived their snowy day, but you'd want to experiment with<br>
weatherproofing options for a permanent placement.<br>
<br>
For those of you who didn't have an opportunity to find Naughty or<br>
Nice, you can glimpse Naughty in some of the St. Nick Gathering photos<br>
taken by FungusWoman and Wisconsin Hiker.<br>

<br>
Or you might be able to spray it with Krylon and sand off the shine?  Or use the really fine grain sand sold in the candle section while the Clear krylon was still wet to tone down the shine?<br>

  I read not too long ago in a woodworking magazine about "Penetrating <br>
Epoxy".  It soaks into the surface and hardens, unlike the thick stuff <br>
you've probably seen.  If I remember right it was used to finish a tabletop <br>

"rock".<br>
