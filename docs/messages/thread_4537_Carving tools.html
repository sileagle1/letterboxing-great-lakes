This is soooo funny -- all the opinions!  : )<br/>
You see...I hate the exacto knife -- I've tried it,<br/>
and all my stuff came out like so much shredded<br/>
cheese.<br/>
I use the Speedball exclusivly...#1 &amp; #4 mostly...and<br/>
I love 'em myself!<br/>
<br/>
To each his or her own I guess!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Me too, me too!  I haven't tried the exacto knife yet (I did buy a nice set, but promptly misplaced it and haven't seen it in over a year).  But I am very happy with the results I get from a speedball cutter.  If I could only have one blade, it would be the #1.  If I could only have two blades, it would probably be the #1 and the U-shaped gouge (I think it's a #5).  Mostly I use the #1 blade and a pinched #1 for fine details.  For clearing larger areas within the stamp design I might use the #2, or if it is a particularly large stamp even the #3.  And I LOVE the U-shaped gouge and the #3 for clearing large areas around the design...it goes SO much quicker than the #1 or #2.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very happy with the amount of detail I can get with the pinched #1.  I'm sure I can't get as much detail as some of our other excellent carvers, but then again I'm just not that patient and I rarely have that long an attention span.  I need to sit down and carve a stamp all at once...it becomes an obsession that I can't let go of until it is finished.  If a stamp takes me much longer than an hour or so to carve I start to get frustrated and even loose interest.<br/>
