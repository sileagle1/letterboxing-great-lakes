boxes and am in the process of updating the clues with any info that<br/>
has been passed on to me.<br/>
<br/>
I have uploaded a pdf copy of my Excel spreadsheet which lists each<br/>
box, planter, location, status, and extra info about the condition of<br/>
the box.  You will see that there are a number of issues that need to<br/>
be addressed.  If you are responsible for a box, please do me the<br/>
favor of checking on it this month (if you haven't already done so<br/>
recently) and fix anything (including clues) needed.  If you are<br/>
unable to do so, please request for someone else to do it on the GL<br/>
site.  Be sure to let me know of the status.<br/>
<br/>
If you were the carver for a missing or possibly missing box, please<br/>
work it out with the planter as to how you will go about replacing the<br/>
box.  Some carvers are no longer letterboxing, so we may need some<br/>
help recarving stamps from the GL group as well.<br/>
<br/>
We still need adopters for Howling Coyote's and Armadillo Jo's boxes.<br/>
   Contact me if you are interested.  Since Team Taco and Gooble<br/>
Gobble have taken a break from letterboxing, we also need volunteers<br/>
to check up on their boxes.  Last I heard was that the Migrating<br/>
Coconuts were in GG's Sir Robin's Minstrels box, but that info was<br/>
from over a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
