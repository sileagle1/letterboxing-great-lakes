                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, mark your calendars -- Saturday, July 23, 2005 is the date for <br>
the mid-summer mini-meet at Muskegon State Park in North Muskegon, <br>
MI.  This will be in the Channel Campground area.  OldShoe and I are <br>
camping there for the weekend, so we will use our campsite as the <br>
pitstop -- I may check into renting a roof over our head just in <br>
case it rains.<br>
<br>
I am still tossing around ideas for event name/theme and will carve <br>
up an event stamp.<br>
<br>
This will be a VERY INFORMAL get-together.  We will meet in the <br>
morning at the campground to get to know everyone and exchange <br>
stamps.  The rest of the day will then be about letterboxing.  Since <br>
everyone has done different boxes and has interest in different <br>
boxes, this is an "on your own" or with 2-3 other people kind of <br>
thing.  The intention is not for 16 people to go heading down any <br>
one trail together at one time.  There are several boxes already in <br>
Muskegon State Park and the surrounding areas -- the <br>
Whitehall/Montague area is only a short drive up the shoreline from <br>
Muskegon State Park.  Please check out clues on the LbNA web site, <br>
AtlasQuest, etc. to plan the boxes you are interested in.  I will <br>
also put out a few new boxes in the area in anticipation of the <br>
event.  Anyone else is encouraged to do so also.  There will NOT be <br>
an organized potluck/meal -- there are many restaurants within the <br>
area and picnic areas at the park.  Everyone is on their own as to <br>
what fits best into their letterboxing time table.  In the evening <br>
we will group back up for a while to enjoy a campfire at our <br>
campsite.<br>
<br>
No RSVP necessary at this time -- I may want an idea when we get <br>
closer to the date, but we will be there regardless.  Hope you can <br>
make it!<br>
