box!  That's great also that you started right out by carving your <br>
stamp!<br>
<br>
Sometimes what people do if they have a larger stamp and it doesn't <br>
fit into the log books (as they vary from about 3 x 5 to very tiny <br>
ones in microboxes) is to just stamp a portion of the stamp -- one <br>
corner or maybe a portion of the image that could stand all on its <br>
own.  You can use water-based markers to color just parts of the <br>
stamp if you don not want to stamp the entire image.<br>
<br>
Happy Boxing!<br>
