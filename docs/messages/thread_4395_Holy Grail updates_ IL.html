Would you mind posting those revised Lancelot clues to the board?  We <br/>
are ones who had trouble and would love any additional help we can <br/>
get.  Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sure.  Using the original clues, go right instead of left at the small maple (don't worry, you won't wander lost forever...the Red Fox trail is a giant loop, follow it long enough and it'll take you right back where you started) and follow the trail overlooking the lake around the bench and up the hill.  Then continue down the trail (there will be a 90* right hand turn and a lot of winding) to the next intersection.  From there, look for the arrow (it's sort of pointing off into the woods rather than down the trail) and follow the clues as written.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect you got to the maple and then the next intersection was only a few feet past that (at least that's what I did when I misread the clues).  When the clues were written, we hadn't noticed that trail at all!  The revisions make the hike just a little longer and slightly more physically challenging since it throws in a little bit of a hill, but I suspect they will make the clues more clear.<br/>
