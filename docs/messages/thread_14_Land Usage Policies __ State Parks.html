new State Park policy.  One of the employees at the State Park here <br>
who is a letterboxer, tipped me off that the ranger there had shared <br>
the new policy with her.  It was my understanding that it was not <br>

that could have changed since then.<br>

It is actually the reason I have been keeping tabs on the geocaching <br>
site.  I wanted to see if there was discussion of this there, but <br>
have not see anything thus far.  I would assume that the policy <br>
would include both letterboxes and geocaches.<br>
<br>
Of course I am not happy about the policy and think it is a shame <br>
that they would charge people to use the parks in the way they were <br>
intended to be used -- for recreation and outdoor activity.  I will <br>
not pay to place boxes and when the time comes, will remove my boxes <br>
from the parks and find new homes for them.  There are many miles of <br>
beautiful trails around -- if the State Parks don't want people <br>
coming there (not to mention the revenue and awareness it helps to <br>
generate), then I will go elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I was wondering if they will also begin to charge people to fish, to <br>
play volleyball and to fly kites on the beach?<br>
<br>
I think it all comes down to greed and ignorance. <br>

<br>
There is a discussion about this going on in the MI-geocaching forum right at this moment. Apparently, there is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow between MI-GO folks and the parks and rec people. The goal being to try and sway them from implementing the $35.00 fee and to try and reduce the movement of placements from every 3 mths to 1-2 times a year.<br>
 <br>
MI-GO is also trying to tally the $$ spent by folks in state parks to try and provide an estimate of revenue that boxing/caching brings to the parks, so please consider adding in your numbers. To view the discussions on the forum you do need to register, but membership is FREE. <br>
<br>
Please consider taking a look!<br>

THANKS!<br>

I've followed it throughout the day, and even put in my two cents, <br>
although cautiously as I am not familiar with too many of the people <br>
there.<br>
<br>
I did exchange e-mails with Rusty, who recognized my name when I <br>
posted -- he had found a few of my letterboxes last year while out <br>
caching.  Hopefully I was able to give a letterboxer's perspective <br>
and can help in their dealings with the DNR.<br>
<br>
I would like to say this though...  whatever the outcome is, I truly <br>
hope that people will not only continue to letterbox and geocache, <br>
but also continue to utilize the wonderful State Parks we have here <br>
in Michigan, even if not simultaneously .<br>

Hi all,<br>
<br>
We were very disappointed to hear about the efforts of the Michigan <br>
State Parks to charge for letterboxes placed in the parks.  On our <br>
trip from Wisconsin to Michigan last spring, (for the specific <br>
purpose of going letterboxing), we were very happy that there were <br>
boxes in the state parks.  We've found that we would never hear about <br>
these places if it weren't for the letterboxes.  It's free <br>
advertising for the parks....and they are going to charge "us" to do <br>
it for them.  Amazing!  $35 per box!  Per 3 months....I don't know of <br>
anybody who would pay that.  Part of the benefits of letterboxing is <br>
how inexpensive it is to do...unless you're taking 5,000 mile <br>
roadtrips down Route 66 to do it;)  <br>
   The parks are seeing it as a source of more revenue....I think it <br>
will have an opposite effect.  The placement fee will erradicate any <br>
boxes in the park. Less people will go to the parks.  Not enough to <br>
close them down obviously, but less will go.  Missing out on the <br>
great things to see.   I think of our trip through Texas and our stop <br>
at Palo Duro Canyon....never would have known about it if there <br>
weren't two letterboxes that were just 25 mins south of Amarillo.  <br>
Very cool park.  In Tulsa, OK, there was the Oxley Nature Center <br>
which basically sponsors its own series...very cool idea.  And don't <br>
forget Connecticut...who's state parks have their own statewide <br>
series.  <br>
   We think Springchick is right.  Ignorance and greed.  We'll <br>
happily pay the $20 to go to the Michigan State Parks...as we did <br>
last spring, but to be completely honest, we'd skip them to go to a <br>
free park elsewhere for the letterboxes...it just seems like more fun.<br>
   As for the limited placement time....I couldn't imagine the placer <br>
having to mess around with clues and placement that often. Not to <br>
mention, we don't really care to try to keep up with clues that <br>
change every 3 months, 6 months...year...5 years...It's cool to find <br>
the old boxes....We can't wait til some of these boxes start pushing <br>
10-15 years in existence....maybe more.  The older boxes kinda have a <br>
badge of honor to us.<br>
<br>
I guess it's just sad that the commercialism of our society has to <br>
invade even the most benign, wholesome fun....<br>
<br>
