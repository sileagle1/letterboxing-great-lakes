&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, I've received some not-so-good news on the topic of<br/>
&gt; proper placement and land usage in State Parks.  I was contacted <br/>
last<br/>
&gt; week by a (very friendly) employee at a Michigan State Park where <br/>
we<br/>
&gt; have multiple letterboxes planted.  She let me know that there is <br/>
a new<br/>
&gt; policy on geo-caching at Michigan State Parks.  Essentially, <br/>
they've<br/>
&gt; decided that a Use Permit must be filed for each letterbox or other<br/>
&gt; physical object placed in a park, and a $35 fee must be paid.   The<br/>
&gt; letterbox can remain in place for a maximum of 3 months.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is quite a bit different than the existing State Park <br/>
practices<br/>
&gt; which are shown on the Michigan Geo-Caching website.  Perhaps this<br/>
&gt; policy has not been communicated to many people yet.   Even though <br/>
I was<br/>
&gt; disappointed to hear about it, I was glad that this particular <br/>
State<br/>
&gt; Park employee brought it to my attention in such a friendly, <br/>
positive<br/>
&gt; way.  That will give us a chance to remove our boxes the next time <br/>
we're<br/>
&gt; in the area; perhaps we'll be able to find a non-State-Park <br/>
location for<br/>
&gt; them in the future.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Below, I have pasted the message from State Park Headquarters, <br/>
which the<br/>
&gt; employee forwarded to me.  She also forwarded the 2 documents <br/>
mentioned:<br/>
&gt; the new policy, and a sample Use Permit.  I'll place those 2 <br/>
documents<br/>
&gt; in the GLK group's Yahoo! database for anyone who is interested.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My reason for bringing this up, is not to start a flame war on why <br/>
this<br/>
&gt; is or isn't a good policy. in fact, I was very excited to see this <br/>
new<br/>
&gt; Great Lakes Group was started, since I know this group will be <br/>
able to<br/>
&gt; have a much calmer discussion about such topics!  But I  wanted to <br/>
alert<br/>
&gt; you all to it, in case other State Parks don't take the time to e-<br/>
mail<br/>
&gt; or call you, like they did for me.   As you'll see in the policy, <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; have the authority to remove "unpermitted" boxes as of 6/1/2004, <br/>
and I<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Attached is a new policy addressing geocaching on PRB lands. This <br/>
is a<br/>
&gt; new treasure-hunting type "hobby" made possible through the use of <br/>
GPS<br/>
&gt; units and the internet. In a nutshell, a geocacher places a <br/>
container of<br/>
&gt; interesting items (?) in the park, then posts hints and GPS <br/>
coordinates<br/>
&gt; on the geocaching website. Geocaching "hunters" look up these <br/>
items on<br/>
&gt; the internet then go look for the cache. Typically, the finder <br/>
will sign<br/>
&gt; the required log book and may exchange some items. We already have <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; number of these geocaches on our lands.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another form of this activity is known as "letter-boxing". While <br/>
this<br/>
&gt; policy refers to geocaching, any activity which involves the <br/>
placement<br/>
&gt; of items on PRB lands for others to find would be covered by this<br/>
&gt; policy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Virtual caching involves the posting of hints and GPS coordinates <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; direct "hunters" to an existing feature. It may be a sign, a <br/>
waterfall<br/>
&gt; or other natural feature. There is no actual placement of <br/>
materials on<br/>
&gt; site and there is no Use Permit fee charged for such virtual <br/>
caches,<br/>
&gt; although a Use Permit is still required. Virtual caches are <br/>
preferred<br/>
&gt; over physical caches (and there is a financial incentive, too!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This policy is to take immediate effect. A sample Use Permit is <br/>
also<br/>
&gt; included to provide guidance. Please distribute to your respective<br/>
&gt; units.<br/>

There is a discussion about this going on in the MI-geocaching forum right at this moment. Apparently, there is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow between MI-GO folks and the parks and rec people. The goal being to try and sway them from implementing the $35.00 fee and to try and reduce the movement of placements from every 3 mths to 1-2 times a year.<br/>
<br/>
MI-GO is also trying to tally the $$ spent by folks in state parks to try and provide an estimate of revenue that boxing/caching brings to the parks, so please consider adding in your numbers. To view the discussions on the forum you do need to register, but membership is FREE. <br/>

I've followed it throughout the day, and even put in my two cents, <br/>
although cautiously as I am not familiar with too many of the people <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I did exchange e-mails with Rusty, who recognized my name when I <br/>
posted -- he had found a few of my letterboxes last year while out <br/>
caching.  Hopefully I was able to give a letterboxer's perspective <br/>
and can help in their dealings with the DNR.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to say this though...  whatever the outcome is, I truly <br/>
hope that people will not only continue to letterbox and geocache, <br/>
but also continue to utilize the wonderful State Parks we have here <br/>
in Michigan, even if not simultaneously .<br/>

&gt;   &gt; policy on geo-caching at Michigan State Parks.  Essentially, <br/>
&gt;   they've<br/>
&gt;   &gt; decided that a Use Permit must be filed for each letterbox or <br/>
other<br/>
&gt;   &gt; physical object placed in a park, and a $35 fee must be <br/>
paid.   The<br/>
&gt;   &gt; letterbox can remain in place for a maximum of 3 months.  <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;  <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; This is quite a bit different than the existing State Park <br/>
&gt;   practices<br/>
&gt;   &gt; which are shown on the Michigan Geo-Caching website.  Perhaps <br/>
this<br/>
&gt;   &gt; policy has not been communicated to many people yet.   Even <br/>
though <br/>
&gt;   I was<br/>
&gt;   &gt; disappointed to hear about it, I was glad that this particular <br/>
&gt;   State<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Park employee brought it to my attention in such a friendly, <br/>
&gt;   positive<br/>
&gt;   &gt; way.  That will give us a chance to remove our boxes the next <br/>
time <br/>
&gt;   we're<br/>
&gt;   &gt; in the area; perhaps we'll be able to find a non-State-Park <br/>
&gt;   location for<br/>
&gt;   &gt; them in the future.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;  <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Below, I have pasted the message from State Park Headquarters, <br/>
&gt;   which the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; employee forwarded to me.  She also forwarded the 2 documents <br/>
&gt;   mentioned:<br/>
&gt;   &gt; the new policy, and a sample Use Permit.  I'll place those 2 <br/>
&gt;   documents<br/>
&gt;   &gt; in the GLK group's Yahoo! database for anyone who is <br/>
interested.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;  <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; My reason for bringing this up, is not to start a flame war on <br/>
why <br/>
&gt;   this<br/>
&gt;   &gt; is or isn't a good policy. in fact, I was very excited to see <br/>
this <br/>
&gt;   new<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Great Lakes Group was started, since I know this group will be <br/>
&gt;   able to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; have a much calmer discussion about such topics!  But I  <br/>
wanted to <br/>
&gt;   alert<br/>
&gt;   &gt; you all to it, in case other State Parks don't take the time <br/>
to e-<br/>
&gt;   mail<br/>
&gt;   &gt; or call you, like they did for me.   As you'll see in the <br/>
policy, <br/>
&gt;   they<br/>
&gt;   &gt; have the authority to remove "unpermitted" boxes as of <br/>
6/1/2004, <br/>
&gt;   and I<br/>
&gt;   &gt; would hate to see any of you lose the stamps and log books <br/>
that <br/>
&gt;   you have<br/>
&gt;   &gt; out there.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;  <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Attached is a new policy addressing geocaching on PRB lands. <br/>
This <br/>
&gt;   is a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; new treasure-hunting type "hobby" made possible through the <br/>
use of <br/>
&gt;   GPS<br/>
&gt;   &gt; units and the internet. In a nutshell, a geocacher places a <br/>
&gt;   container of<br/>
&gt;   &gt; interesting items (?) in the park, then posts hints and GPS <br/>
&gt;   coordinates<br/>
&gt;   &gt; on the geocaching website. Geocaching "hunters" look up these <br/>
&gt;   items on<br/>
&gt;   &gt; the internet then go look for the cache. Typically, the finder <br/>
&gt;   will sign<br/>
&gt;   &gt; the required log book and may exchange some items. We already <br/>
have <br/>
&gt;   a<br/>
&gt;   &gt; number of these geocaches on our lands.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;  <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Another form of this activity is known as "letter-boxing". <br/>
While <br/>
&gt;   this<br/>
&gt;   &gt; policy refers to geocaching, any activity which involves the <br/>
&gt;   placement<br/>
&gt;   &gt; of items on PRB lands for others to find would be covered by <br/>
this<br/>
&gt;   &gt; policy.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;  <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; Virtual caching involves the posting of hints and GPS <br/>
coordinates <br/>
&gt;   to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; direct "hunters" to an existing feature. It may be a sign, a <br/>
&gt;   waterfall<br/>
&gt;   &gt; or other natural feature. There is no actual placement of <br/>
&gt;   materials on<br/>
&gt;   &gt; site and there is no Use Permit fee charged for such virtual <br/>
&gt;   caches,<br/>
&gt;   &gt; although a Use Permit is still required. Virtual caches are <br/>
&gt;   preferred<br/>
&gt;   &gt; over physical caches (and there is a financial incentive, <br/>
too!).<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt;  <br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; This policy is to take immediate effect. A sample Use Permit <br/>
is <br/>
&gt;   also<br/>
&gt;   &gt; included to provide guidance. Please distribute to your <br/>
respective<br/>
&gt;   &gt; units.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
We were very disappointed to hear about the efforts of the Michigan <br/>
State Parks to charge for letterboxes placed in the parks.  On our <br/>
trip from Wisconsin to Michigan last spring, (for the specific <br/>
purpose of going letterboxing), we were very happy that there were <br/>
boxes in the state parks.  We've found that we would never hear about <br/>
these places if it weren't for the letterboxes.  It's free <br/>
advertising for the parks....and they are going to charge "us" to do <br/>
it for them.  Amazing!  $35 per box!  Per 3 months....I don't know of <br/>
anybody who would pay that.  Part of the benefits of letterboxing is <br/>
how inexpensive it is to do...unless you're taking 5,000 mile <br/>
roadtrips down Route 66 to do it;)  <br/>
   The parks are seeing it as a source of more revenue....I think it <br/>
will have an opposite effect.  The placement fee will erradicate any <br/>
boxes in the park. Less people will go to the parks.  Not enough to <br/>
close them down obviously, but less will go.  Missing out on the <br/>
great things to see.   I think of our trip through Texas and our stop <br/>
at Palo Duro Canyon....never would have known about it if there <br/>
weren't two letterboxes that were just 25 mins south of Amarillo.  <br/>
Very cool park.  In Tulsa, OK, there was the Oxley Nature Center <br/>
which basically sponsors its own series...very cool idea.  And don't <br/>
forget Connecticut...who's state parks have their own statewide <br/>
series.  <br/>
   We think Springchick is right.  Ignorance and greed.  We'll <br/>
happily pay the $20 to go to the Michigan State Parks...as we did <br/>
last spring, but to be completely honest, we'd skip them to go to a <br/>
free park elsewhere for the letterboxes...it just seems like more fun.<br/>
   As for the limited placement time....I couldn't imagine the placer <br/>
having to mess around with clues and placement that often. Not to <br/>
mention, we don't really care to try to keep up with clues that <br/>
change every 3 months, 6 months...year...5 years...It's cool to find <br/>
the old boxes....We can't wait til some of these boxes start pushing <br/>
10-15 years in existence....maybe more.  The older boxes kinda have a <br/>
badge of honor to us.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's just sad that the commercialism of our society has to <br/>
invade even the most benign, wholesome fun....<br/>
