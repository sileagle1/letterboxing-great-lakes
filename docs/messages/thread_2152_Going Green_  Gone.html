  I had a chance over the weekend to go check on it, and I'm so sad to report that it is indeed missing.<br>
   <br>
  Lessons learned:  While summer vegetation LOOKS like it will keep a box hidden and in place, ALL the surrounding vegetation was completely gone and the little hidey-hole where the box was hidden was wide open.<br>
   <br>
  I hope to recarve and replant this box, but it won't be for a while until I'm not so busy...<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
