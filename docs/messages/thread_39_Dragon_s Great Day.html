Isn't it funny though how when you are out boxing or checking on your boxes,<br/>
you think that everyone you see is a letterboxer and you "make it work..."<br/>
He looks at his watch and you're thinking he must have one of those nifty<br/>

him immediately - clues in hand &amp; Kettle Moraine High School jacket.  We<br/>
immediately greeted him and we chatted and did an exchange.  We have put a<br/>
LBNA patch on our pack to hopefully alert other LBers that may be on the<br/>
trail and thereby prompt an exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of thinking everyone you meet might be a LBer...<br/>
<br/>
One of our friends has only been out letterboxing once (last summer), but<br/>
she told us a hilarious story about the occasion. She came to the box<br/>
location (The Green One) but a couple with a bike was lingering at the spot.<br/>
It is a very busy public spot.   She waited patiently for them to leave, but<br/>
they stuck around.  She therefore concluded that THEY must also be looking<br/>
for the box and waiting for HER to leave.  So she said to to the guy, "Are<br/>
you looking for something SPECIAL?".  They looked at her in horror, said<br/>
NO!, and quickly departed.  She couldn't believe that she thought she was<br/>
propositioning him/them but was so surprised (and not wanting to divulge too<br/>
much) that she couldn't reasonably respond.  She hoped they weren't going to<br/>
report her to any nearby police for soliciting (or drugs) as she was busy<br/>
retrieving the box.  Our hiking club has gotten quite a laugh over this!<br/>
