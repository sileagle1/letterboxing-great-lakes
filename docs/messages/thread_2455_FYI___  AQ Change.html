                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wanted to make everyone aware of a change that is being implemented <br>
at AtlasQuest since I know many people here list clues there but are <br>
not active AQ users.<br>
<br>
Ryan has implemented a new *feature* that for any box clue that is <br>
listed there whose owner has not logged into AQ for a year, he will <br>
put the box up for adoption.  Now I know that chances are in a year's <br>
time, an active letterboxer who has clues listed at AQ will more than <br>
likely log in there either to post new clues, change existing clues, <br>
search for boxes, use the message boards, bcheck events, etc., but...  <br>
sometimes life happens and time gets away from us.<br>
<br>
So, if you are one who just puts your clues there or has placed clues <br>
there in the past, but really does not use the site regularly, make <br>
sure you log in every now and then anyway to keep yourself active.  <br>
Would hate to see anyone's box get put up for adoption while they were <br>
out tending to life.<br>
