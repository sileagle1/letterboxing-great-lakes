PS....A big thank you to JBBK2006 clan for hosting the Hoosier Heart- <br/>
St. Pat's Day Gathering at their home in Indianapolis this weekend!  <br/>
They put a lot of effort into making sure we all were taken care of!  <br/>
After hours of stamping madness, the room was an explosion of stamp <br/>
junkies!  You know the look?  Blurred vision, muddy brown fingertips <br/>
from the marker colors stamped together, and hunched lifeless bodies <br/>
only moving their hands to color yet another stamp.  In the future, we <br/>
will only be able to recognize fellow letterboxers by the top of their <br/>
heads!<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed meeting more boxers from IN, IL and Ohio!..We finally got to <br/>
meet Hoosier Honey Bee one of the first boxers in Indiana.  When we <br/>
started letterboxing,there were only a few boxes in Indy..almost all <br/>
were hers.<br/>
<br/>
Happy to report that letterboxing is alive and well in the <br/>
Midwest!..and some awesome carvers too!<br/>
Tiptoe...and Tonto<br/>
