I enjoy knitting, and I'm always thrilled to find out that my talents are appreciated. This year I have taken over the knitting of the "grand prize" socks. They're finished and will be on the way soon Spring Chick! (and if the powers that be have anything to say about it, the person who has the biggest feet will win! I think they may end up being a little big!)<br/>

Hard to believe (since I've done so poorly in Bingo lately), but I did win some nice booty a few years ago.  Most of which I put to letterboxing use, but we did have an odd use for one of the prizes this Christmas.  Someone put in teeny-tiny ziploc bags, which have been great for HH and microboxes.  But that wasn't the unusual use.<br/>
<br/>
Every year,for Christmas, we find out how a different country celebrates Christmas and incorporate some of their foods or decorations or traditions into our Christmas--esp. when we celebrate with one group of friends.  We hadn't done anything from South America yet, so we picked Columbia (and got a lot of jokes from our friends about a cocaine Christmas).  For one of our gifts to our friends, I filled those tiny zip-loc bags with powdered sugar as their special Columbian gift. <br/>
<br/>
If we were able to come to the Olympics (which we can't), I was going to pick Columbia as our country and have a few "samples" out at our table.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very funny!  It made me think of my dad (he died quite a while ago of<br/>
cancer).  One of my sisters &amp; her husband hosted a Halloween party for many<br/>
years.  One year my dad came as a drug dealer and he had a baggie with<br/>
"cocaine"(powdered sugar) in his pocket.  When we did a scavenger hunt that<br/>
night, even his neighbors didn't recognize him.  It was quite a hoot!  <br/>
