It's funny, I too enjoy visiting old cemeteries and piecing together the<br>
history (the mom who died in childbirth, the infant who died days<br>
later......), but I do not visit my own grandparents' graves.  To me, I<br>
would rather remember them as they were when they were alive.  My<br>
brother-in-law and sister-in-law have their graves and tombstones all picked<br>
out and ready to go (they are only in their early 60's!) and even have<br>
pictures of themselves engraved on them.  I know that was a common practice<br>
long ago, but - I'm sorry, that's way too creepy for me to include that<br>
ahead of time!!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to say that all this positive feedback makes me super happy.  Mr & I had a few heated discussion's over this little series, and we eventually had to agree to disagree.  (He's come around now)<br>
<br>
The whole idea stemmed from the beauty of these little country cemeteries.  For much of my childhood I spent time in many little country cemeteries with my Grandmother (an avid genealogist) finding the correct grave stones, and getting rubbing's of the information on them.  These times are some of my fondest memories - just me and my Grandma driving along an old country road and cheering when we finally stumbled upon the tiny cemetery we were looking for.  She taught me respect for those that had passed and also that a cemetery is not a place to fear - but a place of  beauty to be treasured and visited...often.<br>

Thanks again ~ Mrs. Doglvrs <br>
