                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Duncan,<br>
Here is a site that seems to be working from a different angle.  They <br>
don't really seem to be affiliated with any of the hobbies or <br>
interest that they promote, but they seem to have some sort of <br>
business or commercial interest.  On the surface I suppose it's a <br>
good enough thing.  I personally ran far and fast when I found out <br>
that no one who actually letter boxes is familiar with it in this <br>
area....but it may be of use, I wonder what folks in other geographic <br>
areas and/or hobbies have found with it...and the commercial places <br>
that are listed as potential meet-up spots....just something to kick <br>
around.  I hesitate to become "commercially" involved with anything <br>
that I really like.  It's a little like doing what you love as a <br>
career - there is a reason they call it work, and so it stands there <br>
is a reason they call it selling out ;)<br>

Just in general, I hesitate to become "commercially" involved with <br>
anything that I really like.  It's a little like doing what you love <br>
as a career - there is a reason they call it work, and so it stands <br>
there is a reason they call it selling out ;)<br>
<br>
Thanks, it's good that your thinking with a creative mind about <br>
this :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">MiGO did just that for two of its events.  Winter Social 2003 and<br>
Winter Social 2004.  We played a game called Poker Run, where the<br>
object was to visit some caches to collect poker cards and make a<br>
hand.  Bonus cards were placed at local businesses (Mt. Pleasant in<br>
2004, Owosso in 2004).  After both events, the various shops involved<br>
gave high praise to our group for being their customers.<br>
