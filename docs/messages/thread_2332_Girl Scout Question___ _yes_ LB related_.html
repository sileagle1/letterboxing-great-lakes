Leader.  The troop is mostly 2nd graders, she didn't<br/>
say how large, but she said the troop had learned<br/>
about letterboxing from a Connecticut troop they're<br/>
pen pals with and decided to try it themselves.  They<br/>
chose one of our boxes for their first hunt and<br/>
unfortunately didn't find it, and I'm not sure what<br/>
exactly happened but evidently someone who lived by<br/>
the park called the police on them!<br/>

Anyway, having been a Girl Scout myself, I want to<br/>
offer my letterboxing "expertise" to them and offer to<br/>
meet with the troop, maybe accompany them on a hunt<br/>
and/or help them plant a box of their own.  I remember<br/>
FungasWoman saying that a letterboxing badge or<br/>
interest project had been developed, but I think that<br/>
was for the older girls.  Does any one know if there's<br/>
a badge or something that these Brownies can<br/>
incorporate their letterboxing experience into?  Or<br/>
does anyone have any information they've used to teach<br/>
Brownies about the finer details of letterboxing in<br/>
the past they'd be willing to share with me?<br/>

for the 11-17 group right now.  Here is a link to the requirements:<br/>

<br/>
When we started placing boxes at our GS camp a few years ago, I made up a<br/>
checklist of points and concepts I felt were important for the girls to<br/>
understand to be able to successfully go from letterboxing at camp out into<br/>
the "wild" environment of the "real" letterboxing world.  Since our council<br/>
at the time was known as Girl Scouts of Whispering Oaks, I carved a stamp<br/>
with the logo "LbWO".  If the girls could answer all the questions, found at<br/>
least five of the private boxes at camp and one wild box, they were eligible<br/>
for membership in LbWO.<br/>

Doodle, perhaps you can use or adapt this document for the younger girls<br/>
(maybe simplify the language a bit).  I'll send it to you offlist.  (If<br/>
anyone else wants a copy, just ask.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While we are on the topic, I'll give you guys a heads up on a project that's<br/>
due to launch very shortly.  A few of us have been talking between ourselves<br/>
about starting a yahoo group for Girl Scout leaders/advisors/volunteers.  I<br/>
know there are quite a few of you that already belong to this group.  We're<br/>
going to make it a private group not listed in the yahoo directory because<br/>
of Safety-Wise considerations.  I'll post again when things are ready.<br/>
