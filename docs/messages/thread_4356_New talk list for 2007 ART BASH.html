This is the last email about the ART BASH to be sent to this group...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I decided it will be easier to send updates and announcements to a single list rather than many groups.  SO, if you think there is ANY chance you MIGHT attend the ART BASH in Cincinnati OH on Nov. 3rd and 4th -OR- if you just want to learn more about it...<br/>
<br/>
Join this group: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/2007ARTBASH/<br/>
<br/>
If you know of others that could be interested in attending, feel free to direct them to this group.<br/>
<br/>
The 1st and second messages posted to the group may be of interest to you:<br/>
** How to add your name to the list of people looking to share a room<br/>
**A review of last year's ART BASH<br/>
