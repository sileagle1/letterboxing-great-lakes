spending a pleasant morning with Acorn & Golden Boy in downtown Chicago,<br>
capped off with a HUGE and delicious late breakfast at Lou Mitchell's, then<br>
finding a few older Atomic Beans boxes, THEN getting stuck in typical<br>
Chicago traffic, we realized the cemetery would only be open for another 30<br>
minutes so we decided to wait until another day.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We could have had a LB picnic in the cemetery if we all would have met up.<br>

<br>
Glad to hear you have been able to get out, especially on such a nice day as<br>
this!<br>

For the second week in a row we managed to get out and box!! We managed to<br>
find the two boxes that eluded us last weekend and had another beautiful day<br>
cemetary strolling, thanks very much Waltzing Pigs for the walk. Atomic<br>
Beans, I bet you were surprised to find our stamp in a box.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We haven't really told them what they are missing so they don't know where we were yesterday or last week.  Right now it is just easier to leave them behind.  We are working on a solution for when we are all out together.  The upside is that Emily is no longer 100% slackboxer.  She did most of her own walking yesterday and even tried to carry our boxing bag at one point but gave up when she couldn't stand up, "to heavy daddy!"  I think it is funny that there are three boxes, each with a different first finder.<br>
