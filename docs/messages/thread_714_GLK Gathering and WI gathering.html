Speaking of gatherings, I did get a lot of responses for a WI fall<br>
gathering.  It seems a Sunday afternoon would be preferred.  For those<br>
interested, please let me know whether you'd prefer Nov. 14th or 21st<br>
or either or neither.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Just an FYI - the third weekend in June is a big NASCAR race weekend <br>
in the Detroit area - not that it would be a bad thing necessarily <br>
to host an LbGLK event, and I'll definitely be in the area since I'm <br>
married to Mr. NASCAR, but we might want to take that into <br>
consideration since traffic, campgrounds, hotels, etc. will probably <br>
be affected, and there may be problems getting to local boxes for <br>
those of us who would be inclined to do some additional boxing over <br>
that weekend ...<br>

Michigan International Speedway is actually in Brooklyn, which is <br>
just outside of Jackson, about 75 miles SW of Detroit proper.  Guess <br>
it would depend on where the event was planned for, but you are <br>
correct, probably it would be a good idea to avoid anything too far <br>
SW of Detroit.<br>
