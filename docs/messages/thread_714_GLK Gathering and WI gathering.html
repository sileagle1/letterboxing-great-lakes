Speaking of gatherings, I did get a lot of responses for a WI fall<br/>
gathering.  It seems a Sunday afternoon would be preferred.  For those<br/>
interested, please let me know whether you'd prefer Nov. 14th or 21st<br/>
or either or neither.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Just an FYI - the third weekend in June is a big NASCAR race weekend <br/>
in the Detroit area - not that it would be a bad thing necessarily <br/>
to host an LbGLK event, and I'll definitely be in the area since I'm <br/>
married to Mr. NASCAR, but we might want to take that into <br/>
consideration since traffic, campgrounds, hotels, etc. will probably <br/>
be affected, and there may be problems getting to local boxes for <br/>
those of us who would be inclined to do some additional boxing over <br/>
that weekend ...<br/>

Michigan International Speedway is actually in Brooklyn, which is <br/>
just outside of Jackson, about 75 miles SW of Detroit proper.  Guess <br/>
it would depend on where the event was planned for, but you are <br/>
correct, probably it would be a good idea to avoid anything too far <br/>
SW of Detroit.<br/>
