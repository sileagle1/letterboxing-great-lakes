checked on it, and there was substantial water damage to the logbook.<br/>
 Sooo, I plan to remake the logbook and replace the box with something<br/>
a bit more moisture resistant.  <br/>
<br/>
If you live in the area and want to stamp in again when I replace the<br/>
box, that would be great, because right now, your stamps are just big<br/>
blurry blobs, although most of the comments are readable.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows, there might even be an added incentive to anyone who<br/>
decides to visit after the box is replaced.....<br/>
