3 of the Doglvrs went letterboxing this past Sunday, and I wanted to <br>
share this experience with you, because it was so unique.<br>
<br>
We had 3 sets of clues printed up, with no idea where one of them <br>
started.  Off went went to one of the other boxes, and after <br>
sucessfully hunting and rehiding...we headed back to the car.  On the <br>
way there, "Daddy's Girl" says, "Hey Mom, can I see those clues for <br>
that one box?"  Sure thing -- I handed them to her.  She says "I think <br>
I know where this is!  I'm pretty sure I saw it on the way here."  <br>
Alrighty then...back we went.  Sure enough - she had seen it, and after <br>
much cheering and hand slapping - off we wnet on our hunt.  It was <br>
awesome!  I highly reccomend "The Green Mile" if you're ever in the <br>
area.<br>
Way to go Stripey and gang -- keep up the great work!<br>

sure was surprised today.  Dad Lost in China was very impressed to <br>
see that "The Green Mile" hit the group.  Thanks for the endorsement, <br>
