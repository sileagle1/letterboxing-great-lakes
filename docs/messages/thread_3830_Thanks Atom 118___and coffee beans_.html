                    <div class="plaintext-content">We haven't been able to get out and box since our Florida trip in <br>
January...but finally the weather in Chicago was a sunny 55 degree <br>
today!  We decided to do Atom 118 and coffee bean's "Hunt for the <br>
Hidden Hollow" series and a few extras in the same area...Nine miles <br>
and seven out of eight boxes later..we can report that it felt so <br>
good to be outside...at least from the knees up!<br>
Now from the knees down it was a totally different story.  Starting <br>
with the first attempt we realized that all of the snow and ice <br>
accumulated over the winter had to go somewhere as it melted under <br>
the higher temperatures...the paths were all rivers of running water <br>
and mud.  We've never encountered ankle deep mud EVERYWHERE like we <br>
experienced.  But, we figured once we were covered in the slime and <br>
slush what did we have to loose.<br>
We saw at least a hundred deer throughout the day (I'm not <br>
exagerating!)...some within a few feet of us..Obviously, this area <br>
has more Bambi's than people...and they are certainly not afraid of <br>
the two legged folks!<br>
One box was in a stump completely surrounded by a pond in twelve inch <br>
deep water - an island!  Tonto braved the water balancing on fallen <br>
logs to recover the box (which amazingly was high and dry!) and then <br>
replace it.  All he needed was a tutu as he tiptoed across the <br>
tightrope log to enhance the balancing act!  I was very proud of <br>
him!  It was a boxing feat that will be hard to beat!<br>
As for the eighth box attempted...it was buried (if we were in the <br>
correct location) under rushing torrents of the Des Plains River..It <br>
was Atom 118's "A Future Noble"..all we can say is that these <br>
two "masses" looking out on all of that "liquid" and ran out of "gas" <br>
searching for the Future Noble!<br>
We highly recommend this fun series and other close by boxes!...But, <br>
give it a little time to dry out unless you really like mudboxing!<br>
Back at home, we took all of our sopping wet clothes off as we walked <br>
in the back door...our feet looked like prunes, but our hearts were <br>
humming with letterboxing happiness.  Thanks Atom 118 and coffee <br>
beans for a wonderful day of mudwalking! <br>
Oh yeah!  We checked the Bingo words when we got back and to end our <br>
perfect day...we had "Atom 118" in our corner B slot giving us a <br>
Bingo diagonal...now wishing for the other part of the "X"!<br>
Oh happy day!<br>
Tiptoe...and a drying out Tonto<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Woo Hoo!  Sounds like a great day!  We also had problems with a Future <br>
Noble at the end of December due to flooding conditions and realized <br>
it would have to wait for drier weather conditions. Instead of mud, we <br>
had a LOT of snow when we did the HHH series.<br>
<br>
Wish we could have had gone out today, but no boxing for us,and no <br>
words on our Bingo card :-( .  However we did lead a 7-mile hike for <br>
our hiking club and are busy making plans for 3 days in the San Diego <br>
area the weekend of MAR 23-25.  I got a box ready to plant while we're <br>
there and I'm also carving a stamp tonight that will be planted in WI.<br>
<br>
Did you get any photos of Tonto on the log?  I could maybe enhance <br>
them to add a tutu...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">CB and I are happy you had such a fun time with our boxes.  Yea, we are <br>
starting to realize how much the Des Plaines River Trail area floods.  <br>
The Future Noble  box isn't in a flooded area...but you do need (as we <br>
have since found) to walk across a flood-prone stretch to get to <br>
it....on one of our visits to it, I fell in the river while trying to <br>
jump across one of the side streams...and got coated with mud!...<br>
<br>
...as for March being box maintenance month...we did get out on the <br>
trail to reposition a few of our Singing and Boxing boxes.  'Six <br>
Languagues' (with the bonus box), both Wicked Stamps, and 'A Holy Grail' <br>
have been removed.  The 'Holy Grail' is now in the SPAMalot box (two <br>
stamps for one box) and one of the Wicked stamps will be replanted <br>
someplace else along the trail soon.  SO, with the flooding...and it <br>
only being early March....'Magic Foot' was encased below 6 inches of <br>
ice!...hopefully some warmer weather this week might make it possible <br>
for us to finish our maintenance along this part of the trail.<br>
<br>
ON A MORE AMUSING NOTE, while searching for our SPAMalot boxes, we saw a <br>
group of people walking through the woods in a very odd fashion...they <br>
seemed a bit drunk as they would walk one direction, stop, turn, <br>
duck...walk another direction...at first we thought they were looking <br>
for a Geocache which we had heard was nearby (actually one of the <br>
reasons we were moving this box)...it dawned on us that this is what we <br>
must look like to others as they pass us on the trail...a slightly <br>
sobering thought.  So we asked...'you caching?' to which the young lady <br>
said, 'similar but different...its called letterboxing....'  So, they <br>
were, of course, looking for OUR boxes.  After a few laughs about the <br>
whole thing, we did a few exchanges with  Cherry on Top and Music Nerd <br>
who were out boxing with their mom.  They had thought a bit more about <br>
early-March that we had...and had brought along a small shovel to dig up <br>
the boxes....(sorry to all of you who had mentioned digging up boxes...I <br>
thought you had been kidding!)....We spent the next hour-or-so boxing <br>
with the three of them while they tried to find a few of our boxes <br>
before we removed them per our plans.  So, thank you to the three of <br>
them for making our afternoon such fun! (and sorry any incoherent babble <br>
about boxes I may have made....I was perhaps a bit to over-eager and <br>
excited about meeting folks on the trail!!!!)<br>
<br>
In addition to maintenance, we managed to find FM 'Little Lost Stella' <br>
and Kiddy Writers/Hawkeye's 'Boots are Made for Walking'....a fun boxing <br>
day all around!<br>
<br>
And YEA FOR ME!!!!! with the extra B box....I now have a straight line <br>
Bingo...and I'm starting to feel better about my card again.  I hope I <br>
was able to help a few others!<br>
