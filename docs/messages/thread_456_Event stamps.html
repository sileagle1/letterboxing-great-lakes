We are having our annual Dog Scout Picnic. Along with food, games, <br/>
sheepherding and swimming we are planning a letterboxing stop. <br/>
I want to do a special event stamp for the occassion. Since the <br/>
gathering should still be fresh in your minds... what makes a "good" <br/>
event stamp?<br/>

or something unique about the place (a building or natural <br/>
feature).  It is also nice to have the gathering name and date <br/>
spelled on in text on the event stamp.<br/>
