without my "stampin' dots" - from "Stampin' Up".  I was invited to a party, <br>
and went to get 3 or 4 basic ink pads, I love their stamp pads because the <br>
lid is attached.  After asking the demonstrator about the smaller sized <br>
"dots" she was using she informed me that the lids are taped closed when <br>
brand new, so I ordered some.  When they came, I slit open only one side and <br>
whala! the lid stays attached!  The box they come in is the perfect size for <br>
my pack, and I have an assortment of colors available when I find a box.<br>

My must have item is my bag I carry everything in. It sounds pretty basic but I can't picture a more perfect bag for boxing. It's a diaper bag I found at a garage sale a year ago. It has many compartments for all the stuff I carry on the trail, and believe me I have ALOT of stuff I carry around. It has a nice flat bottom where I keep my plastic box full of stamp pads, a nice circular zippered thingy for my inking pens (probably intended for a bottle) mesh pockets for keeping clues and misc paper out of the way, two shallow plastic trays which house my signature stamp and extra baggies of all sizes and paper towels for trailside maintenence of boxes I find in need of some TLC, a neat side zipper pouch which has pen holders and more compartments for storing my flashlight, compass, leatherman pocket knife/scissors/screwdriver/ and other things I'll probably never use, stamp cleaner (it looks like a bingo dauber), and side zipper pocket that I use for my cell phone. Best of all it is<br>
 relatively small for all that it holds, it's only 12"x12"x8", has a shoulder strap so I can fling it over my back, and is a nice shade of dark blue. It used to have a changing pad which was great to sit or kneel on in less than ideal trail conditions, unfortunately it's somewhere in Wisconsin right now (where is the question, I'll never see it again). Sorry for the long post, but I'm quite fond of my bag. If you'll be at Lapham Peak State Park on June 3rd ask me and I'll show it to you.<br>
