Bindle Bum and I will be leaving Elk Rapids July 1st aboard our<br/>
sailboat, Bindlestiff and heading toward our 2 month Lake Superior trip.<br/>

It all depends on the weather, of course, but it's likely we'll be in<br/>
the Straights area (maybe as far as Hessel) for the 4th holiday.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe those of us planning to be in the area should try to have our a<br/>
"mini-meet" and get together.  What do you think?<br/>
