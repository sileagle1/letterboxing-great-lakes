                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone!  A big welcome to all of the new members who have <br/>
joined the group in the past few weeks!<br/>
<br/>
For this week's Topic of the Week, I am posing a challenge instead <br/>
of a question.  I think most people get started boxing by looking <br/>
for letterboxes.  But eventually most letterboxers also begin <br/>
planting boxes of their own.  I think it is at that point, once you <br/>
have planted your first few boxes, that you really begin to have an <br/>
appreciation for the game and everything that goes into the creation <br/>
of the letterboxes you have been hunting for.  <br/>
<br/>
So, my challenge is for everyone to create plant a letterbox.  I <br/>
think for some, taking that step to place a box and write clues is a <br/>
bit scary -- will people like my box, will I do it right?  But <br/>
believe me, there is no right or wrong way to do it, there is no <br/>
secret to a perfect letterbox.  Sure, as you get more involved in <br/>
the game, perhaps you will focus on themes or the historic <br/>
significance of a location and those are great boxes, but not a <br/>
requirement for a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
So, I am challenging you to just do it!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I was going to challenge everyone to create a mystery box, <br/>
but decided some of the newer members may not be comfortable with <br/>
that, especially if they have not yet found a mystery box.  And I <br/>
also realize that even some of the more seasoned letterboxers are <br/>
just not the mystery box type.  So, I am not specifying any <br/>
particular kind of box -- just plant a box!  It would be nice to see <br/>
some mystery boxes come from this though -- so if you've been <br/>
thinking about one -- challenge yourself a bit and give it a try.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping this challenge will generate some discussion and <br/>
questions on the list about how to do this, or what is the best way <br/>
people have found to do this, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
When you have your box planted, post the clues to the LbNA web site <br/>
or on your own web site or perhaps you want to post only to this <br/>
list -- it is up to you.  But let us know what you have done -- of <br/>
course, without giving away any mysteries.<br/>
<br/>
Just do it!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mystery boxes really fascinate me, so I'd be very interested in a <br/>
discussion on this thread.  So far, there is no such thing as a <br/>
generic mystery box. Each one I have found has been unique, <br/>
particularly imbued with the personality of its creator.  This is <br/>
because there is so much work that goes into developing a <br/>
good mystery, the creator just shines through in every element of <br/>
the box.<br/>
<br/>
For my personal taste, a great mystery box includes a fun story <br/>
or framework, some research I can conduct before I get out in <br/>
the field, clever clues (I don't mind having to return a few times--<br/>
right TT? ;-&gt;), and of course a good stamp. It's an added bonus <br/>
for me if the creator includes puzzles, ciphers, codes, rebus, <br/>
anagrams or other forms of play.<br/>
<br/>
The "quality" of the stamp is less important to me than the <br/>
process by which I found it.  Nonetheless, I delight in skilled <br/>
carving, or clever jokes embedded in the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
My sometime letterboxing partner (and dear husband), is more <br/>
goal-driven than process-oriented.  Sometimes, that's just what I <br/>
need to finally track down the mystery.  We were boxing in <br/>
another state, I had done the preliminary research to find the <br/>
right site.  I was, however, given wrong information by the local <br/>
tourist board and we were continually misdirected by locals <br/>
throughout a long day of tracking down the mystery box.  After <br/>
making a circuit around the entire county, we finally located the <br/>
box two blocks from where we began that morning.  It was a little <br/>
too much "process" at the time, but we still laugh about it and <br/>
how he just wouldn't give up.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to hear other stories and comments on mystery boxes.<br/>

OOOH...I just love a challenge! I've got two boxes<br/>
ready to be planted this weekend...and<br/>
yesterday...while working (I'm a home-based social<br/>
worker), took one of the kids I work with out scouting<br/>
for new locations for letterboxes in my county. We<br/>
went to a couple of places we really didn't know<br/>
existed! I just got a huge hunk 'o Mastercarve and am<br/>
ready to make some stamps (my favorite part!)My<br/>
ultimate goal is to keep the P and F counts equal or<br/>
near equal. <br/>
<br/>
Plant and plant away!<br/>

our idea is to have some kind of series for Ingham county parks here in mid-michigan.<br/>

Yeah- you SE Michigan 'boxers.  As is, that woman planting all those boxes on Grosse Ile is winning my "who can plant the most boxes" challenge (see archives).  And she's not even ON the list, so she's not a candidate.  So that leaves ME as the current leader with five planted this summer and two more waiting, and I can't win my own challenge!<br/>
<br/>
 SOOO, you "I like summer too much to plant a box" people, if you won't take up my challenge, take up Spring Chick's challenge.  Plant more boxes!  I only need 22 more to make it to my big 100 milestone.<br/>

I tend to think of planting boxes in series rather than <br/>
individually.  I think that comes from how I like to find boxes.  If <br/>
I'm traveling to an area I like to make it really worthwhile and find <br/>
more than one box.  There aren't a lot of boxes near me so I tend to <br/>
plant in series to return the favor to other boxers.<br/>

I'll take the challenge offered to get moving and finish some other <br/>
boxes that are in various stages of completion.<br/>

&gt; For this week's Topic of the Week, I am posing a challenge instead <br/>
&gt; of a question.  I think most people get started boxing by looking <br/>
&gt; for letterboxes.  But eventually most letterboxers also begin <br/>
&gt; planting boxes of their own.  I think it is at that point, once <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; have planted your first few boxes, that you really begin to have <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; appreciation for the game and everything that goes into the <br/>
creation <br/>
&gt; of the letterboxes you have been hunting for.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, my challenge is for everyone to create plant a letterbox.  I <br/>
&gt; think for some, taking that step to place a box and write clues is <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; bit scary -- will people like my box, will I do it right?  But <br/>
&gt; believe me, there is no right or wrong way to do it, there is no <br/>
&gt; secret to a perfect letterbox.  Sure, as you get more involved in <br/>
&gt; the game, perhaps you will focus on themes or the historic <br/>
&gt; significance of a location and those are great boxes, but not a <br/>
&gt; requirement for a letterbox.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I am challenging you to just do it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, I was going to challenge everyone to create a mystery <br/>
box, <br/>
&gt; but decided some of the newer members may not be comfortable with <br/>
&gt; that, especially if they have not yet found a mystery box.  And I <br/>
&gt; also realize that even some of the more seasoned letterboxers are <br/>
&gt; just not the mystery box type.  So, I am not specifying any <br/>
&gt; particular kind of box -- just plant a box!  It would be nice to <br/>
see <br/>
&gt; some mystery boxes come from this though -- so if you've been <br/>
&gt; thinking about one -- challenge yourself a bit and give it a try.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am hoping this challenge will generate some discussion and <br/>
&gt; questions on the list about how to do this, or what is the best <br/>
way <br/>
&gt; people have found to do this, etc.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you have your box planted, post the clues to the LbNA web <br/>
site <br/>
&gt; or on your own web site or perhaps you want to post only to this <br/>
&gt; list -- it is up to you.  But let us know what you have done -- of <br/>

Of course, you are free to plant as many as you like...  For those who have<br/>

mystery does take a considerable amount of time.  The intention was to give<br/>
a little kick in the butt for those who have been hesitating or even for<br/>
those who have kind of gone stale.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn't necessarily call it "the easy way to F10."  For me, I'd call it <br/>
more "letterboxing isn't the only thing I do in life."  I don't want to sit at a <br/>
computer or sit in a library and do a bunch of research about clues.  And <br/>
neither do the kiddies who sometimes accompany me outdoors.  If I read a set of <br/>
"mystery" clues and recognize the landmark right off, fine.  If not, I won't <br/>
spend a lot of time indoors doing the research.  I have to research enough stuff <br/>
indoors, I don't want to add letterboxing clues to the mix.<br/>
<br/>
I'm outside as much as possible.  I have an outdoors government job, but <br/>
that's far from enough "outdoors" for me.  I also do outdoor photography as a <br/>
hobby, and I take small groups of underprivileged kids on hiking and camping field <br/>
trips.  So finding letterboxes along the way is just a little icing on the <br/>
cake, so to speak. What hooked me on letterboxing was it's ability to fit into <br/>
my lifestyle so easily.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I was just down at the Little Red Schoolhouse in Willow Springs, <br/>
IL.   Not being in Cook County much, I never even knew the place existed.  <br/>
But being an alkaline area rather than an acidic area, the kids &amp; I got to see <br/>
plant life that was a little different.  They also got to see the huge <br/>
domination of grey squirrels compared to our area further north where the red squirrel <br/>
predominates and pushes out the gray.  At first, they were constantly amazed <br/>
at the "baby squirrels" running all over the place.   They were more amazed <br/>
when they found out that those weren't babies, they were just a smaller, softer <br/>
species.  And it was a good way to introduce some of them to the concept of <br/>
species, subspecies, etc on a living level.  We also got to see a teeny tiny <br/>
little snapping turtle hatch out of it's shell, and marvel about how, at only <br/>
being minutes old, it looked just as grumpy as an adult.  They got to get a <br/>
little bit upclose and personal with the view of thousands of lilypads, which <br/>
they'd never seen before, and were amazed to see birds actually walk across the <br/>
lilypads in search of insects.  And they got to see a Great Blue Heron rise up in <br/>
flight -- not a scene new to them, but something that's always a beautiful <br/>
sight.  And since an awfully lot of people walk the trails out there, they got a <br/>
lot more practice in pretending to be CIA operatives.    <br/>
<br/>
The other day we were at the Graue Mill and the kids were helping me come up <br/>
with clues for planting boxes and helping me scout out good hiding places.  <br/>
But at the same time, they learned all about the workings of a grist mill, saw <br/>
the (supposedly) oldest house in DuPage County, learned about the Underground <br/>
Railroad, learned that Fullerburg Forest Preserve has the worst smelling <br/>
latrines that they've come across to date, learned a little something about the <br/>
Native Americans that lived along Salt Creek waaay waaaay back, learned a lot <br/>
about the likes and dislikes of the huge cottonwood trees that are a major species <br/>
there, finally got upclose and personal with some female goldfinches (they'd <br/>
only noticed the flashy males to date), and found out that just like human <br/>
females, female goldfinches do indeed have a voice of their own, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, when it comes to letterboxing, I like the fact that there's <br/>
something for everybody.  Options.  Americans are big on options.  :-)  For the <br/>
most part, I like the option of having my letterboxing fit in with the other <br/>
stuff I'm doing out there.  <br/>

<br/>
Frankly I am impressed with anyone who gets off their butt and gets outside<br/>
to letterbox -- no matter how easy or difficult the find or the placement.<br/>
Everyone looks for something different in this hobby -- some people are<br/>
attracted to the creative aspects, some to long hiking adventures, others to<br/>
puzzling clues and still others embrace the hobby because it is a<br/>
combination of all of these things -- take as much or little of each as you<br/>
like.  Although traditionally letterboxing has been a cloak and dagger kind<br/>
of thing with mysterious locations and cryptic clues playing a big part in<br/>
the inception of the hobby, I do realize that the hobby has evolved to be<br/>
much broader than that in order to accommodate a much more diverse group of<br/>
participants.  Mystery boxes are certainly not everyone's cup of tea<br/>
(although not all mystery boxes require extensive indoor research), and<br/>
neither are long, challenging hikes -- heck, we all have different<br/>
definitions of what a "long, challenging hike" even is.<br/>
<br/>
However, I cannot help being especially impressed when a new boxer attempts<br/>
some of the tougher finds -- either in terms of challenging clues,<br/>
out-of-the-way places or a grueling hike.  It makes me feel like, "Yes...<br/>
they get it!"  as I do feel it is important for participants to understand<br/>
the roots and "underground" aspects of the hobby -- if for no other reason<br/>
than to have a respect for the efforts of people who choose to adhere to<br/>
that standard of play.  That is not to make anyone else's effort or style of<br/>
play insignificant or even categorize it as "easy" as that is something each<br/>
person defines for himself.<br/>

I've never been able to find anything that mentions the inception of <br/>
traditional letterboxing to be cloak and daggerish with the addition of the <br/>
mysterious.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I have sat down and tried to take time to do was to research online <br/>
the history of letterboxing.  What I seem to be basically coming up with is <br/>
the fact that it was pretty open when it first began with the one gentleman in <br/>
Dartmoor and his clients, and once it moved to the U.S., elaborate mysteries <br/>
became common in the U.S.  And now they're also popular in the U.K.  But I <br/>
haven't found any history of letterboxing that includes cloak &amp; dagger activities, <br/>
mysterious locations, and cryptic clues in the *inception* of letterboxing.  <br/>
Physical challenges, yes, to get to those particular places out on the moors.  <br/>
And, a little later, being able to navigate a map/grid.  It seems to me to <br/>
have merely started out as an "I Was Here" sort of thing -- the idea that <br/>
I-made-this-here-long-hike-&amp;-I-can-prove-it.<br/>
<br/>
But it seems to me from reading the various short histories out there that <br/>
the cloak &amp; dagger/mysterious stuff evolved from the first ideas of letterboxing <br/>
the same as other evolutions have been made from the first ideas of <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>

You know what? I just went to cia.gov and searched for "black ops" -- and <br/>

that the CIA has never engaged in any kind of subversive operations, right?<br/>

&gt; So, anyway, when it comes to letterboxing, I like<br/>
&gt; the fact that there's something for everybody.  <br/>
&gt; Options.  Americans are<br/>
&gt; big on options.  :-)  For the <br/>
&gt; most part, I like the option of having my<br/>
&gt; letterboxing fit in with the other <br/>
&gt; stuff I'm doing out there.  <br/>
<br/>
I think this is what I like best about<br/>
letterboxing...it can accompany a wide arrange of<br/>
interests, skill levels, physical abilities...many<br/>
options, as Pippi has expressed. ANYONE can<br/>
participate in this activity. There are options for<br/>
the non-artistic (store bought), options for the<br/>
physically challenged (drive-ups or wheelchair<br/>
access), options for everyone. I think a variety of<br/>
boxes available is a good thing. I've planted an easy<br/>
box, an easy mystery box, a super-easy mystery box (if<br/>
one can get the easy mystery box). I'm working on a<br/>
few ideas for some more challenging boxes, with puzzle<br/>
clues and requiring some research. It's funny, the<br/>
super-easy mystery box was supposed to be much more<br/>
difficult clue wise, but after hours of research I<br/>
realized that it would probably never be found unless<br/>
I toned it down a little. During this round of<br/>
research I discovered that a town that's fairly well<br/>
known went by another name for most of its history.<br/>
This tasty nugget will definitely show up in a clue<br/>
sometime. I personally LOVE the research, puzzles, and<br/>
challenge of some of the mystery clues. I've been<br/>
looking at some of Mapsurfer's clues and wishing I<br/>
lived a little closer to PA to give 'em a try. He's<br/>
got one in OH, but I'll be with my mom...who is<br/>
non-directional, non-clue solving, non-artistic....but<br/>
she likes to hike, God bless her! I have no kids, no<br/>
significant other, so spending an entire night<br/>
figuring out clues is what I call FUN! I think all<br/>
boxes serve a purpose, such as an easy box giving<br/>
newbies opportunities to learn the ropes and the more<br/>
difficult boxes for those hungering for challenges.<br/>
It's pretty awesome...letterboxing...it fits in with<br/>
most of my favorite things: artistry, history, nature,<br/>
geography, etc. Awesome.<br/>
<br/>
30 minutes and i'll be out the door towards that<br/>
Bowling Green box....<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

I would find out by the fact that the beginnings of letter boxing as far as <br/>
the *inception* of letterboxing *are* known.  The original poster talked about <br/>
the inception of letterboxing, not the inception of letterboxing in the U.S.  <br/>
And, as regards the U.S.,  I think it's your own site that mentions that <br/>
mystery boxes in the U.S. had *become* popular, leading one to believe that wasn't <br/>
what was here originally.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I prefer to think of letterboxing's roots as being an "underground" <br/>

&gt;part of the birth of US letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting the word out because boxes might get easily destroyed and damaged <br/>
by negligent people or people bent on vandalism is one thing.  And that may <br/>
well have been part of the birth of *U.S.* letterboxing.  What was mentioned <br/>
was the cloak and dagger routine and the "mystery" of having to research and <br/>
solve more complicated clues in order to find a box.  And that also may have been <br/>
part of the birth of *U.S.* letterboxing, but I'm not finding it mentioned <br/>
anywhere in the various histories I've read.  This is from the original post:  <br/>
<br/>
"Although traditionally letterboxing has been a cloak and dagger kind<br/>

participants."<br/>
<br/>
There's no mention of U.S. in there.   And I've not been able to find where <br/>
that was part of the beginnings of letterboxing in the Dartmoor area.  Once one <br/>
takes a game and changes it, the game is changed.  If someone else then <br/>
changes it yet again, that doesn't really give the original changers permission to <br/>
stand up and cry "Foul!  Only OUR changes are legitimate."     <br/>
<br/>
So, in my humble opinion, unless one is actually taking a long physically <br/>
strenuous hike out on a moor and back bringing home the "mark" of having been <br/>
there and back, none of it's original and thus none is better than any other.   <br/>
These were the remarks of the original poster:<br/>
<br/>
"However, I cannot help being especially impressed when a new boxer attempts<br/>
some of the tougher finds -- either in terms of challenging clues,<br/>
out-of-the-way places or a grueling hike.  It makes me feel like, "Yes...<br/>
they get it!"  as I do feel it is important for participants to understand<br/>
the roots and "underground" aspects of the hobby -- if for no other reason<br/>
than to have a respect for the efforts of people who choose to adhere to<br/>
that standard of play.  That is not to make anyone else's effort or style of<br/>
play insignificant or even categorize it as "easy" as that is something each<br/>
person defines for himself."<br/>
<br/>
I just simply disagree with this.  Why expect respect for a style of playing <br/>
the game that was evolved from the original in the first place?  What's "to <br/>
get"?  A grueling hike I can understand.  If a person undertakes finding a <br/>
letterbox that's a grueling hike, then I can see where a person would get the <br/>
feeling, if that were important to the person, of how the first letterboxers must <br/>
have felt making the trek across the rather physically challenging moors.  <br/>
Anything else tho, and it wasn't part of the original game plan in the first <br/>
place.   From what I've gotten from my reading, the original places may have been <br/>
"out of the way" but they were well mapped.  It was just difficult work gettin' <br/>
to 'em and someone was thought a little more highly of if they had made that <br/>
trek.  Kind of like, if I climb Mt. Everest, folks will respect me for my <br/>
knowledge of mountain climbing and survival skills.  If I climb Jackson Hill, a <br/>
local toboggan hill about a quarter of a mile from me, folks won't look at me <br/>
with quite the same awe.  I certainly don't know for sure, but I can imagine <br/>
that's how it was back in the days of the beginnings of letterboxing, people <br/>
saying "Wow, you went all the way out there and back and survived?  I'm <br/>
impressed."    <br/>
<br/>
If would be as if we brought cricket over to this country, changed all the <br/>
rules, and then got ticked if someone else wanted to come along and change the <br/>
rules even more.  That just doesn't compute in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I don't care if someone goes on a grueling hike to reach a <br/>
letterbox, or whether it's a mom hiking a short limestone path with a five year old, <br/>
it's all the same.   They each have a reason for what they're doing and how <br/>
they're doing it, and that reason carries importance to their own soul.  It's <br/>
really nobody else's business.     <br/>
<br/>
I think what possibly might be irritating to some folks is the fact that <br/>
letterboxing just might <gasp> <gasp> <gasp>  become mainstream.   And as a <br/>
member of the bdsm community, I can certainly understand how bloody awful that <br/>
might be.  :-)   Good heavens, placers and seekers might soon end up with agents <br/>
and million dollar contracts, and we might end up with Letterboxing Camps in <br/>
the Dominican Republic.  There'd be no end in sight. <br/>
<br/>
And one of the problems is that there's no reason for the hobby *not* to <br/>
become mainstream.  In other words, nothing to really turn anybody off about it at <br/>
a core/gut level.  The idea of which might actually make it a turn-off for <br/>
some letterboxers.  :-)     <br/>

<br/>
As for the beginnings of letterboxing on Dartmoor...  Have you ever read any<br/>
of those clues?  You think some of the U.S. boxes are cryptic?  Try some of<br/>
those.  I would also consider the fact that a person has to find 100 boxes<br/>
before they can even get their hands on the clues to qualify as a "cloak and<br/>
dagger" (def. "dealing in or suggestive of melodramatic intrigue and<br/>
action") activity.<br/>
<br/>
You are entitled to your opinions and respect, or lack of respect, for those<br/>
who came before you and made this hobby what it is.  As is each one of us<br/>
who play the game today.  As for me, I look at the roots of letterboxing (in<br/>
the U.S.) -- the likes of people like The Orient Express, MapSurfer, Der Mad<br/>
Stamper and Legerdemaine, just to name a few.  To me these people are true<br/>
players and I have a huge amount of respect for them and the way they shaped<br/>
the hobby here in the U.S.  I am not saying everyone has to play like that,<br/>
quite to the contrary, I think I very clearly pointed out that each person<br/>
is free to choose the style of play that works best for them.  I do however<br/>
think those who came before us deserve to be respected for the groundwork<br/>
they have laid and they way they played the game.<br/>
<br/>
And with that, I agree to disagree.<br/>

have been<br/>
&gt; "out of the way" but they were well mapped.  It was just difficult work<br/>
gettin'<br/>

that<br/>

me<br/>

imagine<br/>
&gt; that's how it was back in the days of the beginnings of letterboxing,<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; saying "Wow, you went all the way out there and back and survived?  I'm<br/>
&gt; impressed."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If would be as if we brought cricket over to this country, changed all the<br/>

the<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Frankly, I don't care if someone goes on a grueling hike to reach a<br/>
&gt; letterbox, or whether it's a mom hiking a short limestone path with a five<br/>
year old,<br/>
&gt; it's all the same.   They each have a reason for what they're doing and<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; they're doing it, and that reason carries importance to their own soul.<br/>
It's<br/>
&gt; really nobody else's business.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think what possibly might be irritating to some folks is the fact that<br/>
&gt; letterboxing just might <gasp> <gasp> <gasp>  become mainstream.   And<br/>
as a<br/>

that<br/>

agents<br/>
&gt; and million dollar contracts, and we might end up with Letterboxing Camps<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the Dominican Republic.  There'd be no end in sight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And one of the problems is that there's no reason for the hobby *not* to<br/>

about it at<br/>

If I've made this up, then please forgive me (and check me into a hospital, because my hallucinations have grown ever worse), but if I'm right, then wouldn't that be part of the cloak and dagger parentage?  100 boxes is a big deal even when the clues are right there on a website, but 100 word-of-mouth boxes?

&gt;&gt;I've never been able to find anything that mentions the inception of<br/>
&gt;&gt;traditional letterboxing to be cloak and daggerish with the addition of the<br/>
&gt;&gt;mysterious.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Except ... how would you ever find out about the mystery/cloak-and-dagger <br/>
&gt;elements of US letterboxing, since wouldn't that be part of the secret?<br/>
<br/>
I would find out by the fact that the beginnings of letter boxing as far as <br/>
the *inception* of letterboxing *are* known.  The original poster talked about <br/>
the inception of letterboxing, not the inception of letterboxing in the U.S.  <br/>
And, as regards the U.S.,  I think it's your own site that mentions that <br/>
mystery boxes in the U.S. had *become* popular, leading one to believe that wasn't <br/>
what was here originally.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I prefer to think of letterboxing's roots as being an "underground" <br/>
&gt;activity -- running under the radar of the general public, various <br/>
&gt;authorities, etc. That element of letterboxing still exists, but has been <br/>
&gt;diluted quite a bit by the growth of the activity. But it was undeniably <br/>
&gt;part of the birth of US letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting the word out because boxes might get easily destroyed and damaged <br/>
by negligent people or people bent on vandalism is one thing.  And that may <br/>
well have been part of the birth of *U.S.* letterboxing.  What was mentioned <br/>
was the cloak and dagger routine and the "mystery" of having to research and <br/>
solve more complicated clues in order to find a box.  And that also may have been <br/>
part of the birth of *U.S.* letterboxing, but I'm not finding it mentioned <br/>
anywhere in the various histories I've read.  This is from the original post:  <br/>
<br/>
"Although traditionally letterboxing has been a cloak and dagger kind<br/>
of thing with mysterious locations and cryptic clues playing a big part in<br/>
the inception of the hobby, I do realize that the hobby has evolved to be<br/>
much broader than that in order to accommodate a much more diverse group of<br/>
participants."<br/>
<br/>
There's no mention of U.S. in there.   And I've not been able to find where <br/>
that was part of the beginnings of letterboxing in the Dartmoor area.  Once one <br/>
takes a game and changes it, the game is changed.  If someone else then <br/>
changes it yet again, that doesn't really give the original changers permission to <br/>
stand up and cry "Foul!  Only OUR changes are legitimate."     <br/>
<br/>
So, in my humble opinion, unless one is actually taking a long physically <br/>
strenuous hike out on a moor and back bringing home the "mark" of having been <br/>
there and back, none of it's original and thus none is better than any other.   <br/>
These were the remarks of the original poster:<br/>
<br/>
"However, I cannot help being especially impressed when a new boxer attempts<br/>
some of the tougher finds -- either in terms of challenging clues,<br/>
out-of-the-way places or a grueling hike.  It makes me feel like, "Yes...<br/>
they get it!"  as I do feel it is important for participants to understand<br/>
the roots and "underground" aspects of the hobby -- if for no other reason<br/>
than to have a respect for the efforts of people who choose to adhere to<br/>
that standard of play.  That is not to make anyone else's effort or style of<br/>
play insignificant or even categorize it as "easy" as that is something each<br/>
person defines for himself."<br/>
<br/>
I just simply disagree with this.  Why expect respect for a style of playing <br/>
the game that was evolved from the original in the first place?  What's "to <br/>
get"?  A grueling hike I can understand.  If a person undertakes finding a <br/>
letterbox that's a grueling hike, then I can see where a person would get the <br/>
feeling, if that were important to the person, of how the first letterboxers must <br/>
have felt making the trek across the rather physically challenging moors.  <br/>
Anything else tho, and it wasn't part of the original game plan in the first <br/>

As for the beginnings of letterboxing on Dartmoor...  Have you ever read any<br/>

those.  I would also consider the fact that a person has to find 100 boxes<br/>
before they can even get their hands on the clues to qualify as a "cloak and<br/>
dagger" (def. "dealing in or suggestive of melodramatic intrigue and<br/>
action") activity.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Except for the fact that that's not how letterboxing started out.  You talked <br/>
about the inception of letterboxing.  Inception = beginning, start, <br/>
comencement, origin, root.  You're talking about "roots" that were, themselves, changes <br/>
however.  <br/>
<br/>
At it's inception, letterboxing didn't have 100 boxes to find, nor did it <br/>
have for quite some time.  By the time over 100 letterboxes existed, I'd say that <br/>
quite a few changes had been made since the inception of letterboxing.<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

<br/>
Yes!  That's exactly what I thought when I hit the various websites reading <br/>
about the history of letterboxing.  Hey, this was geocaching, not letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
And I really like the calling card idea.  Wish they hadn't changed *that* <br/>
part of it.    <br/>
<br/>
I read on one of the websites that in Europe, commercial stamps are <br/>
considered the way to go and hand carved are kind of looked down on?   To me, <br/>
commercial stamps, if made specifically for an individual (like calling cards are) are <br/>
one-way-twuer than hand carved stamps.  That was one reason, when I did my <br/>
personal stamp, that it's actually my same logo that's on my calling cards.  I <br/>
designed my cards myself, so it's "me" since I'm using my personal logo as an <br/>
artist but it has the calling card idea behind it.  That, for me, helps me pay <br/>
homage to the original idea of all of this in my own mind.     <br/>
<br/>
When I first enfolded letterboxing into my lifestyle, I sorta kinda sorta <br/>
considered buckin' the trend and leaving calling cards instead, but figured nooo, <br/>
folks might not appreciate the thought (or humour) behind it, so better to <br/>
leave well enough alone. <br/>
<br/>
The original history was one reason a couple of friends of mine almost didn't <br/>
get into letterboxing.  They read the history first, and thought, oh no, the <br/>
unendurable hikes they could endure and have fun with, but the idea of working <br/>
heavy duty with grids, compasses, longitudes &amp; latitudes, etc. almost made <br/>
'em pass out.   Orienteering R Us, they're not.  I told 'em go read the clues <br/>
for the boxes, that they'd find more than enough boxes in the Great Lakes area <br/>
that never go beyond the most rudimentary of actual compass directives.  That, <br/>
for many boxes, the old Boy Scout compass they grew up loving to hate would <br/>
suffice quite well.  And they've found the "mystery" boxes and that type of clue <br/>
solving to be very much to their liking.<br/>
<br/>
Yep, bring back the calling cards!      <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Um, OK, for the record, my response below was meant to<br/>
be devil's advocate pointing out how silly we all on<br/>
the list were getting about delving into the "history"<br/>
of the game and how it was originally "meant to be<br/>
played" at its "inception."  I personally like how we<br/>
play the game in the US, and do believe it's a bit of<br/>
a cloak and dagger operation and believe that we need<br/>
to keep it like that with the influx of media that's<br/>
been going on.  Simply because too much attention<br/>
truly destroys a good thing and ruins its original<br/>
essence, ie the Beat Generation (and if anyone really<br/>
wants, I could draw remarkable parallels between the<br/>
Beats and Letterboxing in the US right now, but I'm<br/>
sure we've all got better things to do :)<br/>
<br/>
Things change and evolve over time, and it's a good<br/>
thing.  It's necessary for survival.  Yes, the first<br/>
guy in Dartmoor left a calling card on the moor.  Why,<br/>
who knows with those crazy Brits.  But others found<br/>
it, decided it was a good idea, turned it into a game,<br/>
decided to start using stamps instead (maybe because<br/>
calling cards went out of style?), and then this funny<br/>
little game they invented came to the US, and we're<br/>
playing it in the US, where we made more changes so<br/>
the game could survive here.  Dartmoor letterboxing<br/>
and US letterboxing are not the same thing, as people<br/>
have often pointed out on the big list (ie, the<br/>
majority of clues are readily available for us rather<br/>
than having to scour the moor hoping to stumble upon<br/>
100 boxes so that we can finally get a list of where<br/>
those 100 boxes were placed).  This is not a bad<br/>
thing.  McDonalds in Costa Rica is not the same thing<br/>
as McDonalds in the US -- Letterboxing ain't the only<br/>
thing that's been changed once imported.  <br/>
<br/>
So, since we're playing in the US, if one wants to go<br/>
by the "inception of the game" and "how it was truly<br/>
meant to be played," check out the history of how the<br/>
game started over here, since this is where we're<br/>
playing it and it's not played the same way as over<br/>
there.  Bring back the calling cards?  How can we<br/>
bring back something that was never a part of the game<br/>
we're playing on this side of the ocean?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I just had a thought.  If anyone's really<br/>
concerned about the history of the game and how it's<br/>
gotten all fuddled, contact Louise Donovan (see post<br/>
42476 of the Big List's archives).  If anyone knows<br/>
everything there is to know about letterboxing, it's<br/>
got to be the gal doing her dissertation on it.<br/>

&gt; But, if we're going to go by "the inception of<br/>

&gt; the very core of letterboxing and what makes it<br/>
&gt; letterboxing as opposed to geocaching, because it's<br/>
&gt; said that the first original letterboxer left a<br/>
&gt; calling card.  Stamp images had nothing to do with<br/>
&gt; what he started.  And actually, from what I've seen<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; a letterbox/geocache hybrid I found recently, there<br/>
&gt; were geocacher calling cards left in the box.  By<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; above logic, would that mean that geocachers are<br/>
&gt; operating truer to letterboxing as it was at "the<br/>
&gt; inception of letterboxing" than us letterboxers?  <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes!  That's exactly what I thought when I hit the<br/>
&gt; various websites reading <br/>
&gt; about the history of letterboxing.  Hey, this was<br/>
&gt; geocaching, not letterboxing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I really like the calling card idea.  Wish they<br/>
&gt; hadn't changed *that* <br/>
&gt; part of it.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I read on one of the websites that in Europe,<br/>
&gt; commercial stamps are <br/>
&gt; considered the way to go and hand carved are kind of<br/>
&gt; looked down on?   To me, <br/>
&gt; commercial stamps, if made specifically for an<br/>
&gt; individual (like calling cards are) are <br/>
&gt; one-way-twuer than hand carved stamps.  That was one<br/>
&gt; reason, when I did my <br/>
&gt; personal stamp, that it's actually my same logo<br/>
&gt; that's on my calling cards.  I <br/>
&gt; designed my cards myself, so it's "me" since I'm<br/>
&gt; using my personal logo as an <br/>
&gt; artist but it has the calling card idea behind it. <br/>
&gt; That, for me, helps me pay <br/>
&gt; homage to the original idea of all of this in my own<br/>
&gt; mind.     <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I first enfolded letterboxing into my<br/>
&gt; lifestyle, I sorta kinda sorta <br/>
&gt; considered buckin' the trend and leaving calling<br/>
&gt; cards instead, but figured nooo, <br/>
&gt; folks might not appreciate the thought (or humour)<br/>
&gt; behind it, so better to <br/>
&gt; leave well enough alone. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The original history was one reason a couple of<br/>
&gt; friends of mine almost didn't <br/>
&gt; get into letterboxing.  They read the history first,<br/>
&gt; and thought, oh no, the <br/>
&gt; unendurable hikes they could endure and have fun<br/>
&gt; with, but the idea of working <br/>
&gt; heavy duty with grids, compasses, longitudes &amp;<br/>
&gt; latitudes, etc. almost made <br/>
&gt; 'em pass out.   Orienteering R Us, they're not.  I<br/>
&gt; told 'em go read the clues <br/>
&gt; for the boxes, that they'd find more than enough<br/>
&gt; boxes in the Great Lakes area <br/>
&gt; that never go beyond the most rudimentary of actual<br/>
&gt; compass directives.  That, <br/>
&gt; for many boxes, the old Boy Scout compass they grew<br/>
&gt; up loving to hate would <br/>
&gt; suffice quite well.  And they've found the "mystery"<br/>
&gt; boxes and that type of clue <br/>
&gt; solving to be very much to their liking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yep, bring back the calling cards!      <br/>

Not sure where you read that, but it certainly is not consistent with <br/>
anything I have ever read or heard.  Actually from what I understand <br/>
in the U.K. carved stamp images are often much more intricate and <br/>
detailed, and letterboxers who are not comfortable carving usually <br/>
design a stamp to have custom made.  Just as in the U.S., store <br/>
bought commercial stamps are generally not as sought after.<br/>

&gt; Yep, bring back the calling cards!      <br/>

You're kidding right?  The [hand-carved] stamp is such a core part of <br/>

I do orienteering and give orienteering seminars and classes, I do <br/>
geocaching, and now I also do letterboxing.  I check and do whichever is going on in <br/>
whatever area I'm going to be in at a particular time.   Of the three, I <br/>
definitely prefer orienteering, and as old as I am, I can still kick plenty of butt.  <br/>

<br/>
No, I'm not kidding.  Y'see, I don't really care that "the [hand-carved] <br/>
stamps is such a core part of letterboxing in the U.S."  and all that rot.  I was <br/>
giving my own personal opinion because my personal feelings would go back to <br/>
the actual inception in Dartmoor.  I would have preferred the calling cards, I <br/>
like that idea better and it seems closer to the history to me.  You disagree. <br/>
 So be it.   Most of the letterboxes I'm finding have at least 2 or 3 entries <br/>
in them now with individuals or families that have left thumbprints, <br/>
"natureprints", etc.   To me, those people are just as much in the spirit of it, <br/>
because they're still going thru the clues, making the treks, finding the boxes, <br/>
and then finding a way, even if they don't have a stamp, of saying "I was here." <br/>
 I take it you would disapprove of them then?<br/>
<br/>
There's one box in IL that we're going to try to get to later this week or <br/>
the next that's a box planted in honor of schoolteachers.  And each person's log <br/>
entry is supposed to include a short remark about the finder's favorite <br/>
teacher.  I think that's going to be a blast to read the entries and add our own.  <br/>
And that makes that box a little "different" from the traditional that I've <br/>
found.  But is it going to take any "intelligence" to find the box other than <br/>
Stealth Bomber Tactics because of where it's hidden.  No, not really.   Is it an <br/>
"adult" letterbox?  Yeah, probably.  How many kids are going to admit in <br/>
public to having liked a teacher?  I would think it'd be more of a nostalgia trip <br/>
for adults.  Cool.       <br/>
<br/>
Why would I take up the hobby?  It's something that can be done outdoors, and <br/>
horror of horrors, it can actually involve children from time to time, who <br/>
can learn things from it.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, my challenge is for everyone to create plant a letterbox.  I <br/>

a <br/>
&gt; bit scary -- will people like my box, will I do it right?  But <br/>
&gt; believe me, there is no right or wrong way to do it, there is no <br/>
&gt; secret to a perfect letterbox.  Sure, as you get more involved in <br/>
&gt; the game, perhaps you will focus on themes or the historic <br/>
&gt; significance of a location and those are great boxes, but not a <br/>
&gt; requirement for a letterbox.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I am challenging you to just do it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, I was going to challenge everyone to create a mystery <br/>
box, <br/>
&gt; but decided some of the newer members may not be comfortable with <br/>
&gt; that, especially if they have not yet found a mystery box.  And I <br/>
&gt; also realize that even some of the more seasoned letterboxers are <br/>
&gt; just not the mystery box type.  So, I am not specifying any <br/>

&gt; some mystery boxes come from this though -- so if you've been <br/>
&gt; thinking about one -- challenge yourself a bit and give it a try.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am hoping this challenge will generate some discussion and <br/>
&gt; questions on the list about how to do this, or what is the best way <br/>
&gt; people have found to do this, etc.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you have your box planted, post the clues to the LbNA web site <br/>
&gt; or on your own web site or perhaps you want to post only to this <br/>
&gt; list -- it is up to you.  But let us know what you have done -- of <br/>

&gt; &gt; people have found to do this, etc.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When you have your box planted, post the clues to the LbNA web site <br/>
&gt; &gt; or on your own web site or perhaps you want to post only to this <br/>
&gt; &gt; list -- it is up to you.  But let us know what you have done -- of <br/>
&gt; &gt; course, without giving away any mysteries.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just do it!<br/>
