&gt;- The format and games will be the same as last year but the list of <br/>

&gt;- To play, you will need to complete a card and send it to me along <br/>
&gt;with an item for the Bingo Booty and $1 to go toward the cost of mailing prizes<br/>
&gt;- Entries will need to be received by me by December 28th, so don't <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is not a suggested $$ amount -- it has worked well to just leave it open to whatever you can do.  In the past I have received everything from small blank books to carving blades to pieces of carving material to handmade socks to full sets of Marvy markers... and everything imaginable in between.  I don't want anyone to be left out  because of a $$ limit.  The idea is to build a prize kitty based on everybody contributing one thing and I trust that everyone is best qualified to make the call as to how much they are able to contribute.<br/>
