                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is not a suggested $$ amount -- it has worked well to just leave it open to whatever you can do.  In the past I have received everything from small blank books to carving blades to pieces of carving material to handmade socks to full sets of Marvy markers... and everything imaginable in between.  I don't want anyone to be left out  because of a $$ limit.  The idea is to build a prize kitty based on everybody contributing one thing and I trust that everyone is best qualified to make the call as to how much they are able to contribute.<br>
