Of course, Paul is my favorite too.  But he's decided to float on down the river.  I looked along the river and checked the beaver dams trying to find the box, no luck.  <br/>
<br/>
I'd like to place a box and have it last for more than 2 years.  I found a box once and it was 10 years old and the original logbook was still inside.  What a find!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the kind words.<br/>

  &gt; This is a notice to my LbGLK friends, <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; The Beatles Series of 4 boxes in Lake Forest, IL is retiring after <br/>
  just over 2 years. Paul was reported missing. <br/>
<br/>
  I really liked that series. And Paul was my favorite carving!<br/>
