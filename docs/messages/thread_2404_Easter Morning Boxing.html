                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I must say, it's no easier to be a first finder on a box 30 miles <br/>
north of Chicago than it is closer to the city.  I decided to spend Easter <br/>
morning (also my birthday) letterboxing.  I was going to try the Easter egg <br/>
series but after reading that some may not be there I decided to postpone <br/>
that trip and stay a little closer to home.  How happy I was when I found a <br/>
new box placed at a location just a few miles from home.<br/>
<br/>
After opening Easter baskets and piling everyone into the car we made our <br/>
way out to the new Fort Sheridan Letterbox.  It is a great location and <br/>
without giving too much away I want to mention that with almost no one out <br/>
this morning, we run into the only two people in site, right by the <br/>
letterbox!  We waited them out, kind of invaded their space and went to find <br/>
the box.  After we retrieved it we found we missed being first finders by <br/>
two hours!!!!  That's what we get for opening Easter baskets before boxing!<br/>
<br/>
On a brighter note, we headed to another location for another box (it had a <br/>
playground next to it and I promised my son).  While enjoying some time on a <br/>
bench as he played at the park a woman with a piece of paper passed us by. <br/>
My husband looked at me and said 'I think she's a letterboxer!'.  We watched <br/>
as she looked at the place for clue one, then she kept walking, looking at <br/>
the place for clue two.  She was a boxer!!!<br/>
<br/>
We stalked... ummmm... I mean followed her for a little ways and finally <br/>
approached her and introduced ourselves as fellow boxers.  To top this off, <br/>
she was none other than Prairie Dog, the boxer who beat us out for the first <br/>
find on the box earlier in the morning!!!  I must say, this was a much <br/>
better treat, I've been a first finder before but have never met a fellow <br/>
boxer on the trail.  We continued on together to find the box, enjoy some <br/>
boxing conversation and exchange stamps.  It was a perfect birthday treat!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Easter to all and Happy boxing!<br/>

No boxing for us today, but we were able to find two boxes (and a HH)<br/>

had yesterday!<br/>

her on a boxing trip last fall... Sounds like she's a contender for <br/>
the "most trail exchanges" prize!<br/>
2.  "Hoppy" Birthday, Jacks!....<br/>
3.  We had a great afternoon yesterday in SW Michigan - <br/>
letterboxing, hiking, dune climbing and just enjoying the most <br/>
perfect letterboxing weather so far this season!  Best part was a <br/>
shared giant ice cream sundae...Weight Watchers?  What Weight <br/>
Watchers!?!?!<br/>
4.  B-Babe and Lady Doglvr watch for Prairie Dog - wouldn't be <br/>
surprised if she shows up in Kzoo! Have a great trip!<br/>
