                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone... I just have to say that I heart you all for caring so much about my missing stamp and logbook. It seems that several of you were kind enough to spend the time and energy to check for it, and it was not there. i'm not sure if this is good or bad news... maybe i'll stumble upon it in some random place... or maybe i'm just meant to let it go and start over. :( who knows... either way, the kindness and support that was shown to me from this community of letterboxers was a gift in and of itself, and it fills my heart with joy. So in a way, i have a whole lot to be thankful for. <br>
<br>
So thank you, everyone. I really appreciate your help and your warm wishes. i'll keep you posted if i ever do find my lost letterboxing history. <br>
<br>
With heartfelt gratitude, <br>
<br>
One Love Journeying<br>
