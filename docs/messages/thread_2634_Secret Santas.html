Anything you would like is probably something that another letterboxer would like too.  Secret Santas can be so creative.  Besides, it's not the gift but the thought that counts...but enough of the thoughts, I like the gifts best of all.  Small world - I work in retail too.  If I survive the hectic shopping season and the month of returns, it leaves little time to celebrate.  You put up 9 trees each year!  Do I dare admit it....I put up 13!  My friends give me ornaments and I like to display all of them.  It's so much work to take them down, so I usually leave the trees up till....well, we won't go there.  But we've all heard of Christmas in July.   Dust off the old Mitch Miller Christmas Sing-a-long album.  It's June, so the start of Christmas is only a month away.  <br>

To-date 16 letterboxers have shown interest and six (6) have forwarded <br>
their mailing addresses to me (as indicated in the database).<br>
<br>
The majority response has been $10-20 for the total cost.  This is <br>
only a guideline.  Just thought you would like to know what everyone <br>
else is thinking.<br>
<br>
I would like to make assignments Saturday or Sunday, but I need to <br>
hear from the other interested Santas.  I just need your mailing <br>
address to confirm your interest.<br>
<br>
As far as "what to gift?" the archives provide some insight, but there <br>
is no "right" answer.  Be creative.  And plan to mail the gift to <br>
arrive sometime in July.<br>

  Okay, today is June 23rd, the deadline to sign up for this event.<br>
<br>
  To-date 16 letterboxers have shown interest and six (6) have forwarded <br>
  their mailing addresses to me (as indicated in the database).<br>
<br>
  The majority response has been $10-20 for the total cost. This is <br>
  only a guideline. Just thought you would like to know what everyone <br>
  else is thinking.<br>
<br>
  I would like to make assignments Saturday or Sunday, but I need to <br>
  hear from the other interested Santas. I just need your mailing <br>
  address to confirm your interest.<br>
<br>
  As far as "what to gift?" the archives provide some insight, but there <br>
  is no "right" answer. Be creative. And plan to mail the gift to <br>
  arrive sometime in July.<br>
<br>
  All check back later,<br>

<br>
We'll be somewhere in Lake Superior during the designated time-frame<br>
and though we'd be able to SENT our gift, we have no way of offering a<br>
confirmed delivery address until after 9/1/06.<br>
<br>
We do get mail at various ports via "general delivery .. vessel in<br>
transit" and a mail forwarding service.  However, without knowing the<br>
mailing schedule of the sender; it doesn't make sense to participate<br>
in this event (dang it!!)<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>
