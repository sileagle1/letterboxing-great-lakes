I've never done a scuba letterbox, don't even know if they exist. I saw an article in my latest Scuba magazine talking about geocaching, which makes sense considering dive boats use cordinates to get to wrecks. I once stayed at an underwater hotel (yes, it was as cool as it sounds. had to dive to get into the "lobby"). This would be an awesome spot to hide a box! When/if I go back. <br>
 <br>
But I too was wondering how they'd do it. The diver would have to take it back to the boat unless there was an air pocket on the wreck. Can we say, dangerous. If I'm stamping in odds are I'm not paying attention to my air supply!<br>
 <br>
See, our land hunts are all pretty tame!<br>

She had mentioned that one needed to be a master diver to attempt it.  The box has since been retired.  I don't know that it was ever found by a letterboxer, but seem to recall there was maybe a geocacher who found it.<br>
