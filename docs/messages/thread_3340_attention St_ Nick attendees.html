<br>
And there won't be any earthquakes...so our driving plans for Dec. 2 remain the same.  Don't make me turn this car around and drive to your house and get you.  It would be a long trip in the opposite direction, but I'm not listening to excuses.  We all want you there to share in the fun.  Tell the boss the fungus can wait.  <br>
<br>
I was thinking about bringing a propane stove if the shelter doesn't have electricity.  We'll all need plenty of hot fluids to keep us warm.  <br>

Martini Man and I checked the electrical outlet situation on NOV 11 - there<br>
were a bunch of live outlets on various shelter posts.<br>
