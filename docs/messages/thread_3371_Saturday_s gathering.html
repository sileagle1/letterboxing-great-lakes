<br/>
Last week Kiddy Writer and I created a limited edition letterbox in<br/>
conjunction with a local food drive. Only 2 people came to stamp the<br/>
book. KW says she is going to be at the gathering SO....<br/>
<br/>
I am looking into the idea of her bringign this logbook and stamp with<br/>
her. If you would liek to stamp the book, you would need to bring a<br/>
donation, and ask for it by saying the code phrase to her. [which can<br/>
be found by looking up the box called Our Daily Bread loc: Schaumburg,<br/>
IL, on letterboxing.org]<br/>
<br/>
I still need ot check with her that she is still going and still wants<br/>
to do this -- but it's a little heads up, in case any of you were<br/>
wishing you could collect that stamp. It's quite a nice one! The<br/>
logbook is mine and is fantastic, of course LOL<br/>
<br/>
More firm details to come!<br/>

I was to go so bad!  I signed up (and unsigned up) twice now!  I just <br/>
can't swing it.  :(  I hope everyone has a blast!  Be sure to give us <br/>
all the details after it's over!<br/>
