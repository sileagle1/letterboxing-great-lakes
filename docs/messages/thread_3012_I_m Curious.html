October of 2002 looking for new carving materials...she stumbled <br>
upon the LBNA website.  Tonto at the time was in his usual trance <br>
position in front of the TV watching some sporting event.  He heard <br>
her scream in delight, "You aren't going to believe this!"<br>
He answered with a disinterested, "What is it now?"<br>
"There are actually people writing clues and hiding hand carved <br>
stamps out in public areas ALL over the country!"<br>
A polite, "Oh, yeah?" was all he could muster at the time.  He went <br>
back to his TV and she memorized the LBNA website!<br>
<br>
We didn't get around to the actual letterboxing until the following <br>
February (2003) when we were heading out to visit family in <br>
Virginia.  We stopped for the South Mountain Trinity boxes in <br>
Burkittsville, MD on the AT,(Yes, the same area that the Blair Witch <br>
Project Movie of yore was filmed)  The boxes had been planted by the <br>
Apple Dumpling Gang.  Our first box was the "War Correspondence Box" <br>
found in the snow!  The carving blew us away, and Tonto being a <br>
history buff was equally hooked by the location that we would've <br>
never found otherwise!<br>
<br>
Eleven states, several years later and with over 400 boxes under our <br>
belts, we are still loving the adventures that the boxes bring our <br>
way. <br>
