on this box on Saturday that it was missing.  (We had planted th8is <br/>
box for Der Mad Stmaper for the Haunted Harvest event in Menomonee <br/>
Falls in 2006).  The log it was in had been broken open by someonone <br/>
and we could find no sign of the box.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, we actually did checks on a total of 9 boxes on <br/>
Saturday, and the other 8 were still in place.  We dried out those <br/>
that needed it, but are happy to report that any in flooded areas <br/>
survived OK.  We did need to replace one logbook that was higher in a <br/>
tree, but that was because someone had not only failed to close the <br/>
baggie, but also the container cover.  Thanks to all of you who are <br/>
concientious about making sure everything is sealed tightly!<br/>
