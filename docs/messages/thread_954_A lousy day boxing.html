.....is still better than a great day working!<br>
<br>
We went out to Graue Mill today to find Pippi's box (wave), despite<br>
the fact that it is closed for the season, there were swarms of people<br>
enjoying the warm weather.  So, we didn't look too hard.  Not hard<br>
enough to find it, anyway.  Despite that, we spent nearly an hour and<br>
a half walking along the salt river, the girls jumped from stone to<br>
stone, climbed around on the old wall pieces left by the river, found<br>
clams, feathers, and other "treasures," and became acquainted with a<br>
lot of dogs out for walks.  It was a fun way to spend a very warm New<br>
Year's Eve.  <br>
<br>
Thanks Pippi, for getting me outdoors today,<br>
 and a warm Happy New Year to all of you!<br>
