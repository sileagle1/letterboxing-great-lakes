Reminder...  if you posted clues in the files section of the group and will be posting them to either letterboxing.org and/or AtlasQuest, don't forget to remove them from the files section once they have been successfully posted elsewhere.  As the files section is shared space and is limited to 20mb, it really should only be used for temporary clues, WOM clues or other types of clues that are not available on one of the public clue sites (letterboxing.org or AtlasQuest).<br>

Also, this is probably a good time to point out why it is important to keep a back-up copy of your clues even if they are posted to letterboxing.org or AtlasQuest.  You never know when disaster may strike one of those sites.  While both Choi and Ryan are diligent about backups, it is still a good idea to keep copies of your own clues on your computer just to be safe and to be able to access them even if one of the sites are down.<br>
