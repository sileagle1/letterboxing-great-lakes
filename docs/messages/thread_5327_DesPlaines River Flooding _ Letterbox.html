I've been putting if off because I feared the worst, but I went to <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a possible scenario:  the flooding caused the logs to float a <br>
little - not enough to move them away from the area, but enough to lift <br>
them up a little.  The box saw it's opportunity and made a break for <br>
it - Lock & lock's gonna float much better than an old log.  So the box <br>
could have floated free, then when the flood receded, the logs settled <br>
back down where they were.  If you liked the spot originally, I'd stick <br>
with it (barring further flood warnings...)<br>

<br>
Now that you say that, I think it must be charmed.  Shortly after I <br>
planted it, the Forest Preserve people chopped down a tree that had <br>
been hanging at an angle over the trail (and where the box was then <br>
hidden at the base).  In fact, I think your dad looked for it right <br>
after that and couldn't find it.  When I went looking for it, it was <br>
buried under a big pile of dirt and kindling.  <br>
