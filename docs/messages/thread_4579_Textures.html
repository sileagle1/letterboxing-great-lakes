                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have used needles and paperclips to do texture/shading.  Just poke the needle in over and over in a small space.  It takes a little experimenting for needle size and depth, but works well.  Another thing I have done is to drag the Speedball "V" tool across the surface with just a little pressure in a cross-hatch pattern (i.e. parallel line and then parallel swipes at ninety degrees to the first set.  Again a little experimenting is needed to get the pressure down, so you're leaving some marks but not removing chunks of carving material.<br>

I have a little metal tool, like a file, but really pretty small.  My <br>
mom used it for wood carving.<br>
<br>
I've used that to rub over the stamp to make hair and grass.  It <br>
works pretty well!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've heard of people using an iron on PZKut to smooth out surface irregularities.  I wonder if it would work to iron a piece of sandpaper onto the surface to create texture (or would that transfer the grit??)??<br>
