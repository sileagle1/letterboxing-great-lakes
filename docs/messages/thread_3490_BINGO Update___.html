in the database as sent last week -- I am assuming the mail is just <br>
running a little behind on these.  If there is anyone else who wants <br>
to play but you don't think you can get me your stuff in time, e-mail <br>
me and we can work it out.  The important thing is that I must have <br>
your completed card by the 27th.<br>
<br>
I will post some detailed info about the game later this week and then <br>
watch for the words beginning 1/1/07!<br>

The booty box is overflowing -- this is going to be fun ;-) <br>
