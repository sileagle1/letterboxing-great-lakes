I wanted to let everyone know - Hobby Lobby carries MasterCarve, and <br>
Speedy Stamp now - but NOT in the Stamping Aisle! Its over near screen <br>
printing, and similar items. (Was near the derby cars!) They also have <br>
the carvers. (I bought a kit with SpeedyStamp, and several blocks of <br>
Master Carve.)<br>
<br>
Found it yesterday - Prices werent bad either. (Beats paying shipping, <br>
and instant gratification!<br>
<br>
I hope this was helpful to someone - OH! Go to the Hobby Lobby Website <br>
and sign up for their weekly ad to come into your mailbox and about <br>
every other week get a 40% off one item COUPON! Whoo Hoo!<br>

Shutterfly, Brat Pack, and all letterboxers,<br>
I was at my local Hobby Lobby tonight.  All Speedball products (handles, blades and the pink stuff!) are 30% off.  No coupon needed.  I bought the last package of pink rubber.  The stockroom clerk told me there is a new truck shipment on Thursday.  I'll be there looking for more bargains.  Thought you might like to know about the sale.  <br>

(handles, blades and the pink stuff!) are 30% off.  No coupon <br>
needed.  I bought the last package of pink rubber.  The stockroom <br>
clerk told me there is a new truck shipment on Thursday.  I'll be <br>
there looking for more bargains.  Thought you might like to know <br>
about the sale.  <br>

and there is Joann Fabrics, Michaels, and a Hobby Lobby nearby. I <br>
just wasn't sure if they would carry that stuff. Their selection of <br>
rubber stamps were kind of small. I think I'll be going out tomorrow <br>
to Hobby Lobby and see what they have and get some stuff to get <br>
started. Thank you again for all the places and info. I will <br>
definitely check out the websites!!! (HUGS)<br>
