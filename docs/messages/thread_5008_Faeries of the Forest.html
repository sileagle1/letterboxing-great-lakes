great meeting new l'boxers and hiking in a beautiful part of the <br/>
state.  And a special thanks to all the great carvers who donated their <br/>
skills to the event.  The stamps we found were some of the best we have <br/>
ever seen.  And yet another special thanks to TrailTroll, spartanfans, <br/>
and SpringChick for their expertise in tracking down some of the more <br/>
elusive boxes.  We had a blast!<br/>
