Actually we were just there this past weekend and had only limited success -- no doubt ours was one of the comments in the log book you refer to ;-)  There must have been a stampede in that area just in the past couple of days as of the 3 boxes we did find, there were a couple people in each, but nobody had found all three of them.  As you mention you were not the first to complete the series, I assume there were others there in addition to you over the past couple of days that stamped into all of the boxes.<br>
<br>
Now I really feel stupid...  OldShoe and I struggled and struggled with those clues and neither of us could get anywhere.  Just a bad day I guess -- we'll have to give it another shot!<br>

Congratulations on your success with finding all of the boxes.<br>

Based on email from you and SpringChick, I've updated the clues to<br>
this series. Sometimes when I'm in the woods, what seems an obvious<br>
landmark to me, really isn't obvious at all.  Also, as I placed these <br>
boxes on different days and from both ends of the trail, I hadn't <br>
realized there was a problem using the rojo object in the way I had.<br>
<br>
As for the *every single one* situation, I think you were fortunate <br>
that you found something a little less than "ordinary" on your first <br>
trip out. (grin) BTW - Bindle Bum was reading your email over my <br>
shoulder and when he got to the part about your youngest and the lemon <br>

Librarian. (heheheh)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey BindleBabe, thanks for revising the clues to the Fill 'er Up <br>
series!  I was able to find the boxes that had eluded us this past <br>
weekend, "every single one of them."  Actually I was the first person <br>
to stamp into all of them.  There were a couple other people who had <br>
found some of the boxes and each of them had been found by at least <br>
one person, but I was surprised to find that nobody had stamped into <br>
all them (sounds like a logic puzzle, eh?).<br>
<br>
Thrzabox, I was disappointed not to see your stamp in any of the log <br>
books -- perhaps we all assumed incorrectly and you were actually <br>
referring to a different letterbox series?  If so, please dish -- I <br>
am always up for a challenging series of boxes!  If this was the <br>
series you were referring to and you just didn't have a stamp yet <br>
(you did mention it was your first outing), just wanted to let you <br>
know that you can feel free to just sign into the log books until you <br>
get a stamp.<br>
<br>
Happy Trails!<br>
