                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we had a great day at Fort Custer today - finding all six <br/>
boxes we were looking for - not without a couple challenging moments <br/>

Yes sir, apparently there were squirrel hunters in the woods (that's <br/>
according to one of the bikers who passed us).  Believe me that was <br/>
the fastest stamp job I ever did - though I replaced the box as <br/>
carefully as ever - us letterboxers can't be put off by a little <br/>
gunfire, right???  Really can't believe they'd allow shooting to go <br/>
on in a park while it's being used by non-hunters - if the hunters <br/>
want to shoot each other, that's another whole story.......<br/>
<br/>
The other minor challenge was our fault - we REALLY have to get <br/>
better at this compass heading thing.  Even have a book that <br/>
explains it - suppose it would help if at least one of us actually <br/>
read it!<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't been to Fort Custer - it's a really great place to <br/>
spend a day.....letterbox, hike, bike, ride horses if you're lucky <br/>
enough to have one, fish, swim, picnic, and I guess in the winter <br/>
you can go watch some sled dog events....how neat would that be??<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, I'm glad to hear that boxing at Fort custer was fun.  I've been <br/>
thinking about checking it out.  Its just the right distance from the <br/>
Lansing area for an enjoyable day trip.  I just had to chuckle at <br/>
your comments about the gun shots though.  Gun Lake State Park is <br/>
another great area for hiking but the state also allows hunting <br/>
there.  One beautiful fall day a few years ago, a group of us were <br/>
hiking some of the trails but the shots got so loud that we <br/>
hightailed it back to camp.  So walking the trails or stalking the <br/>
wild letterbox can be hazardous to your health if you're not <br/>
careful.  Fort Custer also used to be open for deer hunting, so watch <br/>
out if you wander around there during deer season.  --- In <br/>

There are parts of the Fort Custer Recreation area that are posted <br/>
for No Hunting, but as you noted, there are parts of the state land <br/>
in which hunting IS permitted. <br/>
Back when the TOTW was a listing of gear that letterboxers might <br/>
consider adding to their packs, I noted that we carry florescent <br/>
orange vests. It was during a letterboxing adventure in New Hampshire <br/>
that I first saw hikers wearing the bright blaze hunter gear. (They <br/>
even had 'em for their dogs!)So now during any hunting season, we <br/>
wear the orange. They're not terribly attractive, but it's pretty <br/>
cheap insurance.<br/>
For the record, we AVOID woods and fields that are open to hunting. <br/>
Parks that are adjacent to open-hunting land present problems as well.<br/>
<br/>
It's best to know what the open seasons are and to check with the <br/>
local park rangers about off-limits areas.<br/>

Someone on the big list did post about the chic orange hats and vests you can find at Wal-Mart this time of year.  One of my friends who lives in more rural Ohio complains this time of year about having to wear those just to get her mail.<br/>

Gives me an idea for a hitchhiker, though....help the poor squirrel hitchhiker get out of the hunting areas!  Where's the carving kit?  Oh wait, it's at home...I'm at work...<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
