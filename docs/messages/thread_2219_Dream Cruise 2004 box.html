                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with WI hiker!! What can be worse than wasting your (little <br>
if any) time on a box that doesn't exist. The feelings of "I must be <br>
so stupid, I can't believe I can't find it" racking your brain all <br>
night is the worst. You should have your total count under you hard <br>
copy note book ant way! I wish we could at least be able to put a <br>
note on the site saying "don't bother". The attempted doesn't really <br>
help because you don't know if they just didn't find it or its not <br>
there. I don't know if it keeps a list of how many people attempted <br>
or not that might be helpful if it did.<br>
