or the Pre-Gathering Fish Boil Dinner on Sun. October 3 in Door County <br/>
Wisconsin, you might wish to check out a new listing for some boxes <br/>
that were originally launched in February 2007 at the SILO II <br/>
Gathering, but never listed.  They are now listed as 'mystery boxes'on <br/>
AQ because they don't have a permanent address location.  I guess they <br/>
could be considered travelers, because they usually travel around with <br/>
me...when I remember to bring them.  But there is no clue for them. So <br/>
that means they are a bit like word of mouth boxes too. Check the <br/>
Mystery Boxes listed on AQ.  The series is called On The Table.  <br/>
