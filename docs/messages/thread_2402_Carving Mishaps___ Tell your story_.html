                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I figured I'd start a new thread here for a little fun -- Carving mishaps! I'm sure there are <br/>
some real good stories out there. Here's my latest letterboxing tale of woe....<br/>
<br/>
I'm fairly new at letterboxing... and have only placed 3 boxes, and carved 6 stamps (this <br/>
includes my own personal stamp, an event stamp, and the next box I'm working on.)  I just <br/>
realized this morning that I have to start my new stamp over again:<br/>
<br/>
My mistake... and I knew eventually there'd be times that I'd have to start over on a <br/>
stamp... was that I finished a beautiful one (IMHO, lol!) -- got it all ready to place -- and <br/>
realized I had misspelled the word "chickadee" on it!!!!  ARRRGGGHHHHH!  I spelled it <br/>
'chicadee' instead. I searched in vain on the web to see if perhaps it can be spelled both <br/>
ways <i don't="" i="" know,="" know;="" laugh=""> but no luck there. So I'm off to start this one over.<br/>
<br/>
The one other stamp I carved once which almost bit the dust was a smaller baseball stamp <br/>
that my 3-year-old found on my table. I'm sure he wanted to imitate mom and decided to <br/>
try his hand at the hobby. He took a pretty good chunk out of it, (and yes, I'm lucky the <br/>
chunk wasn't out of his finger,) but with a bit of glue and a day or two under some weight <br/>
it was saved. For that stamp I learned NEVER to leave my carving box any lower than 5 feet <br/>
off the ground!<br/>
<br/>
My lesson I learned today (duh!!!) is to always check and double-check the spelling if I'm <br/>
using words in my stamps!!!<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice weekend, everyone!<br/>

three are in great shape - and really nice stamps.  I look forward to <br/>

I know exactly what was going on when you couldn't get to that third box... it was the <br/>

somewhere else -- and couldn't believe the traffic until I remembered what was going on. <br/>
Normally that road is pretty deserted; it's one of those dirt roads that you just don't take <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, a while back I mentioned a box I placed in VA, 'Two Brothers', last<br/>
summer when we had mini reunion at my niece's house.  The stamp I originally<br/>
carved was this whole family tree of letters: T(om) + K(athi) --&gt;<br/>
M(ichelle), plus my brother-in-law's side as well, which goes one generation<br/>
further than ours (grandchildren).  Letters are not my forte, but I wanted<br/>
the practice.  I thought it came out halfway decently, until I realized I<br/>
put the wrong letter for my niece!  Duh!  An "M" instead of an "S", right in<br/>
the middle of the stamp - not fixable either.  Back to the drawing board.<br/>
The final stamp just says "2 Brothers" - I wasn't going to go through all<br/>
that again!<br/>

&gt; &gt; We missed you by a day, TrailTroll! We tackled the South Lyon <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; yesterday... and agree with everything you said! :-) We did have <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; skip one (because quite a few people were in the area and didn't <br/>
look <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be leaving anytime soon), but can't wait for more PennyPenny <br/>
boxes!<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <snip>I had great fun with your South Lyon boxes on<br/>
&gt; &gt; Friday.  I found all three, despite having to try twice on two of<br/>
&gt; &gt; them because people were too close for me to retrieve the box.  <br/>
All<br/>
&gt; &gt; three are in great shape - and really nice stamps.  I look <br/>
forward to<br/>
&gt; &gt; more plants from you!<snip><br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I carved a stamp with the name written under the image, but I <br/>
wrote <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the name directly on the stamp instead of reversing it, so the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letters were backwards when you stamped it.  I think that's a <br/>
&gt; &gt; pretty <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; common mistake, but frustrating all the same.  Fortunately, the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letters were underneath the image, so I just cut off the bottom <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; used the picture without the words!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, PennyPenny, I had great fun with your South Lyon <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Friends,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I figured I'd start a new thread here for a little fun -- <br/>
Carving <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mishaps! I'm sure there are <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some real good stories out there. Here's my latest <br/>
letterboxing <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tale of woe....<br/>
