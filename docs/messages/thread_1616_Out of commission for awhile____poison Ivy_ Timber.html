                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh my!  Sounds just like the type of reaction Martini Man has had.  We got<br/>
our first dose of P.I. last April after boxing in Maryland.  I was the one<br/>
who got it, but it wasn't TOO bad.  We both got poison oak this fall when<br/>
boxing in California.  Again, mine wasn't too bad, but MM's arm looked<br/>
horrible.   He experienced another outbreak after the Great Lakes Gathering<br/>
last month.  Luckily none has been bad enough to warrant a doctor visit, but<br/>
it is horrible looking and decidedly itchy.  He tried something BindleBabe<br/>
recommended during this last outbreak and it seemed to relieve some of his<br/>
suffering.<br/>
<br/>
As far as some of your other concerns.....   Stay tuned for a box we are<br/>
hiding in your area this Sunday!!<br/>
<br/>
I sincerely hope Mr. P. recovers and that the whole family is able to take<br/>
this in stride and will get out there boxing again soon.  Heat, poison ivy,<br/>
poison oak, snakes, ticks  - none of this is as bad to us as NO BOXING!<br/>
We've decided to continue to take our chances as we pursue hunting the<br/>
elusive boxes....<br/>

P.S.  The idea of a workshop on PI is interesting.  If you, or someone else,<br/>
wants to give a little talk, show some photos of PI, recommend medication,<br/>
etc. that would be great.  At a minimum, perhaps we could have a photo<br/>
contest to determine who has had the worst outbreak!<br/>

started disappearing.  You guys have really done a lot of great<br/>
placements in the last year.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids are too young really to be scared of mosquitoes, etc.  We<br/>
carry them in Kelty Kid Carriers for the time being, which is why I<br/>
haven't been boxing in the last week.  It seems that I wrenched my<br/>
back out of place last week while retrieving "I-94 Traffic Crawl:<br/>
Walkin' in de forest".  Those kids are getting heavy.<br/>
<br/>
The only encouragement I have is to tell your kids that people like us<br/>
love finding your boxes and wouldn't know what to do without them. <br/>
We've really appreciated and enjoyed all your plants in Madison and<br/>
Sauk County.  We need more Madison area boxing, which is why we're<br/>
looking forward to that WI Hiker placement.<br/>
<br/>
Poison Ivy, Lyme Disease, West Nile, Timber Rattlers ... with the<br/>
proper education and precautions, each can be avoided and we heartily<br/>
agree with WI Hiker, the alternative of a letterboxing world without<br/>
the Puddlejumpers would be scary.<br/>
<br/>
(We've actually thought about doing a series of letterboxes called "A<br/>
Letterboxer's Nightmare" and include each of these dangers.)<br/>

<br/>
As for the timber rattlesnakes...yes, they can be found in Devil's <br/>
Lake. I was hesitant to place a letterbox there because of all the <br/>
children who letterbox in our area. I didn't want them to reach a <br/>
little hand into a dark hole and get bitten. If I do get up there again <br/>
sometime soon and place one, you better believe there will be huge <br/>
warnings in the clues.<br/>
If you want more information about the snakes in Devil's Lake, go to <br/>
this website:<br/>
http://www.devilslakewisconsin.com/snakes.html<br/>
The place really is beautiful and I encourage everyone to visit at one <br/>
time or another, but just as with everything, you have to be careful. <br/>
My father used to camp there when he was younger and I asked him about <br/>
the snakes. He said he mainly saw them in the early morning and late at <br/>
night; usually when they are sunning themselves. I suppose it is good <br/>
that you are able to hear these snakes before you get too close. :)<br/>
Oh yeah, and if you go in the water...you'll love me for this <br/>
one...remember about swimmer's itch! My dad got it a few years ago when <br/>
we were canoeing there and his lower leg/ankle area had bumps for <br/>
months. You can read about that at their website also.<br/>
<br/>
There are dangers all over the place when you step out your door. Don't <br/>
let that keep you inside though. My dad and I were just joking that if <br/>
you try to keep yourself cooped up indoors to avoid everything else, <br/>
you'll probably die of carbon monoxide posioning. Ah, the irony of it <br/>
all.<br/>

&gt; people have seen in the Devil's Lake area.  He said they are found in<br/>
&gt; the rocks.  Is this true?!!!  He said "you'll be fine if you stay on <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; marked trail", to which we both told him that letterboxing often takes<br/>
&gt; us off the trail.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm so sorry to hear about the poison ivy.  For the first time in my life, I got into poison ivy last April while letterboxing down at Starved Rock State Park in Illinois.  I can sympathize with you, the itching was horrible, and nothing over-the-counter worked to relieve it for very long.  And to top it all off, we never did find half the letterboxes we hunted for!<br/>

  Mr. Puddlejumper and I both encountered poison ivy somewhere along the<br/>
  way recently.  <br/>
