                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like some of my U.P. boxes have been seeing some activity <br/>
this summer.  I was wondering why I didn't hear much on them from <br/>
finders and think I figured that out -- because the LbNA clue list <br/>
was immediately redirecting to my web page for the clues, <br/>
the "Contact the Placer" option was not available.  I changed that <br/>
and just within the last week have heard on a couple of them.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the reports from finders especially on these boxes <br/>
since they are so far away from me and I do not have contacts in the <br/>
U.P. to just run over and check on a box for me.  We will be heading <br/>
up to the U.P. later this month and I feel an obligation to check on <br/>
my boxes, but am anxious to find the new boxes that have been <br/>
planted since we were last there.  We're planning trips to both <br/>
Mackinac Island and Grand Island and a bunch of boxes along the way <br/>
between Copper Harbor and Mackinac.  But as most of you who have <br/>
been up there realize, things are quite spread out and the condition <br/>
of some of the roads makes getting from one place to another <br/>
sometimes very time-consuming.  Even though we will be there several <br/>
days, there is no way we can check on all of our boxes and find all <br/>
the new boxes along our route (and still leave some time to eat and <br/>
sleep).  So I would really appreciate hearing from anyone who has <br/>
been up there and found, or not found, any of my boxes within the <br/>
past 4-6 weeks (if you did not already contact me).  The more box <br/>
check-up stops I can cross off the list, the more box find stops we <br/>
can make.<br/>
<br/>
A couple I am especially hoping to hear on are the Big Two-Hearted <br/>
River box in Seney and the Marquette Harbor Light box.  I received a <br/>
couple of messages early in the summer from 'boxers who were <br/>
successful at the Big Two-Hearted River, but just received one in <br/>
late August from a group who were unable to find the box.  This one <br/>
is way off our course and if anyone can confirm it was there after <br/>
8/27/04, it would save us a lot of time.  I've received conflicting <br/>
reports on the Marquette Harbor Light box just within the past two <br/>
weeks -- both found and not found and I am not sure who was there <br/>
first.  This one is along our route though so if I have to stop and <br/>
check, it's not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail me offlist if you have any reports you can offer on <br/>
these or any of my other U.P. boxes.  Thanks!<br/>
