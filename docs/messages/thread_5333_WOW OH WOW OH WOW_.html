to the amazing 10th Anniversary of LBing in Wisconsin!  This was my <br>
first big gathering - it was amazing!  <br>
<br>
Peabody told me this event wasn't quite what he was expecting - but he <br>
willingly and enthusiastically went with me to get our 22 traditional <br>
boxes yesterday.  <br>
<br>
I really enjoyed meeting so many of you - now you are more than names <br>
on the 'puter.  And I want to meet more of you all.  And I want my own <br>
version of Martini Man's jacket.  ;)<br>
<br>
I like being in the woods, but am okay with not joining the "club" of <br>
people who have seen what was mentioned in Ardea's First Sighting. =O<br>
<br>
I look forward to more gatherings - and carving, planting and finding!  <br>
This is a great hobby we have!<br>
