                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found 4 hitchhikers this weekend and a few others earlier this month.  We continue to be surprised and disappointed that so many people don't know how to handle a HH.  <br>
<br>
PLEASE, if you put a HH in the box, STAMP the image of the BOX stamp into the HH logbook!  We are finding so many HHs that only have sig stamps, no box stamps.  A HH logbook should have an image of every box it has resided in, as well as sig stamp images of everyone that has found the HH.<br>
