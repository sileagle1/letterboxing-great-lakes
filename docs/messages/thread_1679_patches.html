I'm wondering why you wouldn't want to sew it on?  (I've sewn all my <br>
patches on my pack...)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I sew mine on also -- this way they are transferable if and when I ever come across that perfectly designed backpack.  I just use a couple of straight pins to hold the patch securely in the position I want it, then whipstitch around the edges in a thread color compatible with the border color.  I have found that the heavy duty type thread or quilting thread holds up best to repeated washing -- if using regular thread, try double-thickness.  It takes less than 10 minutes (okay a little longer if you count the time it takes for these old eyes to thread the darn needle).<br>

Hopefully SpringChick can answer that - she's the one who developed <br>
both the original and new logo for this message board.  They are the <br>

You can get it for less than $5 in Wal-mart or most craft/fabric stores.<br>

I'll also be brining some of these patches to the Wisconsin Letterboxing 10th Anniversary event on OCT 4, if anyone wants to purchase them from  me then.<br>
