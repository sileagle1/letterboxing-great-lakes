                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I've just carved my first two stamps and I used the park I'm <br>
going to place them in as the inspiration.  <br>
<br>
What I really need to do though is carve new personal stamps and I <br>
just can't think of what to carve that would personify me when I box <br>
alone - and then something for when my husband & I box together.  I <br>
don't actually box ALONE but sometimes I travel without my husband <br>
and visit relatives that I box with.  So I'll keep giving that some <br>
thought and maybe work on a HH next - while I'm deciding on the <br>
perfect hiding spots for the first two stamps and writing up the <br>
clues.  I think carving the stamps is the easy part......now the <br>
REAL work begins!  There are so many clever clue writers out there - <br>
guess I just gotta jump in and give it a try.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My inspirations are all over the place.  Many of my stamps are inspired by Japanese culture (anime, fabric, art) since one of my other major hobbies is Anime and that has sparked an interest in other Japanese things (like kimonos and fabric and traditions and such).  <br>
<br>
And a lot of them are inspired by my pets.  My personal stamp, for example, was adapted from a picture of my dog in her Halloween costume.  And my latest series started when we got the angelfish for our aquarium and one of my first thoughts about the one I picked out was "that would make an awsome stamp" (it's not *why* I picked that one though...I just thought he was the prettiest).  From there, I decided that most of the other fish in the tank would also be great subjects for stamps (although some were harder to photograph than others).  And the series I'll be working on next is my dog's name spelled out in Hiragana (Japanese characters).<br>
<br>
And then there are some that just sort of come out of the blue.  Like my "Mudflap Moose" hitchiker stamp...I was on a detour through Canada this summer and several of the semis we passed had little cartoon moose with wings on their mudflaps.  When I got home, an internet search proved fruitless so I designed my own winged moose for my stamp.  And I'm toying with the idea of making a stamp either for or in honor of my brother using a design that he is fond of (my mother has already turned this design into a little flag/banner thingy for him).<br>
<br>
So yeah, my inspirations are all over the place.  I tend to do whatever I feel like at the time and then look for someplace to hide it.  My letterboxes may or may not have anything to do with their location.  The Hidden Villiage series is hidden at Homer Lake because there was enough difference in the terrain to match the different elements/locations that the villiages represent.  The Kame Kasuri box and my fish series are along Lake Shelbyville because it's a lake and it seems proper to have fish (maybe not tropical fish) and turtles there.  I'm not sure where the dog's name series is going yet...probably just someplace with plenty of good hiding spots.<br>

Inspiration for stamps, humm?  How about where can I find the time to carve stamps?!  Ok, that's a topic for another time.   But seriously...<br>
<br>
  My first letterbox stamp, was inspired by a landmark in my hometown.  I've only placed one box so far, but plans are in the works for many more.  Right now I'm drawing artwork for a series of stamps based on a comic/graphic novel series I really enjoy.  I would tell you the comic, but I don't want to give away my series yet!  <br>
<br>
  I also enjoy anime and Japanees culture (I see Kimono Girl does too) and was brainstorming some stamps based on  various anime series I like.  I also want to do a sushi stamp (or series of).  I also want to do a box/series about my beloved pet iguana.<br>
<br>
  So needless to say, I have many stamps in the works right now, so there should be an explosion of letterboxes in the Northern Illinois area this spring!  =)<br>

art images I use at work (I'm in marketing/graphic design).  I don't <br>

Usually I work with the clip art to personalize it for the area I'm <br>

didn't turn out too badly.<br>
<br>
The most difficult part for me is to come up with interesting clues.  <br>
I think that sets the tone of the box and I hate to waste a good <br>
location with mediocre clues, so therefore I don't plant nearly as <br>
many boxes as I'd like to.  *sigh*<br>

<br>
Most of my stamps are designed after I find a cool site to place them.<br>
The series I am currently working on reflects the unique features of<br>
various city parks.  The basic design was inspired by the city logo, but<br>
I replace the central leaf with something relevant to the park:  a dog<br>
bone for the dog park, a wheelchair for the park with an accessible<br>
playground, etc.  I use clipart for most things but do some of my own<br>
sketching, like for Claire's and my personal stamps.   <br>
<br>
My most recent stamp was actually inspired by a phrase on the website for <br>
one of my more favorite forest preserves:  "in search of the elusive<br>
morel mushroom."  I think I prefer stamps that either reflect an aspect<br>
of the site or have a personal story that goes with them.  A stamp I<br>
found in NY claims to be NY's crappiest stamp and the placer explains<br>
that it was one of his first attempts but he just felt the site really<br>
needed a stamp- even just that much makes it mean more to me.<br>

Katy,<br>
Brett Costley has a take on it. See the following link:<br>
http://home.agalis.net/bcostley/Letterbox/PSinst.htm<br>
<br>
I have used variations on these techniques, and others in PS Elements.<br>
Good luck,<br>

That filter works best when the original scan is a fairly clean line drawing or a <br>
high-contrast photo.  I   find it doesn't work well with my photos or with shaded <br>
illustrations for stamp making  purposes.<br>
 <br>
 Of course, a tool such as this is only as good as the person who wields it, and <br>
 others may have had more success.<br>

Wow...I never thought about this one.  The ideas are either there, or not.  You know, you find yourself with some free time and haul out all your carving stuff, only to find your head empty, or you're in the middle of the grocery store and all of the sudden, your brain is on fire and you have to carve that stamp RIGHT NOW!<br>
<br>
I'd like to think my stamp ideas come from where ever it is Stephen King gets his ideas.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

I'm a bit late getting in on this one, but better late than never...<br>
<br>
I generally like to theme my boxes on something historical or <br>
interesting about the area where they are being placed.  As such I <br>
try to find images that relate to the theme, both in image and style <br>
of the image.  I am terrible at drawing so almost all of my images <br>
are from clip-art.  I tend to favor elements from nature -- flowers, <br>
trees, leaves, suns, animals, etc.  I haven't had much success with <br>
converting a photo into a carvable graphic, although I have seen it <br>
done very well by a couple of other individuals.<br>
<br>
I have a huge library of clip-art, both in print and electronic <br>
format.  I have also amassed a rather large file of future "image <br>
possibilites" while searching some of my favorite clip-art <br>
libraries.  Sometimes I will see an image that inspires a box because <br>
it brings to mind a fitting location.  A few times I have run across <br>
images I liked and wanted to carve, however they didn't seem to fit <br>
at any location I could think of, so I made them into hitch-hikers.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, I will do up a series of related stamps and place them <br>
together in a park that really has no connection to the theme of the <br>
series.  But this is usually only with a series, very rarely do I <br>
place just a single stamp in an unrelated location.<br>
