day pack that was left at the Paw.  Not much in it except a hitchhiker,<br/>
"Save the Feral Cats" by Nuts4Mice which was stamped in by Sue B Honey and<br/>
Mountain Crosser.  Let me know who it belongs to and I'll mail it to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who attended - we had over 30 people there - does this mean<br/>
we're upgraded from Micro Meets to Mini Meets?  (dang - gonna have to change<br/>
the stamp!)  Kim and Chrissie from the Paw thank everyone for their<br/>
generosity and patience waiting for food (as I told her, food was just an<br/>
afterthought - we were there to STAMP!).  Photos to follow soon!<br/>

great afternoon.  It seems appropriate as she usually sends her thanks <br/>
first.  These Hollywood MINI-meets are really a blast.  I hope that <br/>
the Paw stays open for a very long time so we can continue to have <br/>
these events.  I can't wait to add a tab to that amazing event stamp. <br/>
It was great to see everyone again, it has been so long since the <br/>
third of June.  The more people we meet from the Great Lakes area the <br/>
more we really like this hobby.  Hope to gather again soon.<br/>
