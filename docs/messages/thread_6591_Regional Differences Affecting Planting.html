One major difference I noticed when I planted in the UPlast time, was that the cammo tape that works down here, totally does not blend in the terrain up there. :) Just another letterboxing mystery to solve!!!<br/>

There's a desert pattern camo tape that might work made of varying shades of light to medium beiges/browns. <br/>

For a few of our "Cemetery Stroll" boxes, I have wandered the cemetery looking for rocks to hide the boxes under.  Of course, I would never resort to head stones (although my former three-flat had an old headstone painted yellow to mark the end of the alley--so not everyone is averse to using head stones).<br/>

<br/>
After the Boxacon gathering, Mr. FW and I stayed overnight at the home of an old HS friend who lives in Waukesha. As he toured us through his highly-wooded property, we came upon a headstone way in back near the property line. I recognized his grandmother's name on it. He explained that for whatever reason a new one was placed at her burial site, and he decided to take the old one and put it here just for "fun", next to a couple of marked dog graves, I might add. But the funniest part of the story was when the adjacent property was for sale and a realtor was showing it toa potential buyer and they stumbled upon an apparentmini human and pet cemetery in the neigbor's back yard!<br/>
