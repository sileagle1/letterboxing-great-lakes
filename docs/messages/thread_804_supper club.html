We're from MN and we have some fun ones too.<br>
<br>
1. What's that game that you play when you're a child where you run <br>
around and tap people on the head "Duck, Duck ....... Gray Duck" - <br>
We now live in IL and know that Minnesotans are the only ones that <br>
call "Duck, Duck Grayduck.... Duck Duck Goose"<br>
<br>
2. We have Hotdish instead of casseroles<br>
<br>
3. Pop instead of soda<br>
<br>
4. Peppermint Bon Bon instead of Mint Choc. Chip<br>
<br>
5. We call that nighttime meal... supper instead of Dinner (At least <br>
on the N. Side of Chicago we call it dinner)<br>
<br>
We actually are IN a supper Club now. Just a dinner club that meets <br>
once a month regularly, but our friends from near Rockford, IL named <br>
the group, Supper Club. :)<br>

I have never in my life heard it called anything *but* Duck Duck<br>
Goose, and I've played it/watched my kids play it from coast to coast.<br>
Most people really play it saying "grayduck" instead of "goose"? My<br>
world is rocked...<br>
