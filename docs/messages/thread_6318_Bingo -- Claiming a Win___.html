<br/>
1) You have 3 days from the day your winning word was called to claim a win and still own it effective the day your winning word was called; longer than that and you can still claim the win, but it will be effective on the day you report it, not the day of the actual win.<br/>
<br/>
2) Wins must be communicated to me via email to letterbox@comcast.net. While you are welcome to also post to the list and gloat to your fellow Bingo players, you must notify me via off list email and it is not an official win until I have verified against your card.<br/>
<br/>
3) The state wildcard is not applicable toward the interim games, only the full card.<br/>
<br/>
4) If you have any questions about the games, please review the rules in the files section.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
