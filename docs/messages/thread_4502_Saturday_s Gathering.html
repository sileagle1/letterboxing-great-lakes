                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for an absolutely amazing day!  We were warmly welcomed and <br>
accepted-it felt like home.  Our family is looking forward to getting <br>
to know all of you; it was so nice to put faces to stamps!  Thank you <br>
to all of you who put together such a fantastic set of boxes-we found 5 <br>
of the event stamps and can't wait to go find the rest!<br>
<br>
See you on the trail!<br>
