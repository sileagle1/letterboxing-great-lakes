for those that do not have the updated sleuthing outagamie county passport, here are clue updates:<br>
Thanks for forward the message.  I will be sure a replacement stamp is <br>
put<br>
in the pttp box.  Also, for anyone out there who may be looking for the<br>
Outagamie County Historical society boxes, The Shiocton box was stolen <br>
too<br>
many times and is no longer there, Also, the Seymour box needs added<br>
instructions as it had to be moved after a theft,  " You did not find <br>
the<br>
letterbox because someone took it.  Now, turn around & check the time.<br>
Proceed on a heading of 350 degrees taking one step for every hour on <br>
the<br>
clock. Due west of your current position is the new location of the <br>
box.<br>
Please follow previous instructions 9 & 10"  Good luck and have fun.<br>
