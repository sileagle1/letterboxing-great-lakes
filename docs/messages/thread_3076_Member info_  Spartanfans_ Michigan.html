<br>
We are Spartanfans, comprised of Mike, Heather and Matthew.  Our <br>
trainame comes from our love of Michigan State Univ., where we met <br>
and fell in love, Awwwwww.<br>
<br>
Heather saw a link to letterboxing.org on a board for parents with <br>
babies born in March 2005.  This site has hundreds of hits a day.  <br>
We feel it was divine intervention that we came across this post. LOL<br>
<br>
We found a LB under a mile from our house, and thanks to StampinPam, <br>
we were hooked.  This was April 8th of this year.  Three weeks later <br>
we found our 2nd box and our 1st hitchhiker.  May 6th found us at <br>
our first gathering and we were well on our way.<br>
<br>
We have boxed in 3 different states, in downpours and over 100 <br>
degree weather.  We have converted Heather's parents (Hoot Owl and <br>
Grey Owl) and an Aunt and Uncle who live in Maine.  After 75 boxes <br>
and a trip around the world we feel there is no end in sight.  We <br>
love meeting other boxers, and the riddle aspect of letterboxing.  <br>
We can't wait until our 17 month old, Matthew, can figure out the <br>
clues by himself, and we eagerly await the delivery of our newest <br>
boxer due April, 2007.<br>
