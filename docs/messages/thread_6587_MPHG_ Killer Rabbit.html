I got a message that the Killer Rabbit (carved by my Dad) was just found. It is in good shape except the finder thought the box didn't seal as well as it should.  If anyone is in the area or plans to be and could do a check-up on it, that would be great.  I'm not sure of the container it is in since I didn't hide it.  AJ Lb did, but it appears they are retired from boxing, since they haven't signed into AQ at least since 2007.  I don't remember but I think they logbook is a small 3x5 spiral notebook...I'll contact the finder and see if I can get more info.  In the meantime, I'm going to mark it as "first aid needed".<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>
