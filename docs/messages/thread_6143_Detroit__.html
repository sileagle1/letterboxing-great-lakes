<br/>
I had planned on heading out to Detroit for her services, however, my PTO and our finances may not support my heading out there.<br/>
<br/>
So, this is a priliminary Email to see if there is anyone in Detroit who would be willing to put me up for a night or two? <br/>
<br/>
I do have a cousin who lives there, however, her house is small and I'm sure she will have lots of family and friends through over the course of the visitation/funeral.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a for sure thing, but given the quickness that everything has to fall into place, I figure I would try to get all my ducks in a row.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
