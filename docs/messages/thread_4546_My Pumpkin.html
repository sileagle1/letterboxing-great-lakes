<br/>
  However the best comments came from the last group of the night...a group of 5 or so 16-17 years olds came to the door...and I heard "Cool!  Look at that 'Metallica' pumpkin!" (Mr. carved that one of course) and another guy said "That is so cool!"  I looked at Mr. and gave him the thumbs-up sign and a wink....<br/>
  We let the kids go to the door to hand out the candy, and just as they opened the door we heard "Dude!  Look at that one of the Doors!  That is awesome!"<br/>
  Yeah -- I nearly gave Mr. a high five after hearing that!<br/>
  That made it all worth it!!!  : )<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for all your kind words as well.  I'm definitely gonna do it again next year...however, the kids have made me promised to carve something scarry for the library contest - they were very upset that I didn't win anything.  ; )  God love 'em!  Looks like I'll have to make 2.<br/>
