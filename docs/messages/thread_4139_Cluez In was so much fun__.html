                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Jim and Stacey for all your hard work.  Pru and I enjoyed ourselves very much.  Thanks to everyone who volunteered in any way - the food, prizes, etc. were all so wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I collected so many beautifully carved stamps and will study them in hopes of learning to carve that well some day.  I looked through the log books from the Cat and the Hat Cover and the 55 Chevy Bel Air boxes I left on the tables.  How fun to get all those signature stamps without having to do anything during the event!  Hehehe!<br/>
<br/>
Pru was so tired after Saturday that she didn't even care about any noises outside our tent Saturday night.  We could've had Racoons all over the place and she wouldn't have cared.  Thanks to all who stopped by to give her attention while her mom was off collecting stamps. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the fellow letterboxes that were camping near me and Primitive Cin.  We really enjoyed hanging out and relaxing with you all.  Thanks to whoever left the cooties on our cars Saturday night.  We had fun passing them off to the 2 campsites around the corner in section J.  If you found one under a towel - that was from us.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you heard the story of the speeding ticket I got on Friday night while I drove through the campgrounds.  Well, Primitive Cin has decided that I should carve a stamp in memory of that event.  I would love to hear from all of you on suggestions for this carving.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all of you - this was the most fun I've had letterboxing yet!!<br/>

I know who cootied you and I also know why, I just so happen to know <br/>
that you got the "lucky" ones of the lot also.....  big time LOL...<br/>
<br/>
As I suggested when you first told me of your misadventure with Mr. <br/>
Park Ranger,  I think you should carve a Speed Limit Sign stamp with <br/>
the number 28 and a "Do Not" emblem (circle with a back slash) imposed <br/>
over the top if it.  Your clue to get the Personal Travler would <br/>
be; "What's the speed limit" with the answer being "Not 28"...  In <br/>
honor of the event.<br/>

to be standing close by when the plot was being hatched.  <br/>
