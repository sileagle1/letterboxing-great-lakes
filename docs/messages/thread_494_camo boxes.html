before the winter sets in!  Time for Camo Caps (now there's a product to<br>

retrieved from the trash (not previously used for their intended purpose!).<br>
I only have a few more of them left.<br>

The original FOOW2, which disappeared, was hot pink, however its replacement<br>
is light blue...and still hidden!<br>
