I just finished a personal traveler this afternoon, so if you happen <br>
to meet me on the trail on at a gathering, you have a chance to get <br>
it.<br>
One of my favorite series of books is the Sword of Truth series by <br>
Terry Goodkind. The first book in the series is Wizard's First Rule. <br>
The wizard's first rule gave me a good laugh the first time I came <br>
across it, because I mumble the phrase a lot. <br>
All you have to do to get this stamp is to come up and tell me what <br>
the wizard's first rule is.<br>
<br>
Also, because I know she doesn't get online EVER...Wiener Mouse has <br>
one as well...how you get it depends on the situation. If you see her <br>
on the trail, you can get it as her personal stamp. You just say..."I <br>
am a knight of Ni and I request a shrubbery" and she will give you <br>
one. If you are at a gathering with her, the stamp will be hidden IN <br>
a shrubbery...so you will have to find out which one it is in.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
And just to stir up some conversation in this group...<br>
<br>
For those of you with travelers or those of you who have gotten a <br>
stamp from others, do you count them in your PFX count?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's our personal approach, obviously not the only one possible:<br>
<br>
When we have obtained an image of someone's personal traveler, we just<br>
counted it as a "Miscellaneous" stamp (yes, an "M" count, as if we didn't<br>
have enough categories already!).  We use the miscellaneous category for<br>
personal travelers, traveling event stamps, other stamps laying around at a<br>
gathering, animal signature stamps, etc.<br>
<br>
In other words, we count it as an "M" if it isn't:<br>
- a stamp in a box with clues to follow (our "F" count and "P" count),<br>
- the signature stamp of a human letterboxer (our "X" count),<br>
- an official unique stamp made specifically for an event (our "E" count -<br>
we only count one "E" per event we attend, if there are more event stamps we<br>
count them as an "M".  We like our "E" number to represent the number of<br>
gatherings we have attended) or<br>
- a hitchhiker (our "HH" count).<br>

I've been counting personal travelers in my F count if there was some puzzle I had to solve <br>
to get them, in the X count if the only prerequisite was knowing to ask for it and I've <br>
already got the person's trail stamp.<br>
<br>
(I like to make things complicated, I guess. *sigh*)<br>
<br>
I guess technically they should all be part of an X count, though, as I didn't exchange my <br>
stamp to get the traveler, and according to the FAQ on the LBNA site, "a letterbox can only <br>
count as Found when the letterboxer obtains a stamp image from any stamp associated <br>
with that box, and their personal stamp image has been imprinted (or attempted) in the <br>
logbook or other part of the box."<br>
<br>
Hmm. Looks like I'll start counting them all as X. (Does make life easier.)<br>

Being that you usualy have to anserw a question in order to stamp a <br>
personal traveler in your logbook, I count it in my find count. <br>
Several of the personal travelers that I have found including my own <br>
have there own logbook. If you ever see me on the trail or at a <br>
gathering anserw this question for my personal traveler. What <br>
classic movie monster first appeared in 1954 and this monster is not <br>
from the Lagoon? Talk to you later,<br>
