Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  That is quite an impressive list of boxes!  I noticed that there were<br>
no "Mirkwood" boxes on your list and checked out the clue site to see if<br>
they are even listed and see that they are not.  I think that they never<br>
made it over from the old LbNA site to the new one since she kind of fell<br>
out of the letterboxing picture.<br>
<br>
For those who are not familiar with the name Mirkwood -- this is Ruthann<br>
Zaroff, a veteran SE Michigan letterboxer and stamp-carver extraordinaire.<br>
When I first began 'boxing, we corresponded a lot and she was instrumental<br>
in encouraging me to populate the West Michigan letterboxing void and also a<br>
huge help in getting me going on stamp carving.<br>
<br>
I see that clues to her boxes are still available on her own web site.  Does<br>
anyone know if the boxes are still there?  If so, it may be worth your<br>
effort to attempt at least one of these -- there is something kind of prized<br>
about having a Mirkwood stamp in your book.  As for stamps, I would<br>
recommend Jabberwocky -- it is one of my favorite stamps to this day.  You<br>
might try e-mailing her to see if the boxes are still in place.<br>
<br>
Her site is here:<br>
