Our last box was "The Reaper" in Manistee by Familyof6.  The kids were really looking forward to the box, due to the dire warnings in the clues  that the stamp might be too scary for small children.

This trip just reinforced to me the wonderful variety in letterboxing.  Some stamps were handcarved and others were store-bought, but they all fit the box/location wonderfully.  Some were drive-bys and others were short hikesall took us to interesting places.  Some clues were tricky and others were more straight-forward, but we were able to find the boxes.  I just wish we had more time on this vacation to get more of the boxes in the Traverse area and up by the dunes.  Oh well, another summer.  <br>

We recently got back from our vacation to northern Michigan-and I was able<br>
to get a few boxing trips in. We were staying in Arcadia-and there were 2<br>
boxes planted there. They were planted at 2 great places: the North Bluff<br>
overlook and the gravity-defying "Spook Hill". While we have been to both of<br>
these places a number of times, it was nice to have a stamp there now-and<br>
nice that other people will be lured to these spots {lured in a good way of<br>
course, not lured like Tiptoe when she was supposedly hanging out at<br>
trailheads waiting to pounce on unsuspecting boxers ;~) }. While in Traverse<br>
City, we headed out to the old insane asylum-to check out a relative's<br>
winery, and to snag a few more boxes-which were excellent. Some of the old<br>
buildings had great atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Researching boxes steered us towards a horse stable. We got the box and then<br>
went for a horseback ride. The only instructions we got were pull the reins<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations, BW, on your 300th find!  And yes, I did get a kick out of <br>
your description of your horse riding experience.  Been there and done all <br>
that, believe me, back in my horse-crazy youth.  Sounds like every riding <br>
stable trail ride I ever went on, before my parents finally broke down and <br>
let me get my own horse.<br>

Oh BW...We've moved beyond the"waiting in the parking lot" mischief to bigger and more violent attacks...the "driveby"!  Hehehehe<br>
