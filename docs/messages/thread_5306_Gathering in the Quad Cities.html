I immediately checked our calendar to see if WE could make the event, but realized we'll be hiking in the southeast part of USA that weekend.  Sorry to miss the event, but hope to be in the Quad Cities before the end of the year.<br/>

We continue to pray for your pregnancy and are thrilled with the fact you  <br/>
are in the "safe" zone. We will continue to pray for an Oct. Delivery  though.<br/>
<br/>
Newborns are more than welcome too, though I think all the shelters have  <br/>
open sides so bundle him/her up warmly :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We greatly appreciate the prayers - it is truly a miracle that we made <br/>
it from 28 weeks to almost 38 weeks with the preeclampsia.  Even the <br/>
doctor never imagined that we would get this far (I was not so doubtful, <br/>
though!).  My children have me laughing though - the 7 year old has a <br/>
pile of stuff ready to take to Grandma's already - piled by the stairs, <br/>
heehee!  Never mind that induction date is a week away!  Too funny!<br/>
<br/>
I just cannot wait to hit the trails when I am recuperated - I am going <br/>
stir crazy here watching the world/seasons go by!<br/>
