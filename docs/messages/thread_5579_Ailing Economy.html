WiHi - We're so sorry to hear about the reduction in force issue.  As you know, we came back <br/>
from Tucson with the news that both our adult children were unemployed - one by choice <br/>
another for the reduction issue.  Neither one showed any desire to spend more, lets make <br/>
that ANY, time letterboxing!  But, we can happily report that both have found jobs that far <br/>
exceed what they were doing and making before!  All is not gloom and doom!  Be <br/>
encouraged!<br/>

Sorry to hear of this loss for you and MM. My dad was laid off nearly a  <br/>
decade ago (due to a merger), though the circumstances were different, I can  <br/>
empathize with the uncertainly.<br/>
<br/>
You and Jon will be in our prayers, with hopes of a new start sooner rather  <br/>
than later. <br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, I hope and pray for a heat wave . . . melting all the  snow <br/>
so you can find a myriad of boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WI HI - Sorry to hear about the layoff.  Ailing economy is an understatement!  <br/>
<br/>
After 37 years, my husband was part of the fourth wave of layoffs/reductions at his company.  At least he had received his lump sum pension in hand previously, and then received a severance package at the time of his layoff.  That was last April!  And he's not finding any offers.  Those head hunters who use to call and call and call aren't calling anymore; businesses aren't hiring and the head hunters probably lost their jobs too.  Didn't think those head hunter calls would ever go away, but they did.  It's a scary time.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem in this country is that we have been outsourcing jobs to foreign countries for so many years in the  interest of corporate profits vs lower payrolls and no benefits, that there simply aren't any good jobs left in this country.  High tech jobs have gone oversees.  Made in the USA is not something we see anymore. This country has some major policy decisions that need to be addressed, and jobs and the future economy should be at the top of the list.  No single answer.  But those of us who still have a job are glad to have a job even if it's not the ideal job or what we were looking to do long term.  <br/>
<br/>
Businesses want us to spend but that's not easy to do if you don't have income and you don't dare run up those charge cards.  We're just holding our own.  <br/>

  &gt; On a more serious note, I'm sorry to report that as of today I have<br/>

  WiHi - We're so sorry to hear about the reduction in force issue. As you<br/>
  know, we came back<br/>
  from Tucson with the news that both our adult children were unemployed - one<br/>
  by choice<br/>
  another for the reduction issue. Neither one showed any desire to spend<br/>
  more, lets make<br/>
  that ANY, time letterboxing! But, we can happily report that both have found<br/>
  jobs that far<br/>
  exceed what they were doing and making before! All is not gloom and doom! Be<br/>
  encouraged!<br/>
