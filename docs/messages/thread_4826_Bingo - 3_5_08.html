Wow!  Half the words have been called and I STILL don't have a single thing crossed off in my "G" column.  The same thing is true on my Mid-Atlantic bingo card (they call it TRAIL instead of Bingo) - no "A" words crossed off (and we are half done with that game also).<br>
<br>
Not even a straight line Bingo on either of my cards yet ...  I need four more words to get an "X", but of course that means I would need some "G" words!<br>

The only G word I still need is my own event, The Creepy Crawl!<br>
