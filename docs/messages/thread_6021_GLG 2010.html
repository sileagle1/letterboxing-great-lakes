Well, this Email is an answer to some of your questions. The only question I don't have any idea on is the date . . . I'm leaving that up to SpringChick to decide on (unless she defers it to me or to a poll). <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This gathering will be a joint effort between Pitties, Shorty & Myself (Hart x6) with extra supporting roles as needed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The gathering will hopefully be at one of these two locations. Jubilee State College S.P. is my primary interest as it is over 3,000 acres with all kinds of trails. Jubilee is located just north-west of Peoria, IL. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My second choice is much smaller and just north of Morrison, IL. So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for JCSP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jubilee College State Park http://dnr.state.il.us/lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R1/Jubilee.htm<br>
<br>
Morrison Rockwood State Park http://dnr.state.il.us/lands/Landmgt/parks/R1/MORRISON.HTM<br>
<br>
<br>
The theme will be "CHANGING THE WORLD, ONE BOX AT A TIME" with images carved using images found on World Coins. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There is SUCH a huge selection of images to difficulty of images to carve. You can image search "World Coins ____?_____" and find hundreds of images. The "?" can be filled in with ANYTHING; mermaids, trees, fish, elephants, flowers, buildings, planes, people, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm asking that you carve the entire coin (inside a circle). I ask that you at least give the lettering a try!! If you can't nail it, or you screw it up, then just cut it out leaving no lettering. Though, I think you owe it to yourself to at least try.<br>
<br>
=0<br>
A<br>
I may step on some toes with this, but there are a few things I ask not be a part of your stamp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) If you plan on using metallic's (gold, silver, bronze) please include an ink pad, as not everyone has their own. If you can get away with stamping it with Brown, Black or Gray that would be preferred.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Please no HUGE stamps. I was thinking of setting a standard (ie nothing bigger than 3" across), however, I'll leave the size up to you -- but please try to keep the stamps from growing to a large size.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3) Keep the stamps "clean" or "G" rated. There are coins out there with nudity, I ask that you respect the many folks who would prefer not finding a "PG-13" stamp.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also with #3 we may want to discuss offensive images. One quick example are the German 3 Reich coins all have a swastika on them. If you think the image will offend someone, please find something else.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PLEASE PLEASE Try to have your stamps into us within a month of the actuall gathering -probably next April/May. There is a lot of time between now and then, carve them up and get them to us ASAP so that no one will be left sweating it out at the last minute. ALSO, I will soon be posting this to AQ, PLEASE sign up what coin or set of coins you will be carving so that there are no duplicates.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The exact date is still TBA. Personally, I would like to see it remain the same or move one week later to accommodate those with kids in school. I've been on=2<br>
0this board long enough to know that you can't please everyone!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's looking forward to GLG 2010 & getting the park of our choice.<br>

Oh! Sorry. Usually "Great Lakes Gathering" refers to the big multi-state event in May/June.<br>
<br>
The "Boxacon 2009" gathering in Waukesha, WI on October 3rd is also listed on AtlasQuest:<br>
<br>
http://www.atlasque st.com/showinfo. html?gEventId= 1104<br>
<br>
where you'll also see a link to the event's own website:<br>
<br>
http://sites. google.com/ site/boxacon/ home<br>
<br>
See you there!<br>

course of the last year I sold off on Ebay. I collected coins in earnest for  <br>
about 12 years, and amassed coins from every country in the world.<br>
 <br>
If you have an idea, and have trouble locating a coin with the image you  <br>
want, please contact me & I will work with you in finding the right  image.<br>
 <br>
In addition to Google Image Search, you can try Ebay and look up completed  <br>
listings for a specific coin -- you may find a good image there. Your local <br>
 Library may be of help too . . . just look for The Standard Catalog of <br>
World  Coins by krause.<br>

Trees, Flowers, Animals, Buildings, Profiles, Olympics, Air Planes/Jets,  <br>
Presidents, Landmarks, etc etc<br>

Many many of the stamps that will be there will probably be, Brown, black, and grey. But Im sure we will see some nice colorful ones. Its not like there will be lots of stamps to color. <br>
<br>
Color: I have a Gold ink pad( Pigment ink pad, Stampabilities brand) and it does not rub off even close to the "Juicy" metalics. So maybe we can have metalics if they are not so "juicy" like mine. I got it a hobby lobby and it works great.<br>
<br>
Also the size it a throw up too. The coins I do will be actual size to the real deal, only becasue I have a coin collection, but I too love big and small stamps. I think Variety is key.<br>

<br>
i think in the end, i still lean toward the option for multi colored stamps. letterboxing, to me, is a celebration of art and adventure. the art is in creating stamps that r fun and beautiful and (for me) colorful both when carving and stamping up. part of the adventure,  <br>
is batteling mosquitos and rushing to finish before ur caught and fumbling around to keep track of all ur supplies. :) <br>

Actually I prefer it when gathering boxes are left as permanent placements.<br>
That way there isn't such a rush/need to actually find all the boxes on the<br>
day of the event. When possible it's also nice to have multiple starting<br>
points/areas for the boxes so people are spread out throughout a park,<br>
rather than a single continuous stream.  I'd rather see some variety even<br>
though it may not lend itself as well to the "assembly line" approach that<br>
some other events have advocated.<br>

That said, I tend to agree with the notion that too many rules can be limiting, and could result in some rather similar-looking images.

Is that what the "fuss" is about . . . you all think these are "rules". <br>
 <br>
I look at them more as guidelines -- if you re-read "rule" #2 I added  <br>
"however, I'll leave the size up to you"<br>
 <br>
Sure I added "but please try to keep the stamps from growing to a large  <br>
size." I will not be the stamp Nazi and scold anyone for creating a huge stamp <br>
.  . . I promise.<br>

And Speedsquare did a great job this past year in spreading the boxes out so we weren't stacked on top of each other.  <br>

Bottom line is...just plant those boxes so we can find them.  Whatever size, shape, color!<br>

While I did intend to pick this back up once my schedule frees up a bit, apparently that was not soon enough.  Guess I'll just stay tuned to see what you decide.<br>
