Initial plans are to have it on Sat. 7/14.  The gathering would be<br/>
during the day at Doyne Park in Milwaukee (within walking distance of<br/>
Miller Park and free parking).<br/>
<br/>
"Tail-gate" style lunch and dinner at the park.  Gathering themed<br/>

As a wrap-up to the gathering, we'd all go to the Brewer game that<br/>

I need to know if there is enough interest in order to get group<br/>

1982 was the first year I was interested in baseball, and I got<br/>
spoiled by having a great team to cheer and great games to watch.  I<br/>
bet I could still name the staring lineup from that year. I still hate<br/>
the Cardinals for winning the Series. Imagine my dilemma in 1987 when<br/>
the dreaded Twins were playing the hated Cards in that years' Series<br/>
when I was a freshman here at the U of M - who could I cheer against<br/>
harder?!<br/>
<br/>
And Paul Molitor - Ooh la!**fanning self** <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a great outing - have fun, and have a brat for me! :)<br/>

reminded me and I wanted to share.  For those of you<br/>
who follow baseball, you may have heard how the<br/>
Cleveland Indians first few home games and the weather<br/>
were not coinciding nicely, and our "home" games<br/>
against the Angles were actually moved to Miller Park.<br/>
 A few years ago I was in Milwaukee (loved the town,<br/>
it reminded me of Cleveland ;) and went to a game at<br/>
Miller Park.  My friend &amp; I were highly amused by the<br/>
Running of the Sausages at that game.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night another friend &amp; I got to attend an<br/>
Indians home game that was actually played at home. <br/>
Previously at Jacob's Field, at some point between<br/>
innings they'd show an animated Hot Dog Race on the<br/>
scoreboard, with animated Ketchup, Mustard &amp; Onion hot<br/>
dogs racing on the screen.  At the game Saturday, when<br/>
it came time for the Hot Dog Race, they actually had<br/>
people in hot dog costumes - one with ketchup, one<br/>
with mustard, one with onions -  a la the sausages, do<br/>
the race on the field, like in Milwaukee.  Guess those<br/>
Sausages left an impression!<br/>
