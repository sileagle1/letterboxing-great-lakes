great picnic area reserved for us at Moraine Hills SP!  You can read <br>
the details on the gathering site:<br>

<br>
If you are placing boxes yourself at the park, please keep in mind I <br>
had to sign an agreement to not "have a damaging effect on property <br>
or vegetation in the park".  Hopefully, they will not feel <br>
letterboxing is an activity that goes against this policy.  Let's <br>
present ourselves as good stewards of the environment (as always) so <br>
no questions are raised.  Thank you!<br>
<br>
