The very first box that I ever placed, Commuter Rail, is gone!  I went<br/>
out to check on it, and it is gone, gone, gone!  It wasn't the best<br/>

I am so sorry to hear that.  My family and I were<br/>
lucky enough to find that box.  The stamp is terrific.<br/>
 Do you intend on replacing it?<br/>

I'm beginning to wonder if losing your first letterbox is an <br/>
initiation rite or something... it happened to me and, when I posted <br/>
about it, a few others replied that they had the same experience.  I <br/>
guess we learn from our mistakes (or accidents) and get better for <br/>
them.  BTW, I replaced mine, moving it to a slightly different <br/>
location and it's doing well.<br/>

If I replace it, I won't put it so close to the teen center and<br/>
football practice field.  That *may* had something to do with it's<br/>
disappearance.  :-)<br/>

I'm so sorry about Commuter Rail!  That was our first 'first find'.  <br/>
It was such a great stamp and I thought it was a great location.  We <br/>
had to dig it out so I thought it was hidden pretty well.  Sorry this <br/>
had to happen and we hope it doesn't dampen your enthusiasm for <br/>
planting, we love your boxes!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mine too!!!  In retrospect, the container I used was probably too big for<br/>
its hidey hole, so probably that left it vulnerable to being spotted.  I<br/>
waited a while and replaced it with a smaller box which [knock on the wood<br/>
of the tree it is hidden in!] so far is still alive and kicking.<br/>
<br/>
It's a very disconcerting feeling having a box go AWOL!  I know how you<br/>
feel.<br/>
