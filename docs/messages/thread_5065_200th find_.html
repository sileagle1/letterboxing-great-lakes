Thank you to everyone who plants boxes. I've been to Ohio, Michigan,<br>
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Minnesota, not to mention all over my home<br>
state of Wisconsin. If not for all the carving that goes on, I<br>
wouldn't have had so many fun boxes to find. And I've only scratched<br>
the surface!<br>
<br>
I hope to add to my numbers at the Bird and GL gatherings. However,<br>
Aimlesst is very militant about only counting boxes that I go out and<br>
find... those clever gathering stamps that I find in cookies and<br>
Christmas trees don't count! ;)<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone!<br>

at those upcoming events, and some new exchanges for all of us, in addition<br>
to chatting with all the "familiar faces".  Hopefully the weather will<br>
cooperate so we can enjoy the time out on the trails!<br>
