bought stamp for 3 years. I was almost finished (after a good 4 hours) <br/>
when I carved out a spot I wasn't supposed to. It was just a little <br/>
square spot. I was just thinking to myself ,"Wouldn't that suck if I <br/>
just messed up now." I guess I shouldn't think when I carve. I was <br/>
wondering if there was any filler I could put in the spot so I wouldn't <br/>
have to do it all over again. Any suggestions? <br/>

Ugh!  That sucks.  I wonder if you could cut out a hole all the way <br/>
through the rubber with an exacto knife, then cut the same size piece <br/>
of rubber out of a fresh piece and plug the hole with it.  Maybe you <br/>
could add a little super glue to the edges from the back to keep it <br/>
in place.  Then carve the fresh piece with the rest of the design.<br/>
<br/>
It might be hard to carve the edges of the small piece once its <br/>
plugged in and the edges may cause a little glitch in the design <br/>
where the pieces of rubber meet.  But, it's worth a shot if the whole <br/>
carving is going to be ruined anyway.  Good luck!  Let us know what happens.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I didn't see the first message, but from the replies I can tell what happened.  I just wanted to say that removing and replacing a piece of rubber DOES work!  I've done it!  I carved a design for an event stamp with really detailed text.  Got it completely done and THEN realized I had carved the WRONG DATE!! Aggg.<br/>
<br/>
I carefully removed the date and replaced the piece of rubber with an exact size match (the hardest part of the whole process!)  Trust me, cut an easy shape (square, rectangle, etc.) it's easier to match!  I glued it in place by putting a back on the stamp.  By gluing the main piece and the fill piece to the backing, both were set.  Then once the glue was dry, I recarved the correct date after I did the transfer on the uncarved rubber part.  <br/>
<br/>
I had clean edges around the part I replaced, so a tiny gap wouldn't be an issue.  But I think if you can get a close enough match, the repair won't be noticeable, even if it crosses a line or two in the design.  But I have to say this was with PZ Kut white.  Not sure if other mediums would work as well, especially if they are softer with more "give" or crumbly.<br/>

Go to "My Stamps" (there's sound too)<br/>
It's the 5th stamp down marked "event stamp"<br/>
