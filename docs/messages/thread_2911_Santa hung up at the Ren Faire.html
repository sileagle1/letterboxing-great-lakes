Apparently, Santa and Mrs. Claus have been spending a whole lot of <br/>
time at the Bristol Renaissance Faire - We always knew they just <br/>
couldn't spend ALL of their time at the North Pole!  I think ol' Santa <br/>
and the Misses have even taken up alias identities somewhat out of <br/>
their usual character..Rumor has it that Santa may be involved with <br/>
the making of armour, and dare we metion that Mrs. Claus has been <br/>
dabbling in the art of....well, ...wenching!<br/>
Nonetheless, they delivered to us humble folk an assortment of pens, <br/>
notebooks, a journal, wooden Christmas cutouts, an afterbite stick, 2 <br/>
pieces of PZcut and of course coupons to come visit them at the Faire!<br/>
We send our thanks your way Mr. &amp; Mrs. Claus for finding an alternate <br/>
address - it was fine..Although, it did throw Tonto off a bit!  We <br/>
hope you two don't loose too much jolly weight sweating away in those <br/>
hot costumes!  We are booked up with a host of weddings and showers <br/>
for the next three weekends - But, we will pass on the coupons to some <br/>
potential letterboxing friends!<br/>
