I will spend all of my teachery free time (*grin*) to track this down.  Start on the big list, you say?  Good idea, seeing as how that list provided me with answers to certain questions about personal travelers.<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, that odd other page on my website relates to my PT.<br/>

I was going to ask "YOU HAVE THE CLUES TO THE MACKINAW ISLAND <br/>
BOXES????!!!!" thinking you had a copy of the ORIGINAL clues to the <br/>
ORIGINAL boxes there.  It sure would be nice for a couple of you MI <br/>
boxers to do some hunting down of the original boxes/clues.  There <br/>
is a huge mystery and interesting history to delve into!  If <br/>
interested, do a search of the messages on the "big" list concerning <br/>
Mackinaw Island.<br/>

&gt; Travel plans for the summer really revolve around one event- what <br/>
has been dubbed "Ken's Folly", our triathlon in Mackinaw City in <br/>
August.  We try to spend a week in Cheboygan camping each summer, <br/>
and this race thingie worked perfectly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So should we manage to crawl out of our tent the day after the <br/>
race, we'll probably go check out the three or four boxes on <br/>
Mackinac Island- one is located right on the pier!  Anyone else <br/>
found those boxes?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We've found the two in St. Ignace, so I'm pulling for a new lower <br/>
UP box to pop up before hand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Other than that, we're mostly homebound for the duration of the <br/>
summer months.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; p.s. Who, being a true Michigander, knows the difference between, <br/>
and snorts with disgust when outsiders misspell "Mackinaw" <br/>
or "Mackinac".<br/>
