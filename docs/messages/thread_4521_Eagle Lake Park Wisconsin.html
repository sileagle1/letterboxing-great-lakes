<br/>
We had a report or two that our Eagle Lake box was<br/>
missing.  We found that what actually happened is that<br/>
a squirrel had ignored one of the main rules of<br/>
letterboxing.  "Do not bury them."  At first glace,<br/>
the box appeared to be gone.  I felt there was no<br/>
possible way for that to happen without someone<br/>
removing it from the base of the tree on purpose.  So<br/>
I started scraping out the dirt inside the tree until<br/>
to my surprise I saw a little blue and clear plastic. <br/>
Since the box was placed in 04, the original tight fit<br/>
has become significantly tighter.  It took some<br/>
pulling and wiggling, but we finally got it out.  We<br/>
rehid the box so that it's sticking out a bit and then<br/>
covered it with some other logs for right now, but we<br/>
may have to move it in the future or the tree may not<br/>
let us have it back!<br/>
<br/>
We wonder how many "missing" boxes are actually there<br/>
buried under a couple of years of forest litter.<br/>
