My first try doing the skin peel technique.  (I couldn't get a good picture of it lite in the <br/>
dark...but trust me, it looks totally sweet!)<br/>
<br/>
I used a #2 Speedball, and a couple of cheapy gouges made for wood carving.<br/>
<br/>
I transfered the image onto the pumpkin using tracing paper I sent through my inkjet printer, <br/>
except for the lettering.  That I had to do free hand due to goofing up on the punching.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it turned out pretty good for my first try.  If you want to see it, it's in the "misc." <br/>
folder here on the group photo's page.<br/>

What STRANGE DAYS we have here!  We opened up THE DOORS to our favorite <br/>
yahoo group and what do we see coming out of the doglvrs SOUL KITCHEN <br/>
but RIDERS ON THE STORM waiting to BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER <br/>
SIDE ...of a pumpkin no less!<br/>
<br/>
Tiptoe wants to dress up like a LA WOMAN to join the other Trick'r <br/>
Treaters in THE SOFT PARADE to your DOORStep tomorrow night as your <br/>
pumpkin begs you, "LIGHT MY FIRE!"...Come on baby, light his fire will <br/>
you!<br/>
<br/>
When Tiptoe comes knocking, all she really wants is to say, HELLO, I <br/>
LOVE YOU (I already know your name...)and to tell you we think your <br/>
carving is spectacular...THE END<br/>
