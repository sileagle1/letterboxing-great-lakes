exterior protective plastic bag layer.  Like yours, they were near areas in<br>
which flooding was a possibility.  Just wondering how many others on the<br>
list do use exterior plastic bags around their letterboxes???  What kind of<br>
experience have you had doing so???<br>

I did for my Fish Out of Water just because I didn't like the seal on the<br>
box I used.  (I found a source now for better ones.)  When I checked it<br>
yesterday and PLANTED CLUES FOR A BONUS BOX INSIDE IT [announcing here first<br>
before I do so on the big list 'cuz I like you guys...] I discovered someone<br>
put it in yet another bag.  I hadn't thought about the bags making the boxes<br>
more critter-friendly.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I agree there are pros and cons.  Sometimes I use an outer bag, <br>
sometimes I don't -- depends on the area, the hiding spot and the <br>
container.  I do think the outer bag gives critters an advantage -- <br>
something to latch onto and drag it away, and I have seen several of <br>
my outer bags that were punctured with teeth marks.<br>
<br>
So if the container seals tightly and the area is not prone to <br>
wetness I tend to leave off the outer bag in favor of placing all <br>
inner contents inside a large ziploc baggie, in addition to their <br>
smaller individual bags.  But I do still use the outer bags in some <br>
places, especially where wetness is a factor and if the container <br>
does not seal well or is too small for an inner large bag.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally, I don't see much value in outer bags. They are usually torn <br>
quite quickly after being pulled out from under a rock or tree stump, and <br>
once they're punctured, all they do is serve as a holding place for <br>
moisture close to the letterbox. I'd rather see a sturdier container used <br>
instead, and I also use the "burp test" to check containers to see how <br>
watertight they actually are. Close the container, and then press firmly on <br>
the lid. If air is expelled, then the container isn't likely to be <br>
watertight and water will eventually work itself into the box. For <br>
instance, the small sandwich sized Rubbermaid containers aren't watertight <br>
at all, and neither are most of the cheaper varieties of plastic containers <br>
you find at dollar stores. Water is a significant enemy of a letterbox, <br>
particularly when they may be exposed to freezing temperatures and snow, <br>
and a torn outer bag won't do any good.<br>
