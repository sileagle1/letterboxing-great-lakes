                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we weren't CAMPING, but we were out biking on the "Yellow Brick Road"<br>
(Hennepin Canal trail) Friday afternoon with Tiptoe & Tonto when dark clouds<br>
appeared VERY suddenly, winds whipped the trees and our bikes and rain began<br>
to fall.  We pedaled furiously back to the van and arrived just before the<br>
full force of the storm let loose.  Later that night, just after dinner at<br>
the B&B, we got to hear the weather warning sirens sounding a few times.<br>
Luckily there was no serious damage and no power loss and we were back out<br>
on the trail both Saturday & Sunday.<br>

Gosh, and I thought it was just me! Charlie's Day Out and I camped in<br>
Lansing, MI, Friday night - and got hit by 70+ MPH winds. At least this time<br>
I got the tent down before the wind knocked it down, so the (freshly<br>
repaired) poles stayed intact. Unfortunately, it rained for at least an hour<br>
before I could go set it back up again, so everything was wet. My family has<br>

"Kristin's going camping" weather.<br>
