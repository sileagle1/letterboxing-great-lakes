<br>
 <br>
<br>
A month ago I realized that there were over 300 boxes in WI that we hadn't<br>
found yet, so we have spent the last 3 weekends out & about in the state<br>
(Eau Claire area, LaCrosse area and Rhinelander area).  We've had lots of<br>
adventures & pretty sights and were successful in finding most of the boxes<br>
we looked for.  We even "found" a letterboxER yesterday - we ran into<br>
Pastor's Wife on a trail in Saint Germain, WI!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Now that we've been whittling away on our list of boxes to find, at least 10<br>
new ones were planted this weekend. Many thanks to all of you who have been<br>
planting!<br>
