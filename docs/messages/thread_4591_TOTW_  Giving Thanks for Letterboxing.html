                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good TOTW!  Like you, I am thankful for letterboxing because of the great places it has taken me and even more so, the wonderful people I have met and become friends with from all across the country.  In addition, I am thankful that letterboxing has opened up to me a whole new art form (carving) that I had not previously given much thought to and certainly never tried.  These days I carve more for non-letterbox projects than for letterboxes and although I still treasure and use my pre-carving rubber stamp collection, I seldom buy new rubber stamps, rather just adapt ideas I see to something I can carve myself.<br/>
<br/>
I am also thankful for letterboxing because in a small way it has helped me to share something I have long held dear -- a love of the trail, the woods, the forest.  Since high school I have been a hiker and have long cherished a quiet afternoon walking through the woods on a narrow trail, just listening and observing the world around me -- almost like a secret place at times, providing an escape from the demands and immediacy of life and a place where one can truly just *be.*  But it is difficult to convey this sense of magic in words; it really is something that people must experience themselves and become emotionally connected with to understand.  Letterboxing has been a catalyst in sharing this with other people as it gives them a reason to get out there (the letterbox) and along the way, they come to understand the power of a simple walk through the woods.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great topic! I would have to say that I am thankful for all the parks <br/>
and lovely areas we have visited in the two years we have been <br/>
boxing, both in our own backyards (so to speak) and around the <br/>
country. It certainly makes a cross-country drive much more enjoyable <br/>
if you know you are stopping along the way to get some great stamps! <br/>
And also, I love the fact that letterboxing is one of the few hobbies <br/>
that B and I can participate in together and has given us a ton of <br/>
great, shared memories.<br/>
<br/>
Jeez. What a sap I am! :-)<br/>

from ages 42-3, can really enjoy together for many different reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thankful to letterboxing for the art of carving, finely an art <br/>
that won't take up space in my house (I just drop it off in the woods <br/>
insted), and gives me a way to share my work with others (and get <br/>
wonderful comments unlike all the painting and calligraphy in my <br/>
attic).<br/>
<br/>
I'm thankful to letterboxing for the 12 pounds I lost this summer. Now <br/>
I don't dread my walks any longer, insted I have dates written on my <br/>
calander just for letterboxing so I have no excuse to skip my <br/>
next "workout".<br/>
