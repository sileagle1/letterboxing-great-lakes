everything is slow for me now that I severely cut up my hand on some<br>
glass last Sat.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Leapin' Lizards, the Bristol stamps are being worked on.  I<br>
still do not know whether they'll be ready for opening weekend though,<br>
but they may be.  Stay posted.<br>
<br>
I'm also looking into the possibility of having ALL the Bristol boxes<br>
from the past five years available one of the weekends.  Originally, I<br>
was looking at 7/19, but now I'm thinking of the weekend of 7/26.<br>
<br>
Also, I am working on the 10th anniversary of LBing in WI gathering. <br>
We will have the gathering at Whitefish Dunes SP in Door Cty - the<br>
site of the first LB in WI.  The two dates the shelter is available<br>
are 10/4 and 10/11.  Please vote in the poll as to your preference if<br>
you would like to come.  Note that the poll closes on Friday night<br>
(needto reserve the shelter quickly).<br>
<br>
I am seeking input for a theme for the gathering as well as any help,<br>
including making and hiding boxes, and the making of the event stamp.<br>
   I am also working on some special things for the gathering which I<br>
won't announce until they are firmed up.  Email me (please don't post<br>
it to the GL site) to let me know of any help/suggestions/themes you<br>
can offer.  I'd like to make this OUR celebration, not just mine as<br>
much as possible.<br>
<br>
A couple of things to keep in mind:<br>
-Whitefish Dunes has no camping - there is camping at Potawonami and<br>
Penninsula SP nearby.<br>
-Whitefish Dunes is a state park so you need a sticker.  However,<br>
there is limited parking at the county park connected to the SP which<br>
is free.<br>
-Both parks have limited parking.  Carpooling (esp. with gas prices<br>
these days) is highly encouraged.<br>
-No boxes made for the event will be permanent (temporary boxes only).<br>
 The park is on fragile land, and they've been VERY nice to allow the<br>
one box to remain.  Boxes will be/should be placed so they have VERY<br>
LOW impact on the land, and should NOT be placed anywhere near the<br>
dangerous cliffs or in sensitive areas.  Boxes may also be hidden in<br>
the county park nearby with the same restrictions.<br>
<br>
Watch for more info to come...<br>
