&gt;For those of you having trouble accessing Atlas Quest, I am aware of<br/>
&gt;the problem and am trying to fix it. The web hosting provider is<br/>
&gt;making me change IP addresses, and it's causing problems at the<br/>
&gt;moment. The server, I'm happy to report, really is up and running--it<br/>
&gt;just seems that there's a problem routing the domain name to it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not sure how long the problem will go on for, but hopefully it'll be<br/>
&gt;fixed soon and sorry for the trouble. Just so you all know what's<br/>
&gt;going on, though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The site and all of the data on it is fine. It's just the connection<br/>
&gt;from a personal computer to Atlas Quest that's having trouble.<br/>
