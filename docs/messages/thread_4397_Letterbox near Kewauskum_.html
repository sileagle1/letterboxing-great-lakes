thinking Washington County, not Fond du Lac! Thus, a different region <br>
of the state.<br>
<br>
It looks to be a longer hike than I realized....I might get the <br>
children to do that one.....I keep saying that....it is the younger <br>
one who whines still - and yet he was the one on my case about going <br>
hiking (we have not gone all summer!!).<br>
<br>
It is worth a try!  They put up with me and the 3 boxes we went after <br>
today.  If I bribe them with swimming at Mauthe Lake afterwards, they <br>
might hike it and not even realize the distance...it could happen!<br>
<br>
Thank you again!<br>

Sounds like my kids . . . all four of them. Looks like they have small pox on their arms/legs and face. Poor things.<br>
<br>
Are you still coming to the Quad Cities? I've held off on pulling my Channel Cat stamp . . . I need to re-locate my "Isle of Capri" stamp, figure most people wouldn't want to wander into a homeless camp to find a stamp (unless you had a sandwich to share).<br>
