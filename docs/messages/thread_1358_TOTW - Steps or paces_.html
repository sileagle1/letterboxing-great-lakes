                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, the military definition of a pace is the DISTANCE covered in a step, usually estimated to be about 2.5 feet.  So if I put my left foot down, and then my right foot down, the distance I have covered between those two is considered a pace.  In contrast, many letterboxers define each FOOTFALL to be a pace and would consider the same action -- left foot down, right foot down -- to be 2 paces.  That being said, I think there is a misconception about the military pace in thinking that EACH left/right combination is a pace, which would equal 1 pace for every two footfalls.  I haven't ever been able to find anything that defines a pace in this way as technically, it is only the beginning jaunt where the left/right combination is required to make a pace -- after that initial stride, each new footfall would be a pace, measured from the previous footfall.<br/>
<br/>
Like Mosey, I have a note at the bottom of my clue page that indicates how I use "pace" and also that my compass readings are magnetic.  When looking for a letterbox, unless otherwise noted, I usually interpret a pace to be a footfall since that's how most do it -- I think there was a poll done once at letterboxing.org and about 3/4 of people used the individual footfall definition for pace.  If that doesn't seem to work out, I double it and try again.<br/>
<br/>
I don't really think there is a need to attempt to define it across the board and if the clues don't give an indication, it doesn't bother me.  Measuring distance in paces is so arbitrary anyway given that everyone's stride is a different length and some pace by walking naturally and others by taking an exaggerated step.  I don't know if any of you SE MI folks have had a chance to do any Mirkwood boxes, but she had the shortest pace I've ever encountered.  After ending up way out in the underbrush looking for her first couple of boxes, I got in the habit of halving the number she gave, to be consistent with my single step.  If I am going to use paces as a critical part of the clue or over a long distance, I usually try to give a calibration pacing first so that people are aware of the distance of my pace.<br/>
<br/>
BTW -- if you are from SE MI or find yourself visiting that area (i.e. the 2005 Great Lakes Gathering) and have not done any Mirkwood boxes, you should try to do so.  She was one of the U.S. letterboxing pioneers who lived in MI and her carvings are wonderful.  I had the good fortune of getting to know her a bit before she dropped out of the letterboxing game.  Her carving style and assistance definitely influenced me as I was learning how to wield my X-acto knife.  Her boxes are not listed on the LbNA site, but clues can be found at her web site (not sure how up-to-date this is):  http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/letterboxing/.  Although each of her boxes is a treat, the stamp from Jabberwocky is one of my favorite stamps of all the letterboxes I have found.<br/>

<br/>
I learned one pace was about 5 feet, which was about 2 steps when I was 8 years old.  All <br/>
my clues with paces reflect this.  I am much more coordinated in my pacing by counting <br/>
only my right foot down.  But this is why I had trouble in Hell last year.  I had to work hard <br/>
at matching up the clues to the intermediate paces, but I guess I forced the clues to fit my <br/>
spot.  This time I did it differently and found it quickly.  When I use paces I try to find the <br/>
most distict formation that can be described precisely.  I am reminded of one of scoutdogs <br/>
boxes that says ... look for the urinal tree ... no kidding, you cannot miss it!<br/>
<br/>
If I can't find a box, I'll take the time to start over.  I will probably always consider one pace <br/>
equals two steps.  I will use steps when there are fewer than 3 paces to the box, such as "a <br/>
handful of steps."<br/>

We don't define step and pace in our actual clues, but<br/>
we have it listed on our main clue page at our<br/>
website.  I've always assumed that, not being told how<br/>
many footfalls a pace equals, was part of the<br/>

&gt;Coming from the Catholic school system, I use a military pace rather than a<br/>
&gt;geometric pace. A pace is a step is a step is a pace.  You put one foot<br/>
&gt;down, it's a pace.  You put another foot down, it's another pace.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A nun once used the word in a sentence: "The bear was 10 paces behind me so<br/>
&gt;I quickened my pace."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the entire class gasped.  We later discussed the issue on the<br/>
&gt;playground as to why a nun would have to be afraid of a bear.  It seemed<br/>
&gt;strange to us little kids that all bears wouldn't just naturally obey a nun.<br/>
&gt;Such was the Catholic school system in the '50s.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I put my definition of the word in the clues.  On the other hand, it can<br/>
&gt;make it rather interesting if a placer *doesn't* put it in the clues and the<br/>
&gt;searcher has to try one, then try the other if the one doesn't fit.<br/>
&gt;However, if measuring a pace as two steps would take the searcher over the<br/>
&gt;edge of a cliff, the decision becomes a bit easier.  Or so one would hope.<br/>
&gt;If it doesn't, I guess that's potentially Darwin in action if the drop is<br/>
&gt;long enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of the boxes I found yesterday went one better than *my* clues and gave<br/>
&gt;the searcher a rough way to do a field measurement:  "On the left side of<br/>
&gt;the trail are a bench and kiosk.  From the left side of the bench to the<br/>
&gt;right side of the kiosk is 5 human steps.  Six steps past the right side of<br/>
&gt;the kiosk on the left side of the trail is a tree with the tiny fox den on<br/>
&gt;the South side, down low."  Making it easy to measure what the placer<br/>
&gt;considered the distance of a human step.  I thought that was a nice touch.<br/>
