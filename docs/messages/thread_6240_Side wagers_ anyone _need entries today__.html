&gt;Just a reminder about the side wagers game!  Please send your <br/>
&gt;guesses to <br/>
&gt;<mailto:baliddle%40sbcglobal.net>baliddle@sbcglobal.net.  I've <br/>
&gt;responded to all the entries I've received, so if you sent a guess <br/>
&gt;and didn't get a reply, you may want to resend it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When sending your entry, please include your date and your trail <br/>
&gt;name. You may include a 1st choice &amp; 2nd choice of dates in your <br/>
&gt;email if you wish.  In the event that your 1st date is chosen, I <br/>
&gt;will assign you the 2nd date if it is available.  In the event that <br/>
&gt;both dates are chosen, a new date will be assigned to you that falls <br/>
&gt;between your chosen dates if possible, or by assigning the next <br/>
&gt;available date.<br/>
<br/>
To be valid, your entries must be submitted by the end of the day <br/>
today (I'll actually allow them to be received by 3am eastern time to <br/>
allow for the unlikely west coast entries!).<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and good luck!<br/>
<br/>
