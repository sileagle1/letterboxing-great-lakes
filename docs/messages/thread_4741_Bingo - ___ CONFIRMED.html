the following words:<br>
<br>
First Finder (1/20/08)<br>
Clue (1/7/08)<br>
W.O.M. (her free pick)<br>
Mastercarve (1/1/08)<br>
Cichlid Guy (2/3/08)<br>
<br>
Congratulations Artistamp!  Prizes don't get mailed until after the<br>
game is all over so I know how many winners there are total.  I have<br>
your address so we're all set with that.<br>
<br>
Okay folks, the straight line game is history -- there are so many<br>
people who were sitting on the cusp I'm sure we will be hearing about<br>
many "day lates" all week.  You're now looking for:<br>
<br>
4 Corners<br>
Perimeter<br>
X<br>
Full Card<br>
<br>
The best of luck to everyone!<br>
