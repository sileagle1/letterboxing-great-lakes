Mom had made a felt Santa face, and put a bunch of small velcro pieces in the beard area, with numbers by each velcro tab. Each day, we'd put a white pom-pom onto Santa's face on the appropriately-numbered tab so that by Christmas day his beard would be complete. And yes, arguments about who got to put the pom-pom on Santa's face each day ensued, so we did the "every-other-day" taking turns thing, too. And Mom also still hangs it, too, only Santa now starts off the month with his full pom-pom beard in place rather than her and my dad taking turns putting the pom-poms on as the month progresses :)<br>
