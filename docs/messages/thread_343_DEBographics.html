You must live somewhere near Grand Rapids, MI, or Ripon, CA.  Of course, <br/>
there are other pockets of Dutchmen in the USA (but I don't know  them)!  We don't <br/>
seem to have the Debbie Reynolds Phenomenon here, in  Jenison, MI, But we <br/>
have all the Vans, De's, and B's that you are speaking  of!  My parent's came <br/>
straight off the boat from the Netherlands with my  two brothers.  My sister and <br/>
I were born here.  I was adopted (Dark  hair, eyes, and skin)  People just <br/>
assumed I was from Indonesia...if they  were Dutch:)<br/>
