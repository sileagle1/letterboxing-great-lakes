                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a gorgeous weekend!!!  We brought some friends out letterboxing <br>
with us on Saturday to help get them into it.  We met Merlin and Ardea <br>
on the trail at one of CMoon's boxes.  A first for us, and naturally <br>
for our newbie friends.  (We're kind of newbies ourselves, we've only <br>
been boxing since July).  It was great meeting them on the trail.<br>
<br>
We went out today to plant our first series in Elgin, IL.  When we <br>
were done with that, we headed back out to the Haunted Trail series to <br>
get box 1, which had been missing when we were there rain-boxing last <br>
weekend.  While we were there, we met the Irish Frogs.  We want to <br>
thank CMoon, Kookuburra, and Squeek for this great series that seems <br>
to have everyone meeting on the trail.  It's almost like a mini <br>
gathering in of itself, and the stamps are great.  Besides the Irish <br>
Frogs, we also saw 5 deer.  Last week, we're pretty sure we saw a <br>
wolf, or the world's largest coyote.<br>
