Ahhhh, I'm SOOOO sorry!  I don't know what just happened!  I was just <br/>
reading my yahoo email, and I had a letter in my inbox from Kiddy <br/>
Writer.  So I went ahead and opened it up since we were emailing a bit <br/>
last week, but then I saw what it was.  I didn't open the attachment <br/>
or anything, but I noticed somehow it just got fowarded to the group <br/>
and posted!  I don't know how that happened.<br/>
<br/>
Sooo sorry,<br/>
