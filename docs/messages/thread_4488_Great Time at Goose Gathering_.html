                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a wonderful time at the "A Wild Goose Chase" gathering today <br>
in Iowa!  It took place in our "sister region", the Midwest, but we <br>
were not the only Great Lakes representatives.  It was "Great" to see <br>
our "old" friends The Cottontails, the full contingent of Hart x6, <br>
Atom118 & CoffeeBeans, and Prairie Dog again.  We also met some newer <br>
Wisconsin boxers, the Olsentrio, for the first time.  They have a <br>
very artistic daughter and a very good carver (mom), so we are <br>
looking forward to finding any boxes they may place in the future.<br>
<br>
We also had an opportunity to chat & exchange with 16 new <br>
boxers/teams that we hadn't met before. It was a nice low key <br>
gathering, starting with lunch at 1:00 pm, followed by a group photo <br>
and lots of exchanges.  We also continued our lucky streak this year, <br>
since Martini Man was the winner of the big prize basket!!  Later in <br>
the afternoon we struck out to find some boxes, which were nicely <br>
scattered throughout the park.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, we shared a nice meal with Hartx6 (dad only) <br>
and A118 & CB.  A great way to end a great day!<br>

Coffee Beans and I had a great time at this gathering, and we had the <br>
chance to meet many boxers for the first time.  We enjoyed chatting with <br>
Scout Angel and her mom.  Although we didn't know Goose Chaser, we had <br>
found a few of her boxes on our last trip to the quad cities.   It was <br>
also great to catch up with those we've already met...in particular <br>
getting to meet the other four members of Hart x6 and get a quick smile <br>
from Emily Cottontail.<br>
<br>
We did manage to get out on the trail and find a few of the nearby <br>
boxes...(our enthusiasm for the hunt was obvious since we managed to get <br>
to several FFs)  One of Mr. Duck's boxes caused us a brief amount of <br>
trouble, and just as we were about to jump into the woods, Mrs Dr B and <br>
her sister, Urban Cowgirl, drove up.  As they scratched their heads with <br>
us, Martini Man and Wisconsin Hiker pulled up.  Well, we soon figured it <br>
out and were on our way, but its always a bit fun/hectic to run into <br>
others while out on the trail at a gathering.  Alas, the sun was <br>
starting to set and we wanted to stop by an thank our hosts before they <br>
left...so we had to leave a few boxes for our next visit....<br>
<br>
We are looking forward to the next Goose Chase since this one seemed to <br>
be a grand success. <br>
