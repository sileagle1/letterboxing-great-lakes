addition to your team.<br>
<br>
Both Martini Man & I have used trekking poles for several years, but we only<br>
use them in the mountains.  We primarily got them because of the downhills.<br>
Using poles allows our arms to take some of our weight, instead of our knees<br>
bearing the full burden as we go down steep descents.  However I have found<br>
them also very handy on steep ascents - almost like having handrails to help<br>
haul yourself up.  It's a good workout for your arms, so a hike now benefits<br>
your WHOLE body!  (You may have noticed our poles in some of our blog<br>
photos.)  Poles are also useful when doing stream crossing if you are trying<br>
to hop from rock to rock.<br>
<br>
Usually we adjust the height of the poles depending on what we are doing -<br>
shorter for the uphill and longer for downhill.  They telescope to a short<br>
enough length that we can pack them in our suitcase.  We've used our poles<br>
in the midwest very rarely, such as if we are in the Kettle Moraine in early<br>
spring when there is still snow and/or ice on the trails.  However other<br>
people in our hiking club use them more often on hillier trails in the area.<br>
<br>
I guess the only con is carrying them along if you don't really need/want to<br>
use them.  However when we are doing mountain hiking, we are always wearing<br>
our backpacks and have some straps that we use to secure the poles to the<br>
pack if we won't be using the poles for a while.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations on the new partner!  Playing off  your trailnames, you could go with something Lone Ranger themed.  Maybe "kemo sabe" or "Silverheels" (the actor that played Tonto on the TV series).  Silver and Scout were the names of the Lone Ranger's and Tonto's horses.  Or maybe "Prospector," since he's a "golden" retriever?  Have fun deciding!<br>
