WOW, A GREAT EVENT!  The boxes were plentiful, well spaced, and <br>
beautiful!  We had a great time roaming the trails on Saturday finding <br>
boxes and bumping into the occasional group of boxers.  However, since <br>
there were SO MANY boxes and a decent amount of trails, it didn't seem <br>
like there were so many people at each box.  We managed to get out again <br>
on Saturday, and again had a wonderful day (I think we saw Aimlesst and <br>
her group from a distance, in addition to bumping into the Christmas <br>
Elves, Martini Man, and Wisconsin Hiker).  Unfortunately, we had a to <br>
leave a few boxes for next time (doht!)...but we did come away with at <br>
least a few extra boxes other than the ones we were actually actively <br>
hunting (a benefit of: 1. dual 'interpretations' when reading <br>
clues....'you look over there at x steps, and I'll look at x double <br>
steps'...and 2. lots of boxes lurking!) which is always fun!<br>
We had a fun time reconnecting with boxers we already know, as well as, <br>
those we met for the first time on Saturday.<br>
<br>
Thank you to everyone for the AWESOME weekend!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a great time on Saturday as well and am definitely looking forward to future gatherings, as this was my first!  And there must have been quite a few of us on the trails again on Sunday too, judging by some of the previous replies! Freshwater and I went back out to do the Twilight Zone series before it was picked up. I'm surprised more of us didn't run into each other.<br>
<br>
It's strange looking at everybody's trailnames and seeing faces in my mind now!  Can't wait to see them again though!  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Everyone for the fine time we Iowans had over the weekend at Boxacon! Such a beautiful place, and GREAT carves! Perfect time of year, too, yielding some of the most tasty edible fungi found in this region. Last night I thoroughly enjoyed the mushrooms I harvested from the park on Saturday! It was great meeting more boxers, even exchanging and doing lost-and-found on the trail! Looking forward to seeing you again, and sorry I missed Atomic Beans and Lock etc. <br>
