The Columbus OH team of Flag Bearer and Full of Heart, along with<br>
DogBone beat the clock and survived the "80 Days" tour. As the Travel<br>
Staff was locking the office and retreating to new autumn endeavors in<br>
W. Michigan, the Ohio group slipped their documents under the office<br>
door and quietly qualified for the bonus stamp as well.<br>
<br>
Earlier claims that the series was finished and the trails were empty<br>
were again proven wrong as the intrepid Buckeyes ducked in under the<br>
wire and neatly beat their 80 Days timeframe.<br>
<br>
While the Travel Staff had already moved on to corral a group of<br>
wayward circus acts, the "Around the World in 80 Days" trails were<br>
surprisingly active.<br>
<br>
We *think* that Flag Bearer and Full of Heart, along with DogBone are<br>
the final finishers. But, we've been wrong....lots of times.<br>
<br>
Safe travels,<br>
