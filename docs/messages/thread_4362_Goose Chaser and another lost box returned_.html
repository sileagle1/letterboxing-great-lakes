                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yea!!!!  Scoutdogs, I had found your box years ago.  It is so awsome and broke my heart when I heard that it was missing. When I would stop by to check my box in that same park I always would look for it - willing it to be there - but I never could find it again.  I guess we should never give up.<br>

  We went to look for this years ago and found it encased in a solid block of ice. When we went back in the summer we couldn't find it! I was so bummed because we never did get it. I did see what it looked like in your logbook, which only made me want the stamp more!<br>
  Any thoughts of replanting it back in Columbus?<br>
