<br/>
For those who use AQ, Ryan is doing some upgrades and asked me to tweek my AQ trail name so it could be distinguished from some other "dragons" that are out there.  So being a good sport (actually, the free premium membership offer was the better incentive...:-) ) I have changed my AQ trail name to "the dragon_wi".  I initially was going to change it to "the mathdragon", but I think more people would make the connection to WI than to math for me.<br/>
<br/>
So if you are wondering why you can't find "the dragon" on AQ anymore, here's your answer.<br/>
<br/>
And, although I'm 8 stamps behind in the KML Goes to CC state series, I'm hoping to add at least one more to the "to do" list today...<br/>
