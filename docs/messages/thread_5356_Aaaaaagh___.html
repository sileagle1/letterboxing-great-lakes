Dragon, what is the proper process to replace one of these boxes, since we didn't carve the original stamp?  Should we recarve the stamp ourselves?  I'm not sure I can do nearly as good a job as Howling Coyote had done *gulp*  Let us know what we need to do to get this box back in action.<br>

unknown.  We went to check on him and Push-the-Pram-A-Lot...could not <br>
find armor nor crest of him amidst the rocks where he was to have <br>
been.  It looked like some hooligans may have been tipping rocks <br>
over, too, so my clues were not accurate anymore. Has anyone found <br>
him recently???  It is possible we were just hurried in our search <br>
because of all the annoying muggles! <br>
<br>
Pram-a-Lot was still there, although the logbook was a soaked pile of <br>
mush.  I replaced that and wrote the code in to the new book..so that <br>
one is good to go.  --Papeseed<br>
