                    <div class="plaintext-content">We headed down to Peoria today in 36 degree weather and through a few <br>
snow flakes. We found 7 boxes, including the one I shared about in <br>
our blog.<br>
<br>
Here is what I wrote on our blog (sorry for the "cross post" I figure <br>
not everyone checks our blog and may enjoy the story).<br>
<br>
Skeeter, Bug-a-Boo and I headed out for "Autumn: Scarecrow" (I mile <br>
long hike). We didn't have any difficulty finding this box, and the <br>
girls kept up with me even up the steep hill. <br>
<br>
The most exciting part of this whole hike came when nearing the box <br>
and we saw about a dozen wild turkeys. As we neared the end of the <br>
clues we realized the turkeys were just feet from the tree in which <br>
the box was hidden.<br>
<br>
The girls walked right up to the turkeys, that didn't seem to <br>
concerned about this and only meandered away. Once we grabbed the box <br>
and stamped in, the turkeys were only about 20 feet away. The girls <br>
really enjoyed walking after the birds.<br>
<br>
Once done, we tried to finish the loop, with no luck. The leaves on <br>
the trail were so thick we couldn't figure out what was a "trail" and <br>
what wasn't.<br>
<br>
Rather than getting terribly lost, I decided to head back the way we <br>
came . . . back up the steep hill we went.<br>
<br>
Now on to try "Falling Leaf" again. Last time we attempted it was <br>
about 90 degrees outside with about 90% humidity.<br>
<br>
This time it was about 40 degrees and we were sprinkled with <br>
snowflakes.<br>
<br>
We headed down another trail, this had to be the one. I was excited, <br>
as I thought we were near finding this elusive box.<br>
<br>
We went up another steep hill, double around and up again. Alex <br>
spotted 4 deer up on another hill and we all stood and watched them.<br>
<br>
The girls were absolutely the best little hikers ever -- WATCH OUT <br>
WISCONSIN HIKER!!! :-)<br>
<br>
I estimate we hiked about 3 miles, up rather steep hills in the cold <br>
air. There was no bickering or complaining. They kept up with me, and <br>
smiled and laughed a lot. This hike, though coming up empty <br>
on "Falling Leaf", exemplifies that its not always about the "find."<br>
<br>
The girls and I were away from the car for an hour and a half, and I <br>
can honestly say that I enjoyed every minute of it.<br>
<br>
As an added bonus, the last short stretch before we got to the car, a <br>
herd (is that the right term?) of turkeys was in the middle of the <br>
trail. I couldn't believe how many there were!! I started counting <br>
and lost count at 39 . . . amazing!<br>
<br>
The biggest bummer of this all, is that I left the camera in the <br>
van :-(<br>

but I don't think it counts when they're in the frozen section  =)<br>
<br>
You do know that if you would have had the camera with you that you <br>
would never have seen the deer or the turkeys. That's just the way it <br>
works. Hee hee.<br>
<br>
One question for you. What's your secret?? To the hiking with no <br>
whining, bickering or complaining I mean. I'm lucky if mine make it <br>
1/2 a mile without doing one of the above! <br>
<br>
Glad to hear the Harts had such a great day. And congrats on your 7 <br>
finds too. <br>

 <br>
You are totally right about the camera... bring it with you and see  nothing, <br>
or forget it and see some exciting things.<br>
 <br>
About the "no whining, bickering or complaining", The girls have always  been <br>
good about hiking. The only complaint that I can remember out of Skeeter  is, <br>
"Daddy, I get bored when we don't find the box." and that was a year and a  <br>
half ago.<br>
 <br>
We are coming up to our 2 year anniversary of boxing and last week in  Nauvoo <br>
we hit F400. <br>
 <br>
Turning the clocks back 2 years Bug-a-Boo was only 2 years old and Skeeter  <br>
was 4 (in fact the twins are now older than BaB was when we first started). All <br>
 this to say, they've been doing this a long time and have a lot of Finds <br>
under  their respective belts -- its just a way of life for them :-)<br>
 <br>
If it wasn't for Lbing, we never would go out hiking anywhere, we (Becki  and <br>
I) would just be stuck standing behind a swing and pushing (as that's all  <br>
any of them want to do at a park).<br>
 <br>
Yesterday was just awesome though, looking back at them, their little faces  <br>
pink from the cool air. The glisten of snot below their little noses, and the  <br>
smiles and giggles were just an incredible bonus.<br>

<br>
Yes, we did get to box (as much as my non-boxer husband would let me)<br>
while we were in Florida. I got the two in Magic Kingdom and a couple <br>
near the Disney resorts. Boxing on the way down to FL was tough since <br>
we drove through the night (haven't night boxed yet!), but we did <br>
manage to catch a few on the way back home. In fact I dropped off <br>
your "Mary's Mugs" HitchHiker in Georgia  =)  I would have left it in <br>
FL, but the boxes were way too small. <br>
<br>
We had an awesome trip! Thanks for thinking of us. <br>

You kidding me? We pass a cow pasture and I say, "mmm, dinner."<br>

The girls are well aware of the cycle of life, and I'm not raising  <br>
vegetarians :-)<br>

The more likely reaction would be, not those poor turkeys. Rather, "man,  <br>
those things are ugly . . . I'm not eating that" <br>

RE:  3) I wonder what runs through a turkeys head while they watch us??<br>
<br>
A few years back, a seemingly very puzzled deer kept creeping closer &<br>
closer to us as we sat on our backpack stools, stamping into a letterbox.<br>
We couldn't believe how close it kept coming, trying to figure out just what<br>
in the HECK those people were doing!!  It finally ambled off - guess it was<br>
one of those types that just don't "get it"!    .... a noxer deer.<br>
