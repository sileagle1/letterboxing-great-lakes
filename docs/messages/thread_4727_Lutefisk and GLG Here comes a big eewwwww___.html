                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, Kathi gets the Lutefisk. Now, for all of those who don't know what<br/>
this is...you've asked for it. It is dried fish that is reconstituted<br/>
in  lye (sounds yummy don't it?) and then soaked in a water solution<br/>
to get the lye out. (You know, this stuff burns and is used in soap!)<br/>
Anyhow, after several "baths" it's labeled "edible" (I'm still<br/>
questioning this one) and eaten by the unsuspecting and those with<br/>
lead stomachs. I'd rather eat turpentine (which is what lutefisk<br/>
tastes like anyway). <br/>
<br/>
BIG Eeewwwww!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, there is a great episode of Road Travels where Alton Brown and<br/>
company end up in Minnesota (eh!) at the headwaters of the Mississippi<br/>
and decide to try it. Needless to say, they spit it out.<br/>
<br/>
So...all you Minnesotanscan keep that lutefisk....I'll stick to the<br/>
fish sticks. (And Mrs. Doglvers...if you're reading this...which I'm<br/>
sure you are...just think bagels, cream cheese, extra crispy....AND<br/>
LUTEFISK!) Mmmmm! <br/>
