around it 5 years in a row with one of his friends before they moved to<br/>
Oregon.<br/>

&gt; &gt; And OlsenTrio, I grew up in Rhinelander. Sadly, I've never been to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lake Geneva, but I've heard it's beautiful.<br/>

&gt;I was just curious since you mentioned the Illinois tourists. I grew<br/>
&gt;up in Lake Geneva and we were inundated with them every summer.<br/>
&gt;Yes, it is very beautiful, especially the lake. Of course you never<br/>
&gt;really appreciate the beauty of where you live while you are there. It<br/>
&gt;wasn't until I became an adult that I really appreciated it. Now I love<br/>
&gt;to go back!<br/>
&gt;I've been to Rhinelander, but that was so long ago. That's where we<br/>
&gt;would take our shopping trips during hunting season.<br/>

I was just about to go find your newly placed letterbox last fall. My <br/>
daughter and I had parked right at the end of the lot, sat and ate our <br/>
lunch in front of the water, and when we were just about to get out she <br/>
said she had to go to the bathroom. Of course!! LOL  The park bathrooms <br/>
were locked up for the season already, so by the time we found one it <br/>
was time to head home. It's on my list of ones to find as soon as all <br/>

Yep...22 miles is more like it. The south side is the<br/>
rough one...especially if that's the last leg. The<br/>
slope gets rough on my downhill ankle and shin.<br/>

&gt; Our club always does it as a 1-day hike. We start<br/>
&gt; out in Williams Bay at 8<br/>
&gt; am, heading southwest. We take a short break in<br/>
&gt; Fontana, then stop near a<br/>
&gt; boat launch spot were we eat our lunches. We then<br/>
&gt; continue into the town of<br/>
&gt; Lake Geneva, where most of us buy ice cream cones as<br/>
&gt; a mid-afternoon treat.<br/>
&gt; We then continue on the last stretch along the north<br/>
&gt; shore. Most people<br/>
&gt; finish at around 4:30-5 pm. Contrary to some<br/>
&gt; publications, it really isn't<br/>
&gt; a 26-mile hike. Many years ago our club took a<br/>
&gt; measuring wheel along and it<br/>
&gt; showed only 22 miles.<br/>

&gt; P.S. I've also done the "around the lake" hike 5<br/>
&gt; times. My mom has done it<br/>
&gt; 3 times with us.<br/>
