                    <div class="plaintext-content">Scenario:  A beautiful Indian summer day, clear blue sky, no rain in<br>
forecast, temp in the 70's.  Husband Tom left 4:00 this morning for a<br>
weeklong fishing trip in Canada.  Daughter Michelle is in school and has<br>
practice afterwards until 5:00.  I bought groceries yesterday, so I have<br>
nothing pressing to do (well, there's always housecleaning, but who wants to<br>
do that?).  "Hey, Hershey, want to go bye-bye in the car?  Want to go<br>
letterboxing?"  Needless to say, she's right there.  I pack up the gear, put<br>
her in the back seat, rev up the Jeep, power down the back window for her<br>
and CRASH!  My back passenger window is shattered.<br>
<br>
Let me explain...she has this goofy habit that when the window goes down she<br>
growls and bites at the window.  We used to think it was funny until she<br>
grabbed at Tom's Explorer's window and it shattered in her mouth.  (no<br>
injury to her that time or this time, thankfully) You'd think she'd learn a<br>
lesson, right...?  So now we have broken window #2 to deal with.  The car<br>
gets unpacked, the insurance company called.  I'm stuck at home on a<br>
gorgeous day cleaning up broken glass waiting for the repair place to call<br>
that the replacement window has arrived so I can go have it installed.<br>
<br>
On the plus side of this all, at least I have an inspiration for a new<br>
letterbox!  "Bad Dog"...or how about "Dog in the Doghouse"..."Jaws (just<br>
when you thought it was safe to sit in the back seat...)"...hmmm, the<br>
possibilities are endless!<br>

  Scenario:  A beautiful Indian summer day, clear blue sky, no rain in<br>
  forecast, temp in the 70's.  Husband Tom left 4:00 this morning for a<br>
  weeklong fishing trip in Canada.  Daughter Michelle is in school and has<br>
  practice afterwards until 5:00.  I bought groceries yesterday, so I have<br>
  nothing pressing to do (well, there's always housecleaning, but who wants to<br>
  do that?).  "Hey, Hershey, want to go bye-bye in the car?  Want to go<br>
  letterboxing?"  Needless to say, she's right there.  I pack up the gear, put<br>
  her in the back seat, rev up the Jeep, power down the back window for her<br>
  and CRASH!  My back passenger window is shattered.<br>
<br>
  Let me explain...she has this goofy habit that when the window goes down she<br>
  growls and bites at the window.  We used to think it was funny until she<br>
  grabbed at Tom's Explorer's window and it shattered in her mouth.  (no<br>
  injury to her that time or this time, thankfully) You'd think she'd learn a<br>
  lesson, right...?  So now we have broken window #2 to deal with.  The car<br>
  gets unpacked, the insurance company called.  I'm stuck at home on a<br>
  gorgeous day cleaning up broken glass waiting for the repair place to call<br>
