practice afterwards until 5:00.  I bought groceries yesterday, so I have<br/>
nothing pressing to do (well, there's always housecleaning, but who wants to<br/>
do that?).  "Hey, Hershey, want to go bye-bye in the car?  Want to go<br/>
letterboxing?"  Needless to say, she's right there.  I pack up the gear, put<br/>
her in the back seat, rev up the Jeep, power down the back window for her<br/>
and CRASH!  My back passenger window is shattered.<br/>
<br/>
Let me explain...she has this goofy habit that when the window goes down she<br/>
growls and bites at the window.  We used to think it was funny until she<br/>
grabbed at Tom's Explorer's window and it shattered in her mouth.  (no<br/>
injury to her that time or this time, thankfully) You'd think she'd learn a<br/>
lesson, right...?  So now we have broken window #2 to deal with.  The car<br/>
gets unpacked, the insurance company called.  I'm stuck at home on a<br/>
gorgeous day cleaning up broken glass waiting for the repair place to call<br/>
that the replacement window has arrived so I can go have it installed.<br/>

On the plus side of this all, at least I have an inspiration for a new<br/>

  That bitter apple stuff is good too.  Spray it on the window, and the smell/taste is a deterant (deterrent?  deterent?  too lazy to check...)  Wish I had known about it BEFORE my Harvey boy chewed a big area on our dining room table.  <br/>

  Subject: [LbGLK] Anyone want a dog...cheap???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Scenario:  A beautiful Indian summer day, clear blue sky, no rain in<br/>
  forecast, temp in the 70's.  Husband Tom left 4:00 this morning for a<br/>
  weeklong fishing trip in Canada.  Daughter Michelle is in school and has<br/>
  practice afterwards until 5:00.  I bought groceries yesterday, so I have<br/>
  nothing pressing to do (well, there's always housecleaning, but who wants to<br/>
  do that?).  "Hey, Hershey, want to go bye-bye in the car?  Want to go<br/>
  letterboxing?"  Needless to say, she's right there.  I pack up the gear, put<br/>
  her in the back seat, rev up the Jeep, power down the back window for her<br/>
  and CRASH!  My back passenger window is shattered.<br/>
<br/>
  Let me explain...she has this goofy habit that when the window goes down she<br/>
  growls and bites at the window.  We used to think it was funny until she<br/>
  grabbed at Tom's Explorer's window and it shattered in her mouth.  (no<br/>
  injury to her that time or this time, thankfully) You'd think she'd learn a<br/>
  lesson, right...?  So now we have broken window #2 to deal with.  The car<br/>
  gets unpacked, the insurance company called.  I'm stuck at home on a<br/>
  gorgeous day cleaning up broken glass waiting for the repair place to call<br/>
  that the replacement window has arrived so I can go have it installed.<br/>
<br/>
  On the plus side of this all, at least I have an inspiration for a new<br/>
  letterbox!  "Bad Dog"...or how about "Dog in the Doghouse"..."Jaws (just<br/>
  when you thought it was safe to sit in the back seat...)"...hmmm, the<br/>
  possibilities are endless!<br/>

  That bitter apple stuff is good too.  Spray it on the window, and the smell/taste is a deterant (deterrent?  deterent?  too lazy to check...)  Wish I had known about it BEFORE my Harvey boy chewed a big area on our dining room table.  <br/>
