I'm caught searching, then I say that the dog pooped somewhere around<br/>
here and I'm trying to find it to clean it up.  No one ever offers to<br/>
help or lingers over that one.  Both dogs have backpacks and carry their<br/>
own gear (water, snacks, first aid, etc) and for most people, the sight<br/>
of a dog in a backpack is distracting enough that they hardly see me at<br/>
all.  I've only once had some one look beyond the dogs to wonder what I'm <br/>
doing, which caught me off guard but my current excuse is that I'm<br/>
keeping a log of the dogs' miles for their backpacking titles (not<br/>
untrue, but I don't take the log with me).  <br/>
<br/>
I've been caught scouting for places to hide a box, sans dogs, and<br/>
generally tell people I'm an entomologist, which I've found is a good way <br/>
to end conversations, since either they don't know the word or they find<br/>
bugs icky.<br/>

&gt; I remember when I was out doing a letterbox (Chief Pontiac), and I had <br/>
&gt; three people ask me what I was doing. I looked really good before I <br/>
&gt; went over to the box but these people just came out of no where (this <br/>
&gt; was last year, so it wasn't me that didn't contact you Trail Troll:P). <br/>
&gt; I told them that I was a field Biologist and I was collecting samples <br/>
&gt; for school... not too big of a lie I AM a Biologist. So what do you <br/>
