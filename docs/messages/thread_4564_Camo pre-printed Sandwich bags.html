Those are cute.  There's an awful lot of clear plastic showing though.<br/>
<br/>
I just made a whole bunch of camo pouches for the Creepy Crawl <br/>
event.  They worked pretty good, although, you really need to make <br/>
sure they seal properly to close them.  I didn't use extra baggies <br/>
inside, but I should have.  Even in the 4 days they were outside, <br/>
they got a little damp because they weren't sealed all the way.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't possibly begin to tell you how to find it now, because it <br/>
took me forever, but there's a tutorial on AQ somewhere on how to <br/>
make them.  I didn't do anything as in depth as the tutorial showed, <br/>
though.  Get a hard plastic work surface, like a cutting board.  Lay <br/>
the baggies on it and cut strips of tape about 2-3 inches longer than <br/>
the width of the baggie.  Starting from the top, lay the strips <br/>
across the baggie onto the cutting board... line the first piece of <br/>
tape up with the top lip of the baggie, then overlap each successive <br/>
piece about 1/4-1/2" until you get to the bottom.  All your tape <br/>
strips should overhang the sides about 1-1 1/2 inches and the bottom <br/>
piece should overlap the edge of the baggie about an inch.  Carefully <br/>
peel this off the cutting board and cut out the corners of the excess <br/>
tape to create flaps, be careful not to cut into the baggie when <br/>
you're doing this.  Flip each flap up to the opposite side of the <br/>
baggie.  Flip the baggie over and do the same thing to the other <br/>
side.   You could be done now.  Once I finished this part, though, I <br/>
added some tabs to the opening of the baggie to make it easier to <br/>
see/open.  I also added some velcro to keep the baggies in a tighter <br/>
package when close.  I don't like how that worked very well, so I'll <br/>
let you figure out your own way to close them up.  One I saw "in the <br/>
wild" was just tied up with a piece of twine and tied to a bush branch.<br/>

and it didn't work out very well.  Even with the camo tape covering <br/>
it, the bags don't hold up very well.  They get torn, or people don't <br/>
close them tightly.  I am in the process of replacing the few bags I <br/>
have out there with conventional containers.  This is a good method <br/>
for short-term placements, like a specific event, but I don't think <br/>
they'll stand up long-term.<br/>
