Theme.<br>
<br>
I made some adjustments to the Database for our event.  Here is what I am soliciting at <br>
the moment ...<br>
<br>
About 15-20 GREEN boxes to be placed several days in advance along the trails at <br>
Pokagon.  These creations should be monochromatic - GREEN will be the inkpad of choice.  <br>
If you are concerned that 20 boxes are not that many boxes, keep in mind the 11.0 miles <br>
of trails at Pokagon are rated easy to moderate.  Mostly Moderate, so it might take a little <br>
longer to find boxes.  They will be available Saturday and Sunday, unless the creator <br>
makes them event-day only.<br>
<br>
If you create a Green Box, please list it in the database, giving it a Title.<br>
<br>
Not everyone will be able to hit the trails.  There will be some event boxes at the shelter.  <br>
For these boxes, I submit these themes for a travelling series:<br>
<br>
1. Our Favorite Great Lakes State Parks (1 or 2 from each state would be nice)<br>
2. The Conservation Movement<br>
3. The 1920's and 1930's in America<br>
<br>
Boxes requiring some sleuthing at the shelter are welcome.  If you can create the clues, <br>
great!  If you want some help, we will need to know well in advance.<br>
<br>
Box Requirements ---<br>
<br>
It would be nice to get a standard box size.  I used a rectangular LnL for the Box of the <br>
Month project last year and I liked that size.  But, due to the temporary nature of these <br>
boxes, I wonder if letterpouches wouldn't be a better option?  Definitely less expensive to <br>
mail and return.  And logbooks?  If we have a standard stamp size, I could make uniform <br>
logbooks, including the official event stamp to return with the logbook as a thank-you to <br>
the stamp carvers.  Let us know your thoughts on this.<br>
<br>
If you are creating a letterbox for the event, I will need to have them in my hot little hands <br>
by March 15th.<br>
<br>
Other activities planned ...<br>
<br>
Keep Our Parks Beautiful -- There will be a prize or prizes for the letterboxer who picks <br>
up the most litter along the way.  Start saving a couple of plastic grocery bags to bring <br>
along.<br>
<br>
I am looking into t-shirts and canvas bags imprinted with the event stamp.<br>
<br>
THE OFFICIAL EVENT STAMP -- I want to delegate this to the artistic letterboxers among <br>
us.  I envision a green t-shirt with the logo printing on the front.  If you'd like to help, <br>
contact me off-list.<br>
<br>
Finally - please do not list any event boxes and/or clues on the Atlas Quest page at this <br>
time.  The planted event boxes will listed after the event is concluded.<br>
<br>
I'm sure I will need to clarify something tomorrow.  But this should get you thinking.<br>
