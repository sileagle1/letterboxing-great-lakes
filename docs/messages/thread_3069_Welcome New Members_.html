wanted to take a minute to welcome all of the new members to the <br/>
group. We hope that you will feel at home here.<br/>
<br/>
Given all of the new members, we thought it would be beneficial in <br/>
lieu of a TOTW (Topic of the Week) for people to give a brief <br/>
introduction -- we'd like to get to know you!  If you've been around <br/>
here for a few months or even a few years, don't feel left out -- <br/>
even if we already know you, the newer folks don't, so feel free to <br/>
participate in the intros.<br/>
<br/>
If you could, please use a subject line "Member Into: <br/>
[name/trailname]" as this will make it easier to find these posts in <br/>
the pile of group messages once we are a few months down the road.<br/>
<br/>
We also want to make sure that all of the newer letterboxers are <br/>
aware of the Newboxers Yahoo! group. If you have not already joined <br/>
this group, you may find it beneficial. Of course your questions are <br/>
always welcome here and don't feel anything it too basic or stupid <br/>
to ask, but the newboxers list tends to have some very informative <br/>
threads of particular interest to new letterboxers. You will find <br/>
the group here:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome to letterboxing and to the GL group! We're glad <br/>
you're here and look forward to meeting up with you on the trail <br/>
someday.<br/>
