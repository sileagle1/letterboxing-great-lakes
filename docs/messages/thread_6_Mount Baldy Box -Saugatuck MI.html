                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Carol!  Oh gosh, those stairs are about enough to kill you, <br/>
aren't they?  And they are getting pretty rickety -- I wouldn't be <br/>
surprised if the city of Saugatuck closed them soon, unless they are <br/>
going to repair them.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear you didn't find the box.  I went twice for that one.  <br/>
The first time, I climbed those freaking stairs twice, not willing <br/>
to give up...  I also went down (and subsequently back up) that huge <br/>
hill off to the left (south) of the top, thinking perhaps it was <br/>
that way -- after all, I think the clues said "southerly direction."<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the second time I found the box, but I am pretty sure that <br/>
the originally referred to "centipede" is no longer in place so it <br/>
makes it harder to find.  As a matter of fact, I accidentally <br/>
stumbled on the box hidden under a little pile of sticks and leaves <br/>
as I was scouring the area around the dancing trees.<br/>
<br/>
I actually went back a third time, last April, with OldShoe because <br/>
he had not stamped into the book and we were staying at a B&amp;B right <br/>
near there one weekend.  So I can verify that it was there as of <br/>
early April 2003.  We replaced the box under a centipede that was a <br/>
short way down the hillside from the dancing trees, as it was the <br/>
nearest thing we could find to a centipede and that is what the <br/>
clues indicated.<br/>
<br/>
Good to hear from you again!<br/>
<br/>
Deb<br/>
