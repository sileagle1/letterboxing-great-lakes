Petroglyph by Wisconsin Hiker. It was the creepiest forest we have <br/>
ever been in. We even video taped the find it was so surreal. And we <br/>
went to the southern most point in the u.s.a to see the girlguides <br/>
volcanoes national park. We walk to see hot lava over the lava field <br/>
and went in the lava caves. I will treasure that vacation forever!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward: I would love to go to the U.P. and camp around for a <br/>
week up there going to different LB. I would like to place a LB on <br/>
Isle Royal. I am also looking forward to the gathering I am hosting <br/>
(hoping it is not a crazy mess).<br/>

P.S. what is postal letterboxing?<br/>

<br/>
We also loved Hawaii, did some great hiking and kayaking while we were there<br/>
in 2003!  But just to clarify, we only adopted the Puako Petroglyph box.<br/>
Shortly after we found it, we discovered it had ended up in the Letterboxing<br/>
Basement because the original placers couldn't be reached.  We adopted it so<br/>
it could still be in the active area of the LBNA site.  It is amazing to see<br/>
how long some boxes can last!<br/>
