**************************************************************** God Bless America.....<br/>
<br/>
Sack Lunches...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Life isn't about how you survived the storm....it's about how you danced in<br/>
the rain!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I put my carry-on in the<br/>
<br/>
luggage compartment and sat down in my assigned<br/>
<br/>
seat. It was going to be a long flight. 'I'm<br/>
<br/>
glad I have a good book to read. Perhaps I will<br/>
<br/>
get a short nap,' I thought.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just before take-off,<br/>
<br/>
a line of soldiers came down the aisle and<br/>
<br/>
filled all the vacant seats, totally surrounding<br/>
<br/>
me. I decided to start a conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'Where are you headed?' I asked the soldier seated nearest to<br/>
<br/>
me. 'Petawawa. We'll be there for two<br/>
<br/>
weeks for special training, and then we're being<br/>
<br/>
deployed to Afghanistan<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After flying for about an hour, an announcement was<br/>
<br/>
made that sack lunches were available for five<br/>
<br/>
dollars... It would be several hours before we<br/>
<br/>
reached the east, and I quickly decided a lunch<br/>
<br/>
would help pass the time...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As I reached for my wallet, I overheard a soldier ask his buddy if<br/>
<br/>
he planned to buy lunch. 'No, that seems<br/>
<br/>
like a lot of money for just a sack lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Probably wouldn't be worth five bucks.<br/>
<br/>
I'll wait till we get to base.'<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
His friend agreed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I looked around at the<br/>
<br/>
other soldiers. None were buying lunch. I walked<br/>
<br/>
to the back of the plane and handed the flight<br/>
<br/>
attendant a fifty dollar bill. 'Take a<br/>
<br/>
lunch to all those soldiers.' She grabbed my<br/>
<br/>
arms and squeezed tightly. Her eyes wet with<br/>
<br/>
tears, she thanked me. 'My son was a soldier in<br/>
<br/>
Iraq ; it's almost like you are doing it for<br/>
<br/>
him.'<br/>
<br/>
Picking up ten sacks, she headed up the aisle to where the<br/>
<br/>
soldiers were seated. She stopped at my seat and<br/>
<br/>
asked, 'Which do you like best - beef or<br/>
<br/>
chicken?' 'Chicken,' I replied,<br/>
<br/>
wondering why she asked. She turned and went to<br/>
<br/>
the front of plane, returning a minute later<br/>
<br/>
with a dinner plate from first class.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'This is your thanks.'<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After we finished<br/>
<br/>
eating, I went again to the back of the plane,<br/>
<br/>
heading for the rest room.<br/>
<br/>
A man stopped me. 'I saw what you did. I want to<br/>
<br/>
be part of it... Here, take this.' He handed me<br/>
<br/>
twenty-five dollars.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Soon after I returned<br/>
<br/>
to my seat, I saw the Flight Captain coming down<br/>
<br/>
the aisle, looking at the aisle numbers as he<br/>
<br/>
walked, I hoped he was not looking for me, but<br/>
<br/>
noticed he was looking at the numbers only on my<br/>
<br/>
side of the plane. When he got to my row he<br/>
<br/>
stopped, smiled, held out his hand and said, 'I<br/>
<br/>
want to shake your hand.' Quickly unfastening my<br/>
<br/>
seatbelt I stood and took the Captain's hand.<br/>
<br/>
With a booming voice he said, 'I was a soldier<br/>
<br/>
and I was a military pilot. Once, someone bought<br/>
<br/>
me a lunch. It was an act of kindness I never<br/>
<br/>
forgot.' I was embarrassed when applause was<br/>
<br/>
heard from all of the passengers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Later I walked to the<br/>
<br/>
front of the plane so I could stretch my legs. A<br/>
<br/>
man who was seated about six rows in front of me<br/>
<br/>
reached out his hand, wanting to shake mine. He<br/>
<br/>
left another twenty-five dollars in my palm.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we landed I<br/>
<br/>
gathered my belongings and started to deplane...<br/>
<br/>
Waiting just inside the airplane door was a man<br/>
<br/>
who stopped me, put something in my shirt<br/>
<br/>
pocket, turned, and walked away without saying a<br/>
<br/>
word. Another twenty-five dollars!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Upon entering the<br/>
<br/>
terminal, I saw the soldiers gathering for their<br/>
<br/>
trip to the base.<br/>
I walked over to<br/>
<br/>
them and handed them seventy-five dollars. 'It<br/>
<br/>
will take you some time to reach the base.<br/>
<br/>
It will be about time for a sandwich.<br/>
God Bless You.'<br/>
<br/>
Ten young<br/>
<br/>
men left that flight feeling the love and<br/>
<br/>
respect of their fellow travelers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As I walked briskly to<br/>
<br/>
my car, I whispered a prayer for their safe<br/>
<br/>
return. These soldiers were giving their all for<br/>
<br/>
our country. I could only give them a couple of<br/>
<br/>
meals. It seemed so little...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A veteran is someone<br/>
<br/>
who, at one point in his life, wrote a blank<br/>
<br/>
check made payable to 'The United States of<br/>
<br/>
America ' for an amount of 'up to and<br/>
<br/>
including my life.'<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is Honor, and<br/>
<br/>
there are way too many people in this country<br/>
<br/>
who no longer understand it.'<br/>
