Just letting you know we've had to pull the clues for our "Mellow <br/>
Yellow" box after a mere three days!  It's gone already.  I could be <br/>
bummed, but instead I've decided to wave my failure flag for all to <br/>
see and issue this challenge: can anybody top three days?  <br/>

have had far too many boxes disappear lately...another<br/>
one of ours in AZ may be missing now:(  After spending<br/>
all this time scouting for a good hidden area that is<br/>
well protected and then they are gone!...Oh<br/>
well...just increases the challenge...Personally, I<br/>
don't think we can beat three days!  That's sad,<br/>
Melinda and Kate.  Hopefully, we can all start getting<br/>
our boxes to stick where they are supposed to.<br/>

Basically, I have a sneaky mind.  We have a disclaimer in  our "4 ft under" <br/>
box, but I'm about ready to add that this is a governmental  study and that <br/>
there are hidden cameras aimed at the boxes! <br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry about all the missing boxes,<br/>
