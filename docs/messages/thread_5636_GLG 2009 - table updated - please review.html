                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally took the time this morning to gather much information from here and AQ to see <br>
where we stand regarding event letterboxes.  Please accept my apologies if I overlooked a <br>
post, or did not respond.  I think I've found all of them now.<br>
<br>
Several letterboxers offered to carve stamps that are still needed.  Thank you, thank you.<br>
<br>
It looks like we have enough green trail stamps/letterboxes.  You can start mailing them <br>
to me if they are ready.  I think I sent my mailing address to everyone who needs it.<br>
<br>
Here's where we need additional help/coverage:<br>
<br>
Shelter boxes.  I added listings in the table where I will fill in your name after you confirm <br>
your submission.  I envisioned a series of Favorite State Parks - 2 per state.  The series <br>
could, but certainly does not have to, remain a group series available for future <br>
gatherings.  I have a couple of donations pending.  If you want to help out here, let me <br>
know which state park you'd like to represent.  If the series remains intact, I'll have a <br>
logbook made after receiving them.  If you want to keep your stamp, we will just have <br>
individual logbooks at the shelter.<br>
<br>
I haven't really had any takers on the other shelter series ideas.  The conservation <br>
movement and the 1920-30's.  I updated the table and you will see "Our resourceful <br>
ancestors."  I thought this would make a nice series - ideas generated an put into action in <br>
the 1930's.  My folks were Depression children and I learned much from my grandparents.    <br>
My grandmother never tossed a food container -- might be useful!  What a letterboxer <br>
she could have been.<br>
<br>
The other idea I had was to have some of the shelter boxes remain PT's - as long as they <br>
fall into one of the major themes of the day.  That way, those of you who want to create <br>
puzzle boxes in advance, will be able to post clues ahead of time.  Please add your <br>
thoughts here.<br>
<br>
There will be a few LTC's with a Green theme at the event.  I'm not heavily into the major <br>
group swaps by mail, but I will have one for every attendee as you sign in.  I think it was <br>
Dartmoor Dreamer that has a Tracker at AQ - you will have a deadline for that LTC swap.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks again!<br>

Come on, join us!  It's listed on AQ.<br>

I'm off to a weekend of drumline competition to a Minnesota location <br>
without any letterboxes (bummer).<br>

2.  The shelter boxes will be on the tables.  Some folks will carve special PT's for the event  <br>
using one or more of the themes.  Some of us like puzzle boxes, and due to the <br>
organization involved it is easier to create a personal traveller/shelter box for this <br>
purpose.  Creators can make the clues easy to mind-bending.  Some might involve <br>
research prior to the event day and to get the clues listed, PT's are a simple way to <br>
disseminate these clues.  Other shelter boxes (series) will have not have extra work to <br>
solve.  They are just there for the stamping.<br>
<br>
I'm planning on having a event specific LTC, my very favorite PT, and my signature stamp <br>
with me at the event.  I haven't signed up for a specific event box at this point as I am <br>
waiting for others to fill in their requests.<br>
<br>
If you have any other specific questions or want ideas, let me know.<br>
