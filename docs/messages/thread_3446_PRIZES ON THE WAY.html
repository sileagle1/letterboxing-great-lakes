Ahhhh, that makes sense!    The only thing I could come up with was <br/>
Discover Card, but I didn't figure I'd have any reason to care how <br/>
she paid for the postage, so I knew it couldn't be that! LOL<br/>

But no matter, the goal was accomplished -- both states are now completely covered.  A huge thanks to all who put in the effort to create and plant boxes to make that happen.<br/>
