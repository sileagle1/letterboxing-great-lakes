 Sad to say, I went out on a routine maintenance tour of the trail, <br>

place...  Sheesh.. Little further investigation showed me that it was <br>
some local kids due to conditions of other items along the trail.<br>
  Luckily I found the box and contents thrown to the bottom of the <br>
hill, all in good shape, but strewn about. Which leads me to believe <br>
this was a very recent incident.<br>
 The last folks into the logbook were on Sept. 1st.<br>
 I plan on replacing the box in the very near future to a location <br>
closeby the original location, and will post updated clues, etc. when <br>
that is accomplished.<br>
