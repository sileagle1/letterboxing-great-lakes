Dear Placer,<br>
We were talking to a friend about a sport similar to Letterboxing, <br>
called geocaching, when he mentioned that he found a plastic <br>
container in the woods at a rest stop and had no idea what it was.  <br>
Thinking it may have been a geocache, we asked him to show it to us <br>
and made it to this site.  So, we have your letterbox, i'm sure you <br>
would like it back - if you can give a mailing address we can send it <br>
to you!  Sorry for the confusion!<br>
<br>
<br>
To beet all, I live an hour away from the location of this box! I <br>
wont get it out there again for quite sometime. <br>
<br>
Well, at least they took the time to contact me!<br>
<br>
Oh, say a little prayer for me that when I get around to responding <br>
to these folks that I am tactful.<br>

   <br>
I would like to thank you for taking the time in going to Letterboxing.org  <br>
and tracking me down. I really appreciate that.<br>
 <br>
Sometimes the box, rather than the searcher, has the adventure. Its the  <br>
adventures that make this hobby so wonderful.<br>
 <br>
After reading and re-reading your Email, it sounds as if your friend didn't  <br>
know about either letterboxing or geocaching and just stumbled across the box <br>
in  the woods. That makes this even more remarkable that you should strike up <br>
a  conversation about caching with him.<br>
 <br>
I'm hoping that you know not to remove any "tupperware" box from the woods  <br>
as others will come looking for it . . . this is knowledge that I'm sure you  <br>
passed onto your friend.<br>
 <br>
Then I went on and gave her the address to mail the box  to.<br>

You're not a bad mother.  And I admire your courage to admit, the 'shame', that your two sons are 'geocachers.' LOL!  <br>
<br>
But from one mom to another...sometimes explaining and talking doesn't work.  What is needed is tough love.  Take their GPS units away.  It might be difficult at first because they might experience withdrawal from their technical addiction.  But there's still hope for them.   Ha! Ha!<br>

  I must confess of what a bad mother I must be. Two of my boys are, "gulp" geocachers. Oh the shame!!!<br>
  But, I have taken much time and effort to explain to them about letterboxing. Sure hope they are not put in that position some day, if so, they will know what to do. Leave it alone!!<br>
