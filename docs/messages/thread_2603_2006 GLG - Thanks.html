Man for putting together such a great event.  This was our first <br/>
large gathering and we enjoyed it so much!  We can't wait for the <br/>
next one! <br/>
<br/>
Between Saturday and Sunday, we managed to add over 90 images to our <br/>
logbook (which includes 42 exchanges, 35 letterboxes, 7 personal <br/>
travellers and 10 "other").  But more importantly, we really enjoyed <br/>
meeting everyone and putting some faces with the names we see out on <br/>
the trails and on the message boards.  Although as I now look <br/>
through the list of attendees, there are still so many of you that <br/>
we just didn't get the opportunity to meet.  Guess we'll have to <br/>
find ya next year :)<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to add a special thanks to everyone we partnered with along <br/>
the way.  Usually it is just the two of us out there boxing and it <br/>
was a lot of fun experiencing the "large group" dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone for the wonderful stamps, food, <br/>
conversation, and everything.  We truly enjoyed ourselves!!<br/>
