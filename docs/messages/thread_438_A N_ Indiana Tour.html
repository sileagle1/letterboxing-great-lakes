                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all! Today I went on my first letterboxing quest<br/>
around N. Indiana, my home. I visited 8 boxes total<br/>
and visited places I never even knew exsisted! I found<br/>
all that I was looking for. I am happy to report that<br/>
all boxes were in great shape, with the exception of<br/>
the Potato Creek box, which had a little water in it.<br/>
I emptied it out and attempted to dry it off as well<br/>
as I could. <br/>
I went to:<br/>
Neil's Letterbox (Warsaw)<br/>
Century of Progress (Elkhart Co.)<br/>
3 in St Patrick's Co. Park (South Bend)<br/>
Hunt for Limpids (New Carlisle)<br/>
Potato Creek (N. Liberty)<br/>
Grandpa's Gear (Bremen)<br/>
<br/>
If ever going to Hunt for Limpids, WEAR TONS OF BUG<br/>
SCREEN!!!!! It is indeed Mosquito Hell. <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I will be planting my first box. It will be<br/>
placed in Marshall County, south of Plymouth, IN. I'll<br/>
post the details once I get it planted. I did some<br/>
preliminary scouting today, found my location for the<br/>
box...now just a trip to Wally World for the baggies<br/>
and a stamp mount!<br/>
<br/>
Until tomorrow, <br/>
Armadillo JMO<br/>
