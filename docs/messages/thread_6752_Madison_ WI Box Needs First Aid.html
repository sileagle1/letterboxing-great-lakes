<br>
The Madison area has many fine boxes - local history, lots of beautiful natural areas, library boxes, clever clues and an early Wisconsin Hiker carving.  <br>
<br>
Thank you to all of you plant letterboxes - you take me to gems of places I didn't know were there, teach me things, make me think outside the box, and leave me the gifts of a (usually!) pleasant memory and unique piece of art!<br>
<br>
Now, I'm off to heal my scratches and pick off some burrs from my shoes before the Horsin' Around Gathering.  The last gathering I went to had torrential rain and a nearby tornado - what adventures await us in Cherry Valley?  <br>

So it's just a stamp floating in the woods?  Sad.  I had seen the "missing<br>

I always like an excuse to try and grab a box after school ... I'll let the<br>
list know if I get out there.<br>
