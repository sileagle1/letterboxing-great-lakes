sounding boxes in Wisconsin:<br/>
<br/>
Sleuthing Outagamie County Letterboxes<br/>
Appleton, Wisconsin<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<dear webmaster:<br="">
I write with an update on the letter boxes placed by the Outagamie <br/>
County Historical Society identified as "Sleuthing Outagamie County" <br/>
LbNA #9095 on your website. Unfortunately our organization can no <br/>
longer commit to maintenence of the letter boxes. Vandalisim and <br/>
unintentional destruction took its toll. We left the boxes in the field <br/>
so people may continue to use their passport. However we no longer sell <br/>
the passports and will not replace missing boxes.<br/>
Thank you for this great resource.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone interested in caring for and feeding these little treasures? <br/>
If so, please write us at webmasters-lbna at yahoogroups dot com.<br/>

historical society and asked if they would be willing to enter into <br/>
an "agreement".  We would do the maintenance and clues and they <br/>
would provide stamps and some "consideration" for the successful <br/>
completion of the series. <br/>
  More later... hopefully.<br/>
