I've been celebrating Christmas with the Kranks since 1980 when I met Tom<br/>
and his family, and now I'm one of the Kranks myself!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in honor of the impending release of this new movie, I have created<br/>
a new postal box I'd like to share with you, my LbGLK friends, this holiday<br/>
season.  And I hope that even if you are not a PLB kind of person, you'll<br/>
make an exception and share the holidays with me!<br/>
<br/>
I'd like this box to travel to as many of you as it can by Christmas.  To<br/>
facilitate that, I'm hoping we can send it out by state, perhaps starting in<br/>
Michigan, letting it tour the area a while, passing it across to Wisconsin<br/>
for the mini-meet, and then take it from there.  I'd like it to be home for<br/>
Christmas (and to keep it from getting lost in the holiday mailing rush),<br/>
and then it can go out again to hit more of you.<br/>
<br/>
SpringChick, do you mind if I send it to you first, not only because I have<br/>
your address, but also because I want to send you that HH I talked to you<br/>
about?<br/>
<br/>
If there are clusters of you who can get together to stamp in, that would be<br/>
great.<br/>
<br/>
Please send me your address off-list if you'd like to participate.  I'll<br/>
send it out ASAP, pending SpringChick's response, with as many Michigan<br/>
addresses as I have to that point.  When the last person on that list<br/>
receives it, email me for more addresses.<br/>
<br/>
Priority mail with as fast a turnaround time as possible would be<br/>
appreciated, as would delivery confirmation and email notification of its<br/>
whereabouts.  I know I should have started this sooner, but I just got the<br/>
idea a few days ago, and just finished the stamp and book.<br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays...and God bless us, everyone!!<br/>

The box will be headed to me in Milwaukee as of<br/>
Nov. 8 so that I can bring it to the gathering on the<br/>
14th. If you are in the Milwaukee area and won't be<br/>
able to attend the gathering but would still like to <br/>
stamp into the box, e-mail me off-list and let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
