Hi,<br>
<br>
I'm one of the Waltzing Pigs (named after our guinea pig)and just <br>
joined this letterboxing group a few weeks ago.  Everyone in our <br>
family has their own trail name, but we wanted just one name to use <br>
when we placed boxes (we've only placed one so far, but hope for <br>
more).  I just checked letterboxing.org and our clues were there--<br>
maybe it was just a momentary glitch.  I hope you meant our clues <br>
had disappeared and not our box!!!  Since it's our first box, we <br>
feel a little protective of our baby :-)   <br>
