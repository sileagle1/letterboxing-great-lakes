Once a month, year round, there's a planned hike of a 5 mile or less section of the canal. Here's the link to the schedule:  http://www.friends-hennepin-canal.org/activites/hikes/  On May 15, it's from Lock 21 to Bridge 15.  It looks like 5 - 15 people usually participate in this activity.<br/>

I see that the group feels we should be warned about this instead of welcoming it with open arms LOL <br/>
<br/>
Interesting, though. Typical of me, I'd never even heard of this canal, but apparently it's a big draw to the area. <br/>

&gt; Did you slip and fall or something? I hear that some places there are "exciting". Or were you just making a joke about going there a bunch looking? <br/>
&gt; Sadly, I feel that I live too far away to go there, but I like listening to people talk about it. <br/>

&gt; OH, NOW WE GET IT! So, that's what we've been doing when we've gone out on the canal...getting familiar! You better believe it! In some instances ...WAY too familiar with some sections! <br/>
