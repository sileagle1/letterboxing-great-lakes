here in the Great Lakes area, there are other, more productive things<br>
to be doing with that time also -- namely carving letterbox stamps!<br>
<br>
Once the holidays have passed and the cold has set in, it's a great<br>
time to pull out all those ideas and images and get some stamps carved<br>
for boxes to plant once the weather warms up in the spring.<br>
<br>
This past week I spent a few days doing some major clean-up on my<br>
computer, including consolidating and organizing the thousands of BW<br>
images I've saved in various places on 3 different computers over the<br>
past few years -- after deleting duplicates and discarding some of<br>
poor quality there are 3796 images left!  Talk about an overdose of<br>
inspiration!  If you need ideas or inspiration, just hunt up some of<br>
the image directories online...  and happy carving!<br>
