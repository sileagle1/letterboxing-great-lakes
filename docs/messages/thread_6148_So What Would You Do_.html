I know the box you mention, we did find it, but it was a while ago..<br/>

Might be a silly question knowing us LB folks, but here goes: You just<br/>
pulled into a park about an hour away from home (you're in the area for<br/>
another errand) when you realize you left your LB stuff at home, BUT you do<br/>
have the translated clues that you worked hard on. Quick check of the clues<br/>
- don't need a compass for this one. So what would you do? <br/>
<br/>
I made sure I had a pen, said a little LB prayer that there'd be enough ink<br/>
on the stamp to get a "huffed" image from it, and went searching. Turns out<br/>
in my case that box was not there - gee, maybe, that and the Latin language<br/>
clue are why the box hasn't been found in four years. I'll report the<br/>
details of my attempt to the placer, mark the box "ignore", and consider<br/>
another try if I ever find all the Dane County boxes (HAH!). <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One time I was heading out to a town about an hour and a half away for  <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't have any boxing gear at all, all I could do was print the clues  <br/>
and grab a sharpie on the way out the door. No sig stamp, no logbook, no  ink.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to stamp the image on the clue sheet and then later put it in  <br/>
my logbook. <br/>
<br/>
I found the box, colored the stamp, huffed and then NOTHING... the sharpie  <br/>
was dead!!<br/>
<br/>
So, well, as the title of the Email says, "What would you do?"<br/>
<br/>
The logbook in the box was index cards cut in half, hole punched in the  <br/>
corner and bound with a metal ring. <br/>
<br/>
I opened the metal ring and took the page out that had the image of the  <br/>
stamp on it. I figure the only thing missing for future finders would be the  <br/>
page in the log with the image of the stamp on it. I was, after all, the <br/>
first  finder.<br/>
<br/>
I had the opportunity to apologize to Pugnasties in person at Boxacon  :-)<br/>
