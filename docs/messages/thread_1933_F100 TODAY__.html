Sorry if you get this twice with the cross post, but I'm super excited!<br/>
I stopped after work today and stamped in to Forest Grove Lane by CMOON<br/>
and reached F100!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I was looking back through my logbook and saw that my first stamp back in<br/>
April this year was 67 Squirrels, also by CMOON.<br/>
A big thanks to CMOON for all her wonderful boxes in my area to help me<br/>
reach this milestone  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I tallied up my Postal boxes as well, and was surprised to find I am<br/>
already up to FP81 on those.  Wow, how fast it goes!  And such fun!<br/>
<br/>
I will be thinking about a Personal Traveler now that I can bring with to<br/>
events.  Watch for a posting with clues on that later.<br/>
I've got to get to hiding those Holy Grail boxes now  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for making this such a fun hobby!!!<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
