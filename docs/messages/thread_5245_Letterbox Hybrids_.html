We have found 1 or 2 hybrid boxes in the Madison area that had a hand carved stamp, but mostly they are store-bought.  Hybrids tend to be VERY low on our list of boxes to look for.  Howver sometimes you don't know that it is a hybrid until you find it.  <br/>
<br/>
We also have found some geo-trash trinkets in letterboxes.  We usually remove it so it doesn't damage the stamp and so the box closes properly.<br/>

&gt; Here are my questions - Are geocachers creating geocach/letterboxes?  <br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Tho not very many.  I live in Holland, Michigan, and there's only <br/>
eight within 40 miles.  To put that in perspective, there are well over <br/>
700 caches in that same area!<br/>
<br/>
I have placed two in the area. One is listed both on geocaching.com and <br/>
on LbNA, the second is listed on LbNA and I'm working on getting it <br/>
listed on GC.com.  Both have hand-carved stamps.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Has anyone come across this?  Recently, I found some geocach 'stuff' in <br/>
&gt; one of my letterboxes: a wooden coin, a travel bug metal tag and a key <br/>
&gt; chain.  <br/>
<br/>
A clash of cultures to be sure.  An online log entry for one of my boxes <br/>
said that there were two stamps in it.  Suspecting a hitchhiker, I <br/>
checked it out and posted a bit about HH etiquette.  I imagine some <br/>
boxers are equally befuddled about geocoins, and travel bugs.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Luckily, my stamp was still there.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems every Letterbox (Hybrid) has the statement, in big, bold <br/>
letters, DO NOT TAKE THE STAMP, IT IS NOT A TRADE ITEM!"<br/>
<br/>
The best of the listings act as ambassadors to the geocaching world. <br/>
They explain something of the traditions, link to more information, and <br/>
makes sure that everyone who reads them knows better than to take the stamp!<br/>

<br/>
I am and always will be a letterboxer.  I like the artsy hand carved stamps.  I don't need an expensive, high tech GPS toy.  I wish geocachers would call these things Geocach Hybrids - part goecach part letterbox.  I'm not sure if I have ever seen a listing for a letterbox hybrid, but at least I know that there is such a thing out there and I might come across one.  Yes, they are very low on my list too.  I don't need geo-trash trinkets.   <br/>

But I do respect their hobby.  I just wish it didn't overlap with letterboxing.  <br/>

<br/>
  Our experience has been similar to Hartx6. We have found 1 or 2 hybrid boxes in the Madison area that had a hand carved stamp, but mostly they are store-bought. Hybrids tend to be VERY low on our list of boxes to look for. Howver sometimes you don't know that it is a hybrid until you find it. <br/>
<br/>
  We also have found some geo-trash trinkets in letterboxes. We usually remove it so it doesn't damage the stamp and so the box closes properly.<br/>

Good reason to worry.  No one wants their hand carved stamp to disappear.  I guess 'labeling' is important, but then we all know that some people don't read.  We do our best.  <br/>
<br/>
I had never heard of a 'letterbox hybrid.'  It's not really a letterbox, because it's really a geocach with a stamp in it.  I've never talked with any letterboxers that create a letterbox and include trinkets in their letterbox.  Then I guess that would be a geocach hybrid.  ???   Letterboxing and geocaching are just not the same hobby.  The activity is similar but they are different.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe this explains why I sometimes see a clue on LbNA and the clue appears to be a link to a geocaching website. Maybe that's how these letterbox hybrids are listed; on both geocach and letterbox sites.  But if it looks like a geocach, I tend to ignore the listing.  <br/>
<br/>
I have gone in search of a letterbox and stumbled upon a geocach by mistake.  That happens when there are both placed in close proximity.   But I know the difference and I respect the need to hide them both so passersby don't find either.  <br/>

  &gt; Yes, geocachers are creating letterbox hybrid caches. Some of them <br/>

  be<br/>
  &gt; created simply to be a cache that is a little different. Most <br/>

  &gt; A few years ago I accidentally planted a letterbox virtually on top <br/>
  of a<br/>
  &gt; geocache - in a tree just a few feet away from the tree the cache <br/>
  was in. I<br/>
  &gt; found out because one of the cachers took the time to look the box <br/>
  up on<br/>
  &gt; LBNA and email me, warning me that most of the cachers in our area <br/>
  were<br/>
  &gt; unaware of letterboxing and might, in ignorance, trade for the <br/>
  stamp. When<br/>
  &gt; I went to pull the box and move it, I found that 5 or 6 cachers had <br/>
  logged<br/>
  &gt; in, and one had left a trade item for me - though thankfully didn't <br/>

it that you might have a less than wonderful experience?  That your<br/>

trashy?<br/>

So, you don't have to worry about whether you'll be subjected to<br/>

I think it's a shame that you would be so prejudiced.  But then you<br/>
seemed to have had your mind made up on this issue before you<br/>
started this thread.<br/>

If I sound defensive, it's because I find your comments here and in<br/>

several responses to your original post came from folks who told you<br/>

Please don't read more into my words.  I was merely asking a question about letterbox hybrids; a new term to me and others too.  Once it was explained, I can now see why there is confusion on the trails.  The two hobbies are similar, and yet they are different too.  And both hobbies are continuously evolving. <br/>
<br/>
There are no 'lofty standards' when it comes to letterboxes or geocaches, and it IS about the quest and enjoying the location.  <br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, letterboxes do not contain 'trinkets' and that's the word that is used on the geocach web site.  <br/>
No one denies children the thrill of finding a treasure box of items.  <br/>
<br/>
Prejudice?  Hardly.  "If it looks like a geocach....it's simply called 'a choice'...and I am free to ignore it.  Life is about choices.  <br/>
<br/>
And people who know me understand why I would refer to a GPS unit 'a high tech toy.'  Why does that personally offend you?    <br/>
<br/>
Dragon's responses are his, and he has reasons for expressing himself as he did.  Don't take it personally.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, discussion leads to the understanding and clarification of a problem if there is an evolving crossover between the two hobbies.  It is better to understand why and how things are being done to avoid problems in the future.   <br/>

I used to geocache (for about a week), it took me all of 10 minutes to find<br/>
a trinket to place in a cache, but it takes me a day or more to develop,<br/>
transfer, and carve a stamp.  Hell yeah my "sensibilities may be violated by<br/>
something less than an exquisitely hand-carved stamp!"  I see letterboxing<br/>
as a community, a journey, AND an art.  I only see geocaching as the first<br/>
two.<br/>
<br/>
I would argue that the majority of letterboxers tend to treat their finds<br/>
with some reverence, as they recognize the effort that goes into the<br/>
development and placement of a box -- we find a stamp theme, develop/carve<br/>
stamp, find meaningful location, develop clues (often puzzle clues with<br/>
layers of complexity), hide box, and cross our fingers that it doesn't get<br/>
trashed within a year.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead and attack if that makes you feel better, but standing in a spot<br/>

&gt; &gt; I had never heard of a 'letterbox hybrid.' It's not really a<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox, because it's really a geocach with a stamp in it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have two Letterbos (hybrids) out there, and they are most certainly<br/>
&gt; letterboxes. The only difference is that the clue posted on GC.com uses<br/>
&gt; a GPS to lead one to an initial waypoint. From there, the cacher<br/>
&gt; follows a set of clues to beautiful locations, and to painted<br/>
&gt; lock-n-lock boxes holding high quality journals and hand-carved stamps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I've never talked with any letterboxers that create a letterbox and<br/>
&gt; &gt; include trinkets in their letterbox. Then I guess that would be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; geocach hybrid. ???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; [sigh ...]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing and geocaching are just not the same hobby. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; activity is similar but they are different.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, and Letterbox (hybrids) on GC.com introduce cachers to the<br/>
&gt; traditions of letterboxing. What do you find so wrong about that? Is<br/>
&gt; it that you might have a less than wonderful experience? That your<br/>
&gt; sensibilities may be violated by something less than an exquisitely<br/>
&gt; hand-carved stamp? Can you honestly say that all the boxes you've found<br/>
&gt; meet such lofty standards? Have you achieved such an advanced state of<br/>
&gt; being that you find a few trinkets for the kids or a travel bug to be<br/>
&gt; trashy?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tsk, tsk ... What about the journey? The destination? Community?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe that's how these letterbox hybrids are listed; on both geocach<br/>
&gt; &gt; and letterbox sites.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some are, but many aren't. Mine are. But, most of the geocachers with<br/>
&gt; whom I've corresponded on this subject list theirs only on GC.com.<br/>
&gt; So, you don't have to worry about whether you'll be subjected to<br/>
&gt; those. Only to the ones placed by folks who choose participate in both<br/>
&gt; traditions - which would suggest that they are as aware of the culture<br/>
&gt; tradtions as the average boxer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But if it looks like a geocach, I tend to ignore the listing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it's a shame that you would be so prejudiced. But then you<br/>
&gt; seemed to have had your mind made up on this issue before you<br/>
&gt; started this thread.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I sound defensive, it's because I find your comments here and in<br/>
&gt; previous posts so offensive. Especially in light of the fact that<br/>
&gt; several responses to your original post came from folks who told you<br/>
&gt; they participated in both traditions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I held my tongue before when you referred to "high tech GPS toys" and<br/>
&gt; "geo-trash trinkets" out of one side of your mouth, while stating that<br/>
&gt; you "respect their hobby" out of the other. But today you're continuing<br/>
&gt; make the same points, so I feel compelled to let you know how at least<br/>
&gt; one fellow boxer, who happens to also be a cacher, feels about your<br/>
&gt; screeds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>

The opposite is not always true.<br/>

Hence disdain.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In an effort to be slightly more fair, I will concede that Geocachers seem<br/>
to be more aware these days that letterboxes are different than their<br/>
caches, and that things (e.g., hand-carved art stamps) should not be<br/>
removed.  Back in the day, though, we lost a lot of stamps.  It tends to<br/>
sour you on the culprits.<br/>

I think much of the disdain you hear on this forum is from bad <br/>
experiences some, or many, of us have had with a few geocachers.  We <br/>
have all heard stories of geocachers who remove stamps or destroy parks <br/>
while looking for their ambiguous goal.  While you might find similar <br/>
faults with letterboxers, its much easier to point out how 'they' are <br/>
doing it wrong.  I think several people on this forum would freely admit <br/>
that we might not have given geocaching a fair shake the few times we've <br/>
tried it.  However, like letterboxing itself, it seems to be one of <br/>
those things you just like or you don't.  We like the other aspects of <br/>
letterboxing that are unique to it (particularly the stamps), and as a <br/>
result, you will hear us complain when others infringe upon our sport.<br/>
<br/>
However, you posting rants on this forum won't convince us that <br/>
geocachers are good people.  On the contrary, it will likely reinforce a <br/>
stereotype of geocachers.<br/>

Hope everyone has fun on the trails.<br/>

This is true.  I took offense because I posted what I thought was a <br/>
positive answer to the original post, because I think I've put out some <br/>
good hybrid boxes, and I felt abused by what I saw as attacks on a <br/>
tradition I love.  Besides my rants, I wanted to archive all my listings <br/>
and unsubscribe from this forum.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My point is made - geocachers don't complain because letterboxers<br/>
NEVER muggle their boxes!  We know of and respect their hobby and READ<br/>
what is written in the geocaches.  The reverse is simply not true.<br/>
<br/>
I have geocaching friends, including one of the premier geocachers in<br/>
WI.  They admit this is true.  It boils me to the core however, that<br/>
even though I have requested it MANY times, geocacher leadership both<br/>
at the national, state, and local level REFUSE to educate or remind<br/>
their fellow cachers of the existence of letterboxing other than a<br/>
buried line in the national FAQ (or when they are talking to state<br/>
authorities to place restrictions on us).<br/>
<br/>
It would be so simple to fix this situation if the geocachers really<br/>
wanted to.  All they need to do is edit the part where they explain<br/>
the exchanging of trinkets to include rubber stamps in the list of<br/>
items that should not be exchanged in caches along with a simple<br/>
sentence as to why.  They have a list of hazardous items, etc. that<br/>
should not be traded, why would adding this be difficult?  And for any<br/>
newbie to the geocaching world, this would be one of the things they<br/>
would HAVE to read before going on a hunt.<br/>
<br/>
I knew what to do when I found the train geocache hybrid.  I only<br/>
traded a stamp image.  IF I had had an item of equal value on me, I<br/>
would have considered trading for one of the trains, but I was miles<br/>
from my car.  I would NEVER muggle any box.  My point was that I<br/>
appreciated the items that were placed in that cache compared to the<br/>
junk (yes, junk) that you typically find in caches.  This cache was<br/>
actually truly following the true intent of geocaching which seems to<br/>
have been lost since its beginning.  Caches should reflect the<br/>
location they are in, just like a stamp image should.  The cheap<br/>
trinkets were added to caches so that the hobby would be open to<br/>
people of all economic levels, which is just fine.  I remember a time<br/>
when caches would have $100 bills and other expensive items in them,<br/>
particularly for the first finder.  Cachers had to add the line "of<br/>
equivalent value" to their rules because cachers were taking the<br/>
expensive items and leaving junk drawer items behind.<br/>
<br/>
Consider this - if the tenant of geocaching is to trade items of equal<br/>
value, then why shouldn't I take the nearby geocache if my letterbox<br/>
is taken by them, or parts for parts?  They are equal in sentimental<br/>
value.  I'd only consider doing it to make a clear point to the<br/>
geocacher planter that apparently is rarely gotten when you email them<br/>
requesting help in the return of your stamp.  I have an account on the<br/>
geocaching site, and have found a number of geocaches. so don't say I<br/>
can't trade because I'm not a geocacher.  I have traded items per the<br/>
geocaching code in the past, and have even moved on some of their<br/>
various "hitchhikers".<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am emotional about this right now because one of my most<br/>
detailed and memorable stamps was taken by a geocacher recently.  I<br/>
also receive regular reports about two of my oldest boxes continually<br/>
being found by geocachers because a geocacher came years later and<br/>
placed their cache very close to my box.  And, as in the past, an<br/>
email for help to retrieve the stamp or to move the box to the local<br/>
geocaching community and/or directly to the cache planter has gone<br/>
unanswered - not even an acknowledgment of receipt of my email (nor<br/>
return of the stamp or of the cache being moved).  This reeks of<br/>
disdain from the caching community towards letterboxing rather than<br/>
mutual respect and co-existence.<br/>
<br/>
If geocachers are offended by this, THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!!! <br/>
As letterboxers, we have done everything we can.  It is long past time<br/>
for the geocaching community to act.<br/>

regard I have come across some real jerks in the geocaching world, but<br/>
I have also come across a lot of really nice people who are out on the<br/>
trails, enjoying the outdoors doing their hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Actually some of the most active geocachers here in the West Michigan<br/>
area also letterbox, and I have had great communication with many<br/>
others when there are issues with boxes and caches not playing nicely<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have found when you discover there is a cache located near<br/>
one of your letterboxes...  Position your letterbox so that the<br/>
geocache is the first thing that a seeker will find when he arrives in<br/>
the area.  I had a box that was continually being found by cachers and<br/>
often left lying open in their haste to move on to find the geocache.<br/>
 I repositioned it about 3 feet away so that a person would have to<br/>
stumble over the geocache to get to the letterbox and no more problem<br/>
-- they find what they are looking for and never even realize the<br/>
letterbox is nearby.  I have done this with at least 4 boxes and there<br/>
have been no further problems.<br/>
<br/>
It's a big world, I'm sure we can all play nicely together.<br/>

"This box is underneath the same rock as a Geocache. There is more than enough room for the two of them.

regard I have come across some real jerks in the geocaching world, but<br/>
I have also come across a lot of really nice people who are out on the<br/>
trails, enjoying the outdoors doing their hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Actually some of the most active geocachers here in the West Michigan<br/>
area also letterbox, and I have had great communication with many<br/>
others when there are issues with boxes and caches not playing nicely<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have found when you discover there is a cache located near<br/>
one of your letterboxes... Position your letterbox so that the<br/>
geocache is the first thing that a seeker will find when he arrives in<br/>
the area. I had a box that was continually being found by cachers and<br/>
often left lying open in their haste to move on to find the geocache.<br/>
I repositioned it about 3 feet away so that a person would have to<br/>
stumble over the geocache to get to the letterbox and no more problem<br/>
-- they find what they are looking for and never even realize the<br/>
letterbox is nearby. I have done this with at least 4 boxes and there<br/>
have been no further problems.<br/>
<br/>
It's a big world, I'm sure we can all play nicely together.<br/>

with them over the years and not a one has been good.  That doesn't mean<br/>
responsible geocaching doesn't exist.  But I doubt I'll change my thinking<br/>

just how it is.<br/>

No, she tried to paint a fresh coat on her earlier comments.  But in the<br/>
context of her original posts, she clearly expressed her disdain for<br/>
caching.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Go ahead and yell at me -- I have very little use for geocachers in<br/>
general,<br/>
<br/>
I'll yell at both of you.  I've never heard a cacher speak a<br/>
discouraging word about boxers, and I'm dismayed by how much deep-seated<br/>
disdain for cachers I hear in this forum.<br/>

FoundUnicorn and I had an interesting experience on Sunday afternoon <br/>
while driving to find Journey To The Center Of The Earth. As we <br/>
neared the first clue, we saw a car following us. It turned out to be <br/>
a husband/wife team of Geocachers who go by the name of Rude Rat. <br/>
Turns out that Journey To The Center Of The Earth is a <br/>
letterbox/geocache hybrid as well!!! Rude Rat and FoundUnicorn and I <br/>
searched for the box together, swapping information about <br/>
Letterboxing and Geocaching along the way. The owner of Journey To <br/>
The Center Of The Earth suggests going to the Geocaching website and <br/>
deciphering the coded Runes message in order to more fully understand <br/>
the meaning of that letterbox.<br/>

&gt; A friend who just bought a GPS unit is inquiring about geocaching <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; asked me about "letterbox hybrids."  She wrote:  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Letterbox Hybrid: A letterbox hybrid cache is a combination of a <br/>
&gt; geocache and a letterbox in the same container. A letterbox has a <br/>
&gt; rubber stamp and a logbook instead of tradable items. Letterboxers <br/>
&gt; carry their own stamp with them, to stamp the letterbox's log book <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; inversely stamp their personal log book with the letterbox stamp. <br/>
The <br/>
&gt; hybrid cache contains the important materials for this and may or <br/>
may <br/>
&gt; not include trade items. Whether the letterbox hybrid contains <br/>
trade <br/>
&gt; items is up to the owner."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here are my questions - Are geocachers creating <br/>
geocach/letterboxes?  <br/>
&gt; Has anyone come across this?  Recently, I found some <br/>
geocach 'stuff' in <br/>
&gt; one of my letterboxes: a wooden coin, a travel bug metal tag and a <br/>
key <br/>
&gt; chain.  Luckily, my stamp was still there.  <br/>
