Speaking of tieing down boxes, does anyone have any post-flood status <br/>
updates on boxes that were near the rivers?  I haven't checked <br/>
individual clues, but was just wondering in general if boxes were lost, <br/>
and if so, were the clues updated accordingly?  We probably won't be <br/>
heading down to IL until November, but was curious.  We're hoping that <br/>
all, or at least most, of the boxes survived!<br/>

  I have not seen it yet, but my Mom called me this morning to say <br/>
  there's an article in her Suburban Life newspaper about letterboxing. <br/>
  (I had nothing to do with it - this is news to me.) If it's in her <br/>
  edition (Lyons), it is most likely in others, since the new owners <br/>
  (Chicago Suburban News) tends to run the same articles in all their <br/>
  various "local" papers. Time to get out the bungee cords to tie down <br/>

http://www.gatehousenewsservice.com/entertainment/x823000230 ...nothing <br/>
specific to our area.  It mentions AQ but not LbNA.  Pretty inocuous.  <br/>
We'll see if the boxing traffic in the area increases..........<br/>
