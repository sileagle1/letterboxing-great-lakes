Someone on the Texas regional board posted this question recently: "So,<br/>
how many boxes have you put out that are never found?" which prompted<br/>
some interesting responses.  I thought it might be fun to see what<br/>
people in our area had to say on the same subject.  Here is our<br/>
response:<br/>
<br/>
I have a box in Huatulco, Mexico that at least 2 people have looked for,<br/>
but have not found, so it may have gone missing before it was found. <br/>
Martini Man &amp; I have several other boxes that we planted, but have never<br/>
received any reports on.  To the best of our knowledge, these have never<br/>
been found (but some are pretty recent plants):<br/>

Our first plant still hasn't been found! But it's planted in West Virginia (where we lived until recently), and there aren't a lot of 'boxers in the part of the state we were in. Last we had checked it was still there, but when we go visit my inlaws again we'll have to check on it again. It's been planted for two years and still no bites. I'm beginning to give up hope for it. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Our only other plant so far sat a while without finds, but it's nearer the interstate and has finally racked up some finds, so at least I know we write comprehensible clues... ;)<br/>
