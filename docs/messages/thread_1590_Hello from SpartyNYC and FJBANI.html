I just wanted to introduce myself to the board. My wife and I have <br/>
been letterboxing for close to a year now in both the Traverse City <br/>
Area(parents live on Old Mission Peninsula) and in New York City(we <br/>
live here). I found out about letterboxing after reading about it in <br/>
Time magazine and was amazed at how many letterboxes were all around <br/>
us. Especially the Urban ones. Anyways, we got hooked and we managed <br/>
to hook our parents into it as well. <br/>
<br/>
This past week we managed to do most of the ones in the TC area <br/>
while on vacation. They all seem to be in pretty good shape. And we<br/>
actually  planted our first one on www.letterboxing.org. Its <br/>
called "Fred's Rock Hunt" and it was posted with the trailname of <br/>
fjbani(the parents). But, seeing how they are a little less skilled<br/>
at the ways of the internet Iam joining this group for them too.<br/>

It is amazing how many boxes have been planted in NYC within the past 18 months.  We were there in the fall of 2003 and there were only a handful of boxes in the entire NYC area.  And Traverse City/Old Mission...  what a beautiful area!  It is one of my favorite areas in MI and there are a lot of nice parks/trails there.  I would love to hear further details of your boxing conquests in that area if you want to e-mail me offlist.  I also look forward to looking for your new box when I am up there.<br/>
