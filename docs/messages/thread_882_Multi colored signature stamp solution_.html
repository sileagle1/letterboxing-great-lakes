left before everyone came back for the group photo and we are sorry we had to <br>
leave early, but the 2 hour drive and evening plans were cause to exit!  We had <br>
a great time, food was fab!  and it was so fun meeting everyone and put names <br>
with faces.  It adds a human credibility to it all.  Letterboxing is the best! <br>
 Dragon, thank you for all your hard work and tell your family we appreciate <br>
them loaning you to us for the duration.  <br>

There was mention of using multicolored signature stamps and wishing you <br>
could easily achieve that look.....I have the perfect solution!  As many of you <br>
may know, I own a rubber stamp store here in Rockford, IL  called The Goose Barn <br>
and we carry a product (which you can find other places... so this is not <br>
just a plug for business :) )  that allows you to create a custom colored stamp <br>
pad for your signature stamp which then allows you to repeatedly stamp the <br>
perfectly colored image every time.  It is called Cut n' Dry.  It comes in 2 <br>
varieties, Foam or Felt.  They are like a huge uninked ink pad (8 x 10) with a <br>
thick, gray foam backing to prevent skidding.  The Foam pad is used for making an <br>
ink pad for thicker inks or paints like Pigment Inks, Lumiere paints, Duo <br>
adhesive, acrylic paint, latex paint...whatever might be thicker and you want to <br>
use in a stamp pad.  The Felt pad is a thick, gray foam backed felt, like is <br>
found in a regular dye based ink pad- (8 x 10) - It is for making ink pads that <br>
use thinner inks such as dye, permanent or alcohol based inks.  This is what <br>
you would use for your hand carved signature stamp.  Here's how:  Stamp your <br>
signature stamp onto the corner of the 8 x 10 pad of Felt Cut n' Dry in a <br>
PERMANENT ink, preferably black. Cut the CnD after you trace the shape of the mount <br>
on your signature stamp. (Save the remainder CnD for future use.)   If your <br>
sig stamp has no mount, cut the felt pad slightly larger than your image so you <br>
will easily be able to eye lining it up.   Then use reinkers to color the CnD <br>
on the lined or solid areas you would usually do with a marker, using your <br>
permanent ink stamped image as a guide.  It will bleed a little along the lines <br>
or sections so don't over ink the pad.   Now, you can repeatedly stamp it in <br>
all those log books without having to use several markers everytime you want <br>
multi colors.  Store your inked pad in a zip lock bag or be creative and put it <br>
into a container of some kind, like an empty Altoid tin, etc.and then into a <br>
zip lock bag which will help keep the ink from dehydrating.  Just re-ink as <br>
necessary.   http://www.rangerink.com/product_cutndryfelt.html  Here is a picture <br>
of what you are looking for but the directions are on the back.  It is a <br>
product we carry, so if anyone is interested just let me know.  If my directions <br>
aren't clear, email me and I will be glad to try again or print the directions <br>
right off the back of the package. <br>
