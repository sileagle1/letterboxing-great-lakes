friend to all letterboxers, Kristin, otherwise known as TrailTroll, has taken a
terrible fall which stopped her breathing and her heart. Sh</span>e is now on life support and we are all praying for a good
outcome. She has many, many friends among us letterboxers and means the world
to us. Kristin, you are loved.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/></p><p class="MsoNormal">On 22-JUN-16 he posted some info he received from Trail Troll's sister:</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;color:rgb(29, 33, 41);">From Lori,</span></p><p><span>

good day with Kristin. My sister. She did not respond yesterday. They were
overly optimistic. And the doc said they were wrong. Didn't respond today. She
should be at this point. I beg for positives thoughts and prayers for her. Many
of you know I live with her and she is my world. She's had a great deal of
medical issues. No thyroid, left ear hearing, no gall bladder or adrenal
glands. And more. But I've always taken care of her. But now I need help. Pray.
Make her wake up.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p></body></html>
