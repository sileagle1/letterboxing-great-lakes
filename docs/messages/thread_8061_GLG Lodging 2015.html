                    <html><body><p><span>Based on the poll, I'm guessing that people haven't figured out their plans for where to stay for the GLG in June.  We are suggesting campers stay up the road at Lowden St park since the sites are generally more level, a bit better spaced, and the whole campground is a bit more secluded vs White Pines State Park.   We have reserved a site for ourselves in the non-electric 'B' loop (pit toilets).  There are also electric sites available with a modern toilet/shower building. The modern toilets are across the main road from the the non-electric sites and about a 5 min walk along a small trail.  At the moment, there were several of both types available.   We have camped there before, and will be other there again sooner or later, so if you have questions feel free to send them to us directly and we'll answer them as best we can.  <br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>As for hotel campers, we are a bit at a loss as to where to suggest.  The state parks are a bit out, away from many immediate options.  There look to be a few B&amp;Bs very nearby, but we don't have any 1st hand knowledge of them.  For hotels, there seem to be options in Dixon or Rochell which look to be ~20mins away.  Again, we have no first hand knowledge of them other than what we'd find on the internet.  So sorry for the 'help.' <br/></span></p><p><br/><span></span></p><p><span>We've created a database to track where people are staying for those interested and willing.  ;-)</span></p><p><br/><span></span></p><p><span>Five months to go!</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Atomic Beans<br/></span></p><p><br/><span></span></p><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"/></span></p></body></html>
