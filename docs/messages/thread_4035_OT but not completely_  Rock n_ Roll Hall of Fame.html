Cleveland so that they can spend a day at the Rock<br>
Hall, you may want to visit this website on Wednesday,<br>
May 9th, around 10:30 am to buy tickets:<br>
<br>
http://wkyc3.mediawebconnect.com/<br>
<br>
A lot of the Cleveland-area radio and TV stations have<br>
weekly "half-price deals," usually where you can get a<br>
$50 gift certificate to someplace for only $25, plus<br>
shipping (usually $3 to $5). They have limited<br>
supplies, though, so it's a good idea to visit the<br>
website when the sale opens to ensure you're able to<br>
purchase one of the certificates you're interested in.<br>
 <br>
<br>
This week, our TV station Channel 3's offer is 2<br>
tickets to the Rock Hall for $20 (plus shipping) - the<br>
normal price is $20 per ticket.  Again, if you're<br>
interested, visit the link above on May 9th around<br>
10:30 am.  Deedle & I have bought several certificates<br>
this way before and never had any problems.  The<br>
certificates usually arrive in 1 to 2 weeks of us<br>
ordering them, so you should get your order in time<br>
for the Gathering.<br>
