Nam Vet's hand wasn't in the air ... but, alas, our grandson deleted <br/>
ALL my photos off my camera before I got them on the computer! ;-(<br/>
<br/>
But, I really want to say "thank you" to everyone of you who came to <br/>
Birds of a Feather.  The success of the day was totally due to the <br/>
great letterboxers who came to keep us company for the day!  Especially <br/>
thanks to everyone who donated boxes, whether indoors or out.  Atomic <br/>
Beans, the clue on your car was a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm ... the fork in the tree.  Never saw it before.  Well, Trail Rider <br/>
and I have to get back to MacQueen and get WiHi/MM's boxes which were <br/>
planted there.  Probably a few other strays as well.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks to everyone who came or contributed.  It's fun to see you <br/>
again and get to recognize you at events.<br/>

We just got back from Minneapolis last night. Got to do a bunch of great<br/>
boxing while there. <br/>
<br/>
I have uploaded some of my pictures from BoaF. It was a great event! And<br/>
great food! Just never enough time at events to greet/eat/box/hike/chat,<br/>

Thanks to all who planned/planted/cooked, etc! -The HowD girls :)<br/>
