the April Fool's box in Hudson Mills, MI <br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.info/box/marty/aprilfools.php). This was the <br/>
first box planted in MI and is one of the oldest letterboxers in the <br/>
US, now 7 years old. I "adopted" it a couple of years ago (along with <br/>
the original planter's boxes in PA &amp; NJ) and have been working to <br/>
keep it alive and well with TJ Mich's assistance.<br/>
<br/>
This box gets a fair amount of visitors, and could use some <br/>
maintenance pretty soon -- I think the container and log may need to <br/>
be replaced. I'll be happy to provide a replacement log and container <br/>
if someone could offer to plant it and occasionally check in on the <br/>
box. Since this box is by now a historical relic (in letterboxing, at <br/>
least!), you'd be doing a great service!<br/>
<br/>
Please contact me directly by email if you can help out.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
  I've only visited the box once (when I found it) but I live in Brighton and work in Ypsilanti so I'm in the general area and wouldn't mind maintaining the box as best I can.  If nobody else has stepped up, I'd be willing to adopt it.<br/>
