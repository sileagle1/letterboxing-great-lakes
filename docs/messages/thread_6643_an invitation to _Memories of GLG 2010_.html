Cards need to be 2-1/2 x 3-1/2, either orientation. Carve a stamp that represents the tracker, so something in memory of the GLG 2010. You can add anything to decorate you card, or it can be AATC(all about the carve) and just make it simple. I think FW wants a picture included somewhere..<br/>

Its real simple: <br/>
<br/>
Cards need to be 2-1/2 x 3-1/2, either orientation. Carve a stamp that represents the tracker, so something in memory of the GLG 2010. You can add anything to decorate you card, or it can be AATC(all about the carve) and just make it simple. I think FW wants a picture included somewhere..<br/>
<br/>
Easy right!?  Have fun, cant wait to see what everyone comes up with!<br/>

Here's the project description off AQ:<br/>
<br/>
The muck and the mire...the tornados and fallen trees...the 2010 Great Lakes Gathering is no doubt one that will live on in our memories for many years.  And to help us remember it, let's create and swap some LTC's!  <br/>
<br/>
If possible, try to incorporate a photograph from the event into your cards.  You can use an image as your background and stamp over it, or use it as part of your design.  If you didn't take any photos, I'm sure if you asked someone who posted some either here on AQ or on the GLK yahoo group would probably allow you to use the image.<br/>
<br/>
You MUST have attended the gathering to participate.  Otherwise, all the standard rules apply.  Come join the LTC fun, even if you've never tried making them before.  Just ask if you have a question or see http://www.atlasquest.com/about/wiki/browse.html?gCatId=39.<br/>
<br/>
Our plan is to collect the stamps themselves to use as an event box for future GL Gatherings.  Send your stamp along with your cards (optional, but we'd really like a full set!), one for each participant plus one extra card to be included in the logbook.  Please leave your stamps unmounted to decrease postage costs. <br/>
<br/>
Start date and max signups are flexible.  Let me know if you'd like more time, want in after it fills up.   Contact me and I'll add you to the tracker.  Since I have it set as "limited", self-enrollment won't work.<br/>
<br/>
================================================================<br/>
<br/>
If you really don't want to part with your stamp, that's okay.  My address will be posted on the tracker so when they are ready, send them to me.  I have a send-to-me deadline of September 1st, but if everyone is done early, I'll send them earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome aboard, everyone!<br/>

  Here's the project description off AQ:<br/>
<br/>
  The muck and the mire...the tornados and fallen trees...the 2010 Great Lakes Gathering is no doubt one that will live on in our memories for many years. And to help us remember it, let's create and swap some LTC's! <br/>
<br/>
  If possible, try to incorporate a photograph from the event into your cards. You can use an image as your background and stamp over it, or use it as part of your design. If you didn't take any photos, I'm sure if you asked someone who posted some either here on AQ or on the GLK yahoo group would probably allow you to use the image.<br/>
<br/>
  You MUST have attended the gathering to participate. Otherwise, all the standard rules apply. Come join the LTC fun, even if you've never tried making them before. Just ask if you have a question or see http://www.atlasquest.com/about/wiki/browse.html?gCatId=39.<br/>
<br/>
  Our plan is to collect the stamps themselves to use as an event box for future GL Gatherings. Send your stamp along with your cards (optional, but we'd really like a full set!), one for each participant plus one extra card to be included in the logbook. Please leave your stamps unmounted to decrease postage costs. <br/>
<br/>
  Start date and max signups are flexible. Let me know if you'd like more time, want in after it fills up. Contact me and I'll add you to the tracker. Since I have it set as "limited", self-enrollment won't work.<br/>
<br/>
  ================================================================<br/>
<br/>
  If you really don't want to part with your stamp, that's okay. My address will be posted on the tracker so when they are ready, send them to me. I have a send-to-me deadline of September 1st, but if everyone is done early, I'll send them earlier.<br/>
<br/>
  Welcome aboard, everyone!<br/>

  &gt; Contact FW on AQ-she is also putting together a book of our cards so send in 1 extra card, and if everyone doesnt mind we are sending in the stamps as well so it can travel to all the future Great Lakes Gatherings.<br/>

  &gt; Thanks Brandon! Where do we send our finished product, how many do we make, and is it a real "picture" or the stamp image?<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Its real simple: <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Cards need to be 2-1/2 x 3-1/2, either orientation. Carve a stamp that represents the tracker, so something in memory of the GLG 2010. You can add anything to decorate you card, or it can be AATC(all about the carve) and just make it simple. I think FW wants a picture included somewhere..<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Easy right!? Have fun, cant wait to see what everyone comes up with!<br/>
