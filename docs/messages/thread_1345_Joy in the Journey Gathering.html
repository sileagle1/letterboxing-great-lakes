                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to put out a post thanking The Sisters Act for putting <br/>
together such a wonderful get-together last weekend.  The entire <br/>
affair was lavished with TLC from the clue binders to the goody bags <br/>
to the lapel pins (yes, I said "lapel pins") and it was certainly <br/>
appreciated.  Thank you, Flag Bearer and Full of Heart; it was a <br/>
pleasure meeting you and the other Indiana 'boxers who attended.<br/>
<br/>
Those of you who missed this gathering can still check out the boxes <br/>
in Marshall county.  There's some excellent carving to be found out <br/>
amongst the cattle and the corn rows!<br/>

(love the history).  I will be coming back for more boxes next month.  There were just too <br/>
many to get.  We went for 32 boxes and found 29!  It was great to put some faces to the <br/>
stamps I've seen all over Indiana.<br/>
<br/>
Team Taco - if you saw my message from AQ, would you be so kind to tell me how off-<br/>
base I am?  I think I can, I think I can ...<br/>
<br/>
I will be making my 2nd Trip to Hell on Saturday, weather permitting.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, don't forget the much appreciated hats, water, apple, food and M&amp;Ms.  Looks like I'll <br/>
be buying these little candies in the future just to use the containers for letterboxes.<br/>
