<br>
We had a blast this weekend!  It was so great to finally meet the <br>
people behind the stamps we've seen around the GLK.  Not only were the <br>
exchanges fun, we're also happy to report to have found all but 7 of <br>
the listed boxes and several other boxes as well (we were second to <br>
complete Jigsaw's "Wasp in a Wig" series!) without our legs totally <br>
falling off. :)  We were impressed with all of the well-carved stamps, <br>
and there were several creative logbooks as well (we especially liked <br>
the deck of cards).<br>
<br>
Big thanks to Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man for all of their efforts <br>
in organizing the event!<br>
