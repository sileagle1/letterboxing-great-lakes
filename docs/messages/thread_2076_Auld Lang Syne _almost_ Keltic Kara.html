Well, I know many of you remember Keltic Kara (see Lumber Town series)<br/>
moved from MI to ME and now I have gotten an email letting me know she<br/>
did a quick visit back to the area.  I've not heard of Can Man, but<br/>
have let Thumbs Up know to pass on the address for our list, in case<br/>
he wants to join.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the 'contact the placer' note I got recently:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyway, on 11/20, I was out with Becky from Midland, SISU and Can<br/>
Man from Muskegon, and KelticKara from Lubec, ME (formerly of<br/>
Muskegon) and we found the four boxes out at Henderson Lake Nature<br/>
Preserve:<br/>
    - Compass Rose Letterbox<br/>
    - Old Man Winter<br/>
    - Elvis Lives<br/>
    - Here Kitty Kitty<br/>
<br/>
    I really liked the location (and it's always fun to find more than<br/>
one at any given place!). I really enjoyed the triangulation for<br/>
Compass Rose!  We were together for an early Thanksgiving celebration<br/>
and what better way to spend time with people you love?!<br/>
<br/>
    All 4 are in great shape and well hidden. Thanks again for another<br/>
afternoon of fun! From: Jessica aka Thumb's Up!&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Hope you ENJOY!ed this 'blast from the past' brought to you by:<br/>
