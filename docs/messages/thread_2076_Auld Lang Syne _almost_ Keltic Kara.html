<br>
Well, I know many of you remember Keltic Kara (see Lumber Town series)<br>
moved from MI to ME and now I have gotten an email letting me know she<br>
did a quick visit back to the area.  I've not heard of Can Man, but<br>
have let Thumbs Up know to pass on the address for our list, in case<br>
he wants to join.<br>
<br>
Here's the 'contact the placer' note I got recently:<br>
<br>
> Anyway, on 11/20, I was out with Becky from Midland, SISU and Can<br>
Man from Muskegon, and KelticKara from Lubec, ME (formerly of<br>
Muskegon) and we found the four boxes out at Henderson Lake Nature<br>
Preserve:<br>
    - Compass Rose Letterbox<br>
    - Old Man Winter<br>
    - Elvis Lives<br>
    - Here Kitty Kitty<br>
<br>
    I really liked the location (and it's always fun to find more than<br>
one at any given place!). I really enjoyed the triangulation for<br>
Compass Rose!  We were together for an early Thanksgiving celebration<br>
and what better way to spend time with people you love?!<br>
<br>
    All 4 are in great shape and well hidden. Thanks again for another<br>
afternoon of fun! From: Jessica aka Thumb's Up!<<br>
<br>
Hope you ENJOY!ed this 'blast from the past' brought to you by:<br>
