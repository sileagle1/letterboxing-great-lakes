I do appreciate your comments, but as others have emailed things have changed for the better so there is no good reason not to register ordinary, mediocre or crappy LBoxes and HHs as AQ and LBNA are now soul mates. About the only good reason not to register HHs is if they are such special treasures that knowledge of there whereabouts is only spread by WOM or private emails so as to only be found among a select group of artisan LBoxers who have created little treasures.<br>
 <br>
However, the two HHs of which I speak are open for public inspection. They are nothing to brag about (one entry is in ballpoint pen with no stamp and somewhat illegible). I wouldn't call these HHs crappy, but they are ordinary. There is no reason they should not be registered at LBNA/AQ. The tracking that is done is only when found ~ not where they are placed. In this MInneapois area there is not a whole lot of LBox activity in the summer let alone the winter. So, in this particular instance more good than harm was done by me mentioning where I had placed "Christmas Swish Tree." You are correct is saying that most HH are a "surprise" and not a "treasure" as some would have you believe. If they were a "treasure" they would not have been placed where I could find them in LBoxes registered via public knowledge at LBNA and AQ. The bottomline is that there is NO GOOD REASON why Bindle Babe should deny finders the opportunity to record "Christmas Swish Tree" at Atlas Quest. This is an<br>
 example of not being a good team player.<br>
 <br>
The following is an email reply I made earlier to Ryan at Atlas Quest that I have pasted word for word. I have nothing but GOOD to say about how very, very helpful, unbiased and expedient he has been in responding to all of my emails.<br>
 <br>
"I retrieved my first two LBoxes and have changed their status to "missing." Another LBox that I had planted and was going to register with LBNA/AQ today is on hold as well as about seven more I had planned to place this year. The reason being that the contents are of a quality that is too good to list on a public website. My background is in bookbinding, papermaking, letterpress printing, foil hotstamping, screen printing, engraving, photolithography, still photography, cinematography, graphic design, audio-visual training materials, instructional technology, and broadcast television. I carved my first linoleum block over 40 years ago. Most LBoxers don't even know the meaning of type high as it relates to the thickness of linoleum blocks or why they are impractical for 97% of LBoxers who are better off using pink putz if they don't have their own little pilot press, proof press or larger Chandler & Price printing press. <br>
<br>
I will be downgrading my two "missing" letterboxes to a quite ordinary status. Also, I'm<br>
coming to the realization that women LBoxers are not near as active during winter months. I will buy some cheap little notebooks, carve a quicky counterfeit and get some smaller inexpensive containers, and edit my entry as appropriate. Will try to have these crappy LBoxes back in place in a week just in case one or two searchers come calling in the next 6 months.<br>
<br>
Thanks to your advice and that of others I will no longer register my artisan quality LBoxes with LBNA or AQ."<br>

<br>
Spring Chick, I concur with what you posted earlier.  I sent this poster an off-list message, <br>
but I concur, he/she just doesn't/want to "get it."  I checked the join date - November 6th!  <br>
Then I googled "antoine le blanc" and, no pun intended (really), it made my skin crawl.  <br>
How could anyone be so bold to write some of the things this poster said.  Is this a troll?<br>
<br>
The examples of extreme language make me wonder if this poster is trying to bait our <br>
friendly group of letterboxers in the GL region.  Clues that tip me off ...<br>
<br>
"things have changed for the better so there is no good reason not to register ordinary, <br>
mediocre or crappy LBoxes and HHs as AQ and LBNA are now soul mates." - subjective <br>
opinion. <br>
<br>
"About the only good reason not to .."  implies there are more reasons but the poster <br>
recognizes only one.<br>
<br>
How arrogant to complain about ordinary store-bought HHs.  I will take one any day that <br>
was created by someone with less than 20/20 vision, or with some other physical <br>
challenge.<br>
<br>
If the artistic background of this poster is accurate, it would be a shame not to enjoy what <br>
this poster may have to offer.  But if the poster feels so strongly about the subjective <br>
quality of every box, maybe letterboxing is not for this poster.<br>
<br>
I'd like to encourage antoine le blanc/"journey" to attend a gathering to learn more and <br>
meet some real people who are passionate about letterboxing.  Minnesota just might not <br>
be the letterboxing mecca yet, but give it time. And for those of us that are planning to <br>
travel to Minnesota, let's try to grow the hobby so this poster won't be so isolated.<br>
<br>
To antoine le blanc/"journey": Calling out veterans is not nice and not being a team player.  <br>
How long have you been letterboxing?  I know plenty of winter letterboxing women that <br>
would take issue with your statement.  And degrading your own boxes to make a point <br>
doesn't exactly put your new boxes on my must-find list.  I want to ask, what were your <br>
expectations when you decided to take up letterboxing?  If you wanted to learn and enjoy <br>
something new, please take some time and read through the message board(s) archives <br>
and google to your heart's content.  There's plenty of good stuff to soak in.<br>
<br>
Just an ordinary letterboxer out to have fun,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, Journey. While I was away spending considerable time composing my<br>
previous post to you, you've come back here and posted twice more. <br>
<br>
Up until now, I've been nothing but polite in how I've addressed you<br>
and your concerns. Now, however  the gloves are off, mister.<br>
<br>
I agree with speedsquares' suspicious that you are a troll, trying to<br>
bait us with your ugly, mean-spirited, misogynistic and arrogant<br>
messages. <br>
<br>
I sincerely doubt the veracity of your CV (curriculum vitae) and some<br>
of your statements are completely outlandish. Printing presses for<br>
letterbox stamps!? ROFLMO  too rich.<br>
<br>
Just as speedsquare found parts of your posts to send up warning flags<br>
about a troll  your illogical, inconsistent statements regarding "no<br>
reason not to be on AQ" vs. your new, current position of "no longer<br>
listing on AQ" sounded a huge claxon for me.<br>
<br>
It's truly pathetic that you felt you could hold my little Christmas<br>
Swish Tree HH hostage with your demands that I list it on AQ "by<br>
Thanksgiving"  your deadline gave me a flash-back to that<br>
Televangelist who claimed God would call him home if he didn't raise<br>
so much money by a certain date. Thanks for the chuckle.<br>
<br>
It does sadden me to think you may banish my little HH to a `virtually<br>
inactive box' but I won't allow you to provoke me with your poor<br>
behavior. <br>
<br>
I really liked that little tree and I'm quite fond of it.  However, it<br>
is just a little piece of carved rubber  a thing - and things can be<br>
replaced. You can never steal my memories of it. <br>
<br>
So even if you toss it in the fire, down the disposal or feed it to<br>
your dog, I will still "beat" you at this "game" you're playing. <br>
<br>
To quote W.C. Fields, "go away kid, you bother me."<br>

Enjoy!<br>
