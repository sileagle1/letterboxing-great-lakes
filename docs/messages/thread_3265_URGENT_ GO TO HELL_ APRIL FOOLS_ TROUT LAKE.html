&gt;OK, I just finished composing my letter to the writer.<br/>
&gt;  If anyone wants I can post it to the list, but<br/>
&gt;promise not to institutionalize me after reading it!<br/>
&gt;It's a bit lengthy and passionate, but hey, I WAS an<br/>
&gt;English major.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway...if you haven't been inspired to write to ole'<br/>
&gt;Buddy yet this may make you want to put your two cents<br/>
&gt;in.  I compared the Trout Lake clues on LbNA to what<br/>
&gt;was printed with the article.  The article left the<br/>
&gt;most important line of the clues out:  "This is a very<br/>
&gt;popular spot so rehide me well!"<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; they see a tangible effect.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to know why this family didn't take the<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; P.S.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Curiously, I also noticed that the letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; family was referred to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with their real names, not trailnames. This was<br/>
&gt; &gt; also<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the style of an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; article in the Grand Rapids (MI) Press not long<br/>
&gt; &gt; ago.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Since we all use trailnames as part of the game, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wonder if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers in question really "get it".<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This subject has been debated and discussed again<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and again, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dealing with media is a touchy proposition. As<br/>
&gt; &gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of us learned a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; couple of years ago, even mainstream/major media<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seldom take the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to really understand how letterboxing really<br/>
&gt; &gt; works.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; While pulling clues may seen drastic, I can't<br/>
&gt; &gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blame those with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes in that area for their reactions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll be curious to see if Dragon gets a respnse<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Brande (and everyone else, too),<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To a degree, letterboxing IS a secret society.  Not<br/>
&gt;that we want to keep people out, otherwise we'll never<br/>
&gt;get new boxers hunting and new boxes planted and that<br/>
&gt;would just cause the sport to die out.  But the act of<br/>
&gt;letterboxing is the "secret society" as in, when said<br/>
&gt;letterboxer(s) are in the woods, what they're doing is<br/>
&gt;in a way a covert mission.  Others don't KNOW that<br/>
&gt;there are boxes hidden in these woods, but we<br/>
&gt;letterboxers DO and in order to protect our little<br/>
&gt;rubber treasures we try to not draw attention to<br/>
&gt;ourselves out on the trails.  Which is why, when we<br/>
&gt;find a box, we need to resist the urge to scream "I<br/>
&gt;found it!!" when there are joggers around, and why<br/>
&gt;it's so important to rehide that box so carefully so<br/>
&gt;that, if, say, the kids blowing up firecrackers by the<br/>
&gt;creek have noticed us in the woods and when we leave<br/>
&gt;they decide to go investigate what we were doing their<br/>
&gt;chances of finding the box and leaving obscenities in<br/>
&gt;the logbook are lesser rather than greater.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;(Yes, we have found a logbook before where non-boxing<br/>
&gt;teens left obscenities in the book; but at least they<br/>
&gt;left the box intact.  And yes, we have been<br/>
&gt;letterboxing before where kids were blowing up<br/>
&gt;firecrackers down by the creek.  Luckily the box was<br/>
&gt;hidden far enough from the creek where the kids didn't<br/>
&gt;see us disappear into the woods.  We also found box<br/>
&gt;contents scattered around the woods once where a drunk<br/>
&gt;evidently found the box first and left his empty beer<br/>
&gt;can in the real hiding place.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The whole trailname aspect adds to the "secretive"<br/>
&gt;quality of letterboxing.  In the "real world" I'm<br/>
&gt;known as Diane, but to letterboxers I am Doodle Bug.<br/>
&gt;And let me tell you, it is SO COOL to be at a<br/>
&gt;gathering and someone comes up to you and cries, "So<br/>
&gt;YOU'RE Doodle Bug!"  Makes you feel like a celebrity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, to paraphrase some sci fi character from some sci<br/>
&gt;fi movie (maybe Yoda?) with Letterboxing comes Great<br/>
&gt;Responsibility.  Because as much as finding little<br/>
&gt;rubber stamps (or sometimes big rubber stamps) is<br/>
&gt;central to letterboxing, there's so much MORE to it<br/>
&gt;that that article just doesn't touch on.  Letterboxing<br/>
&gt;isn't just about finding little boxes.  It is about<br/>
&gt;spending time with family and friends, enjoying the<br/>
&gt;outdoors, exploring new places, treating these little<br/>
&gt;works of art with respect, treating our surroundings<br/>
&gt;with respect, and this article touched on none of<br/>
&gt;that.  There are so many resources out there to help a<br/>
&gt;new letterboxer learn that there's more to<br/>
&gt;letterboxing than just pulling on the hiking boots,<br/>
&gt;printing off the clues, and pulling the box out from<br/>
&gt;behind a pile of rocks.  But this article made it seem<br/>
&gt;like that's all there is to it, which I believe is<br/>
&gt;what's enraged so many people on this list - me, at<br/>
&gt;least.  There's a letterboxing "spirit" that the<br/>
&gt;article just doesn't talk about at all.  It's the<br/>
&gt;"spirit" that makes us want to convert all our family<br/>
&gt;and friends into letterboxers, too, and show them HOW<br/>
&gt;to letterbox, how to respect the box and their<br/>
&gt;surroundings and appreciate that letterboxing is so<br/>
&gt;much more than just a hidden container.  In a way,<br/>
&gt;letterboxing is a cult!  We want newer letterboxers to<br/>
&gt;take the time to learn at least a little of the<br/>
&gt;history and respect for the cult - I mean game before<br/>
&gt;pulling those hiking boots on.  And some will, but<br/>
&gt;some won't.  And we're worried about the some who<br/>
&gt;won't, because they're who endanger our boxes.  And<br/>
&gt;although one would hope that the wills would be<br/>
&gt;greater than the won'ts, recent activity in the Great<br/>
&gt;Lakes region (read some of the posts from the past<br/>
&gt;three months) has shown that the won'ts seem to be<br/>
&gt;outnumbering the wills.  So clues get pulled, because<br/>
&gt;there's no way of knowing who hunting for the box is a<br/>
&gt;"will" and who is a "won't."  And people don't want to<br/>
&gt;risk the won'ts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now did I confuse anyone else with that last<br/>
&gt;paragraph?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Forgive me since I am new to this, but why is this<br/>
&gt; &gt; such a big deal?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Is letterboxing like a secret society or something?<br/>
&gt; &gt; I thought the<br/>
&gt; &gt; point was to get people (including families)<br/>
&gt; &gt; involved in going out and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunting for these boxes.  Yes, it's important<br/>
&gt; &gt; they're put back in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; right places, etc but is this something that my<br/>
&gt; &gt; children and I should<br/>
&gt; &gt; not do together?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, I've never read anything about using trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; names except for on<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups.  Maybe like me they didn't know that you're<br/>
&gt; &gt; "supposed to" do<br/>
&gt; &gt; this.  It seems to me reading this series of posts<br/>
&gt; &gt; that geocaching and<br/>
&gt; &gt; such other similar activities are much more open to<br/>
&gt; &gt; a family friendly<br/>
&gt; &gt; environment.  Or maybe it's just this list.  Either<br/>
&gt; &gt; way I must say<br/>
&gt; &gt; it's a bit disheartening for someone who's just<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting involved in an<br/>
&gt; &gt; activity that my children and I viewed as<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenging and entertaining.<br/>
