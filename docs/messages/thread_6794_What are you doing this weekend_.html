We spent the day driving 3 hours to Tiptoe's parents to rake the last (?) of the leaves, then 3 hours back home..no letterboxing this day!  But, we did TALK about letterboxing to help us get through the task!...As far as "the party being over"...let us not forget that BINGO starts in 48 days!  A whole new party to look forward to!<br>
