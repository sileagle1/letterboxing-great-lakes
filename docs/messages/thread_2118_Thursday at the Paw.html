As Wisconsin Hiker reminded me, the clues for "No Clowning Around" are only<br>
available by asking me (not in the LbGLK files, LbNA or AQ).  Hint, hint -<br>
the box is not far from the Paw!  Ask now or forever kick yourself -- !<br>

Looks like we're going to shoot for 11 am, to make the most of the time<br>
they're open.  Got some RSVP's already - yay!<br>

<br>
Hey! Hey!  We're excited too!  It should be a great day:<br>
<br>
1.  Still lots of boxes for us to look for in the Brookfield, IL area<br>
2.  Visiting with some fellow boxers at lunch<br>
3.  Yummy dinner at Lao Sze Chuan in Westmont (We ate there during our last<br>
IL trip and it was delicious)<br>
<br>
Friday (and Saturday?) we'll probably be in the Northbrook-Lake Forest area.<br>
Does anyone have any restaurant recommendations if we decide to stay over<br>
Friday night?<br>
