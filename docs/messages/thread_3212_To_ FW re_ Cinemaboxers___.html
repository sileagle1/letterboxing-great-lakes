Maybe the two Cinemaboxers (plus Joel makes three) are out on the trails trying to find as many letterboxes and caches as possible before the deep snow comes.  Yes, that cold white stuff is on it's way again.  Then, we stop 'searching' for letterboxes and start  'digging'  for letterboxes; always a treat - NOT!  <br>
