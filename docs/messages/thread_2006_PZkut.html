                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have never used either of the PZcut products myself. I would highly recommend trying Speedball's Speedy Cut. It's off white in color, carves like butter and is reasonably priced. It comes in a variety of sizes and is about twice the thicknes of the orange PZcut. I've found it very satisfying to work with. I hope everyone is having a good weekend and has had time to go boxing. Also, for those of you who missed my last post there will be Minnesotas first ever gathering in May. The dates are Friday May 19th to Sunday May 21st. I hope to see you all there.<br>

<br>
I hate the stuff. I ordered 2 sheets of the A grade in the new orange.<br>
<br>
Their website says same as old white stuff.<br>
<br>
Don't believe them. I have been carving like crazy and the stuff is awful.<br>
<br>
I complained to Justin Pease and he sent me 2 sheets in B grade white for<br>
free - all I did was send the money for shipping.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Alafair stopped by our house a few nights ago and I showed her my carvings<br>
and the flaking problems I was having.<br>
<br>
She verified that the consistency was even different.<br>
<br>
I've been able to manage it by constantly changing my carving nibs to sharp<br>
one.<br>
<br>
Once it gone - I'm through with it!<br>

Way back when I first started using PZ Kut, the grade A was on <br>

<br>
carving material.  I couldn't really tell much difference and have <br>
<br>
been using grade B ever since and have been very happy with it.<br>

I was under the impression that the run on grade B at the time the <br>
orange grade A debutted just depleted his current stock, not used up <br>
the last he would ever have.  His bestsellers sidebar shows the <br>
grade B as the 2nd most popular item, so I assume he still carries <br>
it.  Will have to check for sure when he is back after 11/20.<br>
