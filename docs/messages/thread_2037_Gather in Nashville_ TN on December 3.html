Great Lakes region as I am to the LBSE, I'd send a quick note your <br>
way to let you know that there's a Gather in Nashville in just a <br>
couple weeks. There's more information on AtlasQuest's event planner, <br>
but here's the general information: <br>
<br>
<br>
Saturday, December 3, 2 p.m. until 9 p.m.<br>
<br>
Meet in the Opry Mills Mall at 2 p.m.<br>
Indoor boxing from 2:30 - 5:30.<br>
Regroup at 5:30 to move to a nearby restaurant. (Trying to reserve a <br>
room to ourselves this week). <br>
6:00 - 8:00ish supper, exchanges, event stamps, etc. <br>
8:00ish - Head back over to the Opryland Hotel to see the lights <br>
(which really are amazing and worth the trip in and of themselves). <br>
9:00 and on - Those who wish to can stay over and box into the night. <br>
There will be several boxes planted inside the Opryland <br>
Hotel...again, lots of lights, Christmas decorations, poinsettias, <br>
waterfalls, etc, etc, etc...  <br>
<br>
If you are interested, there are a few more details, hotel <br>
information, etc. on the AtlasQuest site...or just email me!<br>

<br>
I have just joined this group to get into on<br>
gatherings.  Would love to come to this one but am<br>
unable to plan a trip at this time.<br>
My family and I started casual letterboxing about 2<br>
years ago.  I've never been to an event but was hoping<br>
to get one have one in my area.  I see that yours is<br>
taking place in a mall which interest me since it is<br>
so cold here in the winter time.  Could you give me<br>
some tips on how to plan a Gathering and what to do at<br>
one.  <br>
