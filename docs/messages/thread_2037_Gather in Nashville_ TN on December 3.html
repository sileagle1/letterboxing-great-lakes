but here's the general information: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, December 3, 2 p.m. until 9 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
Meet in the Opry Mills Mall at 2 p.m.<br/>
Indoor boxing from 2:30 - 5:30.<br/>
Regroup at 5:30 to move to a nearby restaurant. (Trying to reserve a <br/>
room to ourselves this week). <br/>
6:00 - 8:00ish supper, exchanges, event stamps, etc. <br/>
8:00ish - Head back over to the Opryland Hotel to see the lights <br/>
(which really are amazing and worth the trip in and of themselves). <br/>
9:00 and on - Those who wish to can stay over and box into the night. <br/>
There will be several boxes planted inside the Opryland <br/>
Hotel...again, lots of lights, Christmas decorations, poinsettias, <br/>
waterfalls, etc, etc, etc...  <br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, there are a few more details, hotel <br/>
information, etc. on the AtlasQuest site...or just email me!<br/>

<br/>
I have just joined this group to get into on<br/>
gatherings.  Would love to come to this one but am<br/>
unable to plan a trip at this time.<br/>
My family and I started casual letterboxing about 2<br/>
years ago.  I've never been to an event but was hoping<br/>
to get one have one in my area.  I see that yours is<br/>
taking place in a mall which interest me since it is<br/>
so cold here in the winter time.  Could you give me<br/>
some tips on how to plan a Gathering and what to do at<br/>
one.  <br/>
