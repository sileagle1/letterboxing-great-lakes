                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, we had a good but looonnnggg day as well.<br/>
<br/>
We (me, wife and 4 under 5) made our annual trek to Freeport, IL a couple  <br/>
months earlier than usual (due to our scheduled trip to Oregon this June --  <br/>
which we may cancel due to our small 12 hour trial run of today). <br/>
<br/>
There are 21 boxes in Stephenson County, I knew I shouldn't set my goals to  <br/>
high so I was figuring maybe 15 or so LOL.<br/>
<br/>
We found our first box right out of the shoot (well, after the 2 1/2 hours  <br/>
it took us to get there), and bonus, there was a H.H. inside :-)<br/>
<br/>
We then realized our gas tank was in the red, and I missed the oh so  obvious <br/>
straight into town route and swung ourselves 7 miles out of our way on  the <br/>
bypass. No sweat mates, we made it :-)<br/>
<br/>
Next stop was Union Dairy for some oh so good ice cream and a little  history <br/>
with Debate Square where Lincoln/Douglas had their second debate. <br/>
<br/>
Next was Krape Park, a favorite part of our trip and now that we have  <br/>
letterboxing in our blood there are 6 boxes in the one park!!!! But alas, the  park <br/>
was under some MAJOR overhauling and we were only able to find 1 of the 6.  <br/>
This in part because our crew was getting hungry and apparently ice cream isn't  <br/>
enough for brunch to hold us until dinner. Aside from only finding 1 box the  <br/>
waterfall (man made) was shut down, the ducks weren't out to feed  &amp; the <br/>
carousel wasn't running yet (did I mention we went a  couple months earlier than <br/>
usual -- and now we have 6 hungry crabby  people?)<br/>
<br/>
Three hours after we arrived and we had a grand total of 3 stamps found  <br/>
(including a HH). We met some local boxers at Krape Park, River Rat and Nature  <br/>
Nerd and on their suggestion we were going to eat in Lena a short ways off, but  <br/>
first I wanted to plant a box in Freeport -- not a wise move with a  <br/>
hungry/crabby crew on hand . . . I was sweatin' bullets imagining that I was  looking <br/>
like a rack of lamb in the eyes of my sweet adorable children.<br/>
<br/>
I did plant the box, not happy with the spot but it will have to do until  <br/>
next year.<br/>
<br/>
Off to dinner we went, mmmmmmmmmm sweat salvation. <br/>
<br/>
After diner we found 6 more boxes for a total of 9 finds (including HH) and  <br/>
1 plant. Now, children are asleep and mom and I are turning in as well.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. every time I typed the word "crabby" in the above Email I first  typed <br/>
it up with "pp's" instead of "bb's" changes the whole meaning. I'm just  glad <br/>
the whole day turned around and it didn't totally go down the crapper  LOL<br/>

project out in California for the last 9 weeks (with at least 2 more <br/>
weeks to go). This has limited our boxing activities.   However I am <br/>
home this weekend and with the good weather forecast, we planned to <br/>
take care of some odds and ends on Saturday and then spend all day <br/>
Sunday doing some boxing.   However when the Princess Bride series <br/>
was posted last night, we decided to skip the gym this morning and do <br/>
some boxing instead.  It was a perfect morning - great temperatures, <br/>
sand hill cranes in the fields, lots of birds twittering and NO <br/>
mosquitos!  In addition to the Pricess Bride series, we also found <br/>
the Witch's Lair and checked on my Skating box (that was the <br/>
only "not so great" part of the day).<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to another fun day tomorrow as we head north for <br/>
several boxes.<br/>

We all applaud your wonderful accomplishments yesterday!!!  Sadly, I <br/>
still have strings of lights outside that need removing.  I do believe <br/>
you have served as motivation for me to not be tempted to hunt boxes <br/>
today and instead keep my letterboxing addiction under control--for at <br/>
least today?!  So thank you for that!!  :)<br/>
<br/>
My yesterday was great also, but only indirectly, did it have to do with <br/>
letterboxing.  We had an awesome "Showcase of Scouting" event for Cub <br/>
Scouts and Boy Scouts which included a district pinewood derby car race, <br/>
a reenactment team that fired muskets, muzzleloaders and cannons, a <br/>
70-foot suspended all-rope bridge, blow darts, tomahawk throwing, some <br/>
AWESOME dutch oven cooking of hawaiian chicken, pies, pork and more, <br/>
archery, leatherworking and tons more.  We were able to recruit 15 brand <br/>
news scouts and over 75 boys and their families had the best of times <br/>
experiencing all of these various stations. <br/>
<br/>
(Since I was free to take all the promotional photos and promote <br/>
scouting all day long, I was also free to promote letterboxing to those <br/>
I felt would be good and stealthy candidates!  I also used some of my <br/>
carved stamps to stamp the scouts hands, depending on which events they <br/>
attended yesterday!)  I love it that many of us can find ways to combine <br/>
our passions!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also had a great Saturday.  We've never ended up in<br/>
The Pit of Despair when letterboxing with Dragon, even<br/>
while finding the Princess Bride series and the Kanji<br/>
box. We went on to study some mysteries in time and<br/>
from there moved on to find 3 mysteries. Then we<br/>
finally found a friendly ghost who for some reason<br/>
stump "a math teacher, and art teacher, and a<br/>
journalist" at the Haunted Harvest Gathering.  We<br/>
traveled to an enchanted valley with a pond where<br/>
where we pondered our dreams.  We went to look for a<br/>
president also, but had old clues.  Right clues, right<br/>
park, wrong time.   :)  That was our great day.  Would<br/>
love to do it again today, but have decided it is more<br/>
important to get some landscaping done and the cars<br/>
washed.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, Deedle &amp; I took advantage of the great weather<br/>
this weekend, too.  Around this time of year we like<br/>
to do a three-day weekend trip to somewhere nearby,<br/>
but funds weren't as forthcoming this year, so we<br/>
proclaimed Saturday "Vacation at Home" day.  The day<br/>
started with breakfast at the local IHOP ('cause<br/>
Deedle had never eaten at one before).  Then we were<br/>
going to visit the Baseball As America traveling<br/>
exhibit from Cooperstown that's in town this summer<br/>
before visiting a park for some letterboxing, but we<br/>
had gotten a late start and decided it was too nice a<br/>
day to be inside, so the baseball exhibit was skipped.<br/>
 We finally finished the Who's Afraid of Ghosts series<br/>
that had been planted for the 2005 Lake Eeerie<br/>
Gathering (well, what was still left of the series -<br/>
hard to believe it took us so long to get back to that<br/>
park!).  We also attempted a few other area boxes to<br/>
no avail (our letterboxing skills must be very rusty),<br/>
but it was still a great day to be outside - and we<br/>
still had ice cream, the cure all for everything ;)<br/>
<br/>
Sunday was yard work day - and oh, how we worked in<br/>
that yard!  We had a flower garden that had become<br/>
overrun with weeds that we basically gutted.  Those<br/>
roots run deep, literally!<br/>

but my daughter "Agnes" did an awesome job in her events placing 1st and <br/>
6th. We did manage to get out and find a few drive by boxes in the Chicago <br/>
Suburbs. We found our 1st holy grail box and visited our 1st hitchhiker <br/>
hostel. When we arrived home, we were happy to see that our boxes in <br/>
Princeton were visited by a few people this past week. We are hoping to plan <br/>
a 3 day boxing trip to Columbia, MO soon. My brother-in-law grew up there <br/>
and he said the area is gorgeous and, of course, there are a bunch of boxes <br/>
(124 to be exact) to search for. Isn't letterboxing grand!!<br/>
