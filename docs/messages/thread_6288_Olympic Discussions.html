                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone. If you are new to the talk that is going on on this board about the Olympics and such, please be aware that it is in context to a winter mystery letterboxing event being held in Michigan in February. Some of the talk may possibly be seen as derogatory and a bit mean spirited, however, I would just like to say it isn't. Comments, websites, and such are not meant that way or to make anyone feel uncomfortable. Heck, we even welcome you to participate! <br>
<br>
However, if the line does get crossed, please, let us know. Speaking for myself (and most likely much of those involved in this), we would never intend to make anyone feel uncomfortable in any way.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, we hope you are having some fun during this dreary winter season with the anticipation building up to the Olympic Event. If you haven't signed up and would like to, be go to this link:  http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=1551<br>
<br>
I, for one, am looking forward to meeting everyone and having a whole lot of fun with this event (and you should too, because who knows what "mystery" is in store) wink...wink...;-)<br>

We are not located in the Great Lakes region but did subscribe to this list some time back to keep up with news in case we did get a chance to venture that way on a Letterboxing adventure.  I've thoroughly enjoyed this group for many reasons over the months for the lively banter between friends. And have especially enjoyed this thread concerning the "Olympics" you have planned. It has been a lot of fun to read about the various teams & has been quite entertaining during these cold winter months. Wish we were closer & maybe we would participate too lol.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for your comment!  I have been very pleased with the Great Lakes<br>
group over the years and proud of the fact that we are still a very vibrant<br>
and thriving board.  I also subscribe to many different message boards and<br>
the only ones that still have very active and tight-knit groups are the<br>
Mid-Atlantic, Texas and Great Lakes groups.  Thanks also to all the rest of<br>
you on this board who contribute to the fun!<br>
