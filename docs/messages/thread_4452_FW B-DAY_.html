It's easier to find some really difficult letterboxes than to get FW to fess up and tell us the date of her birthday.  <br/>
It's not like we're asking for the YEAR she was born.  Who can remember back that far ago in time anyway.  LOL!  <br/>

  &gt; I am thinking of putting together a mini-meet for October. Here <br/>
  is <br/>
  &gt; the synopsis:<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; October is national popcorn month, national desert month, and <br/>
  national <br/>
  &gt; pizza month so I am thinking of putting together a mini meet around <br/>
  &gt; those themes. It would start off with us meeting for popcorn and <br/>
  a <br/>
  &gt; movie at our downtown theater, The Majestic. After the movie we <br/>
  could <br/>
  &gt; go the ice cream parlor across the street for some letterboxing <br/>
  &gt; activities, or if I can get the community center at our city hall <br/>
  we <br/>
  &gt; could go there for letterboxing and everyone pitch in $5 for pizza, <br/>
  or <br/>
  &gt; the third option go to the community center and everyone brings a <br/>
  &gt; desert dish to pass. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I am waiting for the owner/operator of the theater to post his <br/>
  October <br/>
  &gt; movie showings and then will go from there as far as scheduling, <br/>
  etc.<br/>
