we spent the whole day up in the Wadsworth IL/Kenosha WI area <br>
letterboxing.  Almost a perfect LBig day...except for the wind and <br>

<br>
We would've had more time if..Tiptoe hadn't lost our logbook at a <br>
box and Tonto had to go back for it...And, to prove that she isn't <br>
the only forgetful one, we had to waste 30 more minutes to go back <br>
to the restaurant where we ate lunch to fetch Tonto's jacket!<br>
<br>
We were at the Jelly Belly factory where Tonto had stubornly gone to <br>
the "tree" to look for the hidden box without the clue sheet while <br>
Tiptoe stayed in the car.  He had been looking for a very long time, <br>
when she got annoyed and told him to, "just forget it!"<br>
"Fine! he huffed.  YOU get out and fight the wind and look in the <br>
millions of roots for it.  <br>
Which she stubbornly did while he drove around the block.  She had <br>
just gotten out of the car and was muttering to herself (things not <br>
appropriate for this audience!), when two people in a car pulled up <br>
and rolled down their window with obvious smirks on their faces.<br>
"Hey Tiptoe, are you looking for a box?" they said.<br>
When she looked up she felt like AAA had sent out their best and <br>
brightest emergency letterboxing recovery team...the Leapin' <br>
Lizards!  They got out of the car and literally walked over to the <br>
correct spot and produced the box in a matter of seconds!<br>
Oh happy day!<br>
<br>
We found a possum either playing dead, or REALLY dead, inches away <br>
from a box!  That was a first!<br>
<br>
We were mistaken for Carthage College parents (football fans) as we <br>
stopped to sing the National anthem at their football game while <br>
looking for Hiker Babe's stamp.  The coolest part of this box was <br>
stamping in on the beach while sitting on a "stone sofa" overlooking <br>
Lake Michigan...the coolest stamping spot ever!<br>
<br>
We would like to especially thank CinemaBoxers for some very fine <br>
stamps and spots!  Throw in boxes by Leapin' Lizards, Atom 118, <br>
Hiker Babe, and adventureteam which all added up to us finding 21 <br>

By the way, we're planning to "head south" this weekend to track down <br>
some of the newer IL boxes.  Luckily there are a bunch not too far from <br>
the WI border since I don't have any vacation days left and therefore <br>
no more "long weekends"!<br>
