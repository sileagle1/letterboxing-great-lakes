them today and see that the last seekers that logged a status also <br>
were unsuccessful (back in January).  They show being planted by two <br>
different people, but the clues are written similarly, so it seems as <br>
if they may be one and the same, or friends, etc.<br>
<br>
Just curious if these boxes are indeed intact or missing.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi SpringChick, we found these two boxes about a year ago on a trip to <br>
Michigan.  It does look like the clues are written by two members of a <br>
family.  The box packing, stamps, and logbook styles appeared to be <br>
made by the same person, two family members, or two close friends.<br>
