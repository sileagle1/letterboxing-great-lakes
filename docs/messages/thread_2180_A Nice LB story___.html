with everyone. It may qualify for the 'You know your obsessed <br/>

<br/>
This past Sunday, I was gathered in Illinois with my extended family <br/>
(I'm from Michigan) to celebrate my Grandma's life. She was a really <br/>
special lady, a major part of my life, an incredible woman, and she <br/>
passed away on Thursday, January 12th. <br/>
<br/>
My mom had suggested I bring my letterboxing equipment with me, as <br/>
you never know what may happen. She knew I was on box #99, just <br/>
waiting for #100. <br/>
<br/>
As it happened, my Grandpa (a wonderful man who is very set in his <br/>
ways), was a little tired and overwhelmed from all the activity and <br/>
people who had decended into his life since Grandma's passing. On <br/>
Sunday afternoon, it became clear that he needed some quiet time (to <br/>
watch college basketball, do the crossword puzzzle, and take his <br/>
Sunday afternoon nap). So I went out with two of my sisters and <br/>
three of my female cousins (who had heard about LB-ing and were <br/>
anxious to try it) to find a series that was planted in Champaign. <br/>
If you live in that area of Illinois, you may remember the sunshine <br/>
and warm temperatures of Sunday and Monday. <br/>
<br/>
Now, that's the part of this story that could sound a little selfish <br/>
and obsessive (and my friends will tell you that I do have a little <br/>
bit of an obsessive mind!); but what happened was a really lovely <br/>
experience. <br/>
<br/>
In the process of searching for this 6 box series, 6 family members <br/>
from the age of 10 to 36, from two different states, and in several <br/>
different phases of life, were able to gather together and spend an <br/>
afternoon together. We caught up on what was happening in each <br/>
other's lives, remembered Grandma (remembering stories that we all <br/>
knew, and sharing some stories for the first time). We initiated the <br/>
youngest (Gracie) into the odd society that is the women in our <br/>
family (starting with our mothers and their cousins - the original <br/>
Moo Mau Chorus Girls!) and grew closer together as sisters and <br/>
cousins.<br/>
<br/>
I know it's exactly what Grandma would have wanted - all of us <br/>
gathered together having fun (not sitting around being sad and <br/>
upsetting Grandpa) and being important to each other. If Grandma was <br/>
nothing else, she was family. She lived for her family and left a <br/>
huge legacy (16 grandchildren and 4 greats). <br/>
<br/>
And now, we all (who sometimes tend to be too busy, too involved in <br/>
our own lives, too fill-in-the-blank) have a really special memory <br/>
of time spent together in laughter, joy, and celebration in the <br/>
midst of our sadness. <br/>
<br/>
I loved my Grandma dearly, and wasn't sure how I would make it <br/>
through this weekend (which was a long time coming), and here this <br/>
odd little hobby of looking for plastic in the woods brought <br/>
together the elements of comfort and family that provided the <br/>
strength I needed (and didn't think I had within myself). What an <br/>
unexpected but welcome gift!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I found my 100th box (am up to 104) and have a special page <br/>
dedicated to this day and my Grandma Cromlich, complete with inked <br/>
thumbprints of all my cousins and sisters who shared the search with <br/>
me! There's even been talk of planting a box for Grandma - no for <br/>
sure plans yet, but the wheels are turning!<br/>

I remember how sad it was when my last grandmother passed away and would have loved to have a warm, happy memory of her passing. Not only did you grow closer to your family but you probably inspired some of your relatives to start boxing ;) Take care, and God Bless you and your family.<br/>
<br/>
  P.S. If you don't have plans the 19th-21st of May come to MN. we are having our first ever gathering! Tell all your boxing friends about it and check out my post from yesterday, hope to see you there!!!<br/>
