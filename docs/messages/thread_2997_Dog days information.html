thought I would do an additional message to make sure everyone got the <br/>
word. <br/>
<br/>
The Dog Days mini gathering is at the Ft. Custer Recreational Area in <br/>
Augusta, MI  between Kalamzoo and Battle Creek. We are meeting at the <br/>
Whitford lake picnic shelter. There will be signs to help you navigate. <br/>
Meeting time is 1:00 pm. There are 58 miles of trails and several nice <br/>
boxes already planted by some of our members. So be sure and bring your <br/>
clues to these boxes. I have also planted several boxes in honor of <br/>
this event plus an event stamp just for spending the day with us.  I <br/>
will bring the clues to these boxes. <br/>
<br/>
There is camping available here if you wish to stay and spend the <br/>
weekend letterboxing or just visiting Battle Creek or Kzoo.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some new faces along with some regulars!<br/>
