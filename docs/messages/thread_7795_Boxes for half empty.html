Since I am currently in the area and enjoying some of those plants, I would like to do my part as well. I would be planting the boxes in Montana just to the north of him on my return trip. If you would like to contribute a box, please contact me directly through this group or AQ and I can send you a mailing address in ID I will be staying at for about two weeks.  I would need the boxes pretty soon, so you should send then within a week.<br>
