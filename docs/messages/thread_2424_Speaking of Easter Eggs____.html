We were hoping someone else would answer this because we didn't time <br/>
the walk.  We are merely guessing and may be off because we know <br/>
exactly where the eggs are, we placed them.  We don't have to take <br/>
time reading clues, hunting around, stamping, replacing, etc. etc. <br/>
<br/>
We are guesstimating that it might take about 45 minutes to do our <br/>
eggs.  The first 7 are concentrated in one area and its easy to <br/>
collect all 7 and then stamp in and replace them when you're done.  <br/>
There's no logbook in the first 7 boxes, the logbook is only in the <br/>
last box.  The second 7 eggs are a little more spread out than the <br/>
first ones, but they still be able to be collected and then stamped in <br/>
and then replaced.  <br/>
<br/>
Our 45 minute time is a long estimate, but again we're merely <br/>
guessing.  We hope that you have time to do them.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone who's done the eggs that did keep track of time?<br/>

one was around.  It wasn't exactly raining, but close to it with <br/>
drizzle, so I sent Tonto off to find them, and he dutifully would <br/>
bring them to me sitting in the car to stamp in. This only worked for <br/>
the first general location!  I actually had to get out with him to do <br/>
the remaining!  Can you imagine?  (It had been a long, hard day of <br/>
boxin' by that point!) He did a lot more scurrying than I did!<br/>
