Let finding the park be part of the clues.  Just give the name of the park.<br>
Or give the coordinates and let folks figure it out that way.<br>

As far as a direct answer goes -- many parks have an address someplace<br>

give you an address.<br>

This isn't a direct answer to your question but do you really need a map?<br>
Let finding the park be part of the clues. Just give the name of the park.<br>
Or give the coordinates and let folks figure it out that way.<br>
<br>
As far as a direct answer goes -- many parks have an address someplace<br>
online. If you google the park, you might bring up references that will<br>
