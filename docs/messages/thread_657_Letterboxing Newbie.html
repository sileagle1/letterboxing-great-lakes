                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to say how much I am enjoying this new outdoor activity.  <br>
I am part of a group of retired teachers that go by the name <br>
of "WonderBroads of Grand Ledge" when we are "stalking the wild <br>
letterboxes."  We spent a week in the UP last month and "stalked" on <br>
the way to the cabin and again on the way back down state.  Needless <br>
to say, we are hooked.  Of course, as a former teacher, I can't help <br>
but see what a great activity letterboxing would be as a class <br>
project.  I can just see the students learning about the area, <br>
developing their own clues, publishing them in the school newsletter, <br>
making their boxes, placing them around their local neighborhood or <br>
community.  Ah yes, old teachers never die, they just lose their <br>
class.  lol.  Anyway, Thanks Spring Chick for you wonderful clues.  <br>
Your background historical information pertaining to the area of the <br>
boxes really enriches the experience.  Best regards to all fellow <br>
letterboxers, and I hope you are having as much fun as we are when <br>
we "stalk the wild letterboxes."<br>

You don't happen to be the teachers who "rescued" us on their way to their cabin in the woods around Harlow Lake a few weeks ago?  We were looking for Leapin' Lizards' "Hogback Mountain" box near Marquette and got hopelessly lost in the woods!  We had a wonderful excursion in the U.P. that week!!!  --Papeseed (Jean, Mike & Escher)<br>
