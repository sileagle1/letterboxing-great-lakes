You don't happen to be the teachers who "rescued" us on their way to their cabin in the woods around Harlow Lake a few weeks ago?  We were looking for Leapin' Lizards' "Hogback Mountain" box near Marquette and got hopelessly lost in the woods!  We had a wonderful excursion in the U.P. that week!!!  --Papeseed (Jean, Mike &amp; Escher)<br/>
