<br>
On a serious note here (for once, for me):  My husband and I are planning to<br>
attend the 10th anniversary gathering in October at Whitefish Dunes SP.  We<br>
have a dog,  she's about 40 lbs and a Shepherd/Shiba Inu/Chow/Dingo mix (as<br>

and our frequent companion letterboxing.<br>
<br>
We would love to bring her to the gathering -- she is very friendly with<br>
people, excellent with children.  If there is food nearby she will beg<br>
shamelessly.  :-)  She is not voice controlled, and so we NEVER allow her<br>
off her leash or out of our control.  We'd enjoy having her with us on the<br>
trails.<br>
<br>
However -- I know that many people are quite afraid of dogs, or very<br>
uncomfortable around them.  I wanted to ask everyone who is attending if<br>
they are comfortable with our dog attending, or they prefer that she remain<br>
with her grandma here in Milwaukee.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to e-mail me privately with questions or with your<br>

pet-free weekend.<br>

thanks so much.<br>

Sorry, this is very funny for my husband and I -- I saw this when it was<br>
originally posted.  I checked it out.  Nala spectacularly flunks rule number<br>
four:<br>
<br>
_____  My dog will always display good conduct according to the Dog Scout<br>
Laws, never<br>
            chasing wildlife or  causing a disturbance.<br>
<br>
We were out letterboxing and Nala saw a deer.  She immediately let out with<br>
a Shiba Inu screech, dove after the deer, off the trail, through the<br>
underbrush, until her leash extended out to its full 26 feet, wrapped around<br>
my legs, tripped me, and left a massive bruise behind my knees.  She then<br>
continued to pull at the leash for the next 20 minutes, attempting in vain<br>
to find that GIGANTIC BUNNY!<br>
<br>
She's a rez dog.  We're just grateful she doesn't pee in the house.<br>
<br>
Unlike my ungrateful cats.<br>
