Saturday. Let the boxing season begin. No snow on the ground in <br/>
Schaumburg, IL. Had so much fun geting back into the swing of it that I <br/>
went to looking for another box today. It was in the neighboorhood that <br/>
I live and I found befor but I just wanted to look for another one that <br/>
would be a quick find.<br/>
