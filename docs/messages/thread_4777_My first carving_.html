                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes.  Letters are tricky.  Some of my stamp images are fairly intricate and somewhat impressive...but I HATE doing letters because I'm rarely happy with how they turn out.  Part of the problem is that everyone knows what the alphabet is supposed to look like...so when you make a little mistake on a letter it becomes glaring and you feel like everyone will notice it as much as you do.  Other images are more abstract and even if you make a mistake most people won't even notice because who's to say that it wasn't supposed to be that way?  Just keep practicing, it'll get better.  At least that's what I keep telling myself anyway.<br/>

trouble.....<br/>
But the thing that has made the most difference and that no one <br/>
mentioned is getting a magnifying glass, a big one!  Wow what a <br/>
difference!  I got one that is on a base, from the Ott Lite series <br/>
(wait for a 40% off sale or coupon!!! otherwise too pricey.)  <br/>
The other item that has helped me with carving is a LazySusan <br/>
clipboard. I double stick my caring medium to the board, and spin as <br/>
needed.  I think they are still available from Alextamping.com. I don't <br/>
think they come with the clip anymore, but you don't need that for <br/>
carving. <br/>
I also use micro wood carving tools.... I get them at a wood carving <br/>
show.  But you can probably order them online.  There's a WoodCarvers <br/>
store in Peoria IL. if that helps any. <br/>
<br/>
I'v only cared about 7 stamps so far, so i am by no means an expert, <br/>
These are just the things that have helped me so far. <br/>

Congrats on the first carve, beware though IT'S ADDICTING!! Soon you will  <br/>
try to one-up yourself as far as detail etc.<br/>
<br/>
Lettering, well, I'm not sure that I've *ever* heard anyone say that they  <br/>
"love" to carve letters. They seem to be the most dreaded part of any stamp  <br/>
image to carve for veteran carvers as well as those new to carving. Just take  <br/>
your time, carve out the centers first, and use *really* shallow cuts.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons I hate carving letters, (aside from the point already  <br/>
mentioned that "everyone knows what letters look like, therefore they can spot  <br/>
errors easily") is that letters are spaced so closely to each other,  there's <br/>
really very little room to work. <br/>
<br/>
Just keep at it . . . carve carve carve! And with all that carving,  enjoy <br/>
enjoy enjoy!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To add to what Fungus Woman has said about carving details (letters, eyes, etc.) first...  Carving the inside of the letters before the outside makes a difference especially with small letters because once you carve the outside, the area is more flimsy and getting an exact carve on the inside is more difficult.  Also, to help get letters uniform height (assuming of course that the font you are using is meant to be evenly spaced), before beginning individual letters, I carve a straight line across the top of all letters -- actually two lines, one that runs across the top of things like "o" and "n" and "r" and then a second that runs across the top of caps and letters with tall extensions like "l" and "f" and "d".  I then do the same thing on the bottom of the letters.  This helps to keep them an even height.  You would think that wouldn't be difficult to do since you have the outline to follow, but when carving individual letters, it is easy to stray a little and end up with some letters that are a little taller than others.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it has been said many times, many places, but holds very true when carving letters -- kind of goes with the lazy susan idea -- to get nice smooth curves on letters (and your images), instead of pushing your tool, keep the hand with the carving tool still and rotate the piece of carving material as needed.  You will get a much smoother cut that way.<br/>
<br/>
The reason to carve details first?  Does it really make a difference in the difficulty of the carving process?  No, but you get the most tedious parts out of the way and also, since these are the things you are most likely to mess up, if you do really mess it up, you can start on a new stamp without throwing out hours of time that might have been spent had you done the other areas first.<br/>

&gt; Lettering, well, I'm not sure that I've *ever* heard anyone say <br/>
that they  <br/>
&gt; "love" to carve letters. They seem to be the most dreaded part of <br/>
any stamp  <br/>
&gt; image to carve for veteran carvers as well as those new to <br/>
carving. Just take  <br/>
&gt; your time, carve out the centers first, and use *really* shallow <br/>
cuts.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; One of the reasons I hate carving letters, (aside from the point <br/>
already  <br/>
&gt; mentioned that "everyone knows what letters look like, therefore <br/>
they can spot  <br/>
&gt; errors easily") is that letters are spaced so closely to each <br/>
other,  there's <br/>
&gt; really very little room to work. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Just keep at it . . . carve carve carve! And with all that <br/>
carving,  enjoy <br/>
&gt; enjoy enjoy!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Once my husband was having a magnetic sign made for his truck, and they were using those peel-and-stick letters on the magnet material.  I noticed that the round letters looked too big compared to the rest, and as I saw them being placed against guide lines, much like SC describes, you could definitely see the "O"s, "G"s, etc were larger.  The signmaker explained that visually they will look too small when viewing the completed words if they actually were the same size, so they do make those letters a bit larger.  Most of the time it won't make a big difference in a stamp, but it is something to keep in mind.<br/>

To add to what Fungus Woman has said about carving details (letters, eyes, etc.) first...  Carving the inside of the letters before the outside makes a difference especially with small letters because once you carve the outside, the area is more flimsy and getting an exact carve on the inside is more difficult.  Also, to help get letters uniform height (assuming of course that the font you are using is meant to be evenly spaced), before beginning individual letters, I carve a straight line across the top of all letters -- actually two lines, one that runs across the top of things like "o" and "n" and "r" and then a second that runs across the top of caps and letters with tall extensions like "l" and "f" and "d".  I then do the same thing on the bottom of the letters.  This helps to keep them an even height.  You would think that wouldn't be difficult to do since you have the outline to follow, but when carving individual letters, it is easy to stray a<br/>
 little and end up with some letters that are a little taller than others.<br/>
