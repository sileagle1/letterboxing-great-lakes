<br>
For those of you who missed the St. Nick's Gathering, you can have a <br>
second chance at my box "The December Dilemma" as well as a modified <br>
version of the anchor stamp to Atom's "Holiday Exchange HH Hostel" in <br>
north Chicago.  As an added bonus, we also planted an additional series <br>
entitled "Festival of Lights" with stamps carved by Atom in the same <br>
preserve.  These boxes will be available for a limited time -- probably <br>
until January 14th, depending on weather and our schedules.<br>
<br>
Also planted this weekend was a replacement box to Atom's "Memories of <br>
the White City" series in south Chicago.  One box in the series went <br>
missing around August/Sept, and the other 2 were retired due to downed <br>
trees from a storm this fall.  Anyway, this is a new stamp with updated <br>
clues, so even if you found the series before, feel free to come back <br>
again. :)<br>
<br>
And with these recent plants, I'm happy to report we made it above <br>
PFX500!  Specifically P40, F389, X72... but who's counting? ;)<br>
<br>
Enjoy the boxes and happy holidays!<br>
