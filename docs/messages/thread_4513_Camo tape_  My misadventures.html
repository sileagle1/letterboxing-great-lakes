Hey Bali,<br>
<br>
Maybe you already did this, but did you ask at the Army surplus store??  <br>
Often they sell camo tape in flattened packs and then it comes packaged <br>
so that it can be hung on a hook.  What is nice is then you can buy an <br>
extra package and keep it in your arsenal of backpack supplies. <br>
<br>
Just a thought....<br>

WI - They had a very minimal hunting department, no tape to be seen.  :(<br>

In the instructions to make pouches on AQ, it shows cutting the camo <br>
tape while it is stuck onto a cutting board with a straight edge.  Maybe <br>
that will help.   I have also found (cause I'm pretty sure I know which <br>
annoying tape you are trying to use too) that if you wipe your blade <br>
periodically with goo-gone it helps a little bit.  I'm in the process of <br>
using mine up this evening.  It does stick pretty well when doing these <br>
pouches......??? <br>

can't find any such instructions.  Can you direct me where to look?<br>

LMAO  You may be right!  I don't think we live in the same state, but <br>
maybe she was here for a visit!   I really don't think they had any, <br>
there weren't any empty spots on the shelf. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well...............I do have 2 extra rolls of it that I picked up fairly<br>
recently at the Walmart in Villa Park.<br>
<br>
I won't be using it anymore this year -- ended up with all my boxes covered<br>
and these 2 rolls left over.  If anyone needs it for this year and is having<br>
trouble finding it, I'll gladly just stick these 2 rolls in a small box and<br>
mail it out parcel post/standard mail......free of charge.......because now<br>
I feel guilty.......  :-)  I'll have to drop over there and see if they have<br>
anymore.  At the time, I DID tell 'em to reorder it.  Really truly I DID.<br>
<br>
I went in there once myself to buy it and got told by a young man that<br>
someone else had been there the day before and bought 5 rolls of it, and he<br>
couldn't figure out what the heck for.  I've gotta say, I've never bought<br>
FIVE rolls at once.  But I have bought four.<br>
<br>
I don't know if it was a letterboxer, a hunter, or just a guy who wanted to<br>
dress up in camotape for Halloween who bought the 5 rolls.  The young man<br>
said the guy was about 40 years old, tall, and skinny, crew cut hair,<br>
wearing blue jeans, t-shirt, and work boots.  So that could fit a lot of<br>
folks.  I said I was amazed he remember the guy so well.  The young man<br>
replied that he was a little worried that the guy might be a terrorist of<br>
some sort.  yikes.  Had to wonder if that's the impression that I give when<br>
I'm buying the tape?   Would a fat, bald, old lady with rolls of camotape in<br>
her arms appear to be a terrorist?  :-)<br>
<br>
So, anyway, Bali, if you would like a couple of free rolls, email me.  :-)<br>
Or if Bali doesn't need it, maybe someone else does.<br>

Oh-oh!  Am I supposed to feel guilty about buying all 6 small Lock'n'Locks that Target had on their shelf this week? <br>
The most rolls of camo tape I have bought at one time is also 4, but I usually stop by more than once in the hunting season to get some.  Since it is a "seasonal" item I always feel a need to stock up, because you just never know how much we might need during the year.  That reminds me that I'd better check our current supply to figure out if I should buy some more before they disappear!<br>

I don't know why I've never felt any guilt over the tape but I do over the<br>
Lock'n'Locks.  I always leave one at Target for the next person.......  :-)<br>

Being as I am the one who "blamed" you, I now feel bad. <br>
<br>
I never ment to make you feel guilty! I was just jabbin' ya in good clean good fun . . . I know if I had the $$ I would go and buy Wal-Mart out myself (who cares if I make it to the FBI's Top most wanted list).<br>
<br>
Anyway, if buying camo tape makes us suspicious . . .? what about when we are walking through the woods looking for a hiding spot for a small box wrapped in the stuff? hmmm.<br>

Well...............I do have 2 extra rolls of it that I picked up fairly<br>
recently at the Walmart in Villa Park.<br>
<br>
I won't be using it anymore this year -- ended up with all my boxes covered<br>
and these 2 rolls left over. If anyone needs it for this year and is having<br>
trouble finding it, I'll gladly just stick these 2 rolls in a small box and<br>
mail it out parcel post/standard mail......free of charge.......because now<br>
I feel guilty....... :-) I'll have to drop over there and see if they have<br>
anymore. At the time, I DID tell 'em to reorder it. Really truly I DID.<br>
<br>
I went in there once myself to buy it and got told by a young man that<br>
someone else had been there the day before and bought 5 rolls of it, and he<br>
couldn't figure out what the heck for. I've gotta say, I've never bought<br>
FIVE rolls at once. But I have bought four.<br>
<br>
I don't know if it was a letterboxer, a hunter, or just a guy who wanted to<br>
dress up in camotape for Halloween who bought the 5 rolls. The young man<br>
said the guy was about 40 years old, tall, and skinny, crew cut hair,<br>
wearing blue jeans, t-shirt, and work boots. So that could fit a lot of<br>
folks. I said I was amazed he remember the guy so well. The young man<br>
replied that he was a little worried that the guy might be a terrorist of<br>
some sort. yikes. Had to wonder if that's the impression that I give when<br>
I'm buying the tape? Would a fat, bald, old lady with rolls of camotape in<br>
her arms appear to be a terrorist? :-)<br>
<br>
So, anyway, Bali, if you would like a couple of free rolls, email me. :-)<br>
Or if Bali doesn't need it, maybe someone else does.<br>

Perhaps you got to the Wal-Mart just after Mosey had been there, I think<br>
the<br>
quote is, "It's available all<br>
year round but every so often someone (like me) will go in and buy them<br>
out,"<br>

Anyone having any kind of a "letterboxing charity raffle"?  With how scarce<br>
this stuff is in some areas, rolls of camo-tape might make a decent small<br>
raffle prize.  :-)<br>
