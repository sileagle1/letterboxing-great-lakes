Looks like none of them are in the area I am traveling, but I had to say,<br>
you guys have some awesome mystery boxes!  I will definitely be planning a<br>
boxing vacation in Michigan some day.  Clever clues and great locations, on<br>
the ones I could decipher, lol.  <br>

Didn't mean to overlook your boxes-they were listed in the region instead of<br>
under Michigan Mystery..sorry!!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You can bet I am working on those clues as well!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
BTW, how long are you in the Greater Cinci area?  We should definitely meet<br>
for an exchange!<br>
