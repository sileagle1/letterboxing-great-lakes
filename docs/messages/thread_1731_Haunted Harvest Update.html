<br>
The Haunted Harvest Gathering on Saturday OCT 1 is only 6 weeks away, and<br>
I've begun receiving boxes from some out-of-towners.  We'll have a nice<br>
variety of boxes at the event.  In addition to the circus, we'll have some<br>
boxes created for the event from the east coast, the west coast and from the<br>
heart of Texas!  If you'd still like to contribute a box, please let me know<br>
ASAP, especially if you want me to plant it for you.<br>
<br>
I've updated the website www.hauntedharvest.homestead.com to show the<br>
current list of boxes, attendees and potluck items expected. I've also added<br>
a FAQ section which may be useful, especially if you've never been to an<br>
event before.  It also includes some info re: camping and hotels.<br>
<br>
Feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions or suggestions.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to a hauntingly good time!<br>
<br>
