                    <div class="plaintext-content">In the past there have been occasional comments about geocachers on<br/>
this list. I want to report that I recently received a very friendly<br/>
message from a cacher who found one of my letterboxes. He 'stumbled'<br/>
upon a bonus box and after borrowing a stamp from another cacher and<br/>
stamping in, he contacted me. He was very respectful of letterboxing<br/>
and was curious about why he couldn't find the clues to the box he'd<br/>
found. He apparently went on the various clue sites and searched. But,<br/>
of course, since it's a bonus, there were no online clues. He wants to<br/>
find the main box now.<br/>
But he's left with a "reverse-challenge". Since the bonus is attached<br/>
to a mystery box, he'll have to discover which box the bonus is<br/>
attached to. Some of you who have searched in W Mi may know of which I<br/>
speak. I'd say, in fact, that his chances are slim. <br/>
I responded with the particulars of bonus clues and a bit more. It<br/>
turns out those geocachers are now intrigued with letterboxing as<br/>
another activity to get them outdoors and into nature.<br/>

P.S. It seems that the geocacher thought he had found the perfect spot<br/>
for his micro-cache only to discover that a letterboxer had also<br/>
thought it was just right. Hmmmm....maybe we do think alike.<br/>
