                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm writing to the list asking for some help.  Kimono Girl and I are<br/>
planning a 4-day letterboxing trip and are thinking of going after as<br/>
many of the Holy Grail boxes as possible.  So, in preparation, I'm<br/>
locating all the boxes and mapping out a driving route, but I'm having<br/>
particular problem with one of the boxes, the "Bring out your dead!"<br/>
box created by Team Bindlestiff and planted by Papeseed in Sheboygan, WI.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I don't want someone to tell me "This is exactly where the<br/>
box is located."  What I'm looking for is someone willing to help push<br/>
me in the proper direction.  I've spent close to 7 hours searching<br/>
through both Google and Yahoo trying to figure out where the clues<br/>
even begin, as they don't say outright in the clues themselves that<br/>
"this is the place you start".  Instead, the clues seem to ask you to<br/>
find certain numbers in the area your start, then use these numbers to<br/>
figure out which way to head, however, the start location is still not<br/>
available to me.  If there is a certain website that I should check<br/>
out to bring me closer, that would be much appreciated.  Thanks for<br/>
any help you might provide.<br/>
