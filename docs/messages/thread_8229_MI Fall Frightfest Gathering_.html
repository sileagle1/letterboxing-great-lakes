are!  We were at the park this past weekend finishing up the planting 
and it is gorgeous on the trails! The weather has warmed up a bit this 
week and the forecast is looking nice for the weekend! A few things to 
pass along:<br/><br/>1) If you are planning to play Great Lakes Bingo this
 year, Wisconsin Hiker will be at Frightfest and you can bring her your 
booty item to save on postage.<br/>2) In addition to the traditional box 
hunting, there will be a scavenger hunt running simultaneously... there 
is nothing special you need to do to prepare for this, but you may want 
to be thinking of teams -- a family unit, or 3-4 unrelated people... 
also, it would be a disadvantage if you were coming to the event with a 
brand new logbook.<br/>3) Some of the event boxes have a puzzle component
 to them (after all, this is a SpringChick event)... so as you don't 
have to spend half of the day figuring out puzzles, the puzzle piece of 
these clues will be posted on Wednesday night... and if you really are 
not a puzzle person, some of the solutions (not all) will be available 
at the gathering, although asking for them may cost you scavenger hunt 
points.<br/>4) Don't forget to check for personal travelers of your fellow Frightfesters...<br/>5)
 There is still time to jump on board for the Friday night haunted house
 and dinner being hosted by 4eyesMcGee and PoofMagicEvilKitty!<br/><br/>See you on Saturday!<br/><br/>SpringChick<br/></p><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"/></span></p></body></html>
