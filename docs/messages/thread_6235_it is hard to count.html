come up with some creative clues for a single box can bring joy to so many -<br>
well worth the investment!<br>

Thanks to everyone who planted boxes in 2009!<br>

Congratulations Atomic Beans, but more importantly I'd like to say thanks Atom for the 100 boxes and for keeping the hobby alive.  I have found a good number of your boxes (but not all 100) and they have been some of my most memorable and challenging finds.   You just keep placing them and we'll keep looking for them. Oh...this is so addicting!<br>
