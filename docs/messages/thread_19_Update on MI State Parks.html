                    <div class="plaintext-content">The MI geocaching steering committe met with the DNR yesterday tp <br>
try and change the new policy.  Here is the post that was put up at <br>
MiGO after the meeting:<br>
<br>
"We have liftoff  I met with my contact for Parks & Rec this <br>
afternoon, and had a very pleasent and productive meeting.  He <br>
enlightened me as to the rationale for the Guidelines with respect <br>
to both the fee structure and the time period involved. <br>
<br>
The concern with respect to a cache's limited lifetime, is the <br>
creation of social, or "spur" trails. The Parks & Rec agency has <br>
been mandated to both provide recreation areas, and also be good <br>
stewards of the land. My contact is genuinely trying to meet both <br>
(at times opposite) obligations. I assured him that we geocachers <br>
also wish to be good stewards of the land, and that when a spur <br>
trail has been created, the cache owner usually gets a pretty quick <br>
update from the logs. So we have agreed that a cache may stay in <br>
place for up to 1 year, providing that is moved (without having to <br>
pay another fee) every 4 months, (or sooner if the Unit Mngr decides <br>
that a spur trail has been created). I have pledged the support of <br>
not only the Board of Directors, but of every member of our great <br>
organization,  in being environmentally, and historically sensitive. <br>
<br>
The fee for placing a cache will remain at $35, but will be good for <br>
1 year. Also, it is possible for one use permit to cover more than <br>
one cache (details to be worked out)  It should be noted here that <br>
the Park & Rec bureau has further been mandated by the State of <br>
Michigan to be entirely self-supporting!  This mandate does not <br>
affect the other agencies of the DNR, only the Parks & Rec! As a <br>
result of this, our new friends at Park & Rec have lost $9 million <br>
in funding from the state. In other words, the Park & Rec agency <br>
recieves NO tax payer, or other dollars from the state of Michigan. <br>
Therefore, the only way the Parks & Rec can recieve any money is <br>
through stickers, parking, and Use Permits. By the way, Use Permits <br>
are not limited to only events in the traditional definition of the <br>
word. This is how the Parks & Rec is structured to recieve any <br>
money. <br>
<br>
Having agreed to this set of revisions, my contact is going to run <br>
it through his Mngmt staff, and then publish the revised guidelines. <br>
As soon as we have them, we will be able to publish them as well."<br>
<br>
- - - - - -<br>
<br>
So the short of it -- still the $35 fee per placement, but that is <br>
now good for 1 a 1 year placement, although you still need to <br>
relocate the box every 3 months.<br>
<br>
Do they really think anyone is going to pay this?<br>
<br>
Seems like they are actually standing to lost money this way.  For <br>
one, they need somebody to deal with the permits and fees and <br>
paperwork, and to routinely check out the boxes in the park, whereas <br>
now, they just go about peacefully co-existing.  Seocndly, if I <br>
planted a box (for free) and myself plus only 5 other letterboxers <br>
paid the daily usage of $6 for that, they would net $36 without <br>
having to hire anyone to do anything.  By instating the charge, I <br>
pull all of my boxes and they get nothing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I know...  I am preaching to the choir here.  Just wanted to <br>
pass along the latest.<br>
<br>
On a more positive note...  I got another e-mail from my letterboxer <br>
friend who works at the State Park here and apparently although <br>
there is a policy, there is room for individual decision-making on a <br>
per park basis and if the ranger decices to, he can look the other <br>
way.  Perhaps that is why I have not received the official "come get <br>
your boxes or be prepared to pay" notice.<br>

Thanks for the update.<br>
I agree with your conclusions.<br>
And I really do understand the plight of all agencies of state <br>
government -- they are having to make do with much less and they <br>
naturaly turn to ANY revenue source that looks viable.<br>
BUT, this does seem short-sighted. The administrative costs to <br>
enforce this kind of measure will be significant. And the amount of <br>
money raised will be minimal. If some calculation was done based on <br>
the number of boxes and caches in place and an assumed reveue stream <br>
was derived, it certainly will not translate into automatic <br>
compliance and dollars.<br>
I have eight boxes on state land. Five of them have had several <br>
visitors from out of state visit them.  Now, can I say that none of <br>
them would have purchased daily permits had it not been for my <br>
letterboxes? No. But I suspect that the visitors' fees would outweigh <br>
the permit receipts.<br>
<br>
Now, on the issue of 'social' trails. Yup, no question, it happens. <br>
It happens with or without geocaches or letterboxes and, no doubt, <br>
the caches and boxes do contribute to the problem. But that's also <br>
part of useage and wear and tear that occurs when humans enter <br>
nature. There is a series of boxes in west Michigan (NOT on state <br>
land) where the 'boxer respected the park rules and kept all boxes <br>
within a couple feet of the trail. It worked. No harm, no foul.<br>
<br>
I'm sad and sorry that we've come to this juncture.<br>
<br>
As of yesterday I've marked all of my clues for boxes on state land. <br>
The notes indicate that the boxes will be withdrawn before June, 2004 <br>
and I advise potential seekers to email me prior to their search to <br>
determine if the boxes are still in place.<br>
<br>
I'm sure I'll purchase a State Park pass again this year and continue <br>
to use the parks; it just won't be as often.<br>
<br>
Thanks to MIGO for the progress they/you made.<br>

>> As for the limited placement time....I couldn't imagine the placer<br>
having to mess around with clues and placement that often. Not to<br>
mention, we don't really care to try to keep up with clues that<br>
change every 3 months, 6 months...year...5 years...It's cool to find<br>
the old boxes....We can't wait til some of these boxes start pushing<br>
10-15 years in existence....maybe more. The older boxes kinda have a<br>
badge of honor to us.<< <br>
<br>
I agree. It's enough effort to find a good spot for a box. I like <br>
FINDING boxes too. I don't want to spend all my free time simply <br>
keeping up with having to constantly shuffle boxes.  <br>
<br>
>> I guess it's just sad that the commercialism of our society has to<br>
invade even the most benign, wholesome fun.<<<br>
<br>
I'm not sure it's the comercialism of our society, as much as it is <br>
that the Parks have a new mandate of being self-suffienct. <br>
<br>
I don't know what the records indicate, but I'm thinking that the <br>
State Park system (when taken as a whole) probably has never been <br>
self-sufficent and I'm not sure they are going to be able to do this <br>
now. Think of all the rustic / primitave parks in the less populated <br>
areas like the UP, <br>
<br>
I think we, as a society and residents of the state, feel an <br>
obligation to preserve the land for future generations.  That's what <br>
good stewardship is. Didn't we learn anything from the ear of the <br>
Lumber Barons?<br>
<br>
I also wonder what the folks in Lansing were thinking when they <br>
instituted this policy.  In their discussions and outlines  what <br>
are the consequences if the Parks system is not self-sufficent?  <br>
Would they be closed?  That would probably mean the ones least used <br>
would go first.  (Bye-bye UP parks) Or as someone said, would park <br>
land be put up for sale.  LOL  all that noise isn't the sound of <br>
rain on your roof, it's the developers salivating at the thought of <br>
getting their hands on prime land along the Lake Shore. <br>
<br>
I also think the people of this state would agree that we should <br>
preserve the land for future generations and that if needed, we <br>
should use tax dollars to support the Parks system and assure this. <br>
At least I hope that's what we as state residents would choose as a <br>
priority.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
