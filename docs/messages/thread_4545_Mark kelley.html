gift for Cindy for xmas and I am retracing all the boxes we did this <br/>
year - I went to get it to stamp it in the gift book and I could not <br/>
find it.   I am not sure if something dragged it away as the area was <br/>
pretty torn up.   Please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Also - tell me which boxes you have found - I am wondering which you <br/>
have found that I have not.   I went back to get the Ed stamp and <br/>
Cindy and I were the last there in June!!!!<br/>
<br/>
If you aren't busy next weekend the 9th or what ever it is - sat or <br/>
Sundy - do you want to go out and look for some???<br/>
