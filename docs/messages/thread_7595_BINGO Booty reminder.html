Just a reminder that I'll be at the Dead of Winter event in Rockford  on<br/>
JAN 26 and can collect your BINGO booty &amp; $2 fee (for mailing prizes)<br/>
then.  If you won't be at the event (or won't see me somewhere else by<br/>
then), please get your booty in the mail within the next week or so. <br/>
I'd like to have everything by JAN 26.  If you're wondering if I<br/>
received anything from you, please check the "2013 BINGO Players"<br/>
database on the message board.  This link might get you there: <br/>

Another reminder: Based on past years, I'm guessing that three interim<br/>
BINGOs will probably occur within the next month.  [Bingo Trivia:  The<br/>
earliest that an interim Bingo has been called was JAN 31 in 2009 and in<br/>
2011.  Could we beat that this year???]<br/>
<br/>
Keep your eyes on your card watching for:<br/>
<br/>
10-spot Bingo: any 10 spaces on your card - no special configuration or<br/>
location, simply the first person to get 10 words crossed off.<br/>
<br/>
6-pack Bingo: a block of 6 spaces - 2x3 or 3x2, anywhere on your card.<br/>
<br/>
Straight Line Bingo: 5 spaces in a row - vertically, horizontally or<br/>
diagonally, anywhere on your card.<br/>
<br/>
It will probably take longer for someone to get the 4 Corners and "+"<br/>
Interim Bingos.<br/>
