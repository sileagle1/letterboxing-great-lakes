                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm so excited!!  I was in Northport MI for an early Thanksgiving - it <br>
snowed and I forgot to bring my clues but we did take a quick trip to <br>
Leland for supplies and went to see if the Fishtown letterbox might <br>
just be in the wrong shrub.  WooWee! It was there - actually lying on <br>
the ground.  Since it was decorated in brown duct tape it did look much <br>
like the ground.  It was dried off, repackaged and placed back in it's <br>
location.  So, it is back!<br>
<br>
Also, I found the stamp for the Toledo War under a bunch of leaves, so <br>
that one will be replanted next weekend.  Now, if I can just find the <br>
time to finish the Maumee Dog walk stamps.  <br>
<br>
Have a Happy Thanksgiving.<br>
