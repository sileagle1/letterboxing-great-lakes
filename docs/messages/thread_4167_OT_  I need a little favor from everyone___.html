Hey everyone...<br>
<br>
My friend's daughter has made the final five in V100.7 FM's Cutest Baby<br>
Contest.<br>
<br>
Voting period Monday, June 11th at 9 am through Friday, June 15th at<br>
11:59 pm.<br>
<br>
Can everyone please do me a favor and vote a couple of times for her?<br>
<br>
http://www.v100.com/pages/babycontest.html<br>
<http://www.v100.com/pages/babycontest.html>  is where you need to go to<br>
vote.<br>
<br>
Her name is Kahlyn Rae Geiger.<br>
<br>
All you have to do is click on her name and hit vote.  (You can vote<br>
again by hitting refresh).  You can vote as many times as you would<br>
like.  I would appreciate this soooo much.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>
