Letterboxing: where techies and teachers <br/>

<br/>
  Very interesting.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; Based on my groggy, caffeine-deficient, Monday morning<br/>
  &gt; &gt; calculations,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; it appears that of this list, 14 folks are/were teachers, and 5<br/>
  &gt; &gt; were<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; English majors of some fashion.  We also have 2 "Tech" career<br/>
  &gt; &gt; folks,<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; and one out and proud "Mutant Life Form".<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Why so many teachers?  It could be the intellectual <br/>
  inquisitiveness<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; that brought us to teaching and "the life of the mind" is be <br/>
  such a<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; powerful characteristic that it carries over to our leisure<br/>
  &gt; &gt; pursuits<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; as well.... Restless brains.  (Oh!  What a gross/creepy/cool <br/>
  stamp<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; image that could be!)<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Or it could be that given how much teachers get paid, <br/>
  letterboxing<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; is the only hobby we can AFFORD!  ;)<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Count me as a tech person. I'm in the IT industry like Martini <br/>
  Man. I<br/>
  &gt; &gt; have taught photography in the past, if that counts. <br/>
  Letterboxing now<br/>
  &gt; &gt; gives me one more reason to wish I was a full time teacher, <br/>
  however.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; I'd have my summers off and time for one of those long <br/>
  letterboxing<br/>
  &gt; &gt; quests like Dragon is planning.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; DebRocks<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm interested to hear more... So far my teacher theory seems <br/>
  to be<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; holding up....  Anyone else care to support or refute it?<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Have a great day, everyone!<br/>
