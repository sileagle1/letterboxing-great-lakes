                    <div class="plaintext-content">You probably should count me as both.  In addition to teaching <br>
writing and literature to students in other fields, I teach <br>
engineering freshmen how to write;  to make effective <br>
presentations;  to communicate with each other, with <br>
supervisors and clients.  I guide them through the process of <br>
designing real projects for real people, from client meeting, <br>
through brainstorming, protoyping, testing, and final design / <br>
implementation.<br>

My latent engineering skills (and love of games and play) were <br>
inherited from my father, a talented engineer back in the days <br>
when you didn't need a degree to certify that you were creative. <br>
