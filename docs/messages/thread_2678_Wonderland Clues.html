                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
Well, I have finally distributed each "stand alone" clue for the <br>
permanent boxes we planted for people at the gathering. Since we <br>
wouldn't want a box to be dependent on another box's directions (in <br>
case it disappeared), each of the clues was rewritten to start at one <br>
of the parking lots.  I see that some of you have already posted the <br>
clues, as have many of you that created and planted your own boxes.  <br>
If my count is correct, it looks like 17 boxes have been posted and <br>
there are 12 more remaining to post.<br>
<br>
If any of you didn't get an email message from me with your clue, <br>
please send me a message and I will resend it.  Martini Man & I are <br>
willingly to check on any of the boxes if/when necessary if you don't <br>
live nearby.  If you'd prefer that we post the clues under our name <br>
(giving credit to you as the carver), we could also do that.  <br>
<br>
The only clue I haven't sent is for the Rose Gardeners.  Martini Man <br>
& I are uneasy about the hiding spot and have already mentioned this <br>
to Speedsquare.  After the last temporary boxes are removed, we think <br>
it would be better to replant the gardeners in one of those spots.  <br>
So if you haven't found it by the 4th of July, please be sure to <br>
check with us to see if it has been moved.  After we relocate it, <br>
we'll send the new clues to Speedsquare so she can post them.<br>
<br>
One last thing - we will be at the park later on Sunday to pickup 2 <br>
of the temporary boxes.  If anyone needs us to check on anything <br>
(rumors of a missing box or whatever) please send me a note and we <br>
will try to follow-up on it.<br>
<br>
... and yes, I'm still planning to post some photos, including the <br>
group photo with names.  However we've been pretty busy with a hiking <br>
weekend at Devil's Lake, a party at our house, planning some LB <br>
weekend trips and of course our "real" jobs.  Hopefully we'll get <br>
something up within the next week or so.<br>
<br>
Good luck to all on your Grail quests, we hope to venture forth this <br>
weekend to add to our collection!<br>

Just an FYI - if you can't find a good spot in the park, I'd be happy to<br>
find a spot in a real Rose Garden (open to the public) near my new home,<br>
the Rose City.  I could walk by it every day.  We are planning to<br>
volunteer at this very special garden.  Keep me posted.<br>
