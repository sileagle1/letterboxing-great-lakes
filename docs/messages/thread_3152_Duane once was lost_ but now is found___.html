Two sets of thanks today, first to Marci of the 3 MO's for suggesting I contact Nitrocat (duh - I knew she lived near the box, but it totally slipped my mind - what little I have left, that is) and to Stacy/Nitrocat herself for going out to check on and find my missing Duane's Motel box out in Newark, IL.   Nitrocat has graciously offered to rehide it for me in a new location (and then I get to find my own box!).  Watch for the new clues when they become available!<br>
 <br>
 Remember, anyone taking a "pilgrimage" out to the Starved Rock/Matthiessen area, if you head out from the Chicago area on I-55, if you take the US 52-IL 71 route, there are a number of boxes for your searching pleasure along the way, including Holy Grail box(es??).  My goal is to make that area the Illinois Letterboxing Corridor!!!   (-:<br>
