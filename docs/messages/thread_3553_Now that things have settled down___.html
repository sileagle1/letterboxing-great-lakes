                    <div class="plaintext-content">To start, I would really like to thank everyone for their prayers, <br/>
support, and well wishes.  It makes me feel good that we belong to a <br/>
group of such amazing people.  I know that we have only scratched the <br/>
surface in terms of meeting the names on this site but you are all <br/>
very close to our hearts.  I can't wait for some of you to meet <br/>
Emily, and she can't wait to get out boxing.<br/>
<br/>
About Bingo...<br/>
 Well, with the free space and today's word, we have 2!  Look out The <br/>
Cottontails are on a roll!!<br/>
<br/>
About Christmas Cards...<br/>
 Not to make ya feel bad, but Mrs. Cottontails and I not only hand <br/>
made our cards this year, but we mailed 'em on the way to the <br/>
hospital with our Bingo booty.  Though I do understand being busy <br/>
last year we mailed 'em on December 26th.<br/>
<br/>
About Circular paths...<br/>
This makes me laugh because we had a box that did just that.  We also <br/>
try to send people in a circle so after a 90 minute walk you don't <br/>
have another 90 minutes back to the car.  Though recently it hasn't <br/>
worked out that way.  That first box was my favorite, especially <br/>
reading the comments in the now missing logbook.<br/>
<br/>
About Registering finds...<br/>
I am with the people who like a little note, although checking the <br/>
book and seeing lots of names you never heard from is also really <br/>
cool.<br/>
<br/>
About the Gathering and Camping...<br/>
While I used to do alot of camping, Mrs. Cottontails never has, we <br/>
don't even own a tent.  I am pretty sure her idea of "roughing" it is <br/>
a hotel with a black and white TV.  I don't know what Emily thinks <br/>
about camping.  What I am trying to say is, are there any good <br/>
(cheap) hotels nearby?  We are definately planning on going in fact <br/>
we voted for Ohio because it gets us halfway to CT.  Provided there <br/>
are no more snow days this will be the beginning of a week long trip.<br/>
<br/>
About the Southern Illinois Gathering...<br/>
I think the best way is to try and find out from confirmed attendees <br/>
ahead of time so they can send $$ and do the rest outside.  We would <br/>
like to come but aren't sure yet.<br/>
<br/>
Again, many thanks to all of you.<br/>
