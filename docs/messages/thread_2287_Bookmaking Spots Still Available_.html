Bookmaking event being held near Clear Lake, Indiana.  The event will <br>
consist of 4 bookmaking/bookbinding workshops, each taught by a <br>
different letterboxer from the Great Lakes Group.<br>
<br>
It promises to be a fun-filled day of learning, creativity and <br>
comaraderie.  It looks like the weather isn't going to be a factor if <br>
you were worried about driving in March, so if you are still <br>
interested, please e-mail me offline as soon as possible to get signed <br>
up.<br>
<br>
