Hey guys,<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering about that Gryphon box, still.  While you were boxing,<br/>
did you find out if it was missing, misplaced or ... maybe Jigsaw and<br/>
I were simply looking in the wrong place.  We spent about an hour<br/>
(including hiking time) on that one and I just wanted to know if it<br/>
"beat" us or not. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for everything.<br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>

The bittersweet answer is that it was just fine. It was in fine fettle. It's<br/>
a permanent box, so come on back!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed your company along with Jigsaw at Marty's. Hope the trip home was a<br/>
good one.<br/>
