                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, there was one.  It was in Lake Michigan, east of Milwaukee if I<br>
remember correctly.  It was placed by BindleBabe and I believe she had a<br>
report that someone, not a normal (if there is such a thing!) letterboxer,<br>
did in fact successfully find it.  However I don't see the clues listed<br>
anymore.  She can probably give you an update the next time she gets<br>
online....<br>
