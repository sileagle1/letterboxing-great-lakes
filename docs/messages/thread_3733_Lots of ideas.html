                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been thinking about creating a county quest series for my new area.  Plenty of history, <br>
plenty of old houses (Log cabin, Federal to Mid-Century Modern styles), colorful celebrities, <br>
artists and some Firsts.  I want it to be available at the local historial society.  I was thinking <br>
of hosting a (very small) gathering of letterboxers that might want to help me make quest <br>
books.  Once all the clues have been solved and letterboxes found, the completed series <br>
would earn a patch or decal or something.<br>
<br>
Our local library has a wonderful online catalog and newspaper index going waaaay back.  I <br>
am spoiled.<br>
<br>
This series might act as a WOM in that I would probably announce it here, and at our local <br>
museums.  My hope is that it gets students and parents interested in the rich history of our <br>
area.<br>
<br>
So, if I manage to pull this off in 2007, this will be my resolution.<br>

see on your profile which state you live in but hopefully it is close <br>
enough for me to seek them once you do this!  With all of the debate <br>
about whether or not you would want to share a thought like this for <br>
fear that someone might come along and copy your idea, I think this is <br>
the type of sharing that inspires others to do the same in another <br>
county or state!  Thanks for sharing!<br>

Not a bad job as I had to go downhill on the drive.  The great discovery<br>

perfect outfit for letterboxing in colder temps.  My regular clothes<br>

I've already claimed them to be "my clothes" when I need them.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey speedsquare!  I see you are going to the Hoosier gathering too.  <br>
Good.  I'll get to meet you there!  I have gotten some boxes in the <br>
Dayton area but not all of them.  I ran out of daylight the last time I <br>
was there.<br>
<br>
Congrats on discovering Carhart!!  I've been a Cleveland Browns fan all <br>
my life and I swear that is the unofficial uniform of Browns fans.  Must <br>
be that lake effect thing.<br>
<br>
Your bravery in learning how to use your John Deere is impressive in <br>
this mess we have.  We too have been under Level 2 and 3 emergencies <br>
because of the ice.  This is crazy.  Make it stop!  There are <br>
letterboxes out there!<br>
<br>
I was thinking about making a temp box for this next event in Indy <br>
called "Hoosier Daddy" and carve a picture of Anna Nicole Smith but I <br>
thought that might be in poor taste?!    Funny and truly sad all at the <br>
same time.<br>
<br>
See you when things begin to melt!!<br>
