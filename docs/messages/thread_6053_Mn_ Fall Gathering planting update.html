I hope that everyone has a great day on the 10th of Oct. There should be plenty of boxes to find, and a nice choice of environments to plant them in. I recommend going out to plant as soon as you can if you're not familiar with the park. As I said, the terrain is varied and there are some really cool areas just begging to be stocked with boxes. Go and familiarize yourself with the park, it will help out on the big day so you have a general feel for the layout of the park. It's not going to be here soon enough, it never is.<br>

Why do I always seem to pick the hottest day to go for a five hour planting<br>
binge? I just got back from the park and what a day! Kudos to Red Cat for<br>
the park selection. It's SO beautiful. There is a nice range of hardwood and<br>
pine segments as well as some nice prairies. There really is something for<br>
everyone. The sheer variety of mushrooms I found today would make even<br>
