                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, as alive as a rubber stamp of a cartoon duck can<br>
be.  We checked on our Duck Tape box this past<br>
Saturday, and he was still where we planted him.  It<br>
was interesting reading the comments in the log book. <br>
A few people reported that the ground was swampy<br>
during their searches...it's always been pretty solid<br>
for us.  Guess we luck out when we go there.  The box<br>
was last found on June 4th, and I think those finders<br>
were newbies, because they wrote how hard the clues<br>
were.  Shaw, they should try some of SpringChick's<br>
boxes and then whine! :)<br>
<br>
We then headed out to Port Clinton, and in the<br>
sweltering heat found Hazard.  I really like the way<br>
those clues were put together, making you use<br>
landmarks in order to determine the numbers you needed<br>
to then find the box.  We then found Rest In Peace. <br>
This box was hidden in a cemetery.  Now, I do<br>
genealogy, and I come from a line of long,<br>
unpronounceable Eastern Eurpoean surnames.  So imagine<br>
my surprise when about 4 graves away from one of the<br>
graves listed as a landmark to where the box is<br>
hidden, I see a grave with my mother's maiden name on<br>
it!  So of course I copied down that info to determine<br>
if they're more long lost relatives.  That's the<br>
problem with geneaology - just as you're trying to<br>
finish determining the link between you & one of your<br>
relatives, 5 more relatives appear in your research.  <br>
<br>
That's all for now...<br>
