<br/>
I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm having some type of problem<br/>
receiving status updates on my boxes and "contact the placer" messages.  I<br/>
know it isn't a global problem since Martini Man is still getting messages<br/>
for his boxes.  I've tried several things and have now sent a message to the<br/>
LBNA webmasters to see if they can provide any help.<br/>
<br/>
The last notifications I received were on SEP 26, so if you sent me any<br/>
messages since then I'm sorry to report I didn't receive them.  I didn't<br/>
want you to think I'm rude in not replying, so am posting this message on<br/>
the board.  If you reported any type of problem with any of my boxes, please<br/>
let me know directly at kotlarek@wi.rr.com<br/>
<br/>
I really miss getting the status updates and messages, so I hope I can get<br/>
this fixed soon!<br/>

P.S.  Congrats to Cigna Cats - I see they were successful in finding Capone!<br/>

where Capone was hiding!  We also liked the "detail" that was added <br/>
to the stamp a while back from a hungry critter.  All was well there, <br/>
we are happy to report!<br/>
