I cannot be bribed to pick anyone's favorites.  Actually this year, I haven't been watching <br>
this game very closely, so I am a good candidate to pick this week.  I don't even know if <br>
anyone has won, or where the game really is (and no, I won't go back an read every post or <br>
thread on the subject).<br>
<br>
Secondly, did anyone have MORE fun than I did this weekend?  Finally Indiana had its first <br>
Spring Forward and the weather was glorious today.  Normally I get my first sunburn in <br>
April, but this year March 11th is the date.  We just returned home from a full day of <br>
boxing in Indy and we are going to grill out dinner.  It's still very light out, woohoo!<br>
<br>
Yesterday, JBBK2006 came to town and I met them while they looked for Beauty School <br>
Dropout.  In case you're wondering, this has become my favorite plant.  I never guessed it <br>
would be a difficult one to find.  I found them along the way (further along the way than <br>
necessary) and asked them a series of questions to see why they missed the clues.  Every <br>
word is important and without making the connections, the subsequent clues don't.  They <br>
did locate this letterbox and it is doing just fine.  They are the 2nd finders.  The first <br>
finders took the challenge six times before getting it.<br>
<br>
Last weekend we braved the bitter cold in Indy.  Today we finished up all the southside <br>
boxes and provide some box maintenance on a couple (of boxes).<br>
<br>
So as I recall, MARCH is ANNUAL BOX MAINTENANCE/CHECK.  I'm not volunteering to run <br>
an incentive program, just sending a reminder.<br>
