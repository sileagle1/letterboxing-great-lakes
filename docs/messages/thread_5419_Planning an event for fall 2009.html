                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I am in the advance planning stages for an event next fall.  I am <br>
planning on Saturday October 3rd at Minooka Park in Waukesha.  I'll <br>
be able to reserve the shelter on January 2nd, and will post firm <br>
information for the date as soon as I have the reservation in hand.  <br>
<br>
I figured I would let people know in advance if they are planning on <br>
doing carving over the winter and are looking for inspiration.  The <br>
theme is science fiction.  Science fiction fandom holds conventions <br>
just about every weekend of the year.  The term is shortened to be a <br>
con and that usually gets added into the name of the convention.  <br>
Windycon is in Chicago, Oddcon in Madison, Minnicon in Minneapolis.  <br>
This will be Boxacon.  <br>
<br>
I would like to stick to straight science fiction and save the <br>
fantasy for another con.  So if you are thinking of ideas, I'll throw <br>
some out.  Just off the top of my head from the media side of life <br>
there is Firefly, Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, Battlestar <br>
Galactica, Red Dwarf, Firefly (I really like Firefly!).  Book lists <br>
are longer, some of the big names again off the top of my head, the <br>
big 3 of Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke (2001 and Hal anyone?). Cherryh has <br>
some interesting aliens.  Dave Weber has a lot of great insignia and <br>
items from various ships and worlds that would make great stamps.  I <br>
already have a stamp from Bujold in the parade of books series, but <br>
there is alot more there.  Larry Niven, Anne McCaffrey, Clifford <br>
Simak (a Wisconsin native!), I could keep the list going on and on.  <br>
My general differation is that if the book has magic, elves, <br>
vampires, you are looking at fantasy.  If it is, or was at the time <br>
of its writing, possible in the world as we know it, it is science <br>
fiction.  <br>
<br>
I'm going to try playing with the free website places that were <br>
mentioned here a while back and will let everyone know when I have <br>
something up and running.<br>
