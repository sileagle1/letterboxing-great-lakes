Besides, with the way things go missing, we ought to just be grateful that a <br>

<br>
It's crossed my mind only briefly.  Then I decided it didn't matter if no one else liked my box...if the looked for a few and decided they didn't like them they could always choose not to look for boxes planted by me anymore.  I've done this myself.  There is a series of boxes locally that was planted by someone who lives on the other side of the country.  We looked for them last year with limited success and much frustration.  When this boxer visited again this spring she replaced her boxes in the same area with new stamps etc but given my past experience with her clues I don't really feel that it will be worth my time to search for them (I have been told by a friend who did go after them that you can see all of them from the trail though).<br>
<br>
>My thought, be glad there was one planted for you to find.<br>
<br>
I have to agree here, coming from the land of few letterboxers.  Almost all of the boxes around here were placed by me, Katy, or my husband so I'm not going to gripe if someone plants a box with a stamp or logbook that I don't instantly love.  <br>
<br>
I do think there is such a thing as a bad letterbox because I've found one.  But only one.  And it's only a bad letterbox because it doesn't have a stamp...just pieces of paper with a stamp image on them.  As far as I'm concerned, that's not really a letterbox anyway.  So I guess I haven't really found any bad letterboxes yet.  <br>

I draw stamps but I make my husband carve them) then I'd much rather <br>
have a store-bought stamp than a slip of paper or a web address for an <br>
image or whatever else people do.  I don't feel like I've really <br>
finished with a box until I've got the nice pretty stamp in my book!  <br>
<br>
I do prefer handmade stamps because they are so fun to show off in my <br>
journal, but I'm almost as happy with store-bought stamps and I would <br>
never feel disappointed or cheated to find one.<br>

p.s. I checked my own box on Sunday and the first person had stamped <br>
in!  Hooray!  Here's hoping that more people "Say Yes to Michigan" <br>

Well, in this particular case, I think they were trying to make a handicapped accesable version of a box that is already hidden elsewhere in the park.  It was the exact same stamp image.  Except, the box went missing shortly after they planted it and when they re-planted they hid it further off the trail and it is no longer accesible to people in wheelchairs or with more severe disabilities that would prevent them from going off of the paved path.  It's a nice concept, but I was disappointed to go out there on two occasions and not find a stamp either time.  And realistically, the stamp should have been simple enough that they could have re-carved a second almost identical stamp for the second box anyway.  <br>
<br>
Stickers instead of a stamp is still not a real letterbox either.  And I think I would still be a bit sore to find stickers, but I like that idea better than pre-stamped cards.  At least with stickers printed off on a computer or something you'll get a good image.  None of the stamp images in the box we found were really what I would call great...some of them weren't even good.  <br>
