like its been an eternity since the MI Fall Gathing so it will be <br/>
great to see folks again and have a whole day to carve and talk <br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has questions on logbook making or would like to try the <br/>
Monkey Journal, just say the word and I will bring along the <br/>
instructions and some basic materials -- no formal workshop though --<br/>
 there is nothing formal about this gathering, just an easy-going, <br/>
laid-back time.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!<br/>

&gt; The Mid-Winter Carve &amp; Create is a chance for poor snow bound <br/>
letterboxer's to get together and work on projects in preparation <br/>
for spring planting!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *Have an idea percolating?  Bring it and bounce it off other <br/>
letterboxers.  <br/>
&gt; *Stuck on a technique?  Bring it and someone else can help you.<br/>
&gt; *Have projects sitting on the back burner?  Bring 'em and finally <br/>
get 'em finished.<br/>
&gt; *Have way cool stuff you're dieing to show other boxers?  Bring it <br/>
on.<br/>
&gt; *Curious about Postal Letterboxing and how it works?  Your <br/>
questions will be answered.<br/>
&gt; *Need clue writing help?  Someone will be able to talk you through <br/>
something.<br/>
&gt; *Want to sit around and talk letterboxing?  You're not alone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There will be time for meet and greet and exchanges and even a <br/>
couple of letterboxes to hunt up (a little piece of heaven is very <br/>
near) or stumble upon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a sign-up on Atlas Quest if you so desire - or just show <br/>
up and plan to have a good time.<br/>
&gt; One nice thing about AQ sign up is the personal traveler <br/>
option....hint, hint.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Couple more things:<br/>
&gt; *Snacks/goodies are welcome -- this is not a potluck.  Our noon <br/>
meal will be ordering pizza in - so if you don't like pizza, just <br/>
bring your own lunch.  The restaurants are not close to this <br/>
location, however there is a convenience store right next door.  <br/>
Bring your own beverages please.  (There is a refrigerator and <br/>
microwave available.)<br/>
&gt; *There will be no specific activities available for children.  I <br/>
do not want to discourage you from bringing them along, however - <br/>
you will be responsible for entertaining them.  I'm sure I can set <br/>
up a movie for them to watch -- but that's about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking forward to spending the day with other letterboxers, and <br/>
hoping to meet a few new faces!!<br/>

Glad to hear that you (and El Cajador also?) will be coming to the Carve &amp;<br/>
Create! We can certainly spend some time on the logbooks ;-) Looking forward<br/>
to seeing you again!<br/>

Yes, yes, yes!!! I really would love to learn to make the logbooks. I've<br/>
been hesitant to try it without a helpful hand nearby. Is there anything I<br/>
should bring for making a logbook?<br/>
<br/>
I'm really looking forward to this gathering too!<br/>

Wooo Hoo! I am really looking forward to this get-together! It feels <br/>
like its been an eternity since the MI Fall Gathing so it will be <br/>
great to see folks again and have a whole day to carve and talk <br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has questions on logbook making or would like to try the <br/>
Monkey Journal, just say the word and I will bring along the <br/>
instructions and some basic materials -- no formal workshop though --<br/>
there is nothing formal about this gathering, just an easy-going, <br/>
laid-back time.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!<br/>
