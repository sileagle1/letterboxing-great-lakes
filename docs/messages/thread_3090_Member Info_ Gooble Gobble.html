                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone, Gooble Gobble here to tell my story. I<br>
found out aboot letterboxing from the article in<br>
Smithsonian magazine, or was it Time? Anyway, here<br>
goes. My wife and I were sitting in the lobby of a<br>
local government center waiting for our number to be<br>
called and I started looking through all the magazines<br>
they had. I happened upon the now fateful article and<br>
knew I was hooked right away. After we got home I<br>
immediately looked at the LBNA site and started<br>
drooling. The next day I carved a very rudimentary<br>
stamp on two pink erasers. One said Gooble, the other<br>
said Gobble. For the first 10 or 12 finds that is what<br>
I used to stamp in with. Soon after I purchased a<br>
Speedball cutter and some Speedball speedy-cut and<br>
went to town. I found carving to be very easy and was<br>
amazed at how cool my first stamp turned out. After<br>
carving 5 stamps, which still wait to be placed, I<br>
carved my signature stamp which I've used now for<br>
about a year and a half. <br>
<br>
  I have 117 finds, placed no "real" boxes (I don't<br>
count the 2 boxes I did for the 2006 gathering as<br>
"real" boxes because they're not permanent) and have<br>
released 7 HH's. I have a series of 27 HH's in the<br>
works (they're a safety themed HH series. You know the<br>
safety signs you see in industrial places like<br>
"caustic", "emergency eye bath" "crush hazard", etc.)<br>
be on the lookout for those and collect the whole set<br>
: ) I have 3 personal travelers that are kind of hard<br>
for most to get (I'm a juggler and they are only given<br>
out to those who can demonstrate to me that they can<br>
juggle 3, 4, or 5 balls. Start practicing for Ohio) I<br>
do postals during the winter to feed my addiction and<br>
get out to box whenever I can. <br>
<br>
   My free time to go boxing has been limited by the<br>
fact that my wife doesn't like to go boxing and we<br>
have a 1 year old daughter. Although I will definetely<br>
be getting my daughter hooked A.S.A.P. and will be<br>
using her for leverage to get my wife into it. He he<br>
he he, aren't kids great? ; ) The two times I've<br>
talked my wife into going with me the places we went<br>
were infested with mosquitos, she was pregnant, and it<br>
was 85+ degrees out. Hmm, don't know why she doesn't<br>
like it.<br>
<br>
   I have been to so many cool places and have seen<br>
things I never would have had I not been boxing. One<br>
of the best parts about boxing is the people involved<br>
in it. Everyone I met this summer in Delafield was so<br>
nice and it is a great feeling to be welcomed into a<br>
community of real, genuinely nice people. You don't<br>
find that very often these days. I look forward to a<br>
lifetime of boxing, getting to know those I've met<br>
better and meeting new boxers.<br>
<br>
   As far as where my trail name comes from, it comes<br>
from one of my all time favorite movies. The movie is<br>
called "Freaks". It's a 1930's movie about real circus<br>
freaks. I urge you all to see it. There is a part in<br>
the movie where the freaks are having a party and<br>
welcoming a new member into they're circle. One of the<br>
freaks is standing on the table with a large goblet<br>
and doing a funny dance while the rest of the freaks<br>
are chanting " Gooble Gobble Gooble Gobble we accept<br>
you as one of us Gooble Gobble Gooble Gobble. That's<br>
the way I felt from the beginning of being a part of<br>
this group of people. Part of this "secret club" that<br>
runs around the woods getting eaten alive by<br>
mosquitos, hiking for miles, getting scratched up by<br>
thorns, getting dirty, while looking for treasure in<br>
the form of stamps hidden in tupperware.<br>
<br>
   Thank you to all who make this obsession of ours<br>
possible, you're a great bunch.<br>
