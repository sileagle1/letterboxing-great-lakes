Congrats on the "Four Corners"--and sounds like we may be seeing you <br/>
again soon with the "X".  Although, it does make me feel really <br/>
behind.  I still don't have ANY corners and still no straight line <br/>
Bingo. (sigh)<br/>

We are in a similar situation and that's why we were traveling to Michigan yesterday... We're here for a few days putting in a new kitchen floor, painting some rooms, whatever it takes to sell our house here.   Hope we find some similar luck in that vein.  Perhaps the BINGO win is a omen of good things coming!<br/>
<br/>
We were kinda excited with the 60 degree weather (both in Wisconsin and Michigan) this week, to find some of the letterboxes in southeastern Michigan that we'd never gotten to... only to wake up this morning with a few inches of new snow!!  What's up with that?   It seems to be melting pretty rapidly, though, so we're still hopeful.<br/>

P.S.  Yes, I also recognized Azobox's photo.  The clues were quite <br/>
suspensful leading up to that photo and when we got to that "stream <br/>
crossing" we at first thought he was kidding!!  But across we went <br/>
without a mishap and we found the box.  However we're glad we were <br/>
there on a day when it wasn't flooded - we saw lots of evidence of <br/>
that.  We also ran into a lot of flooding in IL at the end of <br/>
December, so whoever posted earlier about changing conditions is <br/>
certainly correct.  It's hard for a placer to imagine what might <br/>
happen in a given location in each season.  But who would think IL <br/>
would have FLOODING in DECEMBER??  Normally it would be pretty frozen <br/>
at that time, I would think.<br/>
