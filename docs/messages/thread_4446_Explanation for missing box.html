Did he say WHY they had the stamp?  How long have they had it?  I'm <br/>
curious if they just had the stamp or the whole box...<br/>

P.S.  On the positive side, I got an email message from a newbie <br/>
earlier this week.  It was someone who hadn't found a box yet, but was <br/>
planning to go to Door County in a week or two and look for some <br/>
boxes.  They asked for advice and tips before they got started (they <br/>
did this through the LBNA Contact the Placer feature).  I thought that <br/>
was very encouraging, that some people DO try to get educated before <br/>
heading out.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Update: When I was talking about one of my missing boxes, I thought I had found an explanation.  I intentionally didn't post names because hey, mistakes happen.  We live and learn.  But this time, I need to clarify that they don't have the stamp. They didn't take it.   I usually stay up very late, last night till 4 am, and I didn't understand what he was offering to do.  He bought some carving supplies, carved a 2 scoop ice cream cone stamp, and was asking if he could mail it to me or replace my missing stamp in Door County with one he carved.  He was offering to do a really nice thing, although we usually don't carve replacement stamps for others, but I totally misunderstood him.  Just wanted to set the record straight.  However, that means, I still don't have an explanation why that box failed twice. Oh well.....<br/>
