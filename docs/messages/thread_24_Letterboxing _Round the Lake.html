Unfortunately not everyone lives in an area where it would be <br>
feasible to participate in this venture, but for those of you who do, <br>
I hope you will consider it (and for those who don't...  I'm cooking <br>
up another project that should be ready to unveil in a couple of <br>
days).<br>
<br>
So what is this Letterboxing 'Round the Lake series all about?  Well <br>
no doubt many of you have heard of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour?  It <br>
is an established road trip route that takes a person all of the way <br>
around Lake Michigan, through WI, MI, IN and IL.  This series would <br>
seek to populate that route with letterboxes.<br>
<br>
I won't go into great detail here in the post, but you can check out <br>
all of the specifics in the file I uploaded to the files section.  <br>
The short is that I am looking for participants who would like to <br>
participate in the project by contributing a letterbox -- you make <br>
it, you place it, you write the clues and post them where you wish, <br>
you maintain the box and clues.  I will then create a central web <br>
page with links to all of the clues and approach the MI and WI <br>
tourist associations in hopes they might feature it as a fun <br>
diversion along the tour.  Who knows, we may gain some new <br>
letterboxers!<br>

A great idea!  Tom and I have several boxes already in place that <br>
fit the criteria, although some may have to relocate because the new <br>
State Parks regulations.  We'll be up in the UP in a few weeks, and <br>
will check on them to see that they are all in place and ready to <br>
go.   This might even inspire us to carve a few more stamps :)!  <br>

<br>
You bring up a good point that I should have included in the <br>
original post -- these do not necessarily have to be new <br>
letterboxes.  If you already have a letterbox in place that <br>
qualifies, feel free to include that in the series.<br>
<br>
I may include a few of the Michigan Lighthouse boxes -- those here <br>
in West Michigan.  Would love to include others but I simply cannot <br>
commit to keeping a close eye on them because they are further away.<br>
<br>
Glad you are thinking of participating!<br>

(dubbed "Letterboxing 'Round the Lake" to avoid name infringement) <br>
is off and running.<br>
<br>
I've set up a couple of web pages with information, details, box <br>
criteria and submission guidelines here:  <br>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/projects/lmct.asp  (similar information <br>
has also been uploaded into the Files section of this group).<br>
<br>
The main tour route has been broken up into 13 "legs" and there are <br>
an additional 6 spur routes.  When submitting a letterbox for <br>
inclusion in the listing, please indicate which "leg" of the route <br>
the box is located in as this is how they will be organized on the <br>
list.<br>
<br>
In reading through the criteria for the letterboxes, you will notice <br>
that these do not have to be new letterboxes or boxes created <br>
especially for this.  Likewise the boxes do not have to fit any <br>
particular theme.  This is simply the compilation of a listing of <br>
letterboxes that are located along the LMCT route.<br>
<br>
The actual list of letterboxes is here: <br>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/projects/lmct_boxes.asp<br>
<br>
I have entered in a few of my boxes to give an idea of how it will <br>
work.  This is very similar to the I-95 letterbox listing that can <br>
be found at Mark Pepe's web site.<br>
