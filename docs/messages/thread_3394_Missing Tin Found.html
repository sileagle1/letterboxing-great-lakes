                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you Dragon!  I knew it would turn up.  We were so exhausted by the end of the day that when it came time to pack up, clean off the table, and leave the restaurant, I was sure that the tin ended up in a bag of stuff.  No, you're not bad...maybe 'naughty', but we all strive to be a bit naughty in life because being 'nice' isn't fun.)  Just like the naughty or nice letterbox, when given a choice, most of us chose to go after the naughty box first.  <br/>
<br/>
Since so many people have asked, I agreed to hide Santa's Lost Toys Series again this year. Since it is suppose to warm up later in the week, I'll wait to hide this first of my Santa series of boxes till you mail the original logbook and series stamp back to me.  That means Fungus Woman needs to stamp and mail off the second Santa series to you asap.  <br/>
<br/>
Today, I'm recuperating from a day of hiking in cold weather through the 'swamp' in order to find the Hostel.  But it was all worth the effort.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for coordinating this gathering.  <br/>

  You're right, I was thinking of the wrong box. Actually the Santa TIN<br/>
  for the lost toys series was found in my backback just a few minutes<br/>
  ago. My bad! Beetle, I'll mail it to you with the ones I get from FW.<br/>

  &gt; The one we picked up from you was the main box and logbook for the St. <br/>
  &gt; Nick's Workshop series in the cardboard box, the new series replacing <br/>
  &gt; the lost toys series. That box I picked up got back to Beetle.<br/>
