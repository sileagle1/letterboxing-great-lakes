<br/>
Has anyone on this list solved the Kimball Library box (see post <br/>
#592 on this list)?  In glancing at the list of names, none looked <br/>
familiar, although I am not certain of everyone's real names.<br/>
<br/>
I hereby challenge each of you to solve this letterbox clue... and <br/>
will provide a handcarved stamp for the first person who is a member <br/>
of this group (and who has not already solved this box) whose name <br/>
appears on the list of successful seekers at Tom's site.<br/>
<br/>
The link to the clue page is in the previously mentioned post and <br/>
also in the LINKS section of this group.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

&gt; In regards to the question as to whether this has been done <br/>
&gt; before...  There are "letterbooks" that have been placed in <br/>
&gt; libraries which utilize hollowed out real books for the container, <br/>
&gt; as Richard had mentioned.  I have not seen any of these so I'm not <br/>
&gt; sure if they just remove the entire inner hunk of pages or cut <br/>
&gt; individual niches for the stamp and logbook, or if part of the <br/>
&gt; original book is utilized for the journal, etc.  I also don't know <br/>
&gt; in what way they are painted, decorated, etc.  By precise <br/>
definition <br/>
&gt; of "altered book" adornment is not mandatory, rather simply <br/>
cutting <br/>
&gt; a niche technically qualifies as "altering."  My guess is that <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; book is more artistic than most of these, more closely fitting the <br/>
&gt; idea we hold as altered book artists.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Either way, it is a very cool concept for an indoor letterbox and <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; would like to see more of these types of boxes as they really <br/>
allow <br/>
&gt; for some creativity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone is interested, I believe the very first "letterbook" was <br/>
&gt; the Kimball Library box placed by Tom Cooch, a great "old-time" <br/>
&gt; letterboxer.  The box is in Vermont, but there is an on-line <br/>
version <br/>
&gt; (in this respect it probably qualifies also for the first virtual <br/>
&gt; letterbox).  Even though Tom is not so actively involved in the <br/>
&gt; letterboxing community as he previously was, it does appear that <br/>
he <br/>
&gt; still keeps up with this box.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey, everyone.  I've been working all day (okay, not ALL day!) <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; a new Lb<br/>
&gt; &gt; for camp.  I think I mentioned my idea a while back...an altered <br/>
&gt; book that<br/>
&gt; &gt; would actually be the journal for the box as well as the hiding <br/>
&gt; place of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp.  (There's a niche in the back of the book to hold the <br/>
&gt; stamp.)  Has<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone ever done anything like that before?  The book I'm using <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; an old<br/>
&gt; &gt; (1953) pronounciation dictionary, and my altering is pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; rudimentary...basically just playing with some of my stamps to <br/>
&gt; illustrate<br/>
&gt; &gt; words on some of the pages.  On the page that has "BLIND", I <br/>
&gt; stamped the<br/>
&gt; &gt; three blind mice.  For "ALIEN" I stamped Worf from ST:TNG.  A <br/>
few <br/>
&gt; pages are<br/>
&gt; &gt; a bit more elaborate:  "ANTS": I multiply stamped an image of <br/>
&gt; three ants,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and stamped out the words "the ants go marching 3 by 3".  I just <br/>
&gt; wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do enough to give the girls some idea that writing in the book <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; okay, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; spark a little creativity without stiffling their own ideas by <br/>
&gt; being too<br/>
&gt; &gt; overwhelming.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I'd like to bring this along to the Gathering so that <br/>
all <br/>
&gt; of your<br/>
&gt; &gt; can stamp into it, if you don't mind.  I'd like them also to see <br/>
&gt; what some<br/>
&gt; &gt; "real" letterboxers' stamps look like (not the pathetic stuff <br/>
I've <br/>
&gt; produced<br/>
&gt; &gt; so far!!...I *really* need a workshop!).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The name of the box...er, book?...is "May I have a word with <br/>
&gt; you?"  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues imply the lodge it will be hidden in...oh, heck...here <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; are:<br/>
&gt; &gt; "May I have a word with you?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Ah, camp! The perfect place to relax and forget about your <br/>
&gt; problems, at<br/>
&gt; &gt; least for a few days.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You say the Pioneer lifestyle is not for you? Well, perhaps <br/>
you'd <br/>
&gt; prefer<br/>
&gt; &gt; some of our other accommodations. Perhaps some flush toilets? <br/>
&gt; Indoor<br/>
&gt; &gt; fireplace and kitchen? Nearby swimming pool? A separate room for <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; leaders to escape the noise of your troop? Sounds rather <br/>
idyllic, <br/>
&gt; don't you<br/>
&gt; &gt; think?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What? What's that you say? You're trying to read these clues to <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; troopmates but don't know how to pronounce that "I" word in the <br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; paragraph? Well, you know what they always say, "Look it up in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; dictionary!" As a matter of fact, one of the amenities (okay, <br/>
look <br/>
&gt; that one<br/>
&gt; &gt; up too) at camp is a collection of books for your reading <br/>
&gt; enjoyment. Find<br/>
&gt; &gt; the dictionary and you'll find a most unusual letterbox!!"<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ["Pioneer" is the name of the first box I placed there...and <br/>
&gt; refers to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact that it is hidden at a platform tent site called <br/>
&gt; Trailblazer.  The name<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the lodge is "Idle-A-While", hence the reference <br/>
to "idyllic".  <br/>
&gt; The book<br/>
&gt; &gt; itself will be on a bookshelf by a set of old encyclopedias that <br/>
&gt; never get<br/>
&gt; &gt; used, so no one will pay any attention to it unless they are <br/>
&gt; looking for<br/>
&gt; &gt; it.]<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hey, this is kind of nice that you guys can't go looking for <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; box!  This<br/>
&gt; &gt; way I can share this info with you instead!<br/>

Anyway, if you didn't get a chance to work on the challenge yet, <br/>
don't give up just because of that -- it is still a lot of fun and a <br/>
great brain-teaser.  And if you solve it, you get the Kimball <br/>
Library stamp image from Tom and your name on his successful solvers <br/>
page, which is quite an accomplishment as there are less than 50 <br/>
people who have solved this thing!<br/>
<br/>
I've heard from a number of you (a couple in frustration) who really <br/>
enjoyed the diversion from the customary TOTW.  I am glad it is <br/>
being enjoyed!  My hope is that working through clues like this may <br/>
get you thinking along the lines of some more challenging and <br/>
cryptic clues of your own.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I need to do some work on this thing myself ;-)<br/>

Congratulations also to Tom for solving the quest!  And I too, have <br/>
muddled my way through to the end of the hunt to become a gilded <br/>

I hope that others will try their luck and/or continue the search if <br/>
you have already started -- if for no other reason than to get <br/>
that "YEH!" feeling when you realize it has all come together.<br/>

Good luck!<br/>

I had the same problem with number one as SpringChick did- the others I pretty much had, but that stupid no. one must have had me stumped for a long while.  My students are used to me seeking out riddles to try and solve, so they were all rooting me on (actually, I think they were avoiding their test, but they ARE 7th graders, and it IS the end of the year, so short attention spans are to be expected)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Deedle &amp; I are almost there.  One reason I knew #1 right off the bat also has to do with my favorite book (which I read for a class as an English major :).  It's a rather long &amp; complex read, but it's one of those stories that felt like the author was talking about MY LIFE as I read it.  There are 2 time frames, one happens in the 60's where this reknowned scientist is part of a group working to crack the DNA code.  Flash forward to the early 80's, where Franklin, a former art PhD (all but his dissertation is done) works the night shift overseeing some computers with this funny old man, who Franklin discovers used to be a reknowned scientist in the area of DNA who dropped off the face of the earth.  He seeks out the help of a research librarian to learn more about his co-worker.  There's also a lot of technical jargon, because the book also deals with the concept that this one musical composition was composed in the same manner as human DNA.  (I skimmed through most of the technical<br/>
 stuff when I read it back in college.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid that if I write the title on list I'll give away #1, so if you're interested in picking up this book while doing your library snooping, email me off list for the author &amp; title.<br/>
