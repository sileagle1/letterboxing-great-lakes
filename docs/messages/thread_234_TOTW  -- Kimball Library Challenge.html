                    <div class="plaintext-content">Instead of a TOTW, this week I am presenting a challenge...<br>
<br>
Has anyone on this list solved the Kimball Library box (see post <br>
#592 on this list)?  In glancing at the list of names, none looked <br>
familiar, although I am not certain of everyone's real names.<br>
<br>
I hereby challenge each of you to solve this letterbox clue... and <br>
will provide a handcarved stamp for the first person who is a member <br>
of this group (and who has not already solved this box) whose name <br>
appears on the list of successful seekers at Tom's site.<br>
<br>
The link to the clue page is in the previously mentioned post and <br>
also in the LINKS section of this group.<br>
<br>
Good Luck!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've heard from two people who have sent their Kimball Library <br>
Letterbook solutions to Tom Cooch.  Don't know yet who was first, or <br>
if the solutions are correct.  Kudos to both Delirium and Tom and <br>
Jill!<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you didn't get a chance to work on the challenge yet, <br>
don't give up just because of that -- it is still a lot of fun and a <br>
great brain-teaser.  And if you solve it, you get the Kimball <br>
Library stamp image from Tom and your name on his successful solvers <br>
page, which is quite an accomplishment as there are less than 50 <br>
people who have solved this thing!<br>
<br>
I've heard from a number of you (a couple in frustration) who really <br>
enjoyed the diversion from the customary TOTW.  I am glad it is <br>
being enjoyed!  My hope is that working through clues like this may <br>
get you thinking along the lines of some more challenging and <br>
cryptic clues of your own.<br>
<br>
Now, I need to do some work on this thing myself ;-)<br>

Oh!  Oh!  I clocked in the email to tcooch at 1:50 today.  What time did<br>
you get, Mister and Misses Tom and Jill?  And don't say 1:49, or I shall<br>
be forced to arm wrestle you for the prize.  And I need to warn you that<br>
I'm a mean arm wrestler.  *grin*<br>
<br>
Thanks again to SpringChick for an awesome (and highly entertaining)<br>
TOTW<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Delirium- black belt in arm wrestling<br>

Letterbook challenge.  Congratulations!  Are you coming to the <br>
gathering?  If so, I can bring along the stamp at that time.  If <br>
not, I will mail it (send me your mailing address off list).<br>
<br>
Congratulations also to Tom for solving the quest!  And I too, have <br>
muddled my way through to the end of the hunt to become a gilded <br>
treasure seeker (reaching around to lightly pat myself on the <br>
back).  Anyone else make it all the way through yet?<br>
<br>
I hope that others will try their luck and/or continue the search if <br>
you have already started -- if for no other reason than to get <br>
that "YEH!" feeling when you realize it has all come together.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

I had the same problem with number one as SpringChick did- the others I pretty much had, but that stupid no. one must have had me stumped for a long while.  My students are used to me seeking out riddles to try and solve, so they were all rooting me on (actually, I think they were avoiding their test, but they ARE 7th graders, and it IS the end of the year, so short attention spans are to be expected)<br>
<br>
I will be at the Gathering, so no need to mail the stamp.  (Yay!  I win a Prize!  At the Gathering!  How "Highlander"!  Another time, McCloud! *cue Queen music*)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Deedle & I are almost there.  One reason I knew #1 right off the bat also has to do with my favorite book (which I read for a class as an English major :).  It's a rather long & complex read, but it's one of those stories that felt like the author was talking about MY LIFE as I read it.  There are 2 time frames, one happens in the 60's where this reknowned scientist is part of a group working to crack the DNA code.  Flash forward to the early 80's, where Franklin, a former art PhD (all but his dissertation is done) works the night shift overseeing some computers with this funny old man, who Franklin discovers used to be a reknowned scientist in the area of DNA who dropped off the face of the earth.  He seeks out the help of a research librarian to learn more about his co-worker.  There's also a lot of technical jargon, because the book also deals with the concept that this one musical composition was composed in the same manner as human DNA.  (I skimmed through most of the technical<br>
 stuff when I read it back in college.)<br>
 <br>
I'm afraid that if I write the title on list I'll give away #1, so if you're interested in picking up this book while doing your library snooping, email me off list for the author & title.<br>
