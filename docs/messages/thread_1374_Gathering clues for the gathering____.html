early for the gathering, and since the gathering is -<br>
wow - in only a matter of weeks, I pulled out the pile<br>
of clues from when we went to SE MI last August to<br>
sort through what we haven't found yet.  Wow, how<br>
things change in less than a year.  All the *sniff*<br>
Delirium boxes that we never had a chance to find<br>
before she moved, all the *sigh* new boxes that have<br>
been placed so that we'll never have enough time to<br>
find them all....<br>
<br>
But I digress.  I was hoping that some of the SE MI<br>
natives might be able to let me know the status of<br>
some boxes which are no longer listed on<br>
letterboxing.org - basically, do we know if these<br>
boxes still exist?<br>
<br>
Squirrel's Stash in West Bloomfield (Oakland)<br>
<br>
Woodward Dream Cruise 2004 in Ferndale (Oakland)<br>
(these clues ARE on letterboxing.org, but the way the<br>
title's written, was this a one-day-only plant?)<br>
<br>
The Finding Your Way series in Grosse Ile (Wayne) -<br>
these I think were planted by the historical society<br>
or some other organization so they probably were<br>
pulled.  Darn that bridge being out when we tried to<br>
find them in August!<br>
<br>
Not that we really need any more boxes to look for,<br>
but if anyone knows about any of the above, let us<br>
know.<br>

I'm sure we'll be on I-94 at some point during the<br>
weekend, but from where we're coming from in Ohio,<br>
we'll probably be taking 127 or 23 to get into<br>
Michigan, depending on the route we choose.  <br>
