Ohio is up in the rotation for hosting the 2013 Great Lakes Gathering. As is customary I would like to hear from anyone who is interested in hosting the event. Typically the gathering is held on a Saturday in late May or early June -- exact date is host's choice.<br/>

I did have one individual contact me expressing interest, but she has backed out, so if you are interested, please step up!<br/>

Please respond to the list or to me directly by Saturday, Nov. 3. If there are multiple parties interested in hosting the event we can try to hook them up or a vote will be taken based on proposed date and location.<br/>

As there has not been any interest in hosting the 2013 GLG from anyone in Ohio, the opportunity then moves to the next state in the rotation. In the interest of saving time, I am not going to go state by state, rather open it up to anyone who is interested, with preference being given to the next state in the rotation (MN, IN, IL, MI, WI).<br/>

&gt; There has been some buzz recently about next year's Great Lakes Gathering, so let's get this thing going!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ohio is up in the rotation for hosting the 2013 Great Lakes Gathering. As is customary I would like to hear from anyone who is interested in hosting the event. Typically the gathering is held on a Saturday in late May or early June -- exact date is host's choice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did have one individual contact me expressing interest, but she has backed out, so if you are interested, please step up!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please respond to the list or to me directly by Saturday, Nov. 3. If there are multiple parties interested in hosting the event we can try to hook them up or a vote will be taken based on proposed date and location.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

I'm just checking in to see if a state/location has been chosen for this year.  We're new letterboxers, and I would love to attend GLG2013.  But, we do have twins, and limited vacation time while everyone in my office goes on maternity leave this spring/summer, so I was hoping to get on the calendar before everyone else...<br/>
