We didn’t meet everyone but had a great time sitting and talking.  It is events like this that get us inspired to carve and plant more.  So this spring there will be a bunch of new things to plant.  Can’t wait to do this again next year.  Thanks to everyone for all their hard work.<br/>

We too want to chime in regarding the delightful "LIFE of Winter" event!  The day couldn't have been more beautiful!  When we saw the temp reading around 18 degrees we were a little skeptical at the enjoyment factor...but with no wind and warm sunny skies the outdoor trails were perfect...actually leaning toward too warm at one point!<br/>
<br/>
It felt good to breath in the fresh air, hike to the different abandoned military sites, charming cemetery, the beautiful birds of prey display and of course the stamps.  Great location, great friends and of course food...Tonto especially happy to be re-acquainted with the Atomic Beans' Revel Bars!<br/>
<br/>
It felt so good to our bodies and souls to enjoy the fantastic outdoors...we realized we had fallen victim to tendencies of hibernation due to the wintry season...but the event sparked a bigger truth that trails and letterboxing in these winter months can offer just as much pleasure and joy....so bundle up and get out there and box!<br/>
Thank you ggghiker, TrailRider and their supportive mates for providing this winter delight!<br/>

Many thanks to ggghiker (and her able assistant TrailRider) for another<br/>
great event! It was a sparkling day with lots of bright sunshine and just a<br/>
fine layer of snow, so it was great to be outside on the trails. The loop to<br/>
find the boxes took us past some interesting historical military areas as<br/>
well as some impressive birds of prey. Thanks also to those that contributed<br/>

Inside there was a LOT of tasty food and, as always, it was fun to catch up<br/>

boxes for the event!<br/>
<br/>
Inside there was a LOT of tasty food and, as always, it was fun to catch up<br/>
with our long-time letterboxing friends as well as meet some new ones.<br/>
<br/>
This is always such a nice event to touch base with the GL letterboxing<br/>
community in the "off season". Hopefully the tradition will continue and<br/>
there will be another DOW event next year.<br/>
