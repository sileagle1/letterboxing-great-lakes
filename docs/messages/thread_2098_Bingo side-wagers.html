started to wonder how long that game might go. After all, there are<br>
150 items on the list. How long might it take for your 30-item list to<br>
be `called' before you've got BINGO?<br>
Maybe early to mid-February? How about March? Could be April or even<br>
May. Who knows?<br>
If you'd like to add some excitement to the Letterboxing Bingo game,<br>
here's how:<br>
Email me the date you think the game will end. In other words, when<br>
will she pull the item that finally completes some player's list?<br>
<br>
I must have your guess before January 1, 2006.<br>
Mail to jparkerg at Yahoo dot com<br>
(my usual address for this group)<br>
In the subject line, put "Bingo".<br>
<br>
I'll award the winner's prize to the person who comes closest to the<br>
actual day or is closest before the day the Bingo Game ends. If you<br>
choose February 15th, for example, and someone else chooses the 20th,<br>
and the game ends on the 19th, you win. In other words, you'll hold<br>
all of the days until the next guesser hits the calendar. But you<br>
don't know who has chosen which days or how far apart they've fallen<br>
(and neither does SC!).<br>
<br>
I'll select a prize for the lucky winner.<br>
You do not need to be a player in the big game to participate;<br>
however, if you are a player in the Letterbox Bingo Game and you win<br>
the side-wager, you'll get a special prize.<br>
<br>
For more about SpringChick's game, check the files section of our<br>
Great Lakes Letterboxing Group. Go to: LBBING, towards the bottom of<br>
the files list.<br>
Both the main list and the rules are included.<br>
There is still time to get into the game.<br>
