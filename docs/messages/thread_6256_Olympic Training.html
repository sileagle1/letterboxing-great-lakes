I see dat India have a population problem.  Here be two jokes I found on an<br/>
Indian website:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the population keeps expanding, the government may have to follow these<br/>
drastic steps:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---Offer people in foreign countries a 10,000-rupee bonus if they adopt an<br/>
Indian child and a 100,000-rupee bonus if they adopt an Indian adult.<br/>
<br/>
---Train more Indians in computer science and put them on the next boat to<br/>
America. Make sure they can clearly utter at least one English sentence to<br/>
ensure that they land a job. That sentence, of course, would be: "I am<br/>
knowing how to program."<br/>
<br/>

Maybe you also be a programmer, helpin' de IPhone people wit de Apps?<br/>

Indeed, we are representing Iceland this year.  The choice of Iceland <br/>
was decided by 6 or 7 girls back in November.  Site Sleuths understands <br/>
how this goes...  :-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, we have been VERY busy training instead of keeping up with email. <br/>
Mysterina and I were at an Irish hilly camp this past weekend.  We hiked <br/>
many miles up and down the snowy and icy hills.  Unfortunately for us, <br/>
Clue Tracker reported no letterboxes within a 10 mile radius of the <br/>
camp.  We'll have to plant a few boxes in that area next spring.<br/>
<br/>
Although Team Iceland has not yet won a medal in the Winter Olympics, we <br/>
are confident that our technological advancements will surpass those who <br/>
  are merely using performance enhancing drugs.<br/>
<br/>
-- MichKathy<br/>
<br/>
p.s. We are among the happiest people in the world and we would be happy <br/>
to welcome any immigrants to Team Iceland.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok,so the Rabbits have been so busy training for the Olympics we haven't had much time for the message boards! ;-) See, we have these two awesome personal trainers.... The first one's name is Snowshoe Rabbit....and he has got us moving from the moment we wake up in the morning till bedtime and beyond!! ;-) Let's see....we do lots of sprinting (to get to him as he is getting into everything from the cat food to the toilet to eating bugs.....he really likes to challenge us....see what we are made of!) We do lots of weight lifting (at least 24 pounds several times a day). There is lots of endurance involved too......especially on those days that he decides that he is just NOT going to take a nap (AKA-many days)and is grumpy, not to mention, loud about that all day! Oh, and I can't forget the night training.....lately he has been getting us up SEVERAL times a night.....you know.....making sure to keep us on our toes.....and that we are ready for ANYTHING, anytime! :-) While our trainer Noah is helping us with the physical we have another awesome trainer, Rainy-Day Rabbit, who helps us and challenges us in the thinking department! Lately it has been one mental challenge (AKA-battle) after another......and just when you think you have got it down.....she mixes it up on you and you have to start all over figuring it all out!! That should really help us when we have to puzzle out some of those "Olympic" clues!! And, have I mentioned that our trainers have us on a strict diet?? It's called Snowshoe and Rainy-Day eat and we finish off the leftovers!! ;-) Good stuff.....really builds up the self-control!! So....lots of hard-core training going on here in the Rabbit "Burrow".....our only hope is that our trainers do not train us TOO hard and leave us completely wiped out come the big day!;-)But hey, why am I telling you all this?? I really shouldn't be letting you all in on our secrets here! :-) Don't want to give anyone else an edge!! <br/>

P.S.-I'm sure that if you really thought about it someone out there could guess which country the Rabbits are representing!<br/>
