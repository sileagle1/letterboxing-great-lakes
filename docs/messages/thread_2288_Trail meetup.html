                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got back from Florida.  Was looking for "Fun n Sun" in Lake <br/>
Griffin State Park, Leesburg, Fl.--not exactly a tourist spot.  Walked <br/>
along taking pictures on the trail enjoying myself when I came around <br/>
a curve to the spot where the box was to be near a bench.  The couple <br/>
sitting on the bench, with stuff spread all around them, looked at me <br/>
with my backpack and sheet of paper and said "Do you want to do an <br/>
exchange?"  I met Old Hounder and Siamese from Littleton, Mass.  <br/>
Siamese ran back to their car for their exchange book while Old <br/>
Hounder and I chatted a bit.  They have done about 800 boxes in their <br/>
first year of boxing.  I mentioned the Great Lakes Gathering to them.<br/>
