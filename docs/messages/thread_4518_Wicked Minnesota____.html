It's nice to see that you'll have a good turnout and I hope someone <br>
posts a bit of a report (and photos?) after the event.  We'd love to <br>
hear how the folks in the westernmost part of our region are doing!<br>

The gathering was a huge success. The Red Cat put<br>
together a great time for everyone. There were enough<br>
boxes, event stamps and exchanges to keep us all busy.<br>
I finished the day with 13 boxes, 7 event stamps, 11<br>
exchanges, 4 personal travelers, 4 hitchhikers, and<br>
one cootie. It was so nice to have a gathering where<br>
we could all get together and box the day away. The<br>
last time MN. had a gathering was last November. Way<br>
too long. In fact, we were all just talking earlier<br>
about how jealous we were of the many many many many<br>
many gatherings our friends who live a few hours to<br>
our east have (just one more rivalry between our<br>
states, but you guys win this one). We will definetely<br>
have more gatherings in the future. It would be nice<br>
to have more of our fellow MN boxers come out to<br>
gatherings. Of the 45 people I contacted only 9 signed<br>
up for the gathering. We still had a blast though, I'm<br>
not sure what the final count was for attendance. We<br>
even had a small surprise contingent from WI. Optic,<br>
out of Chippewwa Falls and Kayakin' Monkey, who hails<br>
from Madison made the drive SPECIFICALLY for the<br>
gathering. Thank you to them for driving over to enjoy<br>
the beautiful fall weather with us.<br>
<br>
Speaking of which, Red Cat and I were talking (like we<br>
did last year around this time) it would be great to<br>
have the 2008 GLK gathering here in MN. We already<br>
have a fantastic idea of where to have it. I would<br>
like to say this is a request to have it here. If my<br>
memory serves me right, I do believe MN and IN have<br>
not hosted gatherings yet. We would love to see<br>
everyone here in '08. We'll see what happens.<br>
<br>
As far as pictures go, I did not take any. But I'm<br>
sure they will surface before long.<br>
<br>
<br>
Repeat after me: MN '08 MN '08 MN'08 MN'08 MN'08<br>
<br>
Have a great day everyone, I missed seeing everyone at<br>
the GLK gathering this year.<br>
