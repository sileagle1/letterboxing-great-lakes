                    <div class="plaintext-content">She was born in early September.  We've managed to go out on a couple letterboxing adventures so far, but having two young ones definitely cuts into our time on the trail, much to Atom's disappointment.  We missed two great fall gatherings due to the timing of her birth, but we hope to attend DOW III and Silo 7 this winter.  This weekend we have plans to scope out the location for this year's winter boxing series, so we're still managing to do some boxing whenever we can! ;)<br>
