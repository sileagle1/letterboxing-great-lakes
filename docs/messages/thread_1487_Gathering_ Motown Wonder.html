  gathering is still there?  I don't know who brought it, so I can't ask <br/>

Motown Wonder box they were stopped by a Metropark policeman on the way <br/>
back to their car. Apparently parking at the canoe camp area is only <br/>
for authorized group campers.  In fact, the policeman said the driveway <br/>
is usually locked.  <br/>
<br/>
So..... if you go looking for this box you should probably park in the <br/>
Rapids View area and then, on foot, follow the paved pathway north, <br/>
then through the camping area to get to the Canoe Camp area.  <br/>
Apparently it is "legal" to be at that end of the park -- they just <br/>
don't want anyone parking there. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know whether the Motown Wonder box that was planted <br/>
&gt; &gt; for the <br/>
&gt; &gt; gathering is still there?  I don't know who brought it, so I <br/>
can't <br/>
&gt; &gt; ask <br/>
&gt; &gt; them directly.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes, I'm hoping Motown Wonder (purple clue sheet) is still there <br/>
&gt; and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; intended that it remain as a permanent box. (I didn't hear if <br/>
&gt; anyone <br/>
&gt; &gt; found it.  Since we hid it shortly before 10:00 pm the night <br/>
&gt; before the <br/>
&gt; &gt; gathering, hopefully the clues were OK).   I'll be posting <br/>
&gt; official <br/>
&gt; &gt; clues on LBNA later this week.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We got home late last night after a long boxing weekend and am <br/>
&gt; now <br/>
&gt; &gt; stuck back inside the office.  I'll post a longer report <br/>
&gt; tomorrow.  We <br/>
&gt; &gt; really enjoyed meeting more boxers from the GLK region and <br/>
&gt; appreciate <br/>
&gt; &gt; all the effort that went into making it such a fun event!<br/>
