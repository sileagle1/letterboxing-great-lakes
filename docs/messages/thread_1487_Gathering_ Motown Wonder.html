  Does anyone know whether the Motown Wonder box that was planted for the <br>
  gathering is still there?  I don't know who brought it, so I can't ask <br>
  them directly.  I was considering going back to look for that one, <br>
  since I ran out of time/energy before I got to it.  Hard to believe <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey everyone - I just heard from TJMich who said after they found the <br>
Motown Wonder box they were stopped by a Metropark policeman on the way <br>
back to their car. Apparently parking at the canoe camp area is only <br>
for authorized group campers.  In fact, the policeman said the driveway <br>
is usually locked.  <br>
<br>
So..... if you go looking for this box you should probably park in the <br>
Rapids View area and then, on foot, follow the paved pathway north, <br>
then through the camping area to get to the Canoe Camp area.  <br>
Apparently it is "legal" to be at that end of the park -- they just <br>
don't want anyone parking there. <br>
