Hmmmm.....I found a quite flattened (and desiccated!) bluejay's<br>
remains atop a box placement yesterday. It almost looked as though it<br>
had been deliberately placed.<br>
It did make checking the box an iffy proposition. (But then I'm a<br>
devout coward.)<br>

We also went out boxing on Thursday after my dentist appointment.  But <br>
after finding 2 others in Schaumburg, I started getting a migraine so <br>
we headed home without the Character Carousel. It would have been nice <br>
to have been FF at the carousel, but it took over 5 hours before my <br>
head was willing to think again! <br>
<br>
I went back today, but was only able to find #2 and #4 before I had to <br>
go pick up my rental car for work next week.  So I'll have to try <br>
again later!<br>

surprised to see that the Cottontails were FFs.  No fair -- you guys live close and can go <br>
on a weekday, whereas we had to wait for the first weekend day to drive all the way up to <br>
Schaumburg. ;)  But anyway, great series Lavendar!  Box #3 was pretty tricky, and then <br>
when we realized where it was, there was a family BBQ-ing right next to it!  We did boxes <br>
4 and 5 while we waited for them to finish.<br>
<br>
All in all though, it was a GREAT day for boxing in Schaumburg on Saturday.  We also did <br>
the other 4 boxes by Lavendar, as well as "What a Scream!" by the Cottontails up there.<br>
