I'm hesitant to post this, only because it means that the weekend really is over.  I was looking so forward to this weekend, and was not disappointed.  The carvings were amazing, the food plentiful, and the company as always wonderful! :)  And it was really nice that we're at a point now in our "boxing careers" where there are still plenty of new people to meet, but we also recognize more and more faces when we get together.  I hope to have some photos posted if not today then by the end of the week.  <br>
<br>
Until we all gather again! :)<br>
