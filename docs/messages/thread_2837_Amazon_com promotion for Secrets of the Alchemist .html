book in question is the sequel to A Treasure's Trove (which featured <br/>
clues that led to hidden jewel animals around the U.S.) and is being <br/>
released in Sept. Amazon is doing a weekly "treasure hunt" on its site <br/>
leading up to the release (details: <br/>
http://www.alchemistdar.com/Public/MediaRoom/AmazoncomandATreasuresTrove<br/>
Hunt/index.cfm) which involves solving puzzles. I haven't had a chance <br/>
to check it out, but it seems to me like something a bunch of <br/>
letterboxers might be interested in! <br/>
