<br/>
The Department of Passports and the Itinerary Special Section have<br/>
been notified, and have certified, that the team of Grandvilla &amp;<br/>
Mobiusklein have circumnavigated the globe in a manner sufficient to<br/>
meet all requirements specified in the challenge presented by <br/>
"Around the World in 80 Days" letterbox series.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did the aforementioned Grandvilla &amp; Mobiusklein successfully<br/>
traverse the fifteen secret locations, and remit the requisite proof,<br/>
they accomplished their feat in barely a fortnight!<br/>
<br/>
The "80 Days" Travel Staff is astounded by this stupendous<br/>
act of clue solving.<br/>
The names "Grandvilla" and "Mobiusklein" will be entered in the<br/>
appropriate logbooks to commemorate their accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
Other travelers have reported incremental success and so the<br/>
Department of Passports expects to have others soon qualifying for not<br/>
only the "World Traveler" bonus  stamp, but the highly<br/>
prized, "Around the World in 80 Days" bonus as well. <br/>
<br/>
The D of P has asked the Itinerary Special Section staff to remind<br/>
other potential travelers that Passports are still available and that<br/>
the accomplishment of Grandvilla &amp; Mobiusklein (their superb skills<br/>
notwithstanding) indicates that success is certainly possible for<br/>
others who wish to travel "Around the World in 80 Days".<br/>
