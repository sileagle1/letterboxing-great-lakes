I wouldn't call 29 a "pretty dismal showing" by any measure! Some of<br/>
who peppered our lists with choices from every category did not make 29.<br/>
 I'll have to compare lists with WiHi and others, but I'll bet those<br/>
of us who proudly listed lots of exchanges or obscure boxes realized<br/>
as the game went on that action was more often in section A.<br/>
<br/>
And, *our* thanks as well to SpringChick for keeping us entertained<br/>
through the winter.<br/>

&gt;  I'll have to compare lists with WiHi and others, but I'll bet those<br/>
&gt; of us who proudly listed lots of exchanges or obscure boxes realized<br/>
&gt; as the game went on that action was more often in section A.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, *our* thanks as well to SpringChick for keeping us entertained<br/>
&gt; through the winter.<br/>

Well, we both tied with you.  Martini Man and I each made it to 27 when the<br/>
game ended.<br/>
<br/>
The words we still needed were PZ Kut (WH), Pico (MM), Mad Cow Letterbox<br/>
(both) and Thanks for the RIde (both).<br/>

Our thanks also go to SpringChick for the winter (and spring!) diversion.<br/>

Wow, my remaining three were - PZKUT, Pico and Wendell Wilkie!  I didn't<br/>
figure many would have Wendel on their list, unless they love to visit old<br/>
cemeteries, which Rush County has in abundance with letterboxes.  Thanks<br/>
to Jabber &amp; JoBob.<br/>
<br/>
I will give a thumbs-up to Rush County area for great cemetery boxes and<br/>
Covered Bridges.  FYI, if you love old cemeteries and history, Wendell<br/>
Wilkie's resting spot is a NOT-TO-BE MISSED piece of history.<br/>

I love cemetery letterboxes (which is why we've placed 3 so far), but <br/>
I'm not sure if I can bring myself to go to Rushville.  Not since <br/>
their high school and my high school (Perry Meridian) made it to the <br/>
Elite Eight in boys basketball--and they beat us to go on to the Final <br/>
Four.  We were robbed!  Of course, that was 30 years ago, but Hoosier <br/>
Hysteria runs long and deep!  But for some good letterboxes, I "might" <br/>
go there if we are ever in the area.<br/>

We're heading to Michigan for vacation this summer, so I would love to <br/>

the beach and getting munchies at the Cherry Hut and playing games and <br/>

In the mean time, to work off some of this frustration and anticipation of winning some of the bootie of fabulous prizes, let's go outside and find some letterboxes.  Or better yet, winter is a good time to start thinking of new boxes and new locations to hide them. Maybe this will help switch our focus from this nail biting game.  <br/>

I, too thought I wouldn't see you here... and like the others, I've seen your stamp in every <br/>
box I've ever found (not to mention my boxes when I go to "maintenance" them.) <br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you've come to the list and I think you'll enjoy it!!! I know I do, and I don't get to <br/>
pay as much attention to the list as I would like. There's lots of dialog on every aspect of <br/>
letterboxing, and so fun to "meet" everyone. I loved your "Christmas Story" letterbox... and <br/>
so far it's been my favorite letterbox find: Very creative and thought out: both the clues <br/>
and the box!<br/>

Have a great Friday!<br/>

"In this day &amp; age of "instant gratification" and "short attention <br/>
spans" it's interesting that a game that lasts months still holds our <br/>
attention so much."<br/>
<br/>
I hope Spring Chick and Azobox realize just how much their little <br/>
games meant to all of us...Now that "WiHi" mentions it, we all at <br/>
some point every day for the last 100 plus days escaped from the <br/>
stress and complications that life threw at us and, even if for just <br/>
a minute, thought about the game...Each day gave us a renewed sense <br/>
of hope that we either could cross off another word or look forward <br/>
to doing better the next day.  I can't think of too many other things <br/>
that got my consistent attention on a daily basis during that same <br/>
time...Well, maybe the annoying daily thought that comes around 5 PM <br/>
of, "What should I make for dinner"...But that is another topic.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think any of us would have fallen for letterboxing in general <br/>
if it was all about instant gratification.  Let's face it, many of <br/>
our friends and family don't get why we would spend hours pouring <br/>
over clues and puzzles that eventually may lead us on a wild goose <br/>
chase that is miles or even states away!  All for the possibility of <br/>
finding a treasured piece of rubber in a plastic container that comes <br/>
with no guarantee that the box will even be there (or in our case, <br/>
that we were able to figure out the clues correctly!)<br/>
<br/>
As letterboxers, we can feel good that we have discovered that the <br/>
gratification comes in the journey!  But, there is the additional <br/>
hope of an EXTRA reward at the end of the trail of a box to stamp <br/>
into. Sounds a lot like the BINGO game with WOM's and more elusive <br/>
clues being a sort of side wager game....don't you think?<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations to the official Bingo winners!<br/>
But, really we are all winners! We survived another winter together!<br/>
(Although, those living in the UP or Cleveland are still in winter's <br/>
grasp.  Our hope for you is that the snow will melt quickly!)<br/>
<br/>
"Don't toot a ten PI"...who still have two empty spaces and aren't <br/>
giving up on being one of the two other BINGO winners!<br/>

Tiptoe will bravely shout back at their mocking, "You just wait until you see Tonto and me <br/>

I'm in that same limbo-hell as you, but I've been waiting for "only" 10 days. Same word, <br/>
however. I agree that if the evil word is called, there will be at least 20 winners. So I'm not <br/>
gettin' up early anymore ;-)<br/>

Anyway, I thought the bingo rules were that there can be ties for the <br/>
wins.  Meaning, if multiple people (like today) call bingo on the same <br/>
day, they tie for 2nd place.  So I would think the game is still be <br/>
active for 3rd place winner(s).  I also didn't think there was any <br/>
reason to get up at the crack of dawn when SpringChick draws/posts the <br/>
word to win -- you'd win even if you didn't check that day but you still <br/>
had that word on your card.<br/>

<br/>
I was one away from a straightline Bingo when that was called. the<br/>
word i needed was of course called shortly after that.<br/>
I had no hope of the 4 corners, and only a slight hope of the X.<br/>
<br/>
when i hit Uno, it was for perimeter and full card both.<br/>
And there i have sat.....<br/>
<br/>
I must say it kept the incredibly long winter interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Spring Chick!<br/>

&gt; &gt;have waited 10 days now for my last word to be called and still<br/>

&gt; &gt;Spring Chick is just trying to make this game last as long as<br/>
pollible.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Can someone please light a fire under her and turn up the heat a<br/>
degree<br/>
&gt; &gt;or two and call my word.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I have you beat there! I've been waiting 16 days! And I am<br/>
&gt; pretty sure PPE has been waiting a few days longer than that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All I know is, I hate "trail maps". I needed one to find my way to<br/>
&gt; the 4 corners, I needed one to find my way around the perimeter,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; I still need one to fill up! Ack. Evil, evil trail maps!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I gave up on bingo about a week ago. I even almost threw away my<br/>
&gt; sheet! As in real bingo, I'm a perpetual waiter, never a<br/>
&gt; bingo-er! I'd rather be 6 away and have "no hope", than be sitting<br/>
&gt; on one-left day after day after day going through the torture and<br/>
&gt; agony of opening up yet another email only to find out I've been<br/>
&gt; thwarted yet again. Sigh. LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a feeling the SC is dreading the fact that 12 people may<br/>
call<br/>
&gt; bingo with the next word! Talk about prize distribution hell, 12<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; tie for last place! LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That said... congratulations Tiptoe and Tonto! I'm happy for YOU,<br/>
at least!<br/>

The easiest way to do it at this point is to open up the database and click on the export link.  This should open up the entire list into one single web page.  Then use the "find on this page" tool under the edit menu tab.  You can then type in a few characters of each word you don't have crossed off to see if it was actually called.  <br/>

&gt; I'm going Cuckoo, I tell ya!  Really?  Another word I don't have?  You <br/>
&gt; have to be kidding.  of the remaining words, I have 1/3 of them, roughly, <br/>
&gt; and I still can't manage to get one called.  Crazy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I even double checked the list to be sure.... and I DID miss called words, <br/>
&gt; but they weren't on my card anyway.  They were just on the mastersheet and <br/>
&gt; I didn't mark them off of there. :(<br/>

I have 4 squares left, 2 of which are trail names, and the other 2 are general terms. I do have the wild card, so I guess technically I have 3 squares left. The problem is, I only get to cross off about 1 square a week, so at this rate I still have three weeks to go to win :-(<br/>

I agree, PackerBackers ... I am fortunate if I can cross off one word per week.  I have 3 words left, 2 trail names and 1 general term.  I do not have the wild card.  I have a feeling that if the trail names are the last to go, there will be a large number of BINGOs!  I have never before had so many of my words called, however, which has made it a lot of fun this year.  Thanks, WiHi, for a great game!<br/>
