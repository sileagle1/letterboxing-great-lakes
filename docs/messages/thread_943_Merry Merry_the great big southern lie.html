Hello list!<br/>
<br/>
Well, we're here in Mississippi, the house is (mostly) set up (ready or not, here the holiday visitors come), and most importantly, the computer was hooked up yesterday.  So I check my million and two emails, and see a thread about you poor, poor kids up there in the snow.  And I figure, hey, if I was ripped away from my native soil, at least I get to gloat about the weather, right?  At very least I get to send a witty email about how I went letterboxing today in 60 degree weather, and fretted about not bringing sunscreen, right?  'Cause everyone knows that's the big drawing feature of the south- the weather.<br/>
<br/>
WRONG!  I am "snowed in" my house right now (snowed in, of course, meaning that there's half an inch of snow on the ground and that the local Wal-Mart has run out of milk, bread, and butter because holy cow there's been two snowflakes spotted out there)- but if you don't count the pathetic attempt at snow, there's a pretty wicked ice storm tearing through here.  And it's cold.  Now, not the winter of '94, when it got to wind chills of -70, and MSU actually cancelled classes for one day, but pretty blustery.  So instead of getting to gloat, I have to haul out MY carving materials and dream of warmer days (which my neighbors assure me will come sooner than I want).  I keep telling my better half that he promised crippling heat, and gosh darnit, I want crippling heat!  But so far, all I've got is an entire state of nervous nellies who drive with their hazzards on as soon as there's a single flake spotted.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Delirium, who doesn't understand half the things people say to her down here.<br/>

south gets snow. When it happened in '90 in New<br/>
Orleans...it was the first time many of my friends had<br/>

trash bags! We got a whole whopping 1/2 inch and<br/>
school was cancelled. There's no such thing as salt or<br/>
snow plows and the last thing the authorities want is<br/>
a bunch of half-drunk cajuns sliding around on the<br/>
ice. <br/>
It never lasts, though...generally winter in the South<br/>
consists on 3 months of rain. My "winter coat" was my<br/>
Levi's jean jacket. It rarely gets colder than 55,<br/>
which would be a "heat wave" up here. I used to<br/>
complain about how "cold" it was when it was 55. Now I<br/>
only feel the cold if the wind chill is in the<br/>
negatives. You get used to it. <br/>
You'll also figure out what those Southerners are<br/>
saying soon enough. Get the book, "The Sweet Potato<br/>
Queen's Book Of Love." Jill Conner Brown writes like<br/>
most Southerners talk. Not to mention the book is<br/>
hysterical, about a troop of middle-aged ladies who<br/>
dress up and parade every St. Patrick's Day in<br/>
Jackson, Mississippi. <br/>

If it makes you feel any better, Delirium, when my family moved down<br/>
south, I came home from school the first week and asked my parents what<br/>
language the people there spoke, because I was pretty sure it wasn't<br/>
English!  Granted, I was 8 and we moved from Maine, but I know what<br/>
you're going through.  <br/>

He he he...reminds me of when my uncle first moved to<br/>
Virginia in the 80's, he called us here in Ohio to<br/>
laugh about how everything was shut down because<br/>
they'd gotten about an inch of snow, and no one knew<br/>
how to drive in it!  Of course, though, now after more<br/>
than 15 years of living there himself, he can't stand<br/>
Cleveland in the wintertime because his blood thinned<br/>
too much :)<br/>
<br/>
As for all the snow we've got here, I am so glad I<br/>
bought a Jeep Wrangler earlier this year.  I never<br/>
would have made it out of my apartment's parking lot<br/>
this morning if I still had my old Dodge Neon.  Of<br/>
course, here at work we're all rooting for them to<br/>
send us home soon - they just paged for all the<br/>
managers to meet in the main conference room.  Not<br/>
sure what I'll do if they send us home early, though -<br/>
our carving materials are at Deedle's place, not mine!<br/>

When my husband called me when he was getting ready to leave work, I said, "Well, the roads should be salted by now, so it won't be as bad".  This sent him into five minutes of hysterical laughter, while he grabbed nearby co-workers to repeat my sentence.  What rational person wouldn't expect salt trucks?<br/>
