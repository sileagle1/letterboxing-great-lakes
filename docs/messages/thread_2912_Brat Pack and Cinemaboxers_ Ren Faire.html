  I already told hubby I wanted to be there when the faire opened. (I don't think he's gonna argue with a pregnant woman with mood swings..LOL) I'm getting so excited I have a print out of the clues, things highlighted, and trying to find something to wear, which is kinda hard when I got a watermelon belly sticking out in front of me. =) (This is my 6th, yes I said 6th child, and the VERY last one.) Luckily the day will be just for hubby and me, even tho I know the kids like it too. Maybe we'll make another trip up there with them before the end of the season. =) So, Saturday is definitely on, and I can't wait to see you all there!! (HUGS)<br/>

  Oh you could make a weekend out of it - Letterboxes at the Faire, <br/>
  and MANY in the surrounding area - more as of today! You can search <br/>
  for Zion IL, and Pleasant Prairie WI to see some. <br/>

  Do let us know if you head up - we live minutes from the Bristol <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Men wearing ribbons in their hair?  You might be able to start something new at the faire.  But only if the gents thought they had something to gain by wearing ribbons in their hair. If the ribbons were given to them by the ladies as a sign of 'favors received' -nudge nudge wink wink, or a symbol of their sexual masculinity, the gents would wear ribbons proudly.  But I don't think that will even be the case.  <br/>
<br/>
Instead, to distract the men so the ladies can go letterboxing, BEER was invented.  <br/>

See you at the faire.<br/>

(or at least I don't miss anything...LOL)  I think I will take your advice KissmeKate, and wear a short shirt and get my belly painted. =)  It's only a 5 month bump, but least it's something.  LOL   I'm getting so excited that I printed out the letterbox clues, all the food places, and highlighted where I wanted to eat through LOL, and of course the 113 free things to do at the faire as well!!!  I'm like a kid in a candy store when it comes to the faire, so if ya see a very rambucious adult, pregnant of course, running through the faire, saying, "I want to do this", or "I want to try that", ya know it's me!! =)  <br/>
