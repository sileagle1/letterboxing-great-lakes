Kittens everywhere else.  Except for where people call us by our real <br>
names of Stacy, Jurene and Megan.  We started letterboxing in July <br>
2006 and immediately jumped in with both feet.  We just recently <br>
started the postals because one of the kittens hates hiking.  Plus <br>
winter is coming.  The strangest thing we have seen while boxing is a <br>
broom-propped up against a cliff face in the middle of nowhere!  Our <br>
favorite box so far is "Untitled" by midnight visitor.<br>
We live in rural northern Illinois and do all of that farming, stay-at-<br>
home, homeschool stuff.  That means we can letterbox whenever we want, <br>
not just when school/work is done!<br>
