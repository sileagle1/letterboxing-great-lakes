                    <div class="plaintext-content">Enders Angel and I have carved up SIX additional "bonus Easter Egg" <br>
boxes for our "The Fate of Easter" series (Grand Rapids, MI area)<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, these boxes will be placed close enough to the the <br>
original series that they could be gotten on the same trip. Clues <br>
will be posted soon after I get them in place.  <br>
<br>
Remember .... these six bonus boxes are only going to be available <br>
for a limited time. (Because Easter Eggs are perishable, right? LOL)<br>
We were thinking of leaving them up for two weekends, so the <br>
tenative time that they'll be removed is Mon 4/19<br>
<br>
This makes it a series of 12 boxes located in a relativly small <br>
area ..... Power-boxing anyone? LOL<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
