                    <div class="plaintext-content">There will be an informal workshop for kids conducted by Bindle Babe<br>
during the Haunted Harvest Gathering.<br>
<br>
The Foot and I probably won't be able to get out and do much boxing,<br>
so I thought I'd put together a quickie "LOG BOOKS for KIDS" workshop. <br>
<br>
We'll be making two kinds of logbooks if there's enough interest and<br>
enough time. NEEDLES are NOT needed for these bindings -- even young<br>
kids CAN play!<br>
<br>
Since I'm doing this last minute and taking the ferry, I won't be<br>
bringing all the supplies along with me. (sorry)<br>
<br>
Here is the list of supplies each participant will need to bring:<br>
* 4-8 sheets construction paper (any color)<br>
* 10-20 sheets plain printer/copier paper<br>
* 2-4 regular size rubber bands (about the size of a hair-twist tie)<br>
Kids can go out and find their own sticks for the binding while we're<br>
at the Gathering Park<br>
<br>
Additional supplies that would be <b> REALLY </b> helpful if anyone<br>
could bring for sharing:<br>
* Paper hole punch (single one, the hand held kind)<br>
* Scissors (Kid safe ones would be great)<br>
<br>
Supplies to be provided:<br>
Cotton thread for the bindings on one of the logbook styles<br>
<br>
Send questions or an email to let me know if you'll be able to bring<br>
supplies for sharing to me at bindlestiff_boxer at yahoo dot com<br>
(don't forget the underscore mark)<br>
<br>
The storm caused power problems in the marina last night which remain<br>
unresolved, so I'm going to be without internet access from now (Thurs<br>
7pm) until Mrs DogLvrs and I get checked into our hotel room tomorrow<br>
afternoon. We have wi-fi in the room and I'll bring my laptop, so I<br>
should be able to answer email Fri after 2pm.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
