                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was doing maintenance on "Frog Preserves" a while back and picked up a signature stamp that had been dropped nearby.  The stamp is of a long skeleton key, and if I remember correctly, the trail name used to stamp in was something like "Traveling Londoners."  When I found it I stuffed it into my pack and promptly forgot about it.  Just ran across it again last weekend.  If anyone claims it let me know offline and I will get it in the mail.<br>
