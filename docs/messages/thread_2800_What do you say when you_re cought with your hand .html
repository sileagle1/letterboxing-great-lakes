<br>
I agree that there is no reason to outright lie, particularly if you are <br>
with kids as it does set a bad example, as you say.  But I think that most <br>
people really don't want to hear the whole spiel anyway.  It's like when <br>
somebody says, "how have you been" and they really don't want to hear the <br>
details of what's been happening in your life for the last year.  Add to <br>
that it is a little *different* and most people aren't going to *get it* and <br>
it just seems easier to skirt the issue rather than go through the <br>
explanation.  It is possible to not lie without telling the whole truth. <br>
The scavenger hunt explanation does seem to work better as most people can <br>
relate to that (although it doesn't explain the rubber stamping part if <br>
you've already begun the stamping process). If somebody stopped and asked <br>
and genuinely seemed interested in what I was doing, I might tell them, <br>
guess I'd play it by ear -- but that has never happened to me.<br>
<br>
 While providing an explanation *may* be an opportunity to introduce <br>
somebody to letterboxing, that is not generally the case and to be honest, I <br>
am not out looking for converts.  If somebody finds the game through an <br>
online site, or another participant or even a publicity piece and they are <br>
intrigued enough to research a little and then follow through with it, <br>
that's great and welcome to the game, but I don't go out of my way to add <br>
sheep to the flock.<br>
<br>
I would have to agree that the *secretive* aspect of the game adds to it for <br>
me.<br>
