I agree that there is no reason to outright lie, particularly if you are <br/>
with kids as it does set a bad example, as you say.  But I think that most <br/>
people really don't want to hear the whole spiel anyway.  It's like when <br/>
somebody says, "how have you been" and they really don't want to hear the <br/>
details of what's been happening in your life for the last year.  Add to <br/>
that it is a little *different* and most people aren't going to *get it* and <br/>
it just seems easier to skirt the issue rather than go through the <br/>
explanation.  It is possible to not lie without telling the whole truth. <br/>
The scavenger hunt explanation does seem to work better as most people can <br/>
relate to that (although it doesn't explain the rubber stamping part if <br/>
you've already begun the stamping process). If somebody stopped and asked <br/>
and genuinely seemed interested in what I was doing, I might tell them, <br/>
guess I'd play it by ear -- but that has never happened to me.<br/>
<br/>
 While providing an explanation *may* be an opportunity to introduce <br/>
somebody to letterboxing, that is not generally the case and to be honest, I <br/>
am not out looking for converts.  If somebody finds the game through an <br/>
online site, or another participant or even a publicity piece and they are <br/>
intrigued enough to research a little and then follow through with it, <br/>
that's great and welcome to the game, but I don't go out of my way to add <br/>
sheep to the flock.<br/>
<br/>
I would have to agree that the *secretive* aspect of the game adds to it for <br/>
me.<br/>

&gt;I think we strech the truth a bit because it is just easier than<br/>
&gt; going through the whole "LB" spiel. I don't know what your<br/>
&gt; experiences have been like tring to tell someone about LBing, but<br/>
&gt; most people look at me like I'm nuts! I love it when you say "you<br/>
