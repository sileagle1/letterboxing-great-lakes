and have some yummy ice cream too? Then this is the place for you! <br/>
<br/>
Please join us for a memorable afternoon getting sticky &amp; inky together <br/>
at the Yum Yum Tree in heart of downtown Brighton.  Address is 140 W <br/>
Main Street, Brighton, MI.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When: July 12th, 1:00-4:00 PM <br/>
<br/>
There are many boxes located within a short driving distance of this <br/>
location. There is also a beautiful board walk around the Mill Pond. <br/>
Across from the Millpond is the Imagination Station, a giant wooden <br/>
playstructure.<br/>
<br/>
This event has been prompted by the availability of "mudflinginfools", <br/>
from Maine, traveling ice cream social stamps...complete with cooties :)<br/>
<br/>
See you all then! It can now be said "the more the merrier &amp; cherrier", <br/>
he he he!<br/>
<br/>
Mully :)<br/>
