Subject: [LbGLK] Knights on the Quest for the Holy Grail<br>
<br>
For all ye knights also on the quest for the holy grail, let it be known that today the band of knights known as Papeseed, Triclops, and Secret Agent Mr. E will bravely try to find and face (insert dramatic music)...KILLER RABBIT! If you do not hear from us again after the holiday weekend, assume the worst fate has befallen us and be warned. If you dare follow on our trail to brave the beast yourself, please pick up our bones and give us a decent burial in Lake Michigan.<br>
<br>
Off we go, then! (clip clop, clip clop) <br>
<br>
--The Brave Dame Papeseed, and Brave Sir Triclops, and the not-so-brave Sir Mr. E<br>
