&gt; That is so true! After attending three gatherings, I STILL think of <br/>
&gt; everybody I have met by their trail names... and really have to sit <br/>
&gt; and scratch my head to remember their "real" names! <br/>

&gt; &gt; I think it was at the June '06 GL Gathering we were talking about <br/>
&gt; how <br/>
&gt; &gt; in real life, you use a person's real name and don't use nicknames, <br/>
&gt; &gt; etc. until you are very familiar with a person, but in letterboxing <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; is just the opposite -- you use their alias name and then after a <br/>
&gt; while <br/>
&gt; &gt; you learn the real names of those folks you become more familiar <br/>
&gt; with --<br/>
&gt; &gt;  and then there are a few elusive boxers of whom you never find <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; out...<br/>
