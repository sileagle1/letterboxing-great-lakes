lower SW corner as we were going there last night for some home <br>
inspections. Well we had just been in that area not too long ago and <br>
thought we had gotten all but the Three Oaks boxes.... well seems that you <br>
guys have been busy this past weekend and the secretary (who is now a boxer <br>
too.. look for The Blowfish soon!) was able to find some boxes that were <br>
recently hidden.<br>
We found SpringChick's I-94 traffic crawl box, flyin' down the highway... <br>
very cool! Neat little area. It was cool to see how nature had weaved its <br>
magic due to the storm that had just hit before we got there. Off to CMoon <br>
and Kookaburra's Chalet on the Lake. This was more difficult to locate as <br>
the street did not have a road sign and is called something different on <br>
the other side of the road. Thanks to locals out walking we managed to <br>
located the little beach and the box. Naughty dog exclaimed "no way, it <br>
can't be over there" as I proudly produce the box for him to see! Very nice <br>
stamp CMoon, were you just there on vacation?<br>
Next SpringChick's circle tour box at Warren Woods. The name escapes me at <br>
this moment. This was difficult to find as there were no signs for a state <br>
park anywhere. Naughty dog was not paying attention and I finally found the <br>
back side of the park  as he tells me he just now found it on the map. <br>
Geesh! It was getting dark and we didn't have much time left. We found the <br>
spot but unfortunately too many options with not enough light. Even a <br>
flashlight didn't help us much... have to save that one for another time.<br>
I just love getting paid to go letterboxing...<br>
Everyone have a good time at the Lazy Days gathering as I will be canoeing <br>
on the Pine River and yes, I will be getting the Serendipity box this <br>
year...!!!! Come hell or high water!!<br>
