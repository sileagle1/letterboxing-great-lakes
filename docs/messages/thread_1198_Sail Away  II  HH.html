I posted this on the other LB group beginning of this month.  I am<br>
new to this and not sure if I should post the same message to both?<br>
<br>
This HH was placed April 10th...<br>
<br>
Sail Away II hitchhiker was picked up by the Nelson clan, April 9 2005<br>
at April Fools on a glorious sunny day. We were quite surprised to<br>
find it and delighted to open the book and see its travels...our very<br>
first hitchiker! It will be taken to our first letterbox ever, not a <br>
bad thing that it should go there and back again! The road is open now<br>
and still paved with good intentions.<br>
<br>
Peace and Best wishes<br>
