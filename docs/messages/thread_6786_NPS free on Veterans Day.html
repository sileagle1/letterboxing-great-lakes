HEY VA! HAVE YOU HEARD? October 28, 2010<br/>
What do Shenandoah National Park, the Vanderbilt Mansion, and Harpers Ferry have <br/>
in common?  They are all part of the U.S. National Park system and you can visit <br/>
them all for free on Veterans Day!  In recognition of current and former service <br/>
members, the National Park Service is waiving all entrance fees to national <br/>
parks on Nov. 11, 2010.  Almost 400 of America's national parks will be open, <br/>
including Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska, Cabrillo National <br/>
Monument in California, and Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.  "I invite <br/>
everyone to take advantage of this opportunity and savor places that our <br/>
veterans have kept safe for us," said NPS Director Jon Jarvis. The national <br/>
parks hold something for everyone -- hardcore hikers and campers and people who <br/>
like to explore history, take a leisurely nature walk, or simply pack a picnic <br/>
lunch and get away from it all.  In the parks, visitors of all abilities and <br/>
interests can enjoy a holiday, often without making more than a short trip from <br/>
home. For more information, visit www.nps.gov.<br/>
