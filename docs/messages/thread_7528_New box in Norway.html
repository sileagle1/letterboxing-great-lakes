Congrats on your first Plant!  When we were new to boxing and bemoaned to SpringChick about how few boxes were in our area, she gave us some sage advice, "Plant and they will come!"  <br>

The cemetery includes a very nice zinc (aka white bronze) family monumentthat includestwo sons:<br>
<br>
Severt Waterfell, son of Ole Waterfell, and Severt Waterfell, 2nd son of Ole Waterfell. <br>
<br>
The first son lived from 1867 to 1869 and the 2nd son from 1869 to 1870. The entire family wasn't long-lived however. Another son, Canute lived to be 20; Ole lived to be 37, his wife Martha lived to be 42. The 1800s were rough times. <br>

I'm in Big Rock and Norway is about 45 minutes mostly south but a little west of me. <br>
<br>
To put it from a large city, it's about an hour and a half almost directly southwest of Chicago.<br>
<br>
It was settled in the mid 1800s by Norwegians who mostly came from New York. There's a Norwegian Settlers Memorial, a Norwegian Store, and a park that honors King Olaf V.<br>
<br>
It's right on the Fox River, but I don't think it's even a regular town, I'm pretty sure that it's still unincorporated. Norway Cemetery is chock full of Scandinavian names.<br>

When I saw your original post regarding the Norway boxes, I was hoping that would be Norway, ILLINOIS. <br>
<br>
Feel free to also make use of Norway, Illinois if you like. :) Beautiful little rural area.<br>

I have another 3 boxes that are a series that I am almost ready to plant. They will be near the Viking ships that are at all the entrances to Norway. Thor, Loki, and Leif...<br>
