When they show the shot on the slideshow of how the box was hidden when the<br/>
family finds it, it didn't look like the previous finder had done a very<br/>
good job of rehiding either.  And ya can see that both adults are already<br/>
away from the scene of the hiding place, waiting for the child, who's been<br/>
allowed to rehide the box by herself, to catch up with them.  Oh, yuck!<br/>

<br/>
Greetings from The Dragon, owner of the Go to Hell and other<br/>
letterboxes in your county.<br/>
<br/>
Myself and a number of other letterboxers are not very happy with the<br/>
article you published, particluarly since neither the article nor the<br/>
letterboxers that you interviewed stressed the main component to<br/>
letterboxing: take care of the boxes you find as if they are your own<br/>
so others may find them in excellent condition as well.  Many of us<br/>
that have letterboxes in your county are fearing for our boxes right<br/>
now because experience has shown us that if the safekeeping of boxes<br/>
is not stressed in an article, boxes tend to disappear as "newbies" go<br/>
and find the boxes without proper knowledge on how to care for them. <br/>
Many, like myself, are currently busy pulling all our clues to our<br/>
boxes in your county for that very reason. Boxes like "Go to Hell" are<br/>
only special if they remain in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to continue to print articles on letterboxing or wish to<br/>
print a follow-up article, I would strongly suggest that you inteview<br/>
more seasoned letterboxers in MI like SpringChick, Azobox. and Team<br/>
Rabbit.  I would also suggest that you point out specifically that<br/>
anyone interested in trying letterboxing MUST first refer to and take<br/>
to heart the suggestions for beginners found at the following websites: <br/>
<br/>
SpringChick's website: http://www.stampinthebox.com/start.asp<br/>
LBNA faq: http://www.letterboxing.org/GettingStarted/<br/>
particularly:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/GettingStarted/getstart_finding.htm<br/>
and<br/>
The Newboxers Group: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
Also, be advised that the individual clues to each box are owned by<br/>
the placer of the box.  Before any specific boxes are named in any<br/>
article, permission should be received by the owner of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Tim Kuehl<br/>
aka The Dragon<br/>

Dragon -- I don't think there is a way to remove a cached page from Google except to contact Google -- and even then they may not do it and I imagine it takes some time, and then they penalize you and will not list your site on Google at all for like 6 months.<br/>

Curiously, I also noticed that the letterboxing family was referred to<br/>
with their real names, not trailnames. This was also the style of an<br/>
article in the Grand Rapids (MI) Press not long ago.<br/>
<br/>
Since we all use trailnames as part of the game, I wonder if the<br/>
letterboxers in question really "get it".<br/>
<br/>
This subject has been debated and discussed again and again, but<br/>
dealing with media is a touchy proposition. As many of us learned a<br/>
couple of years ago, even mainstream/major media seldom take the time<br/>
to really understand how letterboxing really works.<br/>
<br/>
While pulling clues may seen drastic, I can't really blame those with<br/>
boxes in that area for their reactions.<br/>
I'll be curious to see if Dragon gets a respnse form the newspaper writer.<br/>

Pulling clues IS drastic, but GO TO HELL ranks #1 among my finds for<br/>
creative clue writing.  I had to go to Hell and back to find this box. <br/>
I'd also be sad to miss the first Michigan box and some others that are on<br/>
my summer 2007 list.<br/>
<br/>
I found several boxes today, last minute decision to be outdoors.  I am<br/>
making my 2007 New Year's resolution early.  I will challenge the rest of<br/>
my fellow Hoosier boxers to do the same.  Better boxes with more elusive<br/>
clues and farther into the woods.  I probably won't plant many this year,<br/>
but we are in desparate need of more quality boxes (which I would like to<br/>
Hike to find).  It seems the newer inductees need some leadership.  We<br/>
have 92 counties and we still have dozens of empty counties.<br/>

  I tried to send an educating comment to the reporter but didn't want to<br/>
  register. I figured the opinions of the box owners would carry more<br/>
  weight.<br/>
<br/>
  Pulling clues IS drastic, but GO TO HELL ranks #1 among my finds for<br/>
  creative clue writing. I had to go to Hell and back to find this box. <br/>
  I'd also be sad to miss the first Michigan box and some others that are on<br/>
  my summer 2007 list.<br/>
<br/>
  I found several boxes today, last minute decision to be outdoors. I am<br/>
  making my 2007 New Year's resolution early. I will challenge the rest of<br/>
  my fellow Hoosier boxers to do the same. Better boxes with more elusive<br/>
  clues and farther into the woods. I probably won't plant many this year,<br/>
  but we are in desparate need of more quality boxes (which I would like to<br/>
  Hike to find). It seems the newer inductees need some leadership. We<br/>
  have 92 counties and we still have dozens of empty counties.<br/>

Frankly, I'm more concerned about the family in this article than I am<br/>
the reporter (who has most likley gone on to his next assignement).<br/>
As they -- the Mankoffs -- go forth and fail to rehide carefully or<br/>
create only walk-ups, the level of letterboxing slips downward. And we<br/>
as a community of letterboxers may lose some great and historic boxes.<br/>

Our challenge to educate is the difficult one.<br/>

&gt; &gt; P.S.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Curiously, I also noticed that the letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; family was referred to<br/>
&gt; &gt; with their real names, not trailnames. This was also<br/>
&gt; &gt; the style of an<br/>
&gt; &gt; article in the Grand Rapids (MI) Press not long ago.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Since we all use trailnames as part of the game, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder if the<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxers in question really "get it".<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This subject has been debated and discussed again<br/>
&gt; &gt; and again, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; dealing with media is a touchy proposition. As many<br/>
&gt; &gt; of us learned a<br/>
&gt; &gt; couple of years ago, even mainstream/major media<br/>
&gt; &gt; seldom take the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; to really understand how letterboxing really works.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; While pulling clues may seen drastic, I can't really<br/>
&gt; &gt; blame those with<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes in that area for their reactions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll be curious to see if Dragon gets a respnse form<br/>

&gt; For those interested, here's the email I sent the reporter:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Greetings from The Dragon, owner of the Go to Hell and other<br/>
&gt; letterboxes in your county.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Myself and a number of other letterboxers are not very happy with <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; article you published, particluarly since neither the article nor <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; letterboxers that you interviewed stressed the main component to<br/>
&gt; letterboxing: take care of the boxes you find as if they are your <br/>
own<br/>
&gt; so others may find them in excellent condition as well.  Many of us<br/>
&gt; that have letterboxes in your county are fearing for our boxes <br/>
right<br/>
&gt; now because experience has shown us that if the safekeeping of <br/>
boxes<br/>
&gt; is not stressed in an article, boxes tend to disappear <br/>
as "newbies" go<br/>
&gt; and find the boxes without proper knowledge on how to care for <br/>
them. <br/>
&gt; Many, like myself, are currently busy pulling all our clues to our<br/>
&gt; boxes in your county for that very reason. Boxes like "Go to Hell" <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; only special if they remain in good condition.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you wish to continue to print articles on letterboxing or wish <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; print a follow-up article, I would strongly suggest that you <br/>
inteview<br/>
&gt; more seasoned letterboxers in MI like SpringChick, Azobox. and Team<br/>
&gt; Rabbit.  I would also suggest that you point out specifically that<br/>
&gt; anyone interested in trying letterboxing MUST first refer to and <br/>
take<br/>
&gt; to heart the suggestions for beginners found at the following <br/>
websites: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SpringChick's website: http://www.stampinthebox.com/start.asp<br/>
&gt; LBNA faq: http://www.letterboxing.org/GettingStarted/<br/>
&gt; particularly:<br/>
&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/GettingStarted/getstart_finding.htm<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; The Newboxers Group: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, be advised that the individual clues to each box are owned by<br/>
&gt; the placer of the box.  Before any specific boxes are named in any<br/>
&gt; article, permission should be received by the owner of the clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for your understanding.<br/>

Is letterboxing like a secret society or something?  I thought the<br/>
point was to get people (including families) involved in going out and<br/>

right places, etc but is this something that my children and I should<br/>
not do together?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've never read anything about using trail names except for on<br/>

this.  It seems to me reading this series of posts that geocaching and<br/>
such other similar activities are much more open to a family friendly<br/>

it's a bit disheartening for someone who's just getting involved in an<br/>
activity that my children and I viewed as challenging and entertaining.<br/>

idea. I don't think any of the ideas here are saying otherwise. We <br/>
just want to educate people that it's not just about YOU finding the <br/>
box it's about others finding it AFTER you. SpringChick takes her <br/>
grandchildren out with her, but she also keeps a watchful eye to <br/>
make sure they put the boxes back properly concealed. It is a great <br/>
opportunity to show children an example of the golden rule (do unto <br/>
others...). Boxers take alot of time and energy to put a box <br/>
together for others to enjoy, and by taking care of it it insures <br/>
that may more others will have the opportunity to enjoy it as much <br/>
as you did. If they are just going to get distroid once a month, <br/>
then the chances of the placer wanting to put it back out there are <br/>
slim.<br/>

To a degree, letterboxing IS a secret society.  Not<br/>
that we want to keep people out, otherwise we'll never<br/>
get new boxers hunting and new boxes planted and that<br/>
would just cause the sport to die out.  But the act of<br/>
letterboxing is the "secret society" as in, when said<br/>
letterboxer(s) are in the woods, what they're doing is<br/>
in a way a covert mission.  Others don't KNOW that<br/>
there are boxes hidden in these woods, but we<br/>
letterboxers DO and in order to protect our little<br/>
rubber treasures we try to not draw attention to<br/>
ourselves out on the trails.  Which is why, when we<br/>
find a box, we need to resist the urge to scream "I<br/>
found it!!" when there are joggers around, and why<br/>
it's so important to rehide that box so carefully so<br/>
that, if, say, the kids blowing up firecrackers by the<br/>
creek have noticed us in the woods and when we leave<br/>
they decide to go investigate what we were doing their<br/>
chances of finding the box and leaving obscenities in<br/>
the logbook are lesser rather than greater.  <br/>
<br/>
(Yes, we have found a logbook before where non-boxing<br/>
teens left obscenities in the book; but at least they<br/>
left the box intact.  And yes, we have been<br/>
letterboxing before where kids were blowing up<br/>
firecrackers down by the creek.  Luckily the box was<br/>
hidden far enough from the creek where the kids didn't<br/>
see us disappear into the woods.  We also found box<br/>
contents scattered around the woods once where a drunk<br/>
evidently found the box first and left his empty beer<br/>
can in the real hiding place.)<br/>
<br/>
The whole trailname aspect adds to the "secretive"<br/>
quality of letterboxing.  In the "real world" I'm<br/>
known as Diane, but to letterboxers I am Doodle Bug. <br/>
And let me tell you, it is SO COOL to be at a<br/>
gathering and someone comes up to you and cries, "So<br/>
YOU'RE Doodle Bug!"  Makes you feel like a celebrity.<br/>
<br/>
Now, to paraphrase some sci fi character from some sci<br/>
fi movie (maybe Yoda?) with Letterboxing comes Great<br/>
Responsibility.  Because as much as finding little<br/>
rubber stamps (or sometimes big rubber stamps) is<br/>
central to letterboxing, there's so much MORE to it<br/>
that that article just doesn't touch on.  Letterboxing<br/>
isn't just about finding little boxes.  It is about<br/>
spending time with family and friends, enjoying the<br/>
outdoors, exploring new places, treating these little<br/>
works of art with respect, treating our surroundings<br/>
with respect, and this article touched on none of<br/>
that.  There are so many resources out there to help a<br/>
new letterboxer learn that there's more to<br/>
letterboxing than just pulling on the hiking boots,<br/>
printing off the clues, and pulling the box out from<br/>
behind a pile of rocks.  But this article made it seem<br/>
like that's all there is to it, which I believe is<br/>
what's enraged so many people on this list - me, at<br/>
least.  There's a letterboxing "spirit" that the<br/>
article just doesn't talk about at all.  It's the<br/>
"spirit" that makes us want to convert all our family<br/>
and friends into letterboxers, too, and show them HOW<br/>
to letterbox, how to respect the box and their<br/>
surroundings and appreciate that letterboxing is so<br/>
much more than just a hidden container.  In a way,<br/>
letterboxing is a cult!  We want newer letterboxers to<br/>
take the time to learn at least a little of the<br/>
history and respect for the cult - I mean game before<br/>
pulling those hiking boots on.  And some will, but<br/>
some won't.  And we're worried about the some who<br/>
won't, because they're who endanger our boxes.  And<br/>
although one would hope that the wills would be<br/>
greater than the won'ts, recent activity in the Great<br/>
Lakes region (read some of the posts from the past<br/>
three months) has shown that the won'ts seem to be<br/>
outnumbering the wills.  So clues get pulled, because<br/>
there's no way of knowing who hunting for the box is a<br/>
"will" and who is a "won't."  And people don't want to<br/>
risk the won'ts.<br/>
<br/>
Now did I confuse anyone else with that last<br/>
paragraph?<br/>

&gt; I thought the<br/>

&gt; involved in going out and<br/>
&gt; hunting for these boxes.  Yes, it's important<br/>
&gt; they're put back in the<br/>

&gt; Also, I've never read anything about using trail<br/>

&gt; way I must say<br/>
&gt; it's a bit disheartening for someone who's just<br/>

When my family (which is my parents, myself and my 5 kids) started out in July, I just happend about it from the Ren Fair site.  I read what it was about and then went to the sites it suggested, and read everything there.  I feel people who are really interested in it, will research it, and respect what is written and have respect for others and their boxes.  Our kids considered it finding a "buried treasure", and we supervise them when they rehide the box. If we feel it's not hidden good enough, we go and show them how to hide it so it's covered and looks like nothing is there.  We were very lucky to run into another letterboxer, that helped us in our first hunt, and how to rehide, and they showed the kids how to do it as well.  I feel if anyone plans on publicizin<br/>
g about anything like this that is a word of mouth, that they do alot of research, and not give out al the details, but let the person do the research on their own.  If the family is really interested, they would do the research themselves to find out more about the hobby, by doing a search for a letterbox site, and find all the info about it.  I feel if everything is handed to people on a platter, then they are going to go wild, and have no respect for the hobby.  For those who are serious about the hobby, will do the research, find what they need to do, and read the sites as to how the hobby is done, and be more apt to respect the boxes and rehide the boxes the right way.   If they read the sites, I believe it says about creating a trail name.  It makes the hobby more interesting, and cryptic.  I feel more connected, and the people stand out more by their trail name than a real name.   <br/>

Forgive me since I am new to this, but why is this such a big deal? <br/>
Is letterboxing like a secret society or something? I thought the<br/>
point was to get people (including families) involved in going out and<br/>
hunting for these boxes. Yes, it's important they're put back in the<br/>
right places, etc but is this something that my children and I should<br/>
not do together?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've never read anything about using trail names except for on<br/>
groups. Maybe like me they didn't know that you're "supposed to" do<br/>
this. It seems to me reading this series of posts that geocaching and<br/>
such other similar activities are much more open to a family friendly<br/>
environment. Or maybe it's just this list. Either way I must say<br/>
it's a bit disheartening for someone who's just getting involved in an<br/>
activity that my children and I viewed as challenging and entertaining.<br/>

and when I finally get around to typing it I see that you have <br/>
already said it all.  The only point you seem to have missed is <br/>
this:  EVERYONE who letterboxes in the U.S. owes their start in <br/>
letterboxing to a magazine article no matter how they discovered <br/>
boxing, wasn't it an article in the Smithsonian Magazine that started <br/>
all of this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do feel a little guilty that one of my first reactions was to look <br/>
this family up on AtlasQuest, I did however resist the urge to <br/>
contact them while I was still riled up.  It is true that they do not <br/>
use trailnames, they are listed by their joint first names.  I do <br/>
agree that although the information is freely available on the <br/>
internet, it does not make it right to post it in this forum.  I have <br/>
always liked this list because it stays pretty friendly.  This is the <br/>
second time in recent memory that things have been getting tense.  I <br/>
am very happy that I have met the people on this group that I have <br/>
met (?).  I really do enjoy the community, but I think some of us <br/>
need to step away from the keyboard for awhile, find a box, and <br/>
remember why we like it here so much.<br/>

&gt; Brande (and everyone else, too), <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To a degree, letterboxing IS a secret society.  Not<br/>
&gt; that we want to keep people out, otherwise we'll never<br/>
&gt; get new boxers hunting and new boxes planted and that<br/>
&gt; would just cause the sport to die out.  But the act of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing is the "secret society" as in, when said<br/>
&gt; letterboxer(s) are in the woods, what they're doing is<br/>
&gt; in a way a covert mission.  Others don't KNOW that<br/>
&gt; there are boxes hidden in these woods, but we<br/>
&gt; letterboxers DO and in order to protect our little<br/>
&gt; rubber treasures we try to not draw attention to<br/>
&gt; ourselves out on the trails.  Which is why, when we<br/>
&gt; find a box, we need to resist the urge to scream "I<br/>
&gt; found it!!" when there are joggers around, and why<br/>
&gt; it's so important to rehide that box so carefully so<br/>
&gt; that, if, say, the kids blowing up firecrackers by the<br/>
&gt; creek have noticed us in the woods and when we leave<br/>
&gt; they decide to go investigate what we were doing their<br/>
&gt; chances of finding the box and leaving obscenities in<br/>
&gt; the logbook are lesser rather than greater.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Yes, we have found a logbook before where non-boxing<br/>
&gt; teens left obscenities in the book; but at least they<br/>
&gt; left the box intact.  And yes, we have been<br/>
&gt; letterboxing before where kids were blowing up<br/>
&gt; firecrackers down by the creek.  Luckily the box was<br/>
&gt; hidden far enough from the creek where the kids didn't<br/>
&gt; see us disappear into the woods.  We also found box<br/>
&gt; contents scattered around the woods once where a drunk<br/>
&gt; evidently found the box first and left his empty beer<br/>
&gt; can in the real hiding place.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The whole trailname aspect adds to the "secretive"<br/>
&gt; quality of letterboxing.  In the "real world" I'm<br/>
&gt; known as Diane, but to letterboxers I am Doodle Bug. <br/>
&gt; And let me tell you, it is SO COOL to be at a<br/>
&gt; gathering and someone comes up to you and cries, "So<br/>
&gt; YOU'RE Doodle Bug!"  Makes you feel like a celebrity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, to paraphrase some sci fi character from some sci<br/>
&gt; fi movie (maybe Yoda?) with Letterboxing comes Great<br/>
&gt; Responsibility.  Because as much as finding little<br/>
&gt; rubber stamps (or sometimes big rubber stamps) is<br/>
&gt; central to letterboxing, there's so much MORE to it<br/>
&gt; that that article just doesn't touch on.  Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; isn't just about finding little boxes.  It is about<br/>
&gt; spending time with family and friends, enjoying the<br/>
&gt; outdoors, exploring new places, treating these little<br/>
&gt; works of art with respect, treating our surroundings<br/>
&gt; with respect, and this article touched on none of<br/>
&gt; that.  There are so many resources out there to help a<br/>
&gt; new letterboxer learn that there's more to<br/>
&gt; letterboxing than just pulling on the hiking boots,<br/>
&gt; printing off the clues, and pulling the box out from<br/>
&gt; behind a pile of rocks.  But this article made it seem<br/>
&gt; like that's all there is to it, which I believe is<br/>
&gt; what's enraged so many people on this list - me, at<br/>
&gt; least.  There's a letterboxing "spirit" that the<br/>
&gt; article just doesn't talk about at all.  It's the<br/>
&gt; "spirit" that makes us want to convert all our family<br/>
&gt; and friends into letterboxers, too, and show them HOW<br/>
&gt; to letterbox, how to respect the box and their<br/>
&gt; surroundings and appreciate that letterboxing is so<br/>
&gt; much more than just a hidden container.  In a way,<br/>
&gt; letterboxing is a cult!  We want newer letterboxers to<br/>
&gt; take the time to learn at least a little of the<br/>
&gt; history and respect for the cult - I mean game before<br/>
&gt; pulling those hiking boots on.  And some will, but<br/>
&gt; some won't.  And we're worried about the some who<br/>
&gt; won't, because they're who endanger our boxes.  And<br/>
&gt; although one would hope that the wills would be<br/>
&gt; greater than the won'ts, recent activity in the Great<br/>
&gt; Lakes region (read some of the posts from the past<br/>
&gt; three months) has shown that the won'ts seem to be<br/>
&gt; outnumbering the wills.  So clues get pulled, because<br/>
&gt; there's no way of knowing who hunting for the box is a<br/>
&gt; "will" and who is a "won't."  And people don't want to<br/>
&gt; risk the won'ts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now did I confuse anyone else with that last<br/>
&gt; paragraph?<br/>

those opinions ensure that I examine my own ideas. I trust my friends to tell me what they <br/>
believe to be the truth, even when they know I may not agree.  I hope they trust me to <br/>
respect their opinions and to weigh what they have to say with as open a mind as possible. <br/>

For those who do not care to entertain certain topics, I recommend you scroll past them. <br/>
This topic will give way to others, perhaps more to your liking, soon enough.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the friends I have found in this forum, and I hope none will fear to say what <br/>
they believe. Thank you SpringChick and azobox for moderating a board where <br/>
letterboxing friends can openly discuss the issues they care about.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very well said Acorn.  While this topic may not be of concern or relevance to every person here, it is a valid concern for many of our members and therefore worthy of discussion.  Other than the inappropriate posting of the family's personal information, I think that for the most part this entire discussion has been quite civil and several very pertinent issues have been brought to light and have received insightful commentary.<br/>
<br/>
If there are those who are not interested in this particular topic or are in disagreement -- please just ignore the thread.  Remember, this is a discussion list and as long as the discussion remains civil, any letterboxing-related topic or issue is valid fodder for discussion.<br/>
