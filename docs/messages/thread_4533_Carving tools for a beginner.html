<br/>
I find that I use it for the majority of the work, but also use one of the Speedball U-shaped blades (the official name is "lino cutter") to more quickly remove material in the larger areas.  If you can only get one, I'd choose the smallest blade you can find, #1 if possible.  You can always use it several times to carve what you need, but you can't use a larger blade to get the same amount of detail.<br/>
<br/>
On stampeaz.com the lino cutters are 1.29 each, or 10.75 for an assortment of 5 plus a handle.<br/>

I would buy the speedball cutting set, assortment #1.  It comes with <br/>
one handle and 5 blades for $10.75.<br/>
<br/>
If that's too much, buy one handle for $3.99 and at the very least <br/>
the #1 and #5 cutter blades ($1.29 each).<br/>

I started out using carving tools, then switched to an x-acto blade.  I  haven't used my carving tools since, even though I have several different blades.  I find I have much better control PULLing an x-acto blade toward me, rather than PUSHing a carving tool away from me.  <br/>

You can get linozip blades which fit Speedball handles - that you  <br/>
pull rather than push.<br/>
I know several people swear by them!<br/>

<br/>
I was for several years exclusively an Exacto carver and was quite happy with the results.  I still use the Exacto for the majority of my carving -- always for letters and details, but find myself reaching for the Speedball gouges to clean away large areas and to make random lines on the surface.  I find it easier to get the rough-hewn/woodcut look of carving lines when cleaning with the gouges, whereas when I clear with the Exacto, I tend to end up with a very clean background, which is sometimes desirable, sometimes not -- strictly a matter of preference.<br/>
<br/>
As previously mentioned, you should try to pick up the entire Speedball carving tools set with all 5 blades and experiment with them to find what you like best.  If you don't go for the entire set, get the handle and the two gouges -- small "V" and the "U"<br/>

I agree with WI Hiker. I just bought some gouge tools and I hardly use them. I can't SEE where my cut begins and I have trouble stopping my cut where it needs to end. So I'm having to go back over it with an exacto blade to carve out the begining and endings of all the cuts. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The larger ones are good for carving out large areas of negitive space, and the #1 (if converted into a #0) is really good for cutting out hair that looks fairly natural.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, I love my exacto knife. I can see precisly where I'm cutting and I can get some details I never thought possible when I first started to carve.<br/>

Hi!<br/>
I started out using carving tools, then switched to an x-acto blade. I haven't used my carving tools since, even though I have several different blades. I find I have much better control PULLing an x-acto blade toward me, rather than PUSHing a carving tool away from me. <br/>
Have fun with your experimentation!<br/>

I don't know how people can carve with an Exacto!  Obviouslt it gets done, but I'm not one who has figured out how to do that :-)<br/>
<br/>
All I have carved with is the #1 Speedball blade.  To remove larger areas of rubber and to flatten out the grooves, I turn the tool on it's side and use one side of the "V" to get a flat surface. <br/>
<br/>
I only use my Exacto to cut the image from the larger piece of PZ Kut and to trim the edge.<br/>
<br/>
I made a video of myself doing a carving tutorial last year, but it's on Hi8 tape.  I'm going to get something else on the tape transferred to DVD, so I'll also get the carving tutorial transferred.  Then I can upload it to You Tube or something similar :-) I'll post here when it's ready to be viewed.Chris Puls "Scoutdogs"Troop Leader for Dog Scout Troop 107 (OH-KY-IN tri-state) www.DogScoutTroop107.comCaptain of the Dearborn County Animal Response Teamwww.TriStateCART.com My boys: www.Dog-GoneHappy.itgo.comMy book: www.SafeHomeVisits.comMy art: www.PictureTrail.com/scoutdogs <br/>

  Well, you've already had a lesson from a real expert (Leapin' Lizards), but I'd be happy to spend some time showing you my approach (which is based on some tips from SpringChick). However I will be at a severe disadvantage without my lighted magnifying lens! I'll bring some strong reading glasses so I can hopefully see what I'm doing...<br/>

  &gt; I'm always open to new techniques. And based on the end results <br/>
  &gt; of your great looking stamps, there must be something to using an <br/>
  &gt; Xacto knife. I've used a knife to cut out small areas and I even <br/>
  &gt; tried to outline letterings with a blade and then go back and lift <br/>
  &gt; the rubber material out with my Speedball cutter. But I can't <br/>
  &gt; figure out how to do it all with just an Xacto knife. Maybe if I <br/>
  &gt; bring some PZ Kut and my Xacto knife to the Letterboxing Wedding, <br/>
  &gt; you could show me some basic techniques for using just an Xacto <br/>
  &gt; knife. Just tips, not an entire workshop. <br/>

I've often wondered the same thing about how people can carve intricate designs with just the tools, but I've always kept your work in the back of my mind as a testament to that possibility.  Some of the details and precision of your lettering, I simply cannot imagine doing with the carving tools.  It is why I always encourage people to give both thte exacto and the carving tools a chance to see what feel more comfortable for them.  It is not the tool itself -- masterful carvings can be made either way, rather it is how well you make the tool work for you.<br/>

  I don't know how people can carve with an Exacto! Obviouslt it gets done, but I'm not one who has figured out how to do that :-)<br/>
<br/>
  All I have carved with is the #1 Speedball blade. To remove larger areas of rubber and to flatten out the grooves, I turn the tool on it's side and use one side of the "V" to get a flat surface. <br/>
<br/>
  I only use my Exacto to cut the image from the larger piece of PZ Kut and to trim the edge.<br/>
<br/>
  I made a video of myself doing a carving tutorial last year, but it's on Hi8 tape. I'm going to get something else on the tape transferred to DVD, so I'll also get the carving tutorial transferred. Then I can upload it to You Tube or something similar :-) I'll post here when it's ready to be viewed.Chris Puls "Scoutdogs"Troop Leader for Dog Scout Troop 107 (OH-KY-IN tri-state) www.DogScoutTroop107.comCaptain of the Dearborn County Animal Response Teamwww.TriStateCART.com My boys: www.Dog-GoneHappy.itgo.comMy book: www.SafeHomeVisits.comMy art: www.PictureTrail.com/scoutdogs <br/>

After learning that you use the Speedball tools I went back to your web  site <br/>
and am even more awe inspired. I can't wait to get out your way and find  <br/>
some of your stamps (I do have the LBNA map and "G is for  Gathering").<br/>
<br/>
Wonderful work!! Something I continue to strive for.<br/>

Unfortunately, I have pulled all my boxes (except the 3 in TX) because I found I didn't have the time or ability to do the needed up-keep and a few had recently disappeared.  Most had been out for several years, so I was also pulling them to open up space for new boxers to plant.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you got to see my event stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I'll have the video of my carving tutorial finished early next month (I'm in TX till the 7th) and I'll post a link here so you can see how I carve with a Speedball tool :-)<br/>

I'm even more honored to have my image included with images from Fungus  <br/>
