                    <div class="plaintext-content">Concerning the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering, my personal<br>
selfish request is to please have it as far away from<br>
Cleveland as possible, because then I won't be upset<br>
that it was reasonable for us to get to but d'oh,<br>
we're getting married and can't make it :)  (I know,<br>
we should have taken the Great Lakes Gathering into<br>
consideration when we set our wedding date.... ;)<br>
<br>
As for disbanding the Great Lakes Gathering all<br>
together - no!  Please, please no!  Even though, based<br>
on the state that's hosting it, it won't be feasible<br>
for everyone to always attend, it's part of life.  We<br>
were able to attend this past year's gathering and it<br>
was amazing.  We loved meeting all these people from<br>
all over that we otherwise might not have, and all the<br>
fun, hidden boxes, word of mouth boxes, all the neat<br>
things people came up with to make the gathering<br>
great.  Now, we attended the Lake Eerie Gathering this<br>
past October, too, and it was also amazing - all the<br>
work that bibliophile & crew put into it had us in<br>
awe.  Comparing these two "types" of gatherhings, I<br>
think we need both types.  We need the smaller<br>
state-based gatherings - it helps build ties between<br>
local area boxers, and is also always a treat when<br>
someone from out of state takes the time to attend the<br>
gathering, too.  Taking the Lake Eerie gathering as my<br>
example, it was much smaller than the Great Lakes<br>
Gathering and allowed for a more intimate setting.  <br>
<br>
Now, considering the big Great Lakes Gathering,<br>
someone made the comment about letterboxing<br>
conventions, and I guess in a way the Great Lakes<br>
Gathering is already our group's unofficial<br>
convention, where those who are able to travel to meet<br>
on a larger scale to have a grand event.  One of the<br>
things I loved most about the 2005 Great Lakes<br>
Gathering is that it was so big, and we saw first hand<br>
that hey, letterboxing IS a big thing that we're<br>
involved in and there are lots and lots of others as<br>
crazy as we are.  Akin to the Blind Melon music video<br>
for "No Rain," where the BumbleBee Girl is searching<br>
for others like her and finally finds them at the end<br>
of the video.<br>
<br>
OK, that's all for now.<br>
