                    <div class="plaintext-content">Concerning the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering, my personal<br/>
selfish request is to please have it as far away from<br/>
Cleveland as possible, because then I won't be upset<br/>
that it was reasonable for us to get to but d'oh,<br/>
we're getting married and can't make it :)  (I know,<br/>
we should have taken the Great Lakes Gathering into<br/>
consideration when we set our wedding date.... ;)<br/>
<br/>
As for disbanding the Great Lakes Gathering all<br/>
together - no!  Please, please no!  Even though, based<br/>
on the state that's hosting it, it won't be feasible<br/>
for everyone to always attend, it's part of life.  We<br/>
were able to attend this past year's gathering and it<br/>
was amazing.  We loved meeting all these people from<br/>
all over that we otherwise might not have, and all the<br/>
fun, hidden boxes, word of mouth boxes, all the neat<br/>
things people came up with to make the gathering<br/>
great.  Now, we attended the Lake Eerie Gathering this<br/>
past October, too, and it was also amazing - all the<br/>
work that bibliophile &amp; crew put into it had us in<br/>
awe.  Comparing these two "types" of gatherhings, I<br/>
think we need both types.  We need the smaller<br/>
state-based gatherings - it helps build ties between<br/>
local area boxers, and is also always a treat when<br/>
someone from out of state takes the time to attend the<br/>
gathering, too.  Taking the Lake Eerie gathering as my<br/>
example, it was much smaller than the Great Lakes<br/>
Gathering and allowed for a more intimate setting.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, considering the big Great Lakes Gathering,<br/>
someone made the comment about letterboxing<br/>
conventions, and I guess in a way the Great Lakes<br/>
Gathering is already our group's unofficial<br/>
convention, where those who are able to travel to meet<br/>
on a larger scale to have a grand event.  One of the<br/>
things I loved most about the 2005 Great Lakes<br/>
Gathering is that it was so big, and we saw first hand<br/>
that hey, letterboxing IS a big thing that we're<br/>
involved in and there are lots and lots of others as<br/>
crazy as we are.  Akin to the Blind Melon music video<br/>
for "No Rain," where the BumbleBee Girl is searching<br/>
for others like her and finally finds them at the end<br/>
of the video.<br/>
<br/>
OK, that's all for now.<br/>

Also, the 7 Huckaby's are within 15 minutes of Howell Nature Center.  Can they meet up with us, too?  Their only hang-up is that he gets off of work about 4:00.  Hey, would we call this a mini-gathering?  HAHA<br/>

Oh poor, poor Forester family....I have SO been in your shoes! The 2005 . <br/>
gathering was in Dexter - and you missed it! (Darn it!)<br/>
I remember saying something very much like this message last year around <br/>
this time....and everyone told me to "HOST YOUR OWN MINI-MEET" : ))<br/>
<br/>
I know our little LBing family would be happy to travel to <br/>
Brighton....seeing as how this girl grew-up in Fowlerville! : ) In fact we <br/>
are making a trip home on the 18th for a weekend visit. Have to go check on <br/>
my boxes too. Any chance you'd like to meet up at the Howell Nature Center?<br/>

&gt;Okay....somebody, somewhere, somehow......PLEEEEEASE pick Michigan for a <br/>
&gt;gathering.  I'd love to host one, but since I've never been to one before I <br/>
&gt;don't what to expect/include, etc.  The Brighton Recreation Area is <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'm not sure how to proceed with this now...  Since there is<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;beginning of June as has been done for the past 3 years?  I don't<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;want for the two gatherings to compete with one another for<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;attendees, especially if the GL Gathering were to end up in WI.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As another option, we could set the location for the GL Gathering to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;the folks less likely to make the trip to MN.<br/>

&gt;Perhaps in future years I will just set a location and date for the<br/>

Bonnie.. no fear. There is a Fall gathering put on by Springchick and <br/>
Azobox (this year was the first annual) and we usually have a couple mini <br/>
meets in Michigan during the year.... So far we had a Sweetest Day Mini <br/>
Meet by BindleBade and a May Day Mini Meet by Doglvrs, I am supposed to do <br/>
the next one... so gotta find a cool day for it to land on! (sorry if I <br/>
missed anyone else's in MI)<br/>

Anybody else???<br/>
Oh yes.......(drumroll).....stupid newbie question......If we exchange stamps, do we use our trail stamps?  What is a personal traveler?  Do we put our exchanged stamps in our regular stampbook?<br/>

&gt;We LOVE the Howell Nature Center.  Next Friday?  It sounds okay.  Hubby is <br/>
&gt;"hunting" (watching, really ) and will be back sometime tomorrow.  Unless <br/>
&gt;he knows something I don't, we'd really like to meet up with you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, the 7 Huckaby's are within 15 minutes of Howell Nature Center.  Can <br/>
&gt;they meet up with us, too?  Their only hang-up is that he gets off of work <br/>
&gt;about 4:00.  Hey, would we call this a mini-gathering?  HAHA<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know our little LBing family would be happy to travel to<br/>

&gt;are making a trip home on the 18th for a weekend visit. Have to go check on<br/>
