I was wondering if it is ok to plant a letterbox in a location tht you <br/>
can only check once a year?<br/>
<br/>
I am going to Bois Blanc(Bob Lo) Island and thought of placing one <br/>
there if I can find a decent location.  Also-- I travel to Arizona <br/>
every year-- there are a couple places along the way I could place a <br/>
box at but would only get back there once a year to check on it.  Same <br/>
with Bois Blanc.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ginny, many people place letterboxes while they are travelling or on <br/>
vacation.  Some never go back to that spot again, so in your case, once a <br/>
year is at least better than that ;-)  In some cases, you may be able to <br/>
find a local letterboxer who can check in on the box for you between your <br/>
visits, in other cases, it may not be near any other letterboxers.  I have <br/>
several boxes in the U.P. and northern MI that I only get to on a yearly <br/>
basis but they get lots of visitors (more than most of my down-state boxes). <br/>
If you do decide to place a box that you cannot check on often, it is nice <br/>
to indicate this in the clues so that people know they may be taking more of <br/>
a chance in looking for the box and can weigh their decision with that in <br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
Go for it!  I've always thought Bois Blanc Island would be a great place for <br/>
a letterbox!  This will give me a reason to go there ;-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sure you can always ask if some one out there can check on your <br/>
box 'cause you are an out of towner. Or you can just put a friendly <br/>
reminder at the end of your clues to bring an extra baggie just incase <br/>
it is ripped or needs repair because you can't check on it that often.<br/>
