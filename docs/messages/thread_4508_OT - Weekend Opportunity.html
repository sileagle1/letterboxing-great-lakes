the camp where I work.  I wanted to mention that this weekend at Camp<br>
Miniwanca (at Stony Lake, near Shelby, MI) we are having  our Fall<br>
Family Festival, which is like an Open House -- a time for folks to<br>
come out and learn about the camp, explore the grounds and participate<br>
in some of the activities and programs we provide in our mission of<br>
positive youth development.  The Open House is Saturday afternoon,<br>
Oct. 20 and is free of charge.  If you would like more information,<br>
check out our web site at www.ayf.com and follow the link on the home<br>
page to the Miniwana Fall Family Festival.<br>
