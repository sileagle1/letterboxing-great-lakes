and sorting through stuff going, "We really don't need<br/>
two of these," and "Do you REALLY want to keep THAT?"<br/>
we have enough stuff to stock our own discount super<br/>
store.  So it's garage sale time this Saturday!  Since<br/>
this will keep us from letterboxing, borrowing from<br/>
The Dragon's original idea a few years ago, we're<br/>
going to have a letterbox at our garage sale instead. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We created the Marriage is a Wonderland box for the<br/>
2006 Great Lakes Gathering, but haven't had a chance<br/>
to plant it locally yet (and don't know when we<br/>
will....).  So, if you can figure out where we live,<br/>
stop by on Saturday for a chance to get this box (no<br/>
purchase necessary ;).  And bring your markers for the<br/>
stamp.  Sale hours will be from 9 am to 3 pm.  <br/>
<br/>
The clues to find our house are:<br/>
<br/>
Drew Carey hailed from this state, and hey, so do we!<br/>
<br/>
As the Beastie Boys sang, theres No Sleep Till this<br/>
city.<br/>
<br/>
In 1692, a massacre happened here.  Not _here_, but I<br/>
sure hope our street wasnt named after it!<br/>
<br/>
Stay on the east side of the Ridge and youre sure<br/>
to see the signs.  Look for the doodle and deedle<br/>
bug to know youre at the right site.<br/>
<br/>
To get the box, say something to one of the<br/>
proprietors about their first year anniversary being<br/>
June 10th.  Remember that we also have a personal<br/>
traveler you can get if you tell us how we originally<br/>
met.  <br/>

*sigh*  Cleveland weather....up until yesterday, the<br/>
forecasts were showing sun for today, not rain.  But<br/>
now that we're up and attempting to get things going,<br/>
all we see are grey clouds on the horizon.  The<br/>
weather line said that the chance of rain is only in<br/>
the morning, so we're still debating whether to set up<br/>
or just call it a day.<br/>
<br/>
So - if you decide to venture out for this box and you<br/>
don't see our yard sale sign, remember that we use a<br/>
ladybug to represent us in letterboxing.  Look for the<br/>
odd white &amp; green house with the ladybug windchime<br/>
hanging from our porch awning.  <br/>

Didn't get this message until Sunday, but luck would have it that as <br/>
a letterbox I was able to recognize the buggy nature of the Doodle &amp; <br/>
