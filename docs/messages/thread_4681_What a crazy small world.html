Here's one for you...<br>
I am the secretary of our church and a couple of weeks<br>
ago I sent out an email to all the area church's<br>
requesting them to place an announcement in their<br>
bulletins.<br>
<br>
I received an email from a church in my town with a<br>
question:<br>
Is this the letterboxing "doglvrs" Angel Dannenberg?<br>
<br>
Hmmm... I emailed back right away -- turns out, this<br>
gal is someone I met on the trail while doing a box<br>
check - she's the secretary of the church around the<br>
corner.<br>
<br>
What are the odds?<br>
<br>
Mrs. Doglvrs<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a fun thread!  A few years ago, we had met a<br>
local boxer who used the trailname Blaze at an area<br>
letterbox gathering.  A few months later, Deedle & I<br>
were participating in an organized bike ride in the<br>
Cuyahoga Valley.  The ride was called "Rails n'<br>
Trails" and you rode the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic<br>
Railroad to Akron, and then biked back to Cleveland<br>
along the Towpath Trail.  As Deedle & I were waiting<br>
to board the train, I tugged on his shirt and<br>
whispered, "Hey, over there, isn't that Blaze??"  Sure<br>
enough, Blaze was also a cyclist and doing the same<br>
tour we were!<br>
<br>
So, does anyone else have any stories of meeting<br>
letterboxers in a non-letterboxing setting?<br>

have introduced several co-workers to letterboxing.<br>
One day I was looking at the list of new AQ members<br>
and recognized the name as one of the secreatries in<br>
our school. Next time I saw here I asked if it was<br>
indeed her. She said "yes...Mrs. XYZ got me hooked on<br>
letterboxing". I had gotten Mrs. XYZ hooked! And she<br>
passed it along.<br>
I also recognize lots of girls names that signed into<br>
my logbooks because their Girl Scout Troop found the<br>
box.<br>
And my husband somehow figured out that the security<br>
guard where he works is a letterboxer, but I don't<br>
know how that conversation went.<br>
