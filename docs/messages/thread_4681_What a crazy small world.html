Here's one for you...<br/>
I am the secretary of our church and a couple of weeks<br/>
ago I sent out an email to all the area church's<br/>
requesting them to place an announcement in their<br/>
bulletins.<br/>
<br/>
I received an email from a church in my town with a<br/>
question:<br/>
Is this the letterboxing "doglvrs" Angel Dannenberg?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... I emailed back right away -- turns out, this<br/>
gal is someone I met on the trail while doing a box<br/>
check - she's the secretary of the church around the<br/>
corner.<br/>
<br/>
What are the odds?<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a fun thread!  A few years ago, we had met a<br/>
local boxer who used the trailname Blaze at an area<br/>
letterbox gathering.  A few months later, Deedle &amp; I<br/>
were participating in an organized bike ride in the<br/>
Cuyahoga Valley.  The ride was called "Rails n'<br/>
Trails" and you rode the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic<br/>
Railroad to Akron, and then biked back to Cleveland<br/>
along the Towpath Trail.  As Deedle &amp; I were waiting<br/>
to board the train, I tugged on his shirt and<br/>
whispered, "Hey, over there, isn't that Blaze??"  Sure<br/>
enough, Blaze was also a cyclist and doing the same<br/>
tour we were!<br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone else have any stories of meeting<br/>
letterboxers in a non-letterboxing setting?<br/>

have introduced several co-workers to letterboxing.<br/>
One day I was looking at the list of new AQ members<br/>
and recognized the name as one of the secreatries in<br/>
our school. Next time I saw here I asked if it was<br/>
indeed her. She said "yes...Mrs. XYZ got me hooked on<br/>
letterboxing". I had gotten Mrs. XYZ hooked! And she<br/>
passed it along.<br/>
I also recognize lots of girls names that signed into<br/>
my logbooks because their Girl Scout Troop found the<br/>
box.<br/>
And my husband somehow figured out that the security<br/>
guard where he works is a letterboxer, but I don't<br/>
know how that conversation went.<br/>
