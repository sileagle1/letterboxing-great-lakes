&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sounds like a great day!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Glad to hear The Blue Dog did her duty (so to speak) to help the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;hurricane survivors. Her sister box (BD#1; this was BD#2) will be<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;appearing October 1st at the Haunted Harvest and #2 will be available<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;October 8th at Lake Eerie. Any takers for an appearance October 22nd<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;in Michigan? BD#2 has an open calendar before she goes postal on us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  (#1 will be attending a private GS event on October 23rd.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'ld just like to send out a huge thanks to everyone who could make<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;it to the gathering this past Saturday. We really couldn't have done<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;it without you. It was a great bunch of people and we really couldn't<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;have asked for better weather. Unfortunately, not everyone remembered<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;to stamp into the gathering logbook so I can't be 100% sure about the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;attendance...but according to the stamp exchanges an my memory, we had<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;10 adults, 4 children, and 2 dogs from Illinois and Indiana. In<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;addition, Sprite and Highlander from New York were unable to attend<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;but were kind enough to send us a box for this event. And a special<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thanks to Ruth of Team Red Handed for remembering to bring a camera<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;and being our photographer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There was one official event stamp, one roaming event stamp, and<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;three absolutely awsome surprise event stamps brought by Team Red<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Handed. The Blue Dog roaming event stamp raised $40 for hurricane<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;relief at this event. There were boxes placed by 5 different people<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;for this event, all but two of them permenant. Those of you who<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;couldn't make the gathering, be on the lookout for clues to these<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;permenant boxes sometime in the next week or two.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This was my first experience hosting a gathering and I hope that<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;everyone enjoyed attending as much as I enjoyed hosting! Thanks again<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;to all of the people who made this event a success. I will post<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;pictures to the pictures section as soon as Ruth sends me some. See<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;you on the trails!<br/>
