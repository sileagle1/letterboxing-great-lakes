No, I didn't see this sign while out 'boxing.  Someone just sent me a <br>
bunch of funny pictures and this one reminded me of the recent <br>
discussions of where and where not to plant boxes.  Thought I'd share.  Enjoy!<br>

Well, it stripped the photo.  Bummer.  It said, "No trespassing, <br>
violators will be shot.  Survivors will be shot twice" <br>
