                    <div class="plaintext-content">Agreed!  The location was beautiful... a shelter surrounded by views of Gun Lake, ringed by trees in all colors from green to orange to red.  The event was fun... plenty of time to mingle with letterboxers new and old, and share stories of hunts all over Michigan.  The Clue game was great and I learned how "ruthless" some of our competitors are... they will stop at nothing to be the first to learn the identity of Mother Goose's murderer!!!  :-)  <br>
 <br>
Our only regret was not having more time to seek out the many other boxes which are now hidden all across the park.  Grandvilla's series was indeed Amazing!  We highly recommend it.<br>
 <br>
Thanks to SpringChick and Azobox for putting on a great day for all of us.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think I was still trying to recover from all the great boxing we did!  : ) <br>
  Plus, I had to put some time in at the sewing machine making costumes.<br>
<br>
WE HAD A BLAST!!!!  As much as I love the large gatherings with lots of <br>
people to talk to - I like the small ones just as much because then you get <br>
to really know some people.<br>
<br>
Early on Mr. took the kids and hunted up Fungus Woman's Jack Pumpkinhead - <br>
Neat-O stamp!!  (I'm certain I was still talking during this hunt....)<br>
<br>
We went boxing in the AM with JBBooks - you guys are great!  Thanks for <br>
putting up with us and the wee ones.  We were able to hunt up more than half <br>
of SpringChicks boxes.  (very cool!!)<br>
<br>
The Clue game was - well, frantic?!  LoL!  "the skull" had so much fun <br>
though (we were a team) and we even ended up being one of the 3 winners!  <br>
Boy is he happy!!!<br>
<br>
In the afternoon we set out for the "Amazing" series!  And guess what?!   <br>
They are AMAZING!!!!  I have one thing to say about these great boxes...if <br>
you have kids, you must hunt them up!!!  : )  Thanks Grandvilla!<br>
<br>
Mr. & I left the kids in the van, and ran out to get "Lucky Horseshoe" as <br>
the final box of the day - what a cool stamp!!  And I love the logbook!  : ) <br>
  Thanks Cereal City Boxers!<br>
<br>
We were all pretty tired when we got home, but we all agreed that it was a <br>
great day!!<br>
Thanks for the hard work and good food!!<br>
<br>

us "newbie" boxers. It was a pleasure to finally meet all of you. <br>
Also, thanks for not killing us when we were *ahem* slightly late for <br>
lunch (sorry, sorry, sorry!)! :-)<br>
<br>
I didn't have a chance to tell everybody during the mayhem of the Get <br>
A Clue game, but the stamps were incredible! You all did a superb job <br>
and have inspired B and me to improve our carving abilities this <br>
winter. <br>
<br>
I haven't had a chance to update our blog, but will do so soon with <br>
pics and stories. Can't wait to see the group pic!<br>
<br>
Many thanks to SpringChick and Azobox, of course (and we highly <br>
recommend the Cranky Things at Yankie Springs series. Very fun. <br>
Didn't have a chance to find all of the Pumpkin Kids, though, but we <br>
loved the ones we found!).<br>
<br>
Ok, enough rambling! <br>
