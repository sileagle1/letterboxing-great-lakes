Traveling to another state & wonder about finding local boxes?<br>
<br>
Well, wonder no more! Bindle Bum and I are considering a trip to WI <br>
before the Lake Express stops running for the season.  I had wanted <br>
to check out some of the WI boxes, but not being familiar with the <br>
area, it was more difficult that I wanted to work with at the time.  <br>
<br>
Serendipity strikes. While cleaning up some old messages from my "in-<br>
box" today, I came across a good one that I had forgotten to file.<br>
<br>
Link and tip compliments of GreyCrazy in SC as posted on the big <br>
list some time ago. <br>

<br>
Click on the state you want, or choose from the drop-down list on <br>
the left side of the window, then click the blue "Go" button. <br>
<br>
Look near the top of the next window for a small icon in the shape <br>
of the state you've requested. <br>
<br>
Directly below that icon is a tiny line that says "___ (state) <br>
counties -- view map" <br>
<br>
Click on the little link that says "view map". <br>
<br>
Hint: check your printout when you're done, you might have to turn <br>
it landscape to get it all one a single page.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

Another tip using these maps:  I use them in my "big clue binder" as <br>
separators before the clues for each state.  I color in the counties that have <br>
letterboxes (more and more these days), and when I'm travelling it's just a <br>
quick glance to see which counties I'll be travelling through.  It's easy then just <br>
to pull the clues I need.<br>
<br>
I also place the list from the LBNA site listing boxes in each state in the binder, <br>
updating periodically, and checking off what I have. <br>
<br>
Yes, it sounds tedious, but it really saves time for this naturally disorganized <br>
letterboxer.<br>

It seems to be a slightly different page.  When you click on a state name,<br>
it will launch a .pdf file with a county map.  All are sized to fit on one<br>
page.<br>
