there are some great boxes there and there were NO <br>
MOSQUITOES.  We just got back from Indiana where we were <br>
not able to visit every box we wanted to, but we did go to <br>
Lafayette and Turkey Run.<br>
<br>
Cairo Skywatch is a box that evokes history; we loved it.  Morel <br>
Mushroom combines a little internet research before you leave <br>
and a pleasant little walk in the woods. (We had to do some <br>
maintenance on Morel Mushroom which was soaked).<br>
<br>
If you've loved the canyons of Starved Rock in Illinois, you'll love <br>
Turkey Run State Park in Marshall IN which plays host to four <br>
letterboxes, all hidden in interesting places.  Turkey Run is an <br>
excellent place for a weekend trip.  If you camp, we like the <br>
camping in Shades SP nearby.  Reservations in the Turkey Run <br>
Lodge may be difficult to come by, book early.<br>

beautiful Rocky Mountain National Park.  We found 3 boxes; one in <br>
Estes Park, one near Grand Lake, and the last one near Granby.  All <br>
were fun to find.  The last required a 3-mile hike around Monarch <br>
Lake to find both boxes.  The first two were very near the parking <br>
areas.  On the way out there we tried to find a box hidden in an <br>
Iowa rest area.  It was dark and we didn't really want to go <br>
reaching under a small bridge when we couldn't see, so we didn't <br>
find that one.  We were also going to stop in Lincoln, NE on the way <br>
back as there is a park there with numerous boxes based on the <br>
book, "Sarah, Plain and Tall".  Everyone was asleep when we passed <br>
through, so we will save that one for another time.  My children <br>
think letterboxing is fantastic and I use it as a great reward for <br>
hiking.  Incidently, my wife is a 1st grade teacher and I used to <br>
teach 3rd grade.  <br>

<br>
I'm in the planning stages of my big July trip which I hope takes me <br>
letterboxing thru Chicago, NW Indiana, along southern MI and <br>
northern IN, then across northern Ohio, swinging down east Ohio <br>
heading south, then back to western Ohio via the southern route, <br>
then doing southern Indiana and IL on the way back to WI.<br>
<br>
I'm planning on begining July 5th and taking the rest of July to <br>
make the trip.  For you MI letterboxers in the lower part of the <br>
lower pennisula (Muskegeon, Kalamazoo, Ann Arbor, Detroit, etc.), <br>
I'd be happy to meet up with you for exchanges, to deliver your T-<br>
shirts and other items if you can wait until the week of July 5th.  <br>
Just email me privately. I wouldn't mind meeting other boxers in <br>
Indiana, IL, and Ohio too!  Maybe I'll take my super new Dragon HH <br>
along so you can stamp it and see what Team Taco and Acorn made for <br>
me!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">He he he, funny you should ask that!  Jeff & I will be heading to, of all places, Michigan in August!  We did NOT plan this trip around letterboxing but rather my friend Shawn's wedding in Adrian, where there happens to be a letterbox hidden.  And then Jeff said while we're in Michigan, if it's not too much farther he'd like to go to the Henry Ford Museum & Greenfield Village in Dearborn...and I found clues for another box hidden in Dearborn.  Plus a few other boxes in Wayne county.... and I figured that while heading out to Michigan we'll pass a few boxes on the way in Ohio, and hey, if we're already in the Adrian area I'm sure the surrounding counties aren't too far away and, oh look, I've found some clues to letterboxes in those counties, too... and next thing you know I've got a list of about 42 letterboxes to hunt while in & on our way to Michigan ;)<br>
 <br>
Needless to say, we're probably not going to have a chance to hunt all 42 boxes since we're only going to be there from August 13th to the 17th, and we kind of have that wedding to attend...but for those in the Southern-Eastern Michigan area who knows, maybe we'll run into some of you on the trails.  And Jeff, being such a good sport, said to go ahead and bring all 42 sets of clues along and we can see which ones might be in our reach once we're actually in the state.<br>
 <br>
Oh, and of course I told Shawn about our obsession--I mean, hobby, and he kindly reported that there will be a two hour gap between the wedding & the reception that we could use to find the Adrian letterbox ;)  <br>
 <br>
Not that we need to add to our list any more, but if you have info on boxes in the area (esp. if you know of any currently out of commission), our email is doodle_n_deedle @ yahoo.com  :)<br>

If you spend any time on the "big island" of Hawaii, we can report that the<br>
"Mystery" box is gone (several people told us after we returned that it was<br>
destroyed in a fire) but the other 5 boxes were alive and well in late<br>
November 2003.<br>

mentioned he might have a business trip coming up and my first reaction was:<br>
could we make another letterboxing weekend around the trip?  (We did this<br>

<br>
We tend to stay around here over the summer to enjoy all the things going on<br>
and take more major trips in the "off season" when places aren't so crowded.<br>
(I guess this is one of the benefits of NOT being a teacher, but I sure<br>
think "having the summer off" sounds appealing!)   We do have an LB<br>
excursion planned for the 4th of July weekend in the west and central parts<br>
of Wisconsin.  We have several other weekends "penciled in" during the<br>
summer as possible LB trips - Door County - WI, Starved Rock - IL, and<br>
Muskegon - MI.<br>

Tom and I have some major and some minor travel plans, although I <br>
have a feeling only one group will include letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Minor plans include trips to Chicago and Milwaukee for weddings, and <br>
probably a UP trip in there somewhere as well.  Letterboxing works <br>
well with those trips, since we have lots of room in the car.<br>
<br>
Major plans include traveling to Guatemala, where I don't really <br>
think there are any letterboxes, so that's probably out.  Not to <br>
mention 'packing light' probably doesn't include a backpack of LB <br>
goods, and we probably shouldn't be poking about in lesser-traveled <br>
areas anyway!<br>

Travel plans for the summer really revolve around one event- what has been dubbed "Ken's Folly", our triathlon in Mackinaw City in August.  We try to spend a week in Cheboygan camping each summer, and this race thingie worked perfectly.<br>
<br>
So should we manage to crawl out of our tent the day after the race, we'll probably go check out the three or four boxes on Mackinac Island- one is located right on the pier!  Anyone else found those boxes?<br>
<br>
We've found the two in St. Ignace, so I'm pulling for a new lower UP box to pop up before hand.<br>
<br>
Other than that, we're mostly homebound for the duration of the summer months.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Delirium<br>
<br>
p.s. Who, being a true Michigander, knows the difference between, and snorts with disgust when outsiders misspell "Mackinaw" or "Mackinac".<br>

is a huge mystery and interesting history to delve into!  If <br>
