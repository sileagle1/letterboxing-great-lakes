                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, I thought the door was pretty much closed on the Bingo game for<br/>
new players; I'm glad to see that the reach is widening.<br/>
<br/>
Lest your forget, there is also an under-the-radar game also with a<br/>
deadline approaching: Side-Wagers.<br/>
Even if you're not in the BIG GAME, you can still play in the<br/>
side-wager game. It's kind of like the office pool, but you don't have<br/>
to pay to play.<br/>
<br/>
When do you think SpringChick will the pull the item that completes<br/>
the winning player's list for Bingo?<br/>
<br/>
Email me (jparkerg at yahoo dot com)with "Bingo" in the subject line.<br/>
Just tell me the date when you think SC's Letterbox Bingo will end.<br/>
For example, if you think the game will end on February 9, send me<br/>
that date. If it ends on the 13th, and no one else has claimed a date<br/>
before that (between the 9th and the 13th), you're the winner. In<br/>
other words, you "hold" all days from your date until the next<br/>
guesser's date comes into play. So there are lots of chances to win.<br/>
(And, let me tell you, some of the entries are pretty wild guesses!)<br/>
<br/>
Questions?<br/>
Give a shout and I'll try to answer.<br/>
Deadline is Saturday night 12/31 at 11:59 p.m. EST.<br/>

You mention some of the dates for the winning bingo date as "wild guesses"<br/>
for Side-Wagers.  I was just wondering what distinguishes one date's<br/>
wildness from another?  Aren't all future days equally wild until they<br/>
pass?  Just a rhetorical question.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting date you chose to use in your example.  Will you post a<br/>
database of guesses before January 1, so we all may enjoy everyone's<br/>
guesses?<br/>

The "wildness" was merely an acknowledgment that the dates were all<br/>

so if you decide to list who is still in the game for the side-wager, that<br/>

competition (my guess is probably too optimistic).  <br/>
