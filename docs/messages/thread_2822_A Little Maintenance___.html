(Deb Rocks) was at the very first event we attended (and co-hosted w/Dragon)<br>
on March 2, 2004, even though it was a weeknight in the winter. Definitely<br>
some dedicated boxers up that way and glad to see the hobby expanding more<br>

Those of you who read messages on the internet may have noticed that<br>
I have replaced the photo on the group home page with the new<br>
Letterboxing Great Lakes stamp image, which now includes MN. Thanks<br>
to those who did contribute photos for the home page, but there<br>
wasn't much interest or participation, so I am planning to go back<br>
to the GL stamp image and leave that there.<br>
