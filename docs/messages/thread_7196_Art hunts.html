Although very different from letterboxing, it held some aspects that were familiar. For starters, the whole idea of posting clues and searching in parks and public areas to bring people out into the community had a similar ring.<br/>

I was also reminded how often we state that one of our reasons for letterboxing is the collection of quality art images that so many boxers create.
