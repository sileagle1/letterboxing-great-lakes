clues.<br>
<br>
Just to let the new boxers know; this isn't a discrete way to search for boxes. <br>

Lucky for me it's a box with a permit.<br>

groups or they would have gotten the idea by now (since there has been<br>
much discussion over these issues lately).<br>
<br>
I am guessing that the solution to this is to put the reminder in the<br>
clues that be discrete and to not be asking for help from random people<br>
(or employees) near locations.  I think these are the people that want<br>
to walk up to a counter and have  a park ranger hand them the box as a<br>
reward for printing out the clues....<br>
<br>
Ugh!  What a conundrum this is getting to be!!<br>

If some one does, they might draw them a map to the dumpster out back.<br>
