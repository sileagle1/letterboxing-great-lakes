No, I don't plan to.  AQ seems to only have lower resolution photos, smaller size and no slideshow that I've found.  In general the photo capabilities there seem somewhat limited. (Maybe I'm missing something?)  I primarily use AQ to look at event listings and read some message boards.<br>
The Yahoo groups allow a larger photo view and have slideshow capabilities.  I used the Flickr site because I remember SpringChick mentioning it and wanted to check it out, but I've also sometimes used Walgreen's as "Sophie & Me" has done.  Some of these sites allow you to order copies of the photos if you are so inclined.  Or of course you can print them yourselves since they are at a higher resolution.<br>
