I also stuffed one inside a microbox (film canister with a tiny stamp and roll of paper) but because it sometimes caused the container to be hard to close, it totally defeated it's purpose when the canister was not sealed completely.<br>

  So, I've been wondering about those silica crystal packs. Do they<br>
  actually help keep a letterbox's contents dry? Or drier?<br>
  I imagined that they'd absorb as much as they could hold, then their<br>
  affect would be nil.<br>
<br>
  Perhaps in a smallish microbox it would help?<br>
<br>
  I dunno.<br>
<br>
  Any evidence? I recall some controlled experiments being done out east<br>
  (?) a few years back in which it was shown that even a totally<br>
  airtight box would exhibit signs of moisture, due to condensation.<br>
  Perhaps in those cases, the silica would help.<br>
  And of course, we all know, Do Not Eat the contents of those little<br>
  packets <g>.<br>
