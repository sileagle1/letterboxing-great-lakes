I took my three granddaughters to your letterbox site today and it was gone.  Very disapointed.  I was there 2 months ago with my other grandchildren and we found it then. Just wanted to let you know that it is gone.<br/>

I can probably check on it this weekend since my parents are coming <br/>
up and staying near the MOA, so I'll be down in there anyway.  I <br/>
hope it's not missing-that's one of my favorites in the area!<br/>
