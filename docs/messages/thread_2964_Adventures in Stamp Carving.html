Does anyone know where I can get a #5 blade for a Speedball handle?  I have blades #1, #2, and #3 but I would really like a nice wide #5 for finishing off the edges.  I'd rather not buy a complete set if all I need is one blade.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I get mine individually from Carlson's Art Supply in Lombard.  They also<br>

I think places that are artist supply stores and cater to the fine arts are<br>
more likely to have the blades individually than "hobby" type places like<br>
Hobby Lobby, Michael's, etc.<br>
