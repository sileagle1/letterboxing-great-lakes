Its funny you should say, "With the little knick and little blood, maybe we  <br>
should rethink the trail name and make it Bug-a-Boo-boo!"<br>
 <br>
As Alex has always been accident prone. When we first started boxing she  <br>
would fall on the trail all the time.... well, ok, she still falls. She's  <br>
bloodied both palms of her hands (and that is when our search for a box  ends).<br>
 <br>
When she was really little, before letterboxing, we would call her  <br>
Alie-Boo-Boo.<br>
 <br>
When she turned 4 we still called her that and she got this serious look on  <br>
her face and said, "Don't call me that again."<br>
 <br>
It was hard, but we have since refrained.<br>

Sorry to hear about her sucking thumb. We know from experience what a<br>
sacred item the sucking thumb is. Not the best place for an owie. <br>
