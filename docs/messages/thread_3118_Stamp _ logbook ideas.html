  Anyways we have one sig stamp for the family. When Nick got old enough to <br/>
want to stamp in on occasion he wanted his initial so I just went and bought <br/>
an 'N' stamp.<br/>
Maybe they could all have their own logbooks but not stamps that way they <br/>
could write or take pictures of whatever they want to do in it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In our "Tribe" LOL  there are 8 of us that go on the hunt for boxes.  I decided to let each of the kids pick out their own stamp, and each of them has their own logbook.  My parents each have a stamp of their own, but they share their logbook.  I figure if they ever keep this addiction...I mean hobby going when they get older, then they are ready to go. =)  We have one trail name for us all, but they each use their individual nicknames when we do the postal letterboxing rings with the family trail name.   <br/>
