Thank you again, Dragon!  I'm sorry we didn't get a chance to visit more with you and with the other boxers, but we were out on the trail almost all day.

<br>
Also a very special thank you to Beetle for arranging the pre-gathering fish boil and hiding the Famous Fish series.  This was my first fish boil and I have to say the fish was delicious (albeit quite bony).  I got a big kick out of Beetle approaching the gaggle of people watching the fish boil pot and inquiring, "Is there anyone here who . . . isn't one of us?"  heheheh<br>

Nam Vet and I are pretty worn out today, we don't really know how many miles we trudged . . .

I haven't downloaded the rest of my pictures yet but when I do I'll see if any are good enough to share.<br>

THANKS AGAIN to all (especially The Dragon, I know you went to a LOT of work to stage this event), we had a great time at our first outside gathering other than the "Birds of a Feather" event which we organized ourselves.  Hopefully you'll see us at another event in the near - or distant - future :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Time for me to add my two cents, including thank yous to The Dragon <br>
for spearheading the weekend (hope you're feeling better!), WiHi for <br>
the great event stamp (very glad it was carved by a Wisconsin boxer), <br>
everyone else who contributed boxes and food, Beetle for the Friday <br>
night pre-event, and Mr. FungusWoman for being so patient with me and <br>
my "Hobby" (I can always tell when he says it how he capitalizes the <br>
H...).  While he didn't find much other than a few coins (nothing <br>
old) with his metal detector, he did find a piece of pottery nearby <br>
which he turned in to the nature center (they were quite pleased to <br>
receive it).<br>
<br>
But I'd like to also thank everyone who contributed to Project Pajama <br>
Pants.  Holy cow!  We collected EIGHTEEN pairs of pants, a pile of <br>
letters, and a stack of comics and comic books.  There was also some <br>
cash donated, so I'll be purchasing a few more pairs before I take <br>
them in.  Thank you all so much!  I've noticed that there aren't that <br>
many stamps in the logbook, so if you made a donation but missed <br>
stamping in, drop me a note offline and we can make arrangements for <br>
me to mail you a copy of the image.<br>
<br>
It was kind of cool driving through Manitowoc because that was where <br>
Mr. FW gave me my ring those MANY years ago.  We used to go up there <br>
quite a lot, but haven't been there in a long time, so we explored <br>
his old fishing haunts and looked around at how much the area had <br>
changed.  I didn't think to bring the clues to the Killer Rabbit, <br>
which was my Dad's carving.  Next time!<br>

We remarked throughout the day on all the different areas we hiked through... rocky paths in hardwoods, sandy trails through pine plantations, the lake, the creek.<br>
<br>
The series of Wisconsin Firsts letterboxes was great, too. Thanks tocarvers far and wide who responded to WiHi'srequest and shared their artistry with us. Of course, there was the usual gathering fun of bumping into other groups almost every timewereached, or completed,a box. That's always a nice way to meet folks and exchange stories.<br>
<br>
I will be watching for photos to be posted since, as always, I took far too few to remember the day!<br>

Actually ALL of the food was GREAT. I ended up spending more time <br>
eating than I did hunting for boxes out on the trails. <br>
<br>
That's the bad thing about events. Once you you sit down at the <br>
stamping tables and talking to people it's hard to break away and get <br>
out on the trails to look for boxes.<br>
<br>
My thanks to Dragon and Beetle for a great weekend of stamping and <br>
eating <br>
