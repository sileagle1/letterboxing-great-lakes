we are going there next week.  I kept searching for<br/>
letterboxes there since it is so beautiful and Devils<br/>
Doorway seems to be calling out for a stamp image. <br/>
But now that the rattler complication has been pointed<br/>
out, I see why there are no boxes.  We will definitely<br/>
look for Man of the Mounds though.<br/>

Thanks for the warning and the update.  We ARE planning to look for <br/>
both of those.  Glad box #2 is still there!  We'll let you know if we <br/>
spy any poison ivy anywhere.  (Actually I'm not too good at recognizing <br/>
it, but Martini Man might.)  We'll have a niece &amp; nephew w/us, so we <br/>
may need to keep a more watchful eye out this time.<br/>
