something about this hobby makes me overly so.  Even out hunting, I <br>

But, today was something else.  I think I had legitimate reason to be <br>
paranoid.  I was out doing some planting today.  I was in a cemetery <br>
that is a pretty visible place, but I don't think I was looking <br>
overly suspicious.   I think I looked like I was just walking around <br>
looking at the stones.  But, I was SURE these people were watching my <br>
every move while I was there.  I was right by their fence line for a <br>
little while and she came out of the house right then "looking at a <br>
flower bed by the fence".   While I was there, I made a special point <br>
to stop and read lots of stone.   I was pretty far away from them <br>
while I was doing the actual plant and I don't think they could see <br>
me put the box away, so I'm not too worried they'll go find it.   I <br>
think they were kind of watching the whole time I was there, <br>
though.   As I was leaving the place, I think the guy got in his <br>
truck, drove around and followed me.    The road I was on was split <br>
so that to go north, you have to go south first and turn around.  We <br>
both did that, then both turned left on the next main road.  I turned <br>
into another cemetery that was around the corner (just in case he was <br>
watching me, I figured it would add credibility to my first visit. He <br>
bypassed the cemetery and kept going.   I turned around and was <br>
pulling back out on the main road.  As I was doing so, he came back <br>
from the other direction, so he obviously turned around somewhere <br>
back down the road.  He then proceeded to turn down his road and went <br>
back to his house.  He did not have time to go anywhere else on this <br>
little trek.   He didn't drive into the first cemetery at all before <br>
he went home.  Isn't that weird?  I am being paranoid, or do you <br>
think he was following me or that he was planning on coming to the <br>
first cemetery to see what I was doing, but I left before he had a <br>
chance?  Or am I completely crazy and whatever he was doing had <br>
nothing to do with me?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Y'know, that's not really so odd with a cemetery.  Was the cemetery kind of<br>
on the small to medium side?<br>
<br>
There's soooo much vandalism and theft going on in cemeteries nowadays that<br>
a lot of people who work for cemeteries or own/manage them or who live<br>
bordering them or across the street from them, etc. are often starting to<br>
keep a much closer eye on things.<br>
<br>
One thing I do when heading out for either a medium-sized or small cemetery<br>
is to always carry a camera and a clipboard and I don't dress too<br>
grungy-looking.  Then if anyone looks unusually interested or worried about<br>
why I'm there, I engage them in some sort of casual conversation.<br>
<br>
A lot of times, before I leave for the cemetery, I'll look it up on the<br>
internet and see what I might be able to find about it's history.<br>
graveyards.com is a pretty good place to start.  Finding out a bit about the<br>
cemetery might give me something to ask a question or two about or might<br>
present with me with some subject that I could pretend to be interested in.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I also introduce myself as a member of RAOGK (Random Acts of<br>
Geneological Kindness), an internet group of research volunteers who assist<br>
folks around the country in finding ancestors, getting copies of records,<br>
taking photos of gravesites, etc.  Which I am actually a member of.<br>
<br>
Or sometimes I'll stop at the grocery store and get a small bunch of cut<br>
flowers to leave on a grave, pick a grave that looks like it needs some<br>
visiting, make sure the worried person sees me set the flowers there, and<br>
then maybe wander a bit looking at headstones.  But it shows them that I was<br>
there for a purpose other than to harm their cemetery, even if I'm not<br>
really there for the purpose I'm making them think I'm there for.  And if<br>
they're close enough, I might engage them in a bit of casual conversation<br>
about how interesting the cemetery looks or now nice the maintenance seems<br>
to be, etc, just in case praise helps allay their worries.<br>
<br>
Instead of flowers, sometimes I'll bring a medium-size pebble along in my<br>
pocket to set on a gravestone and stand there a bit as if I'm visiting that<br>
gravesite.  Pebbles left on gravestones are a traditional "I was here to<br>
visit you" thing.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, however, engaging worried people in conversation can backfire,<br>
and I can end up spending far more time at the cemetery than I planned to if<br>
the folks actually taking a liking to me, and relax, and want to show me<br>
this or that that they feel I might be interested in.  Which, if the boxer<br>
is a person like me, who happens to love cemeteries, I'm just fine with<br>
anyway.<br>
<br>
I actually became very interested in the Civil War because of something like<br>
this.  I was out taking some photos for an RAOGK request for a family who<br>
wanted photos of a relative's gravesite.  The cemetery was locked up,<br>
surrounded by an 8 foot fence, so I had to get a township employee to agree<br>
to meet me out there and unlock it for me to go in and take photos.  When<br>
they heard it was an RAOGK request, a gentleman with the local historical<br>
society met me out there because he wanted to show me that they also had a<br>
gravesite there of a Revolutionary War soldier.  So I also took a bunch of<br>
photos of that.<br>
<br>
When he saw I was interested in the Revolutionary War soldier, he told me<br>
that they also had a small totally secluded cemetery of Civil War veterans<br>
that they were in the process of restoring and would I like to see their<br>
work so far?  I said ooooooooooh, of course!  The cemetery was completely<br>
off the road and in the woods, couldn't be seen by road or air, so over the<br>
river and thru the woods we went, and, at the age of 50, I suddenly ended up<br>
interested in Civil War history.  I'd love to plant a letterbox there but I<br>
know the historical society people would do me severe bodily damage if I<br>
did.  :-)  It's a verrry fragile site.<br>
<br>
And sometimes there's a problem because some cemeteries look "public" but<br>
are actually "private" and people who aren't directly visiting a gravesite<br>
of a friend or relative aren't really welcome there, visiting by "strangers"<br>
is discouraged.  Tho, if it's not posted, it's not considered trespassing,<br>
tho they might ask a person to leave and then person has to leave,  no<br>
choice.<br>
<br>
There's a cemetery here in Lombard, IL that's like that.  It's not posted,<br>
but it's considered private by the owners.  It's not protected by any<br>
fencing or anything and they've had serious problems with vandalism and<br>
theft in the past.  Thankfully, it's pretty visible from a busy road so the<br>
police drive by and keep an eye on it and if people drive by and see someone<br>
there, they might call the police on their cell phone and the police will<br>
pay a visit and tell the people to skedaddle.  But the day I was there, the<br>
police dropped by but allowed me to stay, so they're selective in who the<br>
chase off.<br>

obsession is genealogy, and this may help me find more<br>
about my Pennsylvania ancestors.  <br>
<br>
And when genealogy and letterboxing collide, it's an<br>
interesting thing.  Two summers ago Deedle & I were<br>
searching for a cemetery box in another part of Ohio. <br>
The clues called out a specific grave, and I almost<br>
fell over, because the grave next to the grave called<br>
out in the clues had one of my family names on it (one<br>
of those good, Polish names).  Deedle asked, "Are they<br>
related?" and I said, "I don't know, they could be, my<br>
grandfather did have cousins who lived out this<br>
way...."  Haven't had a chance to follow up on that<br>
yet, though.<br>
