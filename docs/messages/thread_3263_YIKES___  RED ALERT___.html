                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just read that Michigan newspaper article, and my jaw hit the <br>
floor!  I'm in shock!  I don't know if I should scream or throw up! <br>
Right now, I feel like doing both.<br>
<br>
 Printoing the story is bad enough, but why would a reporter print a <br>
clue?  Not only are Dragon's boxes in danger, ALL boxes are <br>
threatened!  The media is incredibly irresponsible. <br>
<br>
My first thought was to check Dragon's clues to see if the Mankoff <br>
Family (GRRR!) posted their finds - so we could contact them <br>
directly and tell them 'the rules.'  I hope they are proud of <br>
themselves.  <br>
<br>
However, Dragon is fast and on the ball.  He has changed his clues <br>
to protect his boxes.  Good idea!  However, newspapers have a wide <br>
circulation and people who are just looking for something free and <br>
fun to do (Give Me A Break!!!) will no doubt search the websites for <br>
more clues to boxes.<br>
<br>
We need a plan!!!  We ALL need to go underground!!!<br>
