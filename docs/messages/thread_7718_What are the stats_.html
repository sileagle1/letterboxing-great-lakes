My stats are that I still have no six pack, no four corners, no plus sign. <br/>

I do have a straight line, but didn't get it until 3/23, so only 2 months late. No big deal. <br/>

The game this year is going about the same as the previous 6 years, although<br/>
we did have the EARLIEST winner for an interim game (JAN 21 vs the previous<br/>
record of JAN 31).  All the other interim games this year have fallen in the<br/>
range of past years.<br/>

The earliest date a Full Card has ever been called is APR 6.  Does anyone<br/>
think they might have a Full Card by then this year????<br/>

Good luck to everyone in the final stretch!<br/>
