Hello everyone!  I have a message here from the placers of some of <br>
the boxes in DuPage Co. and have been asked to pass it on in case <br>
you are driving from out of town ~<br>
<br>
>>DuPage County powers-that-be don't approve of letterboxing.  When <br>
we first moved here last year, we had a bit of pull with some county <br>
folks and got a teeny foot in the door for "unofficially" placing <br>
boxes as long as some rules were strictly followed.  In other words, <br>
follow these rules and we'll look the other way.  That way we could <br>
publicly post the clues for folks and not have to resort to word-of-<br>
mouth tricks (tho we still had plenty of word-of-mouth boxes placed).<br>
 <br>
And we follow their rules totally.  But other folks that have come <br>
after us, well, some of them are a different story.  Anyway, I <br>
received a phone call this morning that two county employees had <br>
taken serious offense over the clues of a box just placed in Downers <br>
Grove at the Hidden Lake Forest Preserve by some boxer who goes by <br>
the trail name of "Devil's Mark".  The clues have them feeling that <br>
letterboxing might just be some sort of Satanic cult or might have <br>
some sort of Satanic sub-society attached to it here in DuPage -- <br>
the local law enforcement folks are more than a little paranoid over <br>
anything that might smack of anything having to do with a gang, a <br>
cult, etc.  This is a pretty darn conservative county that takes a <br>
dim view of any of that going on in a county forest preserve.<br>
 <br>
Anyway, the employees are going to head over at some point to remove <br>
that box and wanted me to know that there's a really good chance <br>
they're just going to go thru and pick up and toss out any and all <br>
boxes placed in the county preserves that they find listed anyplace <br>
on the internet this week.  I'd hate for anyone from out-of-town to <br>
take a drive to check out the boxing here in DuPage and not find <br>
anything, so I'd appreciate it if you could just post a short blurb <br>
that folks should maybe check with the placers before coming too far <br>
from out-of-town for boxes in area forest preserves.  Boxes that <br>
aren't in the forest preserves, obviously, won't be affected, nor <br>
will boxes where the clues can't be found on the internet.<br>
 <br>
When we replant our boxes, we're going to list the clues on lb.org <br>
but just as a link to our yahoogroup -- Letterboxing-OopsGangClues.<br>
<br>
Thanks much! <br>
 <br>
Pippi & Keith<<<br>
<br>
These boxes include but are not exclusive to:<br>
Tweet! Tweet!<br>
Biiiiiiiiig Tree<br>
Cries for Freedom<br>
<br>
We know about these boxes because we were fortunate enough to find <br>
them on our recent trip to IL ~ when we got back home, the clues <br>
were no longer posted.<br>
<br>
I for one say "Good Luck" to Pippi & Keith!<br>

<br>
I have an update on the Dupage Forest Preserve District's "policy" <br>
regarding the planting of Letterboxes.<br>
<br>
Last week they approved their Rules and Regulations for the placing <br>
of letterboxes.<br>
<br>
Thursday, April 7th their committee is meeting to finalize their <br>
procedures for approval of letterbox applications. They have said <br>
they will contact me Thursday afternoon or Friday morning to provide <br>
me with the outcome. I'll post here when I hear from them. <br>
<br>
Their intentions are to have a free permit system. It will be a sort <br>
of special case - special use permit. They want only to ensure that <br>
sensitive areas are not disturbed. I applied for permits for my 3 <br>
previous DuPage boxes; Wheres Peabody?, S'Mores, and Forest Grove <br>
Lane, back in January. I am hoping to plant them back out by the end <br>
of April since they have stated they expect to have no objections to <br>
my areas of placement.<br>
<br>
 They do not dislike letterboxing and seems to be quite the contrary -<br>
 they see it as an excellent way to promote visits to their <br>
preserves. Perhaps there are employees at specific preserves that <br>
don't approve of this activity, but the "higher-ups than them" are <br>
willing to allow the activity and it will be allowed openly in just <br>
another week or so.<br>

They are sort of including the letterboxing as an associated activity.<br>

<br>
As promised the forest preserve sent me this today. Here is the Illinois Dupage Forest <br>
Preserve's newly approved "Rules and Regulations" for Geocaching and related special uses <br>
(ie Letterboxing). <br>
<br>
I'll let you know how my approvals go. The district sounds very supportive of the activity <br>
and state that the only basic objection they will have to a particular placement will be in <br>
what they consider to be "High Quality Areas" where they want to protect rare species and <br>
rehabilitation areas. They also object to all secretly placed letterboxes. So when the <br>
application process goes public, lets all get legal!<br>
<br>
Here are their newly approved rules;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rules and Regulations for Placing a Geocache on <br>
Forest Preserve District of DuPage County Property<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The Forest Preserve District of DuPage County manages properties under its jurisdiction in <br>
a manner consistent with its enabling statute to protect the lands for the purposes of <br>
conservation, recreation and education.  Responses to requests for placement shall weigh <br>
the relative impact of this use on District preserves.  All requests for placement of <br>
Geocaches shall be regulated by the rules and regulations found in the Requirements for <br>
Geocache Placement and Requirements for Geocache Owners Sections of these Rules and <br>
Regulations.  The Forest Preserve District of DuPage County encourages the use of "virtual" <br>
caches.  No Geocaches may be placed on District property without a specific special use <br>
permit.<br>
<br>
I.  General Provisions<br>
<br>
All Geocache sites on Forest Preserve District of DuPage County properties must be <br>
approved and authorized through the Visitor Services Office.<br>
<br>
II.  Required Information<br>
<br>
The following information is required to be submitted with each Geocache Permit <br>
Application.<br>
<br>
A.  Proposed Geocache location shown on a map.<br>
<br>
B.  Name and contact information of person(s) or organization requesting authorization for <br>
placement of the Geocache.<br>
<br>
C.  List of items to be initially placed into the Geocache.<br>
<br>
<br>
III.  Criteria for Review of Proposals<br>
<br>
The following is a list of criteria that will be used to review all Geocache proposals for <br>
determining the relative impact to preserves.  Additional site-specific factors may need to <br>
be taken into consideration.<br>
<br>
A.  Impact to Threatened and/or Endangered Species and/or critical habitat.<br>
<br>
B.  Is the proposed location of the Geocache compatible with the current designated land <br>
use?<br>
	1.  Nature Preserve<br>
	2.  Cultural or Historic Site<br>
	3.  Ecosystem Class<br>
	4.  Camping, Picnic, other amenities and other high use areas.<br>
	5.  Facilities / Nature Centers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
IV.  Requirements for Geocache Placement<br>
<br>
Once approved for placement, the Geocache must meet the following requirements.  <br>
Violation of any of these Rules and Regulations will necessitate immediate removal of the <br>
Geocache by Forest Preserve District of DuPage County personnel.<br>
<br>
A.  Container must be a clear (see through), waterproof or sealable container with a size <br>
no greater than 4"x8"x12".<br>
<br>
B.  The Geocache shall not contain any food items.<br>
<br>
C.  The Geocache shall not contain any inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials.<br>
<br>
D.  The Geocache shall not be buried.<br>
<br>
E.  The Geocache shall not be affixed to or disturb any vegetation or natural features.<br>
<br>
F.	The Geocache must have an official Forest Preserve Mylar Sticker placed where it will <br>
be visible to DuPage County Forest Preserve staff.<br>
<br>
NOTE:  Through management procedures in the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, <br>
geocaches may be inadvertently burned, mowed, or destroyed.  The Forest Preserve <br>
District of DuPage County will not be held liable to damaged Geocaches.<br>
<br>
V.  Requirements for Geocache Owners<br>
<br>
Once approved for placement, the Geocache owner shall meet the following requirements.  <br>
Violation of any of these Rules and Regulations will necessitate immediate removal of the <br>
Geocache by Forest Preserve District of DuPage County personnel.<br>
<br>
A.  The Geocache owner shall meet with a Designated District Geocache Coordinator at the <br>
Geocache site to discuss placement and rules.<br>
<br>
B.  The Geocache shall be checked at least every 30 days.  Proof of check will be by E-mail, <br>
letter, or personal communication of the Geocache owner to the Designated District <br>
Geocache Coordinator.<br>
<br>
C.  Notice on the Geocache web site must state the following information:<br>
1. 	This Geocache is placed on DuPage County Forest Preserve property with permission.<br>
<br>
2.	Do not place the following items in the Geocache:  Food items, inappropriate, <br>
offensive, or hazardous materials.<br>
<br>
3.	DuPage County Forest Preserve hours are 1 hour after sunrise until 1 hour after <br>
sunset.  Preserve users must not be in the preserves after hours.<br>
<br>
4. It is the visitor's responsibility to be aware of the policies and rules pertaining to this <br>
preserve.  For more information on preserve rules, see the information kiosk in the <br>
parking lot of the preserve or contact Visitor Services at (630) 933-7248.<br>
<br>
5. All Forest Preserve District of DuPage County Ordinances and subsequent policies, rules, <br>
and regulations are applicable.<br>
