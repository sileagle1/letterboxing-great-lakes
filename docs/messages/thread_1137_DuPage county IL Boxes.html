Hello everyone!  I have a message here from the placers of some of <br/>
the boxes in DuPage Co. and have been asked to pass it on in case <br/>
you are driving from out of town ~<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;DuPage County powers-that-be don't approve of letterboxing.  When <br/>
we first moved here last year, we had a bit of pull with some county <br/>
folks and got a teeny foot in the door for "unofficially" placing <br/>
boxes as long as some rules were strictly followed.  In other words, <br/>
follow these rules and we'll look the other way.  That way we could <br/>
publicly post the clues for folks and not have to resort to word-of-<br/>
mouth tricks (tho we still had plenty of word-of-mouth boxes placed).<br/>
<br/>
And we follow their rules totally.  But other folks that have come <br/>
after us, well, some of them are a different story.  Anyway, I <br/>
received a phone call this morning that two county employees had <br/>
taken serious offense over the clues of a box just placed in Downers <br/>
Grove at the Hidden Lake Forest Preserve by some boxer who goes by <br/>
the trail name of "Devil's Mark".  The clues have them feeling that <br/>
letterboxing might just be some sort of Satanic cult or might have <br/>
some sort of Satanic sub-society attached to it here in DuPage -- <br/>
the local law enforcement folks are more than a little paranoid over <br/>
anything that might smack of anything having to do with a gang, a <br/>
cult, etc.  This is a pretty darn conservative county that takes a <br/>
dim view of any of that going on in a county forest preserve.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the employees are going to head over at some point to remove <br/>
that box and wanted me to know that there's a really good chance <br/>
they're just going to go thru and pick up and toss out any and all <br/>
boxes placed in the county preserves that they find listed anyplace <br/>
on the internet this week.  I'd hate for anyone from out-of-town to <br/>
take a drive to check out the boxing here in DuPage and not find <br/>
anything, so I'd appreciate it if you could just post a short blurb <br/>
that folks should maybe check with the placers before coming too far <br/>
from out-of-town for boxes in area forest preserves.  Boxes that <br/>
aren't in the forest preserves, obviously, won't be affected, nor <br/>
will boxes where the clues can't be found on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
When we replant our boxes, we're going to list the clues on lb.org <br/>
but just as a link to our yahoogroup -- Letterboxing-OopsGangClues.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks much! <br/>
<br/>
Pippi &amp; Keith&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
These boxes include but are not exclusive to:<br/>
Tweet! Tweet!<br/>
Biiiiiiiiig Tree<br/>
Cries for Freedom<br/>
<br/>
We know about these boxes because we were fortunate enough to find <br/>
them on our recent trip to IL ~ when we got back home, the clues <br/>
were no longer posted.<br/>
<br/>
I for one say "Good Luck" to Pippi &amp; Keith!<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;DuPage County powers-that-be don't approve of letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have an update on the Dupage Forest Preserve District's "policy" <br/>
regarding the planting of Letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Last week they approved their Rules and Regulations for the placing <br/>
of letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, April 7th their committee is meeting to finalize their <br/>
procedures for approval of letterbox applications. They have said <br/>
they will contact me Thursday afternoon or Friday morning to provide <br/>
me with the outcome. I'll post here when I hear from them. <br/>
<br/>
Their intentions are to have a free permit system. It will be a sort <br/>
of special case - special use permit. They want only to ensure that <br/>
sensitive areas are not disturbed. I applied for permits for my 3 <br/>
previous DuPage boxes; Wheres Peabody?, S'Mores, and Forest Grove <br/>
Lane, back in January. I am hoping to plant them back out by the end <br/>
of April since they have stated they expect to have no objections to <br/>
my areas of placement.<br/>
<br/>
 They do not dislike letterboxing and seems to be quite the contrary -<br/>
 they see it as an excellent way to promote visits to their <br/>
preserves. Perhaps there are employees at specific preserves that <br/>
don't approve of this activity, but the "higher-ups than them" are <br/>
willing to allow the activity and it will be allowed openly in just <br/>
another week or so.<br/>

As promised the forest preserve sent me this today. Here is the Illinois Dupage Forest <br/>
Preserve's newly approved "Rules and Regulations" for Geocaching and related special uses <br/>
(ie Letterboxing). <br/>
<br/>
I'll let you know how my approvals go. The district sounds very supportive of the activity <br/>
and state that the only basic objection they will have to a particular placement will be in <br/>
what they consider to be "High Quality Areas" where they want to protect rare species and <br/>
rehabilitation areas. They also object to all secretly placed letterboxes. So when the <br/>
application process goes public, lets all get legal!<br/>
<br/>
Here are their newly approved rules;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rules and Regulations for Placing a Geocache on <br/>
Forest Preserve District of DuPage County Property<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Forest Preserve District of DuPage County manages properties under its jurisdiction in <br/>
a manner consistent with its enabling statute to protect the lands for the purposes of <br/>
conservation, recreation and education.  Responses to requests for placement shall weigh <br/>
the relative impact of this use on District preserves.  All requests for placement of <br/>
Geocaches shall be regulated by the rules and regulations found in the Requirements for <br/>
Geocache Placement and Requirements for Geocache Owners Sections of these Rules and <br/>
Regulations.  The Forest Preserve District of DuPage County encourages the use of "virtual" <br/>
caches.  No Geocaches may be placed on District property without a specific special use <br/>
permit.<br/>
<br/>
I.  General Provisions<br/>
<br/>
All Geocache sites on Forest Preserve District of DuPage County properties must be <br/>
approved and authorized through the Visitor Services Office.<br/>
<br/>
II.  Required Information<br/>
<br/>
The following information is required to be submitted with each Geocache Permit <br/>
Application.<br/>
<br/>
A.  Proposed Geocache location shown on a map.<br/>
<br/>
B.  Name and contact information of person(s) or organization requesting authorization for <br/>
placement of the Geocache.<br/>
<br/>
C.  List of items to be initially placed into the Geocache.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
III.  Criteria for Review of Proposals<br/>
<br/>
The following is a list of criteria that will be used to review all Geocache proposals for <br/>
determining the relative impact to preserves.  Additional site-specific factors may need to <br/>
be taken into consideration.<br/>
<br/>
A.  Impact to Threatened and/or Endangered Species and/or critical habitat.<br/>
<br/>
B.  Is the proposed location of the Geocache compatible with the current designated land <br/>
use?<br/>
	1.  Nature Preserve<br/>
	2.  Cultural or Historic Site<br/>
	3.  Ecosystem Class<br/>
	4.  Camping, Picnic, other amenities and other high use areas.<br/>
	5.  Facilities / Nature Centers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IV.  Requirements for Geocache Placement<br/>
<br/>
Once approved for placement, the Geocache must meet the following requirements.  <br/>
Violation of any of these Rules and Regulations will necessitate immediate removal of the <br/>
Geocache by Forest Preserve District of DuPage County personnel.<br/>
<br/>
A.  Container must be a clear (see through), waterproof or sealable container with a size <br/>
no greater than 4"x8"x12".<br/>
<br/>
B.  The Geocache shall not contain any food items.<br/>
<br/>
C.  The Geocache shall not contain any inappropriate, offensive, or hazardous materials.<br/>
<br/>
D.  The Geocache shall not be buried.<br/>
<br/>
E.  The Geocache shall not be affixed to or disturb any vegetation or natural features.<br/>
<br/>
F.	The Geocache must have an official Forest Preserve Mylar Sticker placed where it will <br/>
be visible to DuPage County Forest Preserve staff.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  Through management procedures in the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County, <br/>
geocaches may be inadvertently burned, mowed, or destroyed.  The Forest Preserve <br/>
District of DuPage County will not be held liable to damaged Geocaches.<br/>
<br/>
V.  Requirements for Geocache Owners<br/>
<br/>
Once approved for placement, the Geocache owner shall meet the following requirements.  <br/>
Violation of any of these Rules and Regulations will necessitate immediate removal of the <br/>
Geocache by Forest Preserve District of DuPage County personnel.<br/>
<br/>
A.  The Geocache owner shall meet with a Designated District Geocache Coordinator at the <br/>
Geocache site to discuss placement and rules.<br/>
<br/>
B.  The Geocache shall be checked at least every 30 days.  Proof of check will be by E-mail, <br/>
letter, or personal communication of the Geocache owner to the Designated District <br/>
Geocache Coordinator.<br/>
<br/>
C.  Notice on the Geocache web site must state the following information:<br/>
1. 	This Geocache is placed on DuPage County Forest Preserve property with permission.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Do not place the following items in the Geocache:  Food items, inappropriate, <br/>
offensive, or hazardous materials.<br/>
<br/>
3.	DuPage County Forest Preserve hours are 1 hour after sunrise until 1 hour after <br/>
sunset.  Preserve users must not be in the preserves after hours.<br/>
<br/>
4. It is the visitor's responsibility to be aware of the policies and rules pertaining to this <br/>
preserve.  For more information on preserve rules, see the information kiosk in the <br/>
parking lot of the preserve or contact Visitor Services at (630) 933-7248.<br/>
<br/>
5. All Forest Preserve District of DuPage County Ordinances and subsequent policies, rules, <br/>
and regulations are applicable.<br/>

activity.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Are they doing this to Geocachers too?  It would be only fair.<br/>

&gt; As promised the forest preserve sent me this today. Here is the <br/>
Illinois Dupage Forest <br/>
&gt; Preserve's newly approved "Rules and Regulations" for Geocaching <br/>
and related special uses <br/>
&gt; (ie Letterboxing). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll let you know how my approvals go. The district sounds very <br/>
supportive of the activity <br/>
&gt; and state that the only basic objection they will have to a <br/>
particular placement will be in <br/>
&gt; what they consider to be "High Quality Areas" where they want to <br/>
protect rare species and <br/>
&gt; rehabilitation areas. They also object to all secretly placed <br/>
letterboxes. So when the <br/>
&gt; application process goes public, lets all get legal!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here are their newly approved rules;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rules and Regulations for Placing a Geocache on <br/>
&gt; Forest Preserve District of DuPage County Property<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Forest Preserve District of DuPage County manages properties <br/>
under its jurisdiction in <br/>
&gt; a manner consistent with its enabling statute to protect the lands <br/>
for the purposes of <br/>
&gt; conservation, recreation and education.  Responses to requests for <br/>
placement shall weigh <br/>
&gt; the relative impact of this use on District preserves.  All <br/>
requests for placement of <br/>
&gt; Geocaches shall be regulated by the rules and regulations found in <br/>
the Requirements for <br/>
&gt; Geocache Placement and Requirements for Geocache Owners Sections <br/>
of these Rules and <br/>
&gt; Regulations.  The Forest Preserve District of DuPage County <br/>
encourages the use of "virtual" <br/>
&gt; caches.  No Geocaches may be placed on District property without a <br/>
specific special use <br/>
&gt; permit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I.  General Provisions<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All Geocache sites on Forest Preserve District of DuPage County <br/>
properties must be <br/>
&gt; approved and authorized through the Visitor Services Office.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; II.  Required Information<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; B.  Name and contact information of person(s) or organization <br/>
requesting authorization for <br/>
&gt; placement of the Geocache.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; C.  List of items to be initially placed into the Geocache.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; III.  Criteria for Review of Proposals<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The following is a list of criteria that will be used to review <br/>
all Geocache proposals for <br/>
&gt; determining the relative impact to preserves.  Additional site-<br/>
specific factors may need to <br/>
&gt; be taken into consideration.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A.  Impact to Threatened and/or Endangered Species and/or critical <br/>
habitat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; B.  Is the proposed location of the Geocache compatible with the <br/>
current designated land <br/>
&gt; use?<br/>
&gt; 	1.  Nature Preserve<br/>
&gt; 	2.  Cultural or Historic Site<br/>
&gt; 	3.  Ecosystem Class<br/>
&gt; 	4.  Camping, Picnic, other amenities and other high use <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IV.  Requirements for Geocache Placement<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once approved for placement, the Geocache must meet the following <br/>
requirements.  <br/>
&gt; Violation of any of these Rules and Regulations will necessitate <br/>

&gt; Geocache by Forest Preserve District of DuPage County personnel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A.  Container must be a clear (see through), waterproof or <br/>
sealable container with a size <br/>
&gt; no greater than 4"x8"x12".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; B.  The Geocache shall not contain any food items.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; C.  The Geocache shall not contain any inappropriate, offensive, <br/>
or hazardous materials.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; D.  The Geocache shall not be buried.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; E.  The Geocache shall not be affixed to or disturb any vegetation <br/>
or natural features.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; F.	The Geocache must have an official Forest Preserve Mylar <br/>
Sticker placed where it will <br/>
&gt; be visible to DuPage County Forest Preserve staff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NOTE:  Through management procedures in the Forest Preserve <br/>
District of DuPage County, <br/>
&gt; geocaches may be inadvertently burned, mowed, or destroyed.  The <br/>
Forest Preserve <br/>
&gt; District of DuPage County will not be held liable to damaged <br/>
Geocaches.<br/>

Geocache Coordinator at the <br/>
&gt; Geocache site to discuss placement and rules.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; B.  The Geocache shall be checked at least every 30 days.  Proof <br/>
of check will be by E-mail, <br/>
&gt; letter, or personal communication of the Geocache owner to the <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; C.  Notice on the Geocache web site must state the following <br/>
