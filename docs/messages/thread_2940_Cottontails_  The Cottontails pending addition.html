Christmas will be a hectic time of the year for you in 2006, but Christmas 2007 will be so much fun when the babies are 1 year old.  And it only gets better each year.  Yes, your life will change with the birth of children, but hopefully these two children will brings lots of joy into your family too.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  As promised last weekend at the Mini Gathering in Germantown, we are <br/>
  posting the results of our first Ultrasound that we had this <br/>
  afternoon...<br/>
<br/>
  One of the babies is a BOY!!<br/>
<br/>
  The other one is still a mystery, as its brother was blocking our view.<br/>
<br/>
  That's right, TWINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(Something we <br/>
  didn't know until this afternoon.)<br/>
<br/>
  Still in Shock<br/>
