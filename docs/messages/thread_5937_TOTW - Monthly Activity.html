Oh my!  Does not having a TV all these years do this to a person?  Words like "pivot sheet", "spreadsheet" and "graphs" is just way too left brained for us!  In matter of fact, the thought that we even wondered about a "statistical" question is scary in it's own right!  Way too much math for us!  <br>
<br>
We basically counted up our finds and sorted them into the two groups.  (We used our own "spread sheet" method - flinging the wrinkled, inky, smeared clue sheets into either a warm pile or a cool pile.) To  our surprise we had a fairly even amount in both groups, but winter boxing was the winner with 67 more boxes.  Thanks in part to winter trips.  We also realized that we seem to prefer cooler temps to be outdoors, along with the fact that the warmer months bring more weekend distractions (like holidays, weddings, family parties etc.)  <br>
We'd give you a more concise account of the status of our boxing habits - like how many more boxes do we find when there is a full moon, but we have an uncanny need to go watch mindless TV...maybe this is why we've done so poorly in math all these years!<br>

made pretty graphs following her format and uploaded them as a pdf in <br>

showing our breakdown of boxes found per state.  If you check out the <br>
file, you also might happen to notice that we are nearly at a major <br>
boxing milestone... hopefully over this weekend or next. :)<br>
<br>
In case you don't go look at it though, we definitely have more finds <br>
Apr-Sep than Oct-Mar -- 67% vs 33%.  I imagine those who travel away <br>
from the chilly/snowy midwest even for a week or two of vacation during <br>
the winter months are able to get more winter finds that way.  Our <br>
winter traveling involves visiting parents, which as you may know, live <br>
in WI and MI so definitely snowy there and no increase in opportunity to <br>
box.  As for plants, we're very close, 49% vs 51%, although the <br>
distributions are pretty inconsistent overall, and a couple of 10-box <br>
series planted in July and Dec skew the results a bit.<br>

teach my students without MS Excel how to do their homework.  My breakdown<br>
seems to have much more to do with the academic calendar than the weather,<br>

Half of all the boxes I've found have been in one of those four months.<br>
Oddly, April is apparently the month I never letterbox;  I have only 5 finds<br>
in that month over nearly 5 years of letterboxing (and all of those, even<br>
though they aren't the same year, are Flying Dragon boxes).  Weird.<br>

What is the decent FTP (Found To Planted = boxes found/boxes planted) ratio?<br>

Or a respectable HHR (Hitch Hiker Ratio = hitch hikers released/boxes <br>

Or how high is too high for my ABT (Attempted But There = boxes that <br>

they were missing)?<br>

Or maybe you have a few other stats to consider!? ;-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My letterboxing statistics are not as sophisticated: <br>
My FTP ratio is 7.3/1<br>
My HHR ratio of released to found about 2 to 5.  Statistically, I find a HH about every 11th box ... but I also own a HHH so I get to see a lot of HHs and my stats are summarily skewed.<br>
<br>
I have no idea how to sort my finds and figure out in which month I find more ... I just know that in Minnesota, it's nearly impossible to find boxes in January (unless they are indoors)!<br>
<br>
Since I started letterboxing in the U.S., I have found at least one traditional box every month.  (I first tried letterboxing on Dartmoor in April 2008 and didn't start letterboxing in the U.S. until August of 2008)<br>
