                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I got back from the opening day at Bristol.  Got to meet<br/>
Dumpster Diva and Shutterfly and do an exchange.  I also got to watch<br/>
them hunt for a few boxes.  It was fun watching from the sidelines -<br/>
very different persective on letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I did tweek the web page a little bit when I got home.  Word got to me<br/>
early that the Pippin box was gone, and I couldn't find it for a<br/>
while.  I hid the box on Thursday, and apparently on Friday they did<br/>
some landscaping.  I finally moved a couple of rocks and finally<br/>
exposed the rock it is under.  It should be fine now.  Hopefully they<br/>
won't move the rocks back.  Also, the bench for the "Ale" is gone, so<br/>
I changed the story to sit on the rocks there. I also fixed the clues<br/>
Rua wrote for St. Bridgid's Cross. You don't add the mancala number to<br/>
36, you put it in front of 36.<br/>
<br/>
I also discovered that one of the sisters is back at the "dirty"<br/>
establishment, and that she is very interested in participating again.<br/>
 So I moved the clues to "Please no rats in the soup" up to the<br/>
letterperson area on the webpage.  Currently there are no rats in the<br/>
soup, as the are having trouble finding any around.  She gaurntees<br/>
that the soup will be meatier once they catch some.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you have a chance to talk to Jane the Phool, she is a<br/>
letterboxer as well.  She was not ready for exchanges today, but may<br/>
be in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I should also note that I found out today that Letters, Letters,<br/>
Everywhere will not start until July 18, and will still be Sundays only.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The day was a blast! It was pretty neat finding Dragon. Meeting <br/>
anyone I've talked to online is always fun. I got a kick out of Jane <br/>
too. We're sitting there, being all quiet about exchanging stamps, <br/>
and here is Jane yelling from the rooftops, "ARE YOU LETTERBOXERS!?" <br/>
That was priceless. Later, we had a longer conversation about boxing, <br/>
and rubber stamps in general.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes were great. Dumpster Diva is great at finding and picking <br/>
them up without drawing attention to herself. She walked right behind <br/>
a couple once (inches away) to place the box back, and they didn't <br/>
notice her at all! Every time we were walking in circles trying to <br/>
find a box, we thought Dragon was hiding in the shadows, laughing at <br/>
our stupidity. Well, we know he was at least once. Bell, what bell? <br/>
Our "duh" moment at St. Brigid's Cross was also great. I don't think <br/>
Dragon saw that one, though. :P<br/>
<br/>
If you get the chance, go to the faire. It is a ton of fun. Before <br/>
you go, though, check the website for coupons. You can get a few <br/>
dollars taken off the admission price with them.<br/>
