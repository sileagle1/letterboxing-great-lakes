However we have never viewed it as a "kid-focused activity" that adults can help with.  We instead view it as an adult activity that kids can learn, similar to how they learn other games, sports and hobbies.  Like your children, our nieces and nephews are VERY conscientious letterboxers, taking great pains to be sure a box is hidden well and using discretion in how they talk and act around muggles that may be in the area.<br/>

&gt; While I don't agree with taking a group of preschoolers on a <br/>
&gt; letterboxing outing, I don't agree with letterboxing being an <br/>
&gt; adults- <br/>
&gt; only hobby. My three kids know to be just as respectful as we are <br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; we're out. They're watchful to make sure that everything is put <br/>
&gt; back <br/>
&gt; in the box securely and that the box is hidden, sometimes better <br/>
&gt; than <br/>
&gt; we found it. Chances are that children who are disrespectful <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; other people's boxes have parents who are also, and those parents <br/>
&gt; shouldn't be boxing either. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing isn't "exclusive", nor should it be. But it is <br/>
&gt; becoming <br/>
&gt; more well-known, and with that comes the increased chance of <br/>
&gt; negative <br/>
&gt; things happening, same as anything else that has increased <br/>
&gt; publicity. <br/>
&gt; Chances are, the hype will die down after a while and it will go <br/>
&gt; back <br/>
&gt; to being those who are truly doing it for the right reasons. <br/>
&gt; Until <br/>
&gt; then, I think taking extra precautions is a good idea, especially <br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; there are people out there who obviously don't care if they're <br/>
&gt; ruining <br/>
&gt; a such a good thing for the rest of us. <br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm always a bit careful about who I give info to about the GLk <br/>
&gt; board. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I figure if they do the initial research to find the board, they <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; &gt; truly interested boxers who have taken the time to read a lot <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; hobby. Otherwise I wait a while to see how a new boxer behaves. <br/>
&gt; If <br/>
&gt; &gt; they send Contact the Placer messages, take good care of a box, <br/>
&gt; and/or <br/>
&gt; &gt; eventually plant a box, I'll send them a link. I do <br/>
&gt; this "filtering" <br/>
&gt; &gt; since there are some restricted clues on the message board, and <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; don't <br/>
&gt; &gt; feel comfortable just having any/every boxer have access to them. <br/>
