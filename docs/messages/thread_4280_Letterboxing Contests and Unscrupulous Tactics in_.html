However we have never viewed it as a "kid-focused activity" that adults can help with.  We instead view it as an adult activity that kids can learn, similar to how they learn other games, sports and hobbies.  Like your children, our nieces and nephews are VERY conscientious letterboxers, taking great pains to be sure a box is hidden well and using discretion in how they talk and act around muggles that may be in the area.<br>
