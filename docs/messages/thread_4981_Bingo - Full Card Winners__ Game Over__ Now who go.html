mass rush of bingo winners. She LIVES to see another day! Even for<br/>
someone not playing the game, the tension was immense. Gee...I don't<br/>
know If I can survive this. BTW: Tell me who got the socks?!?<br/>

&gt; Yesterday's word was indeed a winner for Tiptoe &amp; Tonto and the Cereal<br/>
&gt; City Boxers.  So they have claimed the final 2 victory spots in this<br/>
&gt; year's game.  Congratulations to all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know there was some debate over whether they would be considered the<br/>
&gt; last two winners or if it would be a tie for 2nd and the game would<br/>
&gt; continue for a 3rd.  I do allow ties where there is no other choice --<br/>
&gt; i.e. when there is a tie for an interim game or if there is a tie for<br/>
&gt; 3rd place in the big game, or if say 12 people would have called bingo<br/>
&gt; for full card.  Nobody would be denied their win, even if it meant<br/>
&gt; increasing the expected number of winners.  However, in a situation<br/>
&gt; where there are open winning slots when the tie is called -- i.e. if<br/>
&gt; two people would call Bingo for 1st or 2nd place on the full card, it<br/>
&gt; just uses up the available winning spots in order to try and keep the<br/>
&gt; number of winners as close as possible to the predetermined number of 7.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope that makes sense...  and if you were one of those people sitting<br/>
&gt; there waiting for "exchange", "degree" or "trail map", you are not<br/>
&gt; alone.  Each day as I pulled the word, I breathed a sigh of relief<br/>
&gt; that it was not one of those 3 words as there would have been a<br/>
&gt; plethora of winners with any of them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If any of the winners of the Bingo games are going to be at the<br/>
&gt; Fairies Gathering tomorrow, please e-mail me.  I will see if I can get<br/>
&gt; the stuff divided out this evening and possibly bring it with tomorrow<br/>
&gt; for those folks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking forward to next year's game and taking suggestions --<br/>
&gt; especially as to how to avoid 20 people all waiting for the same<br/>
&gt; couple of words at the end of the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; For those who wanted to know, had I continued calling words:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I - The Interurban (OH)<br/>
&gt; B - Trail Map<br/>
&gt; N - The Happy Snowman (MI-LP)<br/>
&gt; I - Baby Bunny's Birthday Bash (IL)<br/>
&gt; O - Degree<br/>
&gt; N - He's Not a TAME Lion (IN)<br/>
&gt; O - Exchange<br/>
&gt; G - George &amp; Lettie (IL)<br/>
&gt; G - Racine Bells (WI)<br/>
