I am thinking we may head back in a couple weeks to get the boxes we missed (must have those last two Lost stamps!).  It was great seeing everyone again (even if it was only briefly) and making some new friends as well.  <br/>

FungusWoman - I am glad we were able to find your walking stick for you.  Please extend your thanks to Whisk Element and Photonut as well since they were our boxing buddies for the day.  I think it was actually Whisk Element that spotted the stick to begin with.  Regardless - glad we could help.  And I would love a copy of the "reunion" photo that was taken . . . <br/>
<br/>
Revode - Sorry you missed getting our PT.  But no worries - you can always catch us at the next event!<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to extend a special thanks to One Love Journeying and Lighthouse Keeper.  They offered us a much needed ride back to the shelter after an unsuccessful attempt at finding John Locke in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
And of course thanks to aimlesst for all her work at making this such a fun event.  Looking forward to the next one :)<br/>
