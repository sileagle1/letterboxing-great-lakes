If you haven't reserved, you may want to do that as soon as you can.  I am planning to stay at our family's lake house about 10 miles from Pokagon and commute into the park.<br/>

Oh, that brings back memories!! Oh so many years ago when Do-Re-Mi Gal <br/>
was just 5 months old, we took her on her first camping trip.  Just one <br/>
night to see how she would do.  (And she did great, so that meant we <br/>
could go on our church's family camping trip a few weeks later.) And I <br/>
just remembered that her first camping experience was at Pokagon!  <br/>
Her "crib" was a laundry basket and her "highchair" was her car seat. <br/>
