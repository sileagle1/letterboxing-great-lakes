trip to Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana and wherever else you ended up?  <br/>
Were there any neat tricks with placement, clues, etc. that you'd <br/>
like to pass along?  Since I've only boxed in WI and IL (and very <br/>
limited at that), I'm always curious about regional norms in other <br/>
areas.  Hope you had a great time!  Did you place any boxes while you <br/>
were vacationing?<br/>
