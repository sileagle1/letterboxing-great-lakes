Congratulations! Since I'll be coming up on four years in August, I I'm not<br>
an oldtimer - guess I'll have to call myself "hardcore". Especially since I<br>
dreamt about LBing twice in the last week! Though not as hardcore as you and<br>

OMG - was I off!  You have FIVE times plus the finds!  WOW!<br>
<br>
As for my plants - thank you all for your patience with the little and not-so-little errors in my clues.  I've got lots of ideas on my carving season list:  Bigs Dogs (replacement), Can Do Women - Betty Ford, MathWoman/Tales of Distributions, Eggopolis - SunnySideUp, The Happy Tree (at Lapham), Grandpa's Shingle Mill/DiSTILLery in Cavour, Castle TV show (I will get this to work and last!); something Vulcan-y; lots of mugs - cheesehead, Holiday World; and lots of books: Miss Rumphius, Into Thin Air, frog-themed books, Elm Creek Quilts, Judy Blume, Nancy Drew.  Those are off the top of my head.  Yup - lots of ideas.  But this is finding season - plan to go to Door County/Algoma/Green Bay again - might go to U.P. for the Paradise mini-meet.  This hobby is SO much fun!  :)<br>

I have been itching to get out and get that new box of Dragon's!  And now the whole Circus Train is up and running!  Hmmm, might have to do a road trip to Watertown, Horicon, Ripon and Lodi.  Or a couple of trips. :)<br>
<br>
As for the Parade of Books - the trail is only 1.5 BLOCKS from my house.  When I started LBing, the parade "ended" less than a half-mile east of us.  Unfortunately, I lost another post to this board - I'd written about the many, many ideas I have for the series and the next carving season!  Archeofrog has brought to my attention another book I hadn't heard of that's very interesting - Motel of the Mysteries.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alas, 'twas not a Mary with mugs, nor a Lizard needing some java to get Leapin' that was the first finder. At first I thought perhaps one of my (sometimes) converts to LBing from Jefferson County had nabbed it - nope. The honor goes to the same one who snuck ahead of me to the fantastic Memorial Day LBs - Speech Teacher!   Excellent carvings!  I like the punny title for the second box - and the hide was definitely well "camoflaged"!  Oh, and I loved that I got to write in a "book" with Sharpie!  Maybe I really am a secret rebel!<br>
<br>
Funny thing - the staff apparently didn't know about it when Speech Teacher went in.  When we got there, one person remarked on that with a smile, saying the owner hadn't told them.  I had spotted the first LB before asking for it.  <br>
<br>
Nice shop - DD espcially enjoyed the books!<br>
