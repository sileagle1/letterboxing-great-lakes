Hi <br>
I decided to welcome spring with a letterbox! <br>
FYI for letterbox "purists". The stamps, there are two, are not hand <br>
carved. The log book IS hand made. No room for a pencil so bring your <br>
own. The name of the letterbox is "Just us Chicks!" I would call it <br>
an easy box, placed in a picnic area with flat terrain and less than <br>
a half mile total walking. The ground may be a bit damp in wet <br>
weather.<br>
It was planted 3/19/05 at Willow Metropark, which is southeast of <br>
Bellville and northwest of Flat Rock. To get to the park, take I275 <br>
to exit #13 (Sibley Road/New Boston)Take Sibley rd east 3.1 miles to <br>
Vining Rd and turn right. Go 3.2 miles to the T-intersection and veer <br>
right onto Willow rd. Drive 1.2 miles to the park entrance on the <br>
right.<br>
<br>
Here's the clues:<br>
 After entering the park, turn right past the toll booth and then <br>
turn left into the parking lot for the Flint Woods picnic areas C.<br>
Begin your quest facing east.<br>
South drinking fountain<br>
North on the trail<br>
Stop for a snack if you're hungry<br>
NE corner of your stopping place<br>
Look for the victory sign at 110 degrees<br>
Go there<br>
The victory sign's behind you<br>
Look 110 degrees<br>
45 footfalls to your goal<br>
Look low<br>
You've found it!<br>
<br>
good luck<br>

 YIPPEE!<br>
I'm so happy that someone actually looked for this box, and that the <br>
clues worked!<br>
<br>
If someone else is planning to seek this box in the near future, can <br>
you bring another ziplock bag to double bag the box? I am not certain <br>
that the box istself is waterproof, and due to the nature of the size <br>
and shape of the box, it was tough to bag the box contents wiithin <br>
the box.Thanks!!<br>
