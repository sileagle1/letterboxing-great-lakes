Another idea is to use it interchangeably with your regular signature stamps -- sometimes one, sometimes the other -- maybe on days when you just don't feel quite like yourself.<br>

  Subject: [LbGLK] Suggestions for a stamp<br>
<br>
<br>
  I am looking for suggestions on what to do with a stamp.<br>
<br>
  I have three armadillo designs that I like.  I have now carved all<br>
  three of them.  One is my signature stamp, one is a personla traveler,<br>
  and the last is what I don't know what to do with.<br>
<br>
  I don't want to put it in a box, and I am not ready to change my sig<br>
  stamp yet.  So, any creative ideas?<br>
