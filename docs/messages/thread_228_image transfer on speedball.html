Can any of you all do a nailpolish remover transfer on speedball medium?  I have a chunk of the white stuff that won't take ANYTHING, and am wondering if the pink stuff is the same way.  Finally gave up, and used the last chunk of my mastercarve (which does accept nailpolish transfers).  Any tips on how I can make this work?<br/>
<br/>
OR (and I vaguely remember this being a very long thread on the big list sometime last year, but since it didn't seem topical to me at the time, I just deleted all of them) could any of you send your tips on halving mastercarve?  I tried it with a big old butcher knife and the results were...um...not so good.  I didn't lose any fingers, but my husband DID walk in on me in the middle and just about stroke out.  *grin*  Something about the vision of me, a knife, and anything requiring balance and precision didn't sit well with him.<br/>
<br/>
That is all.  Speedball transfers and mastercarve slicing.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
I've  heard you can use a cheese cutter to cut Mastercarve in <br/>
half....  Just don't use MY cheese cutter because apparently it's <br/>
not sturdy or precise enough to make an even cut.  The only thing <br/>
it's good at cutting is, mysteriously enough, cheese.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else tried cutting Mastercarve with a cheese cutter? <br/>
