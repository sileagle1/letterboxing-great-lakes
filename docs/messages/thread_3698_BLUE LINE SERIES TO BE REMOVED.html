I did two boxes in Boston on my first trip there that I found to be<br>
VERY questionable.  One was in an access shaft in the Boston City Hall<br>
- very easy hiding place for a bomb.  The other was in the state<br>
building behind a phone booth on the floor above the Governor's and<br>
Lt. Governor's offices.  As I was stamping in, some "men in black"<br>
came by and I had to wander around the place to lose them, but I'm<br>
sure they followed my movements on camera.  The stamps were really<br>
stupid (IMHO) and not worth getting arrested over by any means.<br>

911 and calling mall security.<br>

It isn't even a decision I would have to think about because we are all <br>

suggesting is that everyone who has recently placed a box inside a store <br>
without permission, please reconsider the above and consider that <br>
employees are trained to be on the lookout for shoplifters and other <br>
suspicious behavior. <br>
<br>
Some companies still use a physical attempt to stop shoplifters. Some <br>
professional security carry firearms.  It scares me to think a <br>
letterboxer (of any age) might get into a really bad situation because <br>
an alert employee (or a camera being watched by an employee in the back <br>

I'm sure you have had similar experiences.  Those not in this business, <br>
may not believe what retailers see on a weekly and sometimes daily <br>

<br>
In some ways, I know there isn't much difference between hiding a <br>
camo-taped box out in the woods v. inside a store.  I guess the only <br>
difference is that inside a store or other public place there is a much <br>
higher concentration of people and more of a chance to induce panic <br>
and/or media attention. <br>
<br>
Again, all I am suggesting is that the placement of boxes inside stores <br>
without permission be reconsidered.  I am counting my words as carefully <br>
as I can via email and am sincerely concerned that someone might either <br>
seriously scare someone or might get into trouble with police authorities.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've got one box that will be going into a local video store, but I've <br>
got permission from the owner for that one.  The tricky part will be <br>
that he doesn't want his employees to know about it, that way they won't <br>
get questions about it to distract them from their jobs.  That being <br>
said, I do have to agree that boxes planted inside stores without <br>
permission need to be re-evaluated.  Like was said earlier, no one wants <br>
to cause a scare and possibly be arrested due to a letterbox.  It might <br>
not be your letterbox, but if someone sees you with it, consider it <br>
yours.  Look at the 2 guys in Boston, for all we know, they thought the <br>
ad company that hired them had gotten all the proper permissions and <br>
permits needed to hang those ads.<br>
<br>
As it is now, boxers in NH need to be careful since the police are <br>
asking for anyone with info about Geocaching (and inevitably <br>
Letterboxing) to come forward.  The next thing you know, they'll start <br>
cruising through Geocache.com, AQ and LBNA looking for possible illegal <br>
plantings and confiscate them.  That might just be the paranoia talking, <br>
but in these times, anything can happen and be claimed as done for the <br>
public good/safety, and usually with a grant paid for by the taxpayers.  <br>
It's just a matter of time before it spreads to other cities and states.<br>

your perspective.  You certainly *should* speak up.<br>
<br>
I can't see any sense in wrapping any box inside any establishment in<br>
camo-tape.  Camouflage tape is to camouflage a box in a woodsy, foresty type<br>
setting.  Camo-tape isn't really going to camouflage a box in an indoor<br>
setting unless the box is hidden amongst the camo-tape. :-) But I can<br>
picture some placers using camo-tape on an indoor box just because "that's<br>
the way it's done."  :-) No need for baggies with an indoor box either.<br>
<br>
Mine was in a 35mm film canister.  (I went over and pulled it tonight --<br>
I'll probably go with the golf course idea.)  Big box stores offer film<br>
developing, so I figured if an employee found it, the most they would think<br>
is that someone was dropping off their film, set it down while looking at<br>
some merchandise, and then forgot it and lost track of where they set it.<br>
If they opened it, they'd find the stamp and logbook.<br>
<br>
And the reason I do it word-of-mouth is so that I can totally control who's<br>
going to go looking for it to know that they're the sort of boxers who are<br>
extremely unlikely to demonstrate any "suspicious looking" activity.<br>
There's nothing to "shoplift" because they're not leaving the store with the<br>
box.  I would think that no security person would attempt to use deadly<br>
force on a potential shoplifter.  Is it even legal to use deadly force on<br>
someone who's suspected of shoplifting?<br>
<br>
But yep, someone could still panic or get upset when they find it, and there<br>
could be trouble.<br>
<br>
I remember a thread quite awhile back, I think on the big list, about using<br>
magnets to attach boxes to outdoor electrical boxes, which is what happened<br>
in New Hampshire, if I'm not mistaken, with the geocache.<br>
<br>
And there was also the discussion awhile back of using magnets to attach<br>
letterboxes underneath collection mailboxes in cities.  I can't remember<br>
whether that was on the big list or the urban boxing list.<br>
<br>
But I know, as a Postal employee, that we're trained to immediately contact<br>
the police, the hazmat folks, the Postal Inspectors, and also frequently the<br>
FBI, if we see any type of unauthorized box attached to or inside of or<br>
sitting under or next to any USPS collection box or if we see anyone acting<br>
suspiciously around a box.  It's taken so seriously because we've already<br>
had bombs go off that have seriously maimed Postal workers and things like<br>
poisons placed in envelopes have already killed Postal workers.  Not to<br>
mention that any mail already deposited in that box might end up destroyed<br>
as the bomb squad goes about "removing" the suspicious item -- sometimes<br>
they don't bother using a lot of finesse with those types of jobs.  So<br>
federal charges could end up filed against both placer and finder.<br>
Destruction of federal property.  Destruction of the mail.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, when I was a collection route driver, I never did really<br>
worry about bombs or poisons except once when someone deposited a really<br>
suspicious package in one of my collection box.  It got turned over to the<br>
police and then to the Inspectors, then to the FBI, and I never did find out<br>
whether it was a threat or was benign.  Mostly I worried about idiots who<br>
put live rats down the box chutes, live cats down the box chutes, dripping<br>
ice cream cones down the box chutes, used condoms down the box chutes, live<br>
snakes down the box chutes.  I only found one package that was actually<br>
suspicious.  I probably found a hundred or so of gross-but-not-suspicious<br>
stuff.  But the only thing that ended up with the Postal Inspectors and with<br>
the FBI was that package.  They didn't care about the cats, the rats, the<br>
snakes, the ice cream cones, or the condoms.  Those they considered *my*<br>
problem.  :-)  Not the problem of Homeland Security.<br>
<br>
Barb, I certainly agree...........best for each placer to rethink where each<br>
of our boxes is placed in today's climate and be sure we're comfortable with<br>
where we've placed those boxes.<br>

Great points about 35 mm canisters and "consider the box yours" should <br>
someone question what you might have in your hands.  And I agree that <br>
camo-tape really shouldn't be used inside for the very reasons you <br>
stated---it's meant to hide stuff in the woods!  :)<br>
<br>
I also really like the WOM thoughts as well.  That is an excellent way <br>
to drive home some important points ahead of time.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the added perspective of a postal worker?!  OMG  I had zero <br>
clue people would throw ANYthing other than their mail into a drop <br>
box?!  Where have I been?!  I'm so sickened that anyone would have to be <br>
subjected to disgusting things like that?!  Wow.....<br>
<br>
So thanks for your comments!!  I appreciate your thoughtful responses!!  <br>
More to think about and I am rethinking some of my own boxes as well!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Trailtracker, you make some very very points here.  Thank you for sharing your perspective with us.  I know there are some people who get kicks out of hiding and finding the urban /indoor boxes and that is the way that they choose to play the game, but I am just not stealthy enough, or at least I don't feel I am and thus no doubt, make myself look suspicious in these situations.  As one who has had an unnerving experience with the authorities regarding a questionably placed urban /indoor letterbox, I long ago swore off all but the most innocuous of these types of boxes.  I have to admit that my first reaction after my NYC /FBI experience was "geez, it is just a letterbox."  But there really is no way to know that at first glance and the policy in most places is not to investigate, rather to immediately contact authorities.  It is indeed sad that world events of the past several years has made us a paranoid society, but for better or worse that is reality and there has been a huge attitude shift to "better safe than sorry" which has prompted organizations to instruct their employees to immediately take precautionary steps when they see any suspicious behavior or items that do not belong in their environment. <br>
<br>
I asked myself why I was attracted to letterboxing in the first place -- sure there is the challenge of finding boxes, but outside of that, my primary attractions were beautiful locations with great hikes (a store?) and FUN!  Confrontation with the authorities over a letterbox is not, in my opinion, fun.<br>
<br>
I am glad to hear that the Indoor Letterbox project was cancelled.  <br>

<br>
<br>
  I have been struggling with whether or not to speak up about the boxes <br>
  that have been placed recently inside stores. Please know I respect <br>
  that everyone has their own perspective and so I kept quiet. I guess, <br>
  with the recent situations in Chicago and Boston, I would feel better if <br>
  I softly spoke up now. (Better later than never?!) <br>
<br>
  As a retail general manager of a large store, I can share the <br>
  perspective that if a customer, employee....or heaven forbid, child <br>
  found a letterbox that I was not aware of inside my store, I would have <br>
  had an immediate responsibility to evacuate the building while calling <br>
  911 and calling mall security.<br>
<br>
  It isn't even a decision I would have to think about because we are all <br>
  trained to follow the above guidelines. All I am respectfully <br>
  suggesting is that everyone who has recently placed a box inside a store <br>
  without permission, please reconsider the above and consider that <br>
  employees are trained to be on the lookout for shoplifters and other <br>
  suspicious behavior. <br>
<br>
  Some companies still use a physical attempt to stop shoplifters. Some <br>
  professional security carry firearms. It scares me to think a <br>
  letterboxer (of any age) might get into a really bad situation because <br>
  an alert employee (or a camera being watched by an employee in the back <br>
  rooms) saw suspicious behavior. For anyone else in retail management, <br>
  I'm sure you have had similar experiences. Those not in this business, <br>
  may not believe what retailers see on a weekly and sometimes daily <br>
  basis. And if a letterbox is wrapped in camo-tape.... <br>
<br>
  In some ways, I know there isn't much difference between hiding a <br>
  camo-taped box out in the woods v. inside a store. I guess the only <br>
  difference is that inside a store or other public place there is a much <br>
  higher concentration of people and more of a chance to induce panic <br>
  and/or media attention. <br>
<br>
  Again, all I am suggesting is that the placement of boxes inside stores <br>
  without permission be reconsidered. I am counting my words as carefully <br>
  as I can via email and am sincerely concerned that someone might either <br>
  seriously scare someone or might get into trouble with police authorities.<br>
<br>
  Trying to softly suggest some things to consider....<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ooooooooooh, I would never ever EVER want any type of job cleaning<br>
hotels/motels.  Those folks deserve big tips just for taking the job in my<br>
opinion.  Hotels/motels couldn't survive without 'em and it's got to be<br>
disgusting at times.<br>
<br>
They've never told us that we couldn't say anything.  The window clerks are<br>
supposed to check for the same things when they take in a package, and are<br>
supposed to ask senders a list of particular questions.  The collection<br>
carriers, unfortunately, don't have the benefit of having the sender right<br>
in front of them face-to-face, so we have to be even more careful.<br>
<br>
The package was "Unibomber Style."   It was very obvious.<br>
<br>
The address it was being sent to was made from words cut from<br>
magazines/newspapers, pasted on, and then covered with clear shipping tape.<br>
The return address was a false address (but was hand written).  I happened<br>
to realize right away that the return addy wasn't legit since I'd done the<br>
section of town where the return address was supposedly located so I knew<br>
there was no such office building with that address.  It was addressed to a<br>
person at a university in Arizona, which wasn't a good sign either.<br>
<br>
It wasn't, however, ticking or anything.  :-)  But from what I understand,<br>
modern day bombs don't need to be "ticking."  I guess the ticking stuff is<br>
mostly in old movies.<br>
<br>
So there was no second guessing for me as to whether or not I should<br>
consider this a "suspicious" package.  I called the supervisor right away on<br>
my cell phone and was told "Don't touch it!  Don't touch it!"  I told 'er,<br>
well gee, I wasn't about to.  Not My Job Man.  :-)  I did like I was<br>
supposed to and sat in my truck at a good distance from the package and<br>
stopped anyone who came along to mail a letter in that box before the police<br>
got there.<br>
<br>
For all I know, it might even have been a Postal Inspection "plant."  They<br>
do those types of things sometimes to check up to see that we're following<br>
the rules and regs the way we're supposed to.  But we're never told the<br>
final disposition of any of these cases.<br>
<br>
The Service is now in the process of putting video cameras in a lot of Post<br>
Office lobbies and window lines.  We just got one a couple of months ago at<br>
our place.  The camera is connected to the offices at the big sectional<br>
center.  Serves two purposes actually.  It can identify when lines get<br>
really long and window clerk supervisors don't do anything to get things<br>
moving along faster (something needed at some of our facilities).  And it<br>
can identify people who might need to be identified later should there be an<br>
attempted hold-up or someone mailing a package that really did turn out to<br>
be dangerous where someone got killed or maimed.  Like banks, we'll now be<br>
able to get some idea of what the person looks like.<br>
<br>
So don't pick yer nose or scratch yer butt while you're standing in line at<br>
the P.O. --  you just might be on Candid Camera.  About all ours has showed<br>
so far are things like four year olds throwing temper tantrums when they<br>
find out the P.O. doesn't sell candy.<br>
<br>
I don't know why we don't put in candy.  Like Fry's Electronics.  Fry's<br>
really should have nothing to do with selling candy.  But in the long walk<br>
thru the check-out line to the cashier, the aisle is just lined solid with<br>
candy on both sides.  The P.O. is missing a great source of revenue here.  I<br>
never get out of Fry's without *some*thing to eat.  And they've got that<br>
little cafe in the middle of the store?  It has niiiice turkey and avocado<br>
sandwiches?  We could use one of those too -- a little cafe in the lobby.<br>
Diversification, that's where it's at these days.  Look at Costco and<br>
Walmart -- they sell lots of food a person can go home and<br>
cook...........but just in case a person is into instant gratification<br>
eating and not interested in going home and cooking.....there's a little<br>
place where a person can hotdogs, soda, pizza, etc.  Even IKEA has a little<br>
food court inside their store.  And no matter how lousy the food is, folks<br>
are always in those places eating it.....particularly folks with children.<br>
And look how many people drag their children along to the P.O.  We need to<br>
give these four year olds what they want!  They don't want stamps.  They<br>
want a hot dog!  They want a Milky Way!<br>
<br>
With senior citizens in mind, we did put out a bench.  But what did the<br>
Postmaster do?  Put it outside the building.  So that in the summer when<br>
it's 110 in the shade, or when it's pouring rain, or right now when it's -15<br>
without the windchill, seniors aren't exactly going to be interested.<br>
*No*body is exactly going to be interested.  I was told we couldn't put it<br>
inside because it might encourage folks to "socialize" in the lobby.  Well<br>
maybe if they were "socializing", they wouldn't notice how long they were<br>
standing in line.  Frankly, *I* think we should line the wall leading up to<br>
the window clerks with one loooong bench.  Sit down and relax while ya wait<br>
and just scoot yer butt along as the line moves forward.  But nobody's<br>
buyin' my ideas.<br>
<br>
Stepping off my Postal soapbox now...............<br>

My hair is tingling just seeing that you wrote "my NYC/FBI <br>
experience"?!  I have several "war stories" from my letterboxing <br>
adventures, but I think yours must trump anyone's Ace's with that one.  <br>
I'm sure we are all more than willing to listen if you care to share!!!<br>
<br>
I think your comments about what attracted you to letterboxing in the <br>
first place, says it all!!  More than once I've lost my perspective and <br>
got WAY too stressed out over not being able to find a box or not <br>
getting my goal number of boxes in for a day and quite honestly forgot <br>
to look up and enjoy the day and the view!!!  Thanks for bringing that <br>
back into perspective before we all come out of our igloo's this winter <br>
and really ramp up again!!!  Great goal for 2007!<br>
