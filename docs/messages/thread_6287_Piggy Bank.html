<br/>
I've been on a mission this week to enlist as many of my letterboxing friends, acquaintances and those I don't yet know in my efforts to raise money for the folks in Haiti. I've gotten donations from boxers from coast to coast. I know a few of you in the Great Lakes group and I know that you all are as generous as those elsewhere It's my hope that you could pitch in a few dollars to the cause.<br/>
<br/>
This aid organization is local here in the Pacific Northwest and has high marks. They direct 89% of their funds directly to ongoing relief efforts. It brightens my day to see the tally rise on the donations page. Please help if you can: http://www.mercycorps.org/fundraising/funhog<br/>
