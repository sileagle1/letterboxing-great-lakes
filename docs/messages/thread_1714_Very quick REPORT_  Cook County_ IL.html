<br>
1.  "Drying Off" was in good shape.<br>
<br>
2.  "Electro Motive Division" -- couldn't find -- seemed as if I was looking<br>
in the right place, but hopefully I was wrong.<br>
<br>
3.  "Gephyrophobia" was in good shape.<br>
<br>
4.  "S'mores" is in good shape *now* and hopefully will stay that way.  When<br>
I got there, the contents were scattered around the ground, but the contents<br>
were all there at least. I packed it all back together and hid it where the<br>
clues seemed to indicate the box should have been.  Hopefully I got it<br>
right.<br>
