The site went back up in the middle of the night, so I sent him and email.  Yes, he had some updating to do, but he explained that he thought it might be funny (NOT!) to post a different message than the usual one about shutting down to do an update.  He told me he was considering leaving the site down till morning, but decided that might be too cruel.  Yes, that would have been cruel.  We are such a fragile group.  He holds our sanity in the palm of his hands.  The idea of no AQ till election day had me freaking.  <br/>

  It's up right now. I know he turned it off late last night to do an update. I'm guessing if there was a note about it being shut down all week, it must have been Ryan's idea of a joke! <br/>
