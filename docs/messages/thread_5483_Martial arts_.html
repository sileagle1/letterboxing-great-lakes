to it and then I haven't done tkd for a while...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah, yes. Has nothing to do with our trail names, but we did both do Tae Kwon Do for a while. Flying dragon did it for about two or three years, made it all the way to blue belt before recurring injuries caused him to quit. I made it to 1st gup (just shy of black belt...after first gup is cho dan bo "provisional black belt" and then first degree black belt) but now my schedule makes it hard to attend classes and I've kind of lost my motivation. I also did taek-gyeon, which is an older Korean martial art that is more flowing and is said to be one of the foundation martial arts for tae kwon do. I do miss martial arts, but money and time are kind of short right now and major life changes recently have made it hard to keep up. I'll probably go back to it sooner or later though as it was a lot of fun.<br>

            The reason I asked about Kimono Girl and Flying Dragon, is because I was<br>
<br>
curious if it had something to do with martial arts.  I've been taking tae<br>
<br>
kwon do for about a year.  Just wondering if anyone else has added martial<br>
<br>

you are able to get back into tae kwon do in the coming year.  I take<br>
Songham style, currently camo belt.  I found a free class at a local church.<br>
 Wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise.  Recently started sparring.  Sooo<br>
much fun!<br>
