an older gentleman (almost 12 years old).  We actually found a lump on <br/>
him a few weeks ago and when we took him to the vet last week it was <br/>
determined that it is a tumor.  He is scheduled to have it removed this <br/>
coming Tuesday and boy am I scared.  His behavior hasn't changed at all <br/>
so I am trying to be optimistic and hoping that the tumor is harmless.  <br/>
But I am also worried as any mom would be . . . . I mean he's been my <br/>
baby for 12 years!!! So I definately know how much you can love a pet <br/>
and how much it hurts when you lose them.<br/>
