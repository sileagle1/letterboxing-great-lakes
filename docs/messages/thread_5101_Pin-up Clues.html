<br/>
Just wanted to say that we really enjoyed reading the expanded "Pin-<br/>
up: Mary" clues for your 2008 Gathering box, even though we had <br/>
already found the box.  We always appreciate it when a box is a <br/>
total "package" with an image related to the clues and location.  <br/>
We've found all the Pin-up boxes to date and highly recommend them to <br/>
others (when some letterboxers in PA were looking through our logbooks <br/>
a few weeks ago, they wanted to come to IL just to look for those <br/>
boxes)!<br/>
