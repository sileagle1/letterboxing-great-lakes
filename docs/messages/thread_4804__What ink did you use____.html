Thanks everyone for the wonderful stamp images that were carved for the <br/>
SILO 2 gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks esp. to FW for her organizing me getting a wonderful package in <br/>
the mail today that contained many (if not all) of the images!! FW, you <br/>
went above and beyond by actually making a logbook for my "Louie" <br/>
stamp -- I was just going to let him float around without a log -- <br/>
thanks for going the extra mile for me!<br/>
<br/>
BTW What ink did you use that when dry has that plastic like feel to it?<br/>
