good sunburn too. Finding boxes was the priority. We wandered throught <br/>
woods and meadows, crossed over and under bridges, and tip toed in flip <br/>

afternoon, we wandered over to Village Tavern Restaurant where we were <br/>

Super J arrived after he got off work. Then, it was time for the best <br/>
