Fortunately, the worker did not toss the box.  Instead, he neatly placed it in the dirt right where the box had been.  And fortunately, 3 Sweeties found the box, hid it under a nearby bench and let me know about it.  Ball Magnet and I headed out this afternoon and found it a new hiding spot--hope this one lasts as long or longer as the last one.<br>
As we were walking across the cemetery, we nearly had a run-in with a skunk.  One popped out from behind a headstone about 5 feet away from us.  We both saw it at the same time and made an abrupt 90 degree turn in the opposite direction of the skunk.  The rest of our walk revolved around treating skunk spray--which we fortunately didn't need.<br>
