I'm in Phoenix for work. I thought I would not have time to letterbox. Turns out I will have about six hours to myself today. I would love to find a letterbox. Problem is, I do not have a vehicle. I am staying at the Arizona Grand Resort and could access public transit. But I'm having a hard time figuring out which letterboxes might be near public transit. If you have found any boxes around here, do you happen to know if they were near public transit?<br>

You might do better posting to an Arizona site - and if they're anything like the Great Lakes region, you'll get more answers quickly at Atlasquest.  Good luck!<br>
