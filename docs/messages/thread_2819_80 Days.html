Dragon on his 1000 find. Congrats to you Dragon!<br>
What made my last find even more special is that as I was stamping in, <br>
another car pulled in and out jumped someone who looked suspiciously <br>
like a boxer.  I asked her if she was looking for the stamp and she <br>
said she was, her mother was with her as well and we did an exchange <br>
and wouldn't you know it, she was finishing up the series and that was <br>
the last stamp she needed too.  So we rehid the stamp so she could <br>
find it and we finished at the same time.  How cool! Congratulations <br>
to Spartanfans and Hoot Owl.<br>
Well I am sad to say that it looks like I will be the only one who <br>
finished outside of the 80 day time period, I was counting up the days <br>
and I think it turned out to be 380 days...do you have a stamp for the <br>
one who finishes dead last per chance? How about a perseverance stamp?<br>
(or obsessed stamp?  Anyway, thanks Azobox and Spring Chick, it was a <br>
great journey and I can honestly say that I saw more of Michigan than <br>
I ever dreamed possible!<br>
