The first was an indoor box "the books abound all around", at <br/>
Highland Library.<br/>
<br/>
Since the planter of this box has moved the librarian asked me if I <br/>
was interested in coming back to their library to talk to some kids <br/>
about letterboxing.<br/>
(It'll give me some practice for the Grand Rapids museum event on <br/>
Feb 2nd!!)<br/>
Anyway, I have never done this kind of thing before and I don't know <br/>
if I should talk about carving so much as this is for kids.<br/>
If anyone has any advice for me this would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
Also, if you know of anyone in the area, please let them know about <br/>
this program.<br/>
<br/>
email from the library attached.<br/>
<br/>

Dear Heather,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Brenda, I am a librarian in the Youth Services Department <br/>
at Highland Township Public Library.  My co-worker, Kate, mentioned <br/>
that you and your family were in looking for our Letterbook <br/>
yesterday.  She told me that you have a great deal of experience <br/>
with letterboxing.  Would you be interested in coming to our <br/>
Letterboxing program on January 30th at 4:30 and sharing some of <br/>
your experiences with the children?  I think they would be <br/>
particularly interested in seeing your logbook, any handmade stamps, <br/>
and maybe hearing about some of the fun hunts you have been on.  <br/>
During the class we plan to make a logbook and to go on a short hunt <br/>
to find a false book in the library (not the one you already <br/>
found).  The class will be a basic introduction to letterboxing and <br/>
will only last about 1/2 hour.<br/>
<br/>
We have not had many children register for the class, it is for <br/>
children in grades 3-5.  I am going to put out some more publicity <br/>
and I hope that will help get more people to register.  If you think <br/>
you know of anyone who might be interested or if you have access to <br/>
any letterboxing chat rooms please mention the program!<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you can speak at the program.  I know you have <br/>
young children so you will want to be sure to have your husband or a <br/>
friend along to help watch them while you speak.  Thanks for <br/>
considering us!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I'm replying quickly and haven't looked at others' responses to  <br/>
this... so excuse me if it's been covered:<br/>
<br/>
If I were you I'd focus on box etiquette, secrecy, and general/basic  <br/>
"rules" of letterboxing. I think these things are crucial when  <br/>
educating newbies on letterboxing and in turn it (hopefully) helps  <br/>
prevent vandalism and box loss.<br/>
<br/>
Stick to the very basics in the class -- traditional boxes and clues,  <br/>
the signature stamp, the log book, the personal log book, and carving  <br/>
the stamp. That's enough to fill a class. Any mention of the  <br/>
variations (micro boxes, postal letterboxing, placed &amp; find counts,  <br/>
etc.) only serves to overwhelm the new letterboxer. They can learn all  <br/>
that later if they are still interested.  I found this out the hard  <br/>
way (giving too much information) with a group of homeschoolers whom I  <br/>
held a class for recently. Trust me, their eyes start to glaze over  <br/>
after awhile... you see, they just want to make a stamp and hunt down  <br/>
a box!  I've also explained the hobby to many-an-adult who can also  <br/>
get this same overload look on their faces pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
SO.... less is more when teaching a class, and again I'd preach about  <br/>
HOW to correctly letterbox so as to keep it the fun but covert  <br/>
activity we've all grown to love.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO,<br/>
