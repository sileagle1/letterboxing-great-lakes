Was the dead rooster at the site of your box??<br>
<br>
I thought that I was the only one who has found a dead rooster!  This fall, a girlfriend and I were taking a walk in the cemetery.  There was a red cloth bag lying on the road.  My friend opens the red bag (hoping to find money?) and finds a black bag in that.  Opens that and finds a white bag.  Opens that and finds a dead chicken.  We left it there for the cemetery workers to deal with. A few years back, someone who found one of our cemetery strolls said they had seen a live rooster near the box. Hmmmm.<br>
<br>
And what is the story with the handgun?<br>

Maybe someone should do a series on the weird things found while out boxing.<br>

Unloaded gun found in nature preserve<br>
<br>
BRISTOL — A Union Grove man found an unloaded gun in a plastic bag alongside a trail in the Jean McGraw Nature Preserve, 8700 120th Ave., Saturday afternoon.<br>
<br>
The man called police after finding the item shortly before 2:45 p.m. He told authorities he and his wife were letterboxing — a scavenger hunt-like activity that involves searching for hidden clues — when he found the bag, which he thought contained a clue.<br>
<br>
The gun, a Bulldog Pug 44 SPL revolver, was taken by a Kenosha County sheriff’s deputy and entered into evidence.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
That "Union Grove man" and "his wife" would be known to us as "Leapin' Lizards".  The box was one of the great Lock, Shock & Barrel boxes.<br>

Tat2Bob and I went to check up on a few boxes a month or so back and found... a pair of Santa candle holders. No sign of the box at all. Robert thought I was joking when I can out of the “hole” the box was in with them. They seem fairly old. Look good in my kitchen. So the really gross part. A pink grocery style bag with another pink bag in it. With a white garbage bag in it. And it that bag was a dead rooster. Even with the other things in the bag I know it was a real dead rooster.

Unloaded gun found in nature preserve<br>
<br>
BRISTOL — A Union Grove man found an unloaded gun in a plastic bag alongside a trail in the Jean McGraw Nature Preserve, 8700 120th Ave., Saturday afternoon.<br>
<br>
The man called police after finding the item shortly before 2:45 p.m. He told authorities he and his wife were letterboxing — a scavenger hunt-like activity that involves searching for hidden clues — when he found the bag, which he thought contained a clue.<br>
<br>
The gun, a Bulldog Pug 44 SPL revolver, was taken by a Kenosha County sheriff’s deputy and entered into evidence.<br>
<br>
That "Union Grove man" and "his wife" would be known to us as "Leapin' Lizards". The box was one of the great Lock, Shock & Barrel boxes.<br>

Tat2Bob and I went to check up on a few boxes a month or so back and found... a pair of Santa candle holders. No sign of the box at all. Robert thought I was joking when I can out of the “hole” the box was in with them. They seem fairly old. Look good in my kitchen. So the really gross part. A pink grocery style bag with another pink bag in it. With a white garbage bag in it. And it that bag was a dead rooster. Even with the other things in the bag I know it was a real dead rooster. The cop I spoke with did the “really wide eyed” look before asking “really?” And then said “Eeww.” Some days it isn’t worth it. And some days it is. <br>

Once we came across a pair of red high heels out in the woods, which caused all kinds of scenerios to come to mind. But by far, our worst encounter was on one of our very 1st lb outings. My daughter and her friend were racing to the box and my daughter got there first, removed some debris along with a partial decomposed black cat that was stuck to the top of the letterbox!! This box was across the road from a vets office. We removed the cat, took the icky, sticky box to the vet and got it cleaned up and replaced. So gross - no wonder my daughter soured quickly on letterboxing!<br>

Was the dead rooster at the site of your box??<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I thought that I was the only one who has found a dead rooster!  This fall, a girlfriend and I were taking a walk in the cemetery.  There was a red cloth bag lying on the road.  My friend opens the red bag (hoping to find money?) and finds a black bag in that.  Opens that and finds a white bag.  Opens that and finds a dead chicken.  We left it there for the cemetery workers to deal with. A few years back, someone who found one of our cemetery strolls said they had seen a live rooster near the box. Hmmmm.<br>

My grossest find was a camo-ziplock bag infested with ant larva.<br>

Oooo speaking of the Lizards, I found one of their mystery boxes that had a hole in the corner (eaten through by another animal) -- it was full of dirt and an ant colony moved into it too.<br>

"The gun, a Bulldog Pug 44 SPL revolver, was taken by a Kenosha County<br>
sheriffâs deputy and entered into evidence."<br>
<br>
Too bad it wasn't the "Pug" nasties who found the gun!<br>
<br>
Our creepiest find was in Chicago. We were searching for a hidey hole<br>
in the base of a tree. My daughter, The Tree Hugger, was poking around<br>
with a stick in the base of the tree where we thought the letterbox<br>
should be. She hit something hard, reached in and pulled what she<br>
thought was the letterbox out. It turned out to be a knife. I quickly<br>
told her to put it back. We were a little shaken and left the park<br>
quickly. In hindsight, this was probably not the smartest reaction. <br>
Now her fingerprints are on the knife...<br>
<br>
Other icky finds were a dead squirrel on top of a letterbox, a dead bird<br>
on top of a letterbox, a live mouse on top of a letterbox and an<br>
infestation of ladybugs on and in a letterbox.<br>

As for creepy finds - there was a "sleeping" squirrel near Merlin and Ardea's Tomten LB, I believe. And a deer skull and bones near Dragon's Lock Box.<br>
<br>
<br>
This reminds me, I just found a box not a month ago, Little Bridges on the Prairie in Fairfield, IA with a deer carcas near by. Most the fur was still on, though rib bones were sticking out and it looked like a couple carnavours were playing tug-o-war with the carcass as it was stretched completely out.<br>

Well, when looking to plant an LB, this vegetarian reached into a hollow tree and sight-unseen laid her hand on flat fur - ewwww. Probably was the remains of a rabbit?? No, I did not plant the box there.<br>

  We found one LB in the end of a very short hollow log with a Yellowjacket nest in the other end.<br>
  But the best one was the LB at the base of a tree.  When Ardea picked it up a mouse volcano erupted.  Some went running up the tree, some scurrying around on the ground at and over her feet, and a couple clung desperately to the box.  An amazing dance ensued which dislodged the mice from the box, and when it was over the box was still in hand.  Ardea is an LBer to be reckoned with.<br>

I'm loving all these creepy letterboxing find stories.  However, it is making me a bit reluctant to grab a letterbox for fear of what I might find!<br>

So which was creepier - the mouse volcano or "Ardea's First Sighting"?  ;)<br>

<br>
My latest creepy find actually came quite recently and it wasn't a box I found but one of my plants that another letterboxer found.  When at last reaching the destination of the box, her boyfriend reached under to retrieve the box and pulled out a blue plastic bag, neatly tied, full of dog doo-doo! She didn't let him go so far as to open the package, choosing wisely to let him know that was not how letterboxes came packaged. I am glad to say that she did choose to dispose of the blue bag from its hiding spot so that others won't have quite as creepy of a find when going after that box :).<br>
<br>
And, of course, they did find the real letterbox, no dog poo inside or out.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mine was only a little creepy.  It was late spring/early summer, and I was<br>
looking for a box that was in a small pond area.  It was a really pretty<br>
spot, and easy to get to the box w/o having to hide.  I wasn't sure EXACTLY<br>
where the box was, but I thought it would be under 1 of the rocks.  So,<br>
silly me, I started feeling under the rocks (not smart in a different part<br>
of the world, but in Central IL, it's not TOO stupid ;^)  I felt something<br>
soft, so I thought, maybe this is a letterBAG instead of a letterBOX.  I<br>
pulled out what I thought was a bag, to find a very surprised toad in my<br>
hand!<br>
<br>
I have to say, I'm very proud of myself.  I jumped and screamed a little,<br>
but I did NOT throw the toad!  After a good laugh, I gently put the toad<br>
back under his rock.  Oh, and I DID find the box, too!<br>
