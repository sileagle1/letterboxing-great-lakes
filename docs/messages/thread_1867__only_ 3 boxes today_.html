finding so many boxes, placed close together, I thought it would be<br/>
difficult to go back to our regular Wisconsin boxing.  This is the<br/>
conversation I overheard from Blue Thunder and Hyacinth as they were<br/>
getting ready for bed tonight after returning from an afternoon at<br/>
Devil's Lake.<br/>
<br/>
Blue Thunder says:  "What a nice hiking day!"<br/>
<br/>
Hyacinth says:  "yeah, but we didn't do much. We only found 3 boxes!"<br/>
<br/>
At that point I had to chuckle.  We just hiked both the East and the<br/>
West Bluff and Hyacinth thought we didn't do much?  Maybe we have these<br/>
kids more conditioned than we thought.  Maybe we are ready for that 9<br/>
mile Norwegian Woods series!<br/>
