Kermit, your day sounded much like mine...sunburn, Dirk &amp; Guido, Jousting, eating...and it had been a few years since our last visit, too.  (Won't let that happen again!)  <br/>
<br/>
Dragon, I have to tell you, that the Sir Timothy's stories were a joy to read.  Like I said, it had been a few years since we had gone to the Faire, and reading Sir Timothy's travels thru the years REALLY got me in the spirit.  Our last box was the Spell Book and I thought my friend's nephew was gonna explode with delight at how cool this treasure hunting had turned out to be :) (I think he's 8).  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you Thank you Thank you for making my return to the Faire so much fun!<br/>
<br/>
For those of you possibly going next Saturday, I'll watch for your handstamps! :)<br/>

time meeting MamaMir and RocketMan, and we thank them for not minding us <br/>
continually bumping into them! They always seemed to be stamping in at a <br/>
box for which we were searching....granted we did help with some <br/>
reciprocity at a box or two.  We saw the marks of a few others at the <br/>
Faire, but we only managed to bump into Jigsaw and Dragon.    (how did <br/>
we miss the Brat Pack?!  We figured they would have been easy to find) <br/>
The stamps are beautiful with fun clues.<br/>
<br/>
The Faire was a bunch of fun (although we might have seen a bit more if <br/>
we weren't so focused on the boxing!), and we would recommend it to <br/>
everyone.<br/>
