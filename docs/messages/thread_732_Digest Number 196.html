                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Everyone!<br/>
Let me introduce myself!  My name is Anna (aka<br/>
Thistle).<br/>
 I'm in Racine, WI. and I work at the Bristol<br/>
Renaissance faire in the summer. I heard about<br/>
letterboxing from a girlfriend there, but<br/>
unfortunately, when I finally heard about it, it was<br/>
after closing on the last weekend and I didn't get an<br/>
opportunity to get any of the stamps that were hidden<br/>
on the site!<br/>
<br/>
I have not yet ventured out to look for my first<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I happened upon the site run by Dragon and he directed<br/>
me to this group about a week or so ago. I have been<br/>
lurking and learning since then.<br/>
<br/>
I have printed some clues to find boxes in my area and<br/>
I am excited to get started searching for them.  I<br/>
have even found a spot that would be great to place a<br/>
new box!<br/>
<br/>
I have a LOT of questions so I will try to get my<br/>
thoughts in order!  I'm not trying to be rude or knock<br/>
this past-time with anything I ask - I'm just curious<br/>
and pretty straightforward, so if I offend, I DO<br/>
apologize!<br/>
<br/>
1. What do you do with the collected stamped images.  <br/>
I mean - it sounds really cool to go on the treasure<br/>
hunt, but is there anything that anyone does with the<br/>
images you get??  <br/>
I do scrapbooking and thought that it might go hand in<br/>
hand with using the stamps to accent my page layouts,<br/>
but is there any other thing to do with the images or<br/>
do you just end up with boxes of stamped books that<br/>
have really no use?<br/>
<br/>
2. Stamps.  I have a huge box of rubber stamps - like<br/>
a 13x18x12 box overflowing with stamps that I have not<br/>
used in eons.  If I decide to place a letterbox, is it<br/>
ok to place one of these stamps in it?   I have so<br/>
many other hobbies that take up my evenings<br/>
(Scrapbooking, scratchboard art, woodburning, general<br/>
holiday crafts., etc) I don't really think that I can<br/>
dedicate any more time to another, but I want to give<br/>
this a try. Is it ok to use the pre-made stamps<br/>
instead of carving my own?<br/>
<br/>
3. Stamps in a box.  I am seeing on the posts that a<br/>
lot of the stamps relate to the location of the box. <br/>
Is that something like, If I place a box in a forest I<br/>
would use a leaf stamp, if in a garden a flower stamp,<br/>
if in a cemetary, a headstone stamp?  Or can they be<br/>
all totally unrelated - like "I placed this box on<br/>
Halloween I'm using a witch" type of thing?<br/>
<br/>
4. Clues.  When creating clues do you always have to<br/>
give the location (ABC State Park) or can the clues be<br/>
vague so the searcher has to really do some thinking -<br/>
like "follow the sun to where it sets down a path<br/>
marked with an X" type of thing?<br/>
<br/>
5. Leaving Clues.  Do you leave clues in<br/>
Letterboxing.org only or are there other places I'd<br/>
need to post them? Is that where I would mention that<br/>
you need to bring your own stamp pad and other<br/>
notations on perhaps where you would park, etc?<br/>
<br/>
Well - those are the questions that I have right now -<br/>
I'm surethatthere will be more!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to hearing back from you all!<br/>
<br/>
Thistle<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt;1. What do you do with the collected stamped images.  <br/><br/>
&gt;I mean - it sounds really cool to go on the treasure<br/><br/>
&gt;hunt, but is there anything that anyone does with the<br/><br/>
&gt;images you get??  <br/>
<br/>
Good question.  Being new to the hobby myself I really haven't thought this one through at all.  I suppose I'll be one of those people that just has a collection of relatively useless images to look at from time to time for some good memories and maybe to help introduce others to the hobby.  At the very least, it'll be something to harass my family with at family gatherings and holidays.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;2. Stamps...Is it ok to use the pre-made stamps<br/><br/>
&gt;instead of carving my own?<br/><br/>
<br/>
A lot of people really like to find hand-carved stamps in the boxes they find, but I think most would agree that they're always thrilled to just succesfully find a box regardless of whether the stamps are hand-made or store bought.  Personally I carve my own because I like to carve stamps (which I didn't really know until I tried it) and because it's much cheaper than buying stamps.  However, if you have neither the time nor inclination to carve I see no problem with using a stamp you already have (and aren't very likely to use again).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;3. Stamps in a box.  I am seeing on the posts that a<br/><br/>
&gt;lot of the stamps relate to the location of the box. <br/><br/>
&gt;Is that something like, If I place a box in a forest I<br/><br/>
&gt;would use a leaf stamp, if in a garden a flower stamp,<br/><br/>
&gt;if in a cemetary, a headstone stamp?  Or can they be<br/><br/>
&gt;all totally unrelated - like "I placed this box on<br/><br/>
&gt;Halloween I'm using a witch" type of thing?<br/><br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is young in the US and we're kind of making the "rules" up as we go.  Even in the UK where it has been fairly well established there aren't really hard and fast rules.  Some people think it's important for a stamp to relate to it's location somehow while others don't really care.  I fall into the later category.  So far, my stamps have very loosely related to their location.  My hidden village series is placed where it is because I could find all of the elements they represent (sort of).  My Kame Kasuri box is placed on a trail where I came across a turtle while scouting for hiding spots but it's more coincidence than planning.  And my fish series is being placed near water but the more important factor was that I really like the park I'll be placing them in...not that any of the species in this series live anywhere near the lake they're being placed near anyway.  Some of my other stamp ideas (such as Aina's name in Japanese characters) will have absolutely nothing to do with their location.  I think most would agree that you should plant boxes where you feel they should go and that the journey is ultimately more important than the box's actual content.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;4. Clues.  <br/>
<br/>
The kinds of clues you write are entirely up to you.  You can make them as easy or as difficult as you want to.  If someone doesn't like how your clues are written, they don't have to look for your box...and that's ok.  My clues (so far) have all been pretty easy and straight-forward because I'm not terribly imaginative when I write them.  They are also written that way, in part, because the hobby is very new to this area and I feel that it's important for new letterboxers to be succesful when they are just starting out.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;5. Leaving Clues.  Do you leave clues in<br/><br/>
&gt;Letterboxing.org only or are there other places I'd<br/><br/>
&gt;need to post them? Is that where I would mention that<br/><br/>
&gt;you need to bring your own stamp pad and other<br/><br/>
&gt;notations on perhaps where you would park, etc?<br/><br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing.org is probably the fastest way to get your clues out there for people to see...but there are certainly other places.  Some people have their own websites they post clues on, you can post them to any letterboxer lists you're on, or you could even make them word of mouth clues that don't get posted anywhere.  And yes, I always mention notations in my clues (where to park, how to get to the location if it's hard to find, bring your own ink, trail hazards [such as steep hills, terrain unsuitable for small children or wheels, poision ivy, ticks, road crossings, etc], any rules specific to the location [like if dogs aren't allowed], and an approximation of trail length and/or how long the hike will take).<br/>
<br/>
Hope that answers your questions.  <br/>

Wahoo!! A new boxer in my area!  Welcome, Thistle!  Your questions <br/>
are good ones, and well-answered by Kimono Girl.  I'd like to <br/>
reinforce that your boxes are a personal reflection on you and your <br/>
creativity - each one is unique to it's creator - that's what makes <br/>
them so interesting!  As long as you abide by environmental etiquette <br/>
almost anything goes.  Looking forward to more boxes placed around <br/>
here!  (I live in Salem, so we're practically neighbors!)<br/>

Ok, I think there was a topic of the week a while back about personal logbooks, how did people arrange theirs and what did they do with those images.  If you search the archives, there's answers in messages 304, 300,  and 287 (although I seem to remember more).  On the "big" letterboxing list there will be many, many more ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I've personally seen three different ways to archive your found images (though I'm sure there's more):<br/>
- keeping the images in a book reserved just for the purpose, where you stamp in, then record as much or as little as you like.  My mother-in-law does it this way, and she'll record the name of the box, the placer, the date, and a little blurb about the trip.<br/>
- keeping the images in a scrapbook style, which is what I do.  I stamp in on a piece of cardstock (good for me, since it usually takes me a couple of tries to get a good image), then when I get home, I mount the image in a book that's too big to carry around "in the field".  I'll add pictures, and a narrative.<br/>
- index cards.  The image is stamped on one side, and information about the box is recorded on the other side.  The cards are then filed in a card box.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I'm sure there's more ways out there to record your finds, and I think that after a very short time, your personal logbook becomes more personal than a 7th grader girl's diary- and in my case, just as cluttered.<br/>

&gt;1. What do you do with the collected stamped images.  <br/><br/>
&gt;I mean - it sounds really cool to go on the treasure<br/><br/>
&gt;hunt, but is there anything that anyone does with the<br/><br/>
&gt;images you get??  <br/>
<br/>
Good question.  Being new to the hobby myself I really haven't thought this one through at all.  I suppose I'll be one of those people that just has a collection of relatively useless images to look at from time to time for some good memories and maybe to help introduce others to the hobby.  At the very least, it'll be something to harass my family with at family gatherings and holidays.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;2. Stamps...Is it ok to use the pre-made stamps<br/><br/>
&gt;instead of carving my own?<br/><br/>
<br/>
A lot of people really like to find hand-carved stamps in the boxes they find, but I think most would agree that they're always thrilled to just succesfully find a box regardless of whether the stamps are hand-made or store bought.  Personally I carve my own because I like to carve stamps (which I didn't really know until I tried it) and because it's much cheaper than buying stamps.  However, if you have neither the time nor inclination to carve I see no problem with using a stamp you already have (and aren't very likely to use again).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;3. Stamps in a box.  I am seeing on the posts that a<br/><br/>
&gt;lot of the stamps relate to the location of the box. <br/><br/>
&gt;Is that something like, If I place a box in a forest I<br/><br/>
&gt;would use a leaf stamp, if in a garden a flower stamp,<br/><br/>
&gt;if in a cemetary, a headstone stamp?  Or can they be<br/><br/>
&gt;all totally unrelated - like "I placed this box on<br/><br/>
&gt;Halloween I'm using a witch" type of thing?<br/><br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is young in the US and we're kind of making the "rules" up as we go.  Even in the UK where it has been fairly well established there aren't really hard and fast rules.  Some people think it's important for a stamp to relate to it's location somehow while others don't really care.  I fall into the later category.  So far, my stamps have very loosely related to their location.  My hidden village series is placed where it is because I could find all of the elements they represent (sort of).  My Kame Kasuri box is placed on a trail where I came across a turtle while scouting for hiding spots but it's more coincidence than planning.  And my fish series is being placed near water but the more important factor was that I really like the park I'll be placing them in...not that any of the species in this series live anywhere near the lake they're being placed near anyway.  Some of my other stamp ideas (such as Aina's name in Japanese characters) will have absolutely nothing to do<br/>
 with their location.  I think most would agree that you should plant boxes where you feel they should go and that the journey is ultimately more important than the box's actual content.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;4. Clues.  <br/>
<br/>
The kinds of clues you write are entirely up to you.  You can make them as easy or as difficult as you want to.  If someone doesn't like how your clues are written, they don't have to look for your box...and that's ok.  My clues (so far) have all been pretty easy and straight-forward because I'm not terribly imaginative when I write them.  They are also written that way, in part, because the hobby is very new to this area and I feel that it's important for new letterboxers to be succesful when they are just starting out.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;5. Leaving Clues.  Do you leave clues in<br/><br/>
&gt;Letterboxing.org only or are there other places I'd<br/><br/>
&gt;need to post them? Is that where I would mention that<br/><br/>
&gt;you need to bring your own stamp pad and other<br/><br/>
&gt;notations on perhaps where you would park, etc?<br/><br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing.org is probably the fastest way to get your clues out there for people to see...but there are certainly other places.  Some people have their own websites they post clues on, you can post them to any letterboxer lists you're on, or you could even make them word of mouth clues that don't get posted anywhere.  And yes, I always mention notations in my clues (where to park, how to get to the location if it's hard to find, bring your own ink, trail hazards [such as steep hills, terrain unsuitable for small children or wheels, poision ivy, ticks, road crossings, etc], any rules specific to the location [like if dogs aren't allowed], and an approximation of trail length and/or how long the hike will take).<br/>
<br/>
Hope that answers your questions.  <br/>

Any who were at the McHenry, IL Gathering in June will agree with me <br/>
that Delirium is being way too modest about logbooks/journals.<br/>
Hers is the most wonderful document of a family's letterboxing <br/>
adventures I have ever seen. It's the best combination of <br/>
scrapbooking, stamp art and letterboxing.<br/>
If there were a way for her to share the images with this list you <br/>
too would be amazed. Her comments, photos, and other notations are <br/>
combined with the box image on pages of a large album. All who saw it <br/>
were blown away.<br/>
I know that some photos were taken of the journal but I fear they may <br/>
no longer be available.<br/>
And now she's taking that book to......Arkansas? Texas? <br/>
Oklahoma?...well, anyway, somewhere far away.<br/>

In our book we dedicate 2 pages to each box. The design is variable from box to box, but we stamp in one of the corners, then at home we print the clues include them in the page (sometimes we have to make it fontsize 7 to make them fit in the assigned space). We also include a photo or two and a brief (sometimes-not-so) comment.<br/>
<br/>
My wife does all the scrapbooking thing choosing contrasting backgrounds for each <br/>
element.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of stamping to a white card came to our mind, but for some reason we keep on doing it directly on the pad.<br/>
