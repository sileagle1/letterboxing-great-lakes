OK, I know this is so lame, but I actually found NO time to go back  <br/>
to Maybury after the Fling to find all the temporary boxes! My plan  <br/>
was to return another weekend; but somehow it's June 1 already.  <br/>
Perhaps my 3 kids' schedule at the end of the school year is a bit  <br/>
hectic? Naaaaw!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, those of you who've placed all the temporary (event) boxes...  <br/>
would you please post when you remove them, or if you already did? So  <br/>
if by chance we go out this weekend I'll know if any are still there.  <br/>
Or is there a place where this kind of stuff is posted -- like on the  <br/>
