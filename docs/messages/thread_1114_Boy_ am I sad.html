Well, I'll just say it's sad to see a box of your own go missing.  The <br/>
saddest part is that we placed it on Saturday (3/26) and on Sunday <br/>
(3/27) we got 2 emails saying it was missing.<br/>
<br/>
Boo, hoo....someone must have saw us placing it.  It's an easy carve, <br/>
so I'll just do it over ~ maybe make the box smaller this time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any advice?<br/>

Oh bummer!  It is sad when they go missing -- they are like babies.  <br/>
Look on the bright side though -- at least you didn't lose a log book <br/>
full of a year's stamp-ins.<br/>
<br/>
It does sound like somebody may have seen you, or perhaps the placement <br/>
was a critter home.  I had a box that had been placed inside a hollow <br/>
log and every time I went to check on it I found the box gone and the <br/>
contents scattered a ways away from the log.  Finally I wised up and <br/>
moved it to another log in the same area and it was fine.<br/>
<br/>
A smaller box is never a bad idea and given that the hiding place may <br/>
have been compromised, I would move it at least a little bit away from <br/>
the original placement too.<br/>
