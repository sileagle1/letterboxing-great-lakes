                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned home from the Boar's Head Festival in which our own <br>
GLK letterboxers, the Waltzing Pigs, along with over a hundred <br>
others treated us to an extraordinary performance that instilled the <br>
wonder and awe of the true spirit of the Christmas season!<br>
<br>
This has to go down as one of the best "places" that a letterbox <br>
series has brought us!  The church was stunning!<br>
<br>
Anyone in the Chicago area that has tomorrow (12/10/06) afternoon <br>
available (4PM) and are able to make your way to St. John's <br>
Evangelical Lutheran Churh in Forest Park, IL, can still experience <br>
the beautiful tradional music and pagentry that this event has to <br>
offer....let alone the fifth stamp in the Boar's Head Festival <br>
series!<br>
<br>
As mentioned in an earlier post, we took our non-letterboxing <br>
friends that make fun of our little hobby of letterboxing <br>
(matchbooking).  At the end of the performance they both had tears <br>
in their eyes and repeatedly thanked us for bringing them...and <br>
letting them share in the stealth of "stamping in"....they have a <br>
whole new view of letterboxing!<br>
<br>
Thanks so much, Waltzing Pigs!  It truly ushered us into the <br>
Christmas Spirit!<br>

Boar's Head Festival this December.  Last year we did a 5-box series <br>
on the festival4 boxes based on the parts each of us 4 Waltzing Pigs <br>
played and the last box about the festival in general.  We won't be <br>
doing the first four boxes, but the last box will be availableonly <br>
at the performances.  I will post the clues for it once I figure out <br>

think the Boar's Head Festival is wonderfuland it is one of the <br>

be able to come!<br>
<br>
The performances will be held on Saturday, December 8th at 4pm and <br>
7pm.  It will also be held on Sunday, December 9th at 4pm.  Advance <br>
tickets are $12 general audience and $10 for students and seniors.  <br>
There is also family pricing for larger families.  To order tickets, <br>
you can call 708-453-2654.  Tickets are also available at the door <br>

In case you are wondering what a Boar's Head Festival is, here is the <br>
description from the poster:<br>
<br>
"What began as a pagan festival was endowed by the early Christians <br>
with symbolic religious  meaning.  The boar, being the most ferocious <br>
beast in the forest, was considered the ultimate symbol of evil.  Its <br>
death came to symbolize Christ's victory over sin.  <br>
<br>
Into the midst of medieval gallantry, elaborate costumes, Yule log <br>
and King Wenceslas, appears the Christ Child, the angels, the <br>
shepherds and the three kings.  <br>
<br>
How can this happen together?  St. John Ev. Lutheran Church in Forest <br>
Park, IL will show you.  Come and experience the pomp and pageantry, <br>
the entertainers and musicians of the royal manor house.  Come and be <br>
a part of the birth of Christ and let His light penetrate and <br>
rejuvenate your spirit during this festive time of year."<br>

<br>
YES--tickets are still available for all 3 performances.  I'm sure <br>
that people would be able to get tickets at the door--it just costs <br>
$3 more per person.  If you want to get tickets beforehand, you can <br>
call 708-453-2654 and pay for tickets with your credit card.  There <br>
are 3 performances in Forest Park, IL (near west suburb of Chicago).  <br>
On Saturday 12/8 at 4pm and 7pm (doors open 45" early) or Sunday 12/9 <br>
just at 4pm.  I'm heading over there tomorrow to do some work on the <br>
Boar's Head program, so I will be scouting out a new location for the <br>
Boar's Head Festival stamp--will post clues then on AQ and LbNA.  <br>
<br>
If you want more info on the program, the description I posted <br>
earlier is at the bottom of this message.  Hope to see some inky <br>
fingers this weekend!<br>

The Boar's Head Festival will be presented at 4pm on Saturday, 12/12 and Sunday 12/13.  So, head out to see the Bunnies on the 12th and the Boar's Head on the 13th.  <br>
<br>
Here is a short description of the event:<br>
<br>
One of the oldest Christmas festivals is the Boar's Head Festival, which was first observed around 1340 A.D. at the Queen's College in Oxford. It started as a pagan festival (roasted boar was a staple at medieval feasts) and was then given symbolic religious meaning. The boar (the most ferocious beast in the forest) became the ultimate symbol of evil and death, defeated by the birth of Christ. The festival is set in a medieval English noble's court and includes beefeaters, lords and ladies, a court jester, dancers, serving wenches and wassailers, a beggar, and good King Wenceslas and his page. The second part of the performance takes a more serious turn. The Christmas nativity is enacted, with angels and shepherds and magi coming to see Mary, Joseph and the Christ Child. In a grand finale, the medieval court joins the scene to pay homage to the newborn King. This last scene is very moving (I cry every time). <br>
<br>
Our church, which has presented the Boar's Head Festival in the past, is presenting it again this year. We are blessed with several theater professionals and a number of talented musical people. Even so, this is a major undertaking, as it includes about 100 adults and children in the cast, a 40-voice choir, an orchestra, and gorgeous costuming. Performances will take place on Saturday, Dec. 12(at 4 pm) and on Sunday, Dec. 13 (at 4 pm). It will be held at St. John Lutheran Church, 305 Circle Avenue in Forest Park, IL (a suburb of Chicago). Advance sale tickets are $12 for adults and $10 for seniors/students and can be ordered by calling 708-366-2593 Tickets will also be available at the door for $15. <br>

It started as a pagan festival (roasted boar was a staple at medieval feasts) and was then given symbolic religious meaning. The boar (the most ferocious beast in the forest) became the ultimate symbol of evil and death, defeated by the birth of Christ. The festival is set in a medieval English noble's court and includes beefeaters, lords and ladies, a court jester, dancers, serving wenches and wassailers, a beggar, and good King Wenceslas and his page. The second part of the performance takes a more serious turn. The Christmas nativity is enacted, with angels and shepherds and magi coming to see Mary, Joseph and the Christ Child. In a grand finale, the medieval court joins the scene to pay homage to the newborn King. This last scene is very moving (I cry every time). <br>

> Our church, which has presented the Boar's Head Festival in the past, is presenting it again this year. We are blessed with several theater professionals and a number of talented musical people. Even so, this is a major undertaking, as it includes about 100 adults and children in the cast, a 40-voice choir, an orchestra, and gorgeous costuming. Performances will take place on Saturday, Dec. 12(at 4 pm) and on Sunday, Dec. 13 (at 4 pm). It will be held at St. John Lutheran Church, 305 Circle Avenue in Forest Park, IL (a suburb of Chicago). Advance sale tickets are $12 for adults and $10 for seniors/students and can be ordered by calling 708-366-2593 Tickets will also be available at the door for $15. <br>

> Yes, it was a fantastic show - impressive music, costumes and performances!  Kudos to Bird Woman of the Waltzing Pigs because we found out that she is actually the Festival DIRECTOR.  There were over 100 performers from age 2 months to 79 years old, a choir of 30-40 voices, a 20+ piece orchestra and of course numerous behind-the-scenes helpers.  The extra bonus was a very nice stamp.<br>
