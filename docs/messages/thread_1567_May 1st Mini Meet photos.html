internet all at once.  So, just over 2 months from the event ... I've<br>
posted a couple of pictures from the Mini Meet Gathering.<br>
<br>
Sorry there's not more.  Bindle Bum erased a bunch (for which I was<br>
prepared to give make him sleep in the dinghy) but it was to make room<br>
on the media card so he could photograph a man-overboard rescue (so of<br>
course I've forgiven him and he didn't have to sleep in the dinghy)<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
