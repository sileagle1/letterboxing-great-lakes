                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to post that we will have a temporary personal traveler <br>
at the Great Lakes Gathering this year to commemorate our recent <br>
nuptials.  After the gathering, we will most likely plant it as a <br>
traditional letterbox.  <br>
<br>
All you have to do is find us and tell us what our wedding song was and <br>
you will receive the Julie & Jason Wedding Letterbox.  (HINT - It is <br>
the last song on Smashing Pumpkin's Siamese Dream album)<br>
<br>
Jason will also have his personal traveler at the gathering.  To get <br>
it, you will need to answer this question: Who is Frank Castle?<br>
<br>
Feel free to share these clues with others as I am only posting them <br>
here.<br>
<br>
Thanks and we will see you all next weekend!!<br>
