there is still time to take a guess about when that game will end.<br/>
It's another way to put a little glimmer into the darker days of<br/>
winter for those of us in the upper Midwest.<br/>
It's called The Side-Wagers game.<br/>
<br/>
As SpingChick's BINGO game moves through its daily draw and the<br/>
players anxiously check their cards to see if "we got one!",<br/>
eventually someone will call "Bingo" for the grand prize.<br/>
<br/>
All you have to do is take a guess as to when that date will come.<br/>
<br/>
With 25 spots to fill on the card, it's theoretically possible for<br/>
someone to call "Bingo" on January 25. But we all know that's not likely.<br/>
But when will someone fill his/her card and claim the top prize?<br/>
January 25? Valentine's Day? Groundhog Day? The Ides of March? April<br/>
Fool's Day? Tax Day? May Day? Memorial Day? Or someday in between?<br/>
<br/>
Look in the Files section of the Great Lakes list for the Side-Wager<br/>
rules and give me your best guess. If you want to play entries must be<br/>
in by midnight tonight, December 31, 2007.<br/>
I supply the prize so you don't have to do anything except pick a date.<br/>
The more the merrier!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
