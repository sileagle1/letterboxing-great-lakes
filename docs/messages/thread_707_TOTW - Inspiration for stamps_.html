stamp designs jumping out at me from passing trucks, buildings, packaging<br/>
materials, etc. and am often exclaiming - THAT would be a great stamp<br/>
design! I maintain a list of locations I'd like to place boxes and ideas for<br/>
stamp images to match.  This list seems to grow faster than my actual stamp<br/>
production...<br/>

I've loved the stamps that we have found that seem to be based on photos,<br/>
but I don't think my carving abilities are that good yet to try something<br/>
similar myself.<br/>

For this week's topic, let's look at where we find the inspiration<br/>
for hand-carved stamps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I carved the stamp for our first-placed box, Kumbaya.  The inspiration was originally from a spat on the Big List, but I also have a personal story about the song, and decided to place the stamp in the park related to that story (and if you want to know the story, just look for the Kumbaya clue page at letterboxing.org or our personal website).<br/>
<br/>
We have one other stamp carved, and it's kind of along the same lines...it's being placed in the park that inspired it, also.  As soon as we have a chance to get out that way again, since the park's about 45 minutes from where we live.  That seems to be the theme...we've been coming up with ideas for stamps, but the ideas are also directly linked to the places we want to hide them.<br/>
<br/>
Deedle's come up with some hitchhiker ideas just from his general likes (Elvis, monsters, etc.).  He just has to get carving!<br/>

Do you discover a place for a letterbox and then find art to <br/>
complement that place and make a stamp from it?<br/>
Or do you perhaps see an image that you imagine would make a good <br/>
stamp and go from there?<br/>
Maybe you take a digital photo of some aspect of the letterbox site <br/>
and carve a stamp from your picture.<br/>
Or, do you have a favorite artist whose work inspires your letterbox <br/>
stamps?<br/>
So whether you're new to the game or an experienced carver,<br/>
where do you find the inspiration for your letterbox stamps?<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
