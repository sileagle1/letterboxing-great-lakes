Library Thing (http://www.librarything.com/) is an online book <br/>
cataloging app with a lot of flexibility and is really quick and <br/>
easy to use. It uses a tagging concept similar to flickr and <br/>
del.icio.us, while affording you a simple way to keep a record of <br/>
your book collection. It is still in Beta, but I haven't <br/>
encountered any programatic bugs or glitches during use. I <br/>
especially like that you don't have to provide 17 pages of personal <br/>
information and your grandmother's birthdate to create an account -- <br/>
just sign up and go. The free version only lets you catalog 200 <br/>
books (believe me, this is easy to whip through in an evening), but <br/>
the lifetime unlimited membership is reasonable enough.<br/>

Something for a rainy day (actually several rainy days if you have <br/>
an extensive library).<br/>
