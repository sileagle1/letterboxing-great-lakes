I think one of the most amusing things was when we were checking on a <br>
series of boxes of ours.  When we got to the third box, we found a <br>
hitchhiker.  However this HH wasn't IN our box, it was in its own box, <br>
which was actually LARGER than our box.  The HH not only had a stamp <br>
and logbook inside the container, but also an ink pad. That wasn't an <br>
easy HH to move along, because it had to be placed with another box <br>
that had a big enough hiding spot to hide 2 full size boxes!<br>

<br>
I did accidentally find one box at the GLk gathering when I was <br>
trying to plant a box near the shelter.  That's not all that <br>
surprising, though!  The funny thing is, when I fake-found the box, I <br>
didn't sign into it. But, then when we went to find it for "real" the <br>
next day, it was gone!  (It turned back up though, so I did get to find it)<br>
<br>
I seem to have a knack of planting boxes near other boxes and not <br>
knowing about it until later.<br>
<br>
I planted a box, literally, right on top of a micro geocache and had <br>
no clue until a geocacher emailed me several weeks later.  Lots of <br>
cachers had found my box in the meantime.  I'm not sure if they <br>
mistook if for the cache or just signed into both.  I moved this one <br>
to another place in the same cemetery a few weeks after it was planted.<br>
<br>
I planted a box 20 feet away from a box that TrailTroll had planted 4 <br>
hours earlier and didn't know if until we both posted our clues and <br>
it was obviously in the "same spot".  Mine was supposed to be a <br>
mystery box, but anyone who looked at both sets of clues would know <br>
they were in the same park.  I moved this one to another place in the <br>
same county the next week.<br>
<br>
I planted another box within X distance from another geocache which I <br>
still don't know exactly where is hidden, but several people signed <br>
into my box that there was a cache nearby.  I couldn't find it, but I <br>
removed my box anyway.<br>
<br>
I always look on AQ and LbNA to make sure I'm not planting near know <br>
letterboxes, but apparently I have to look on geocaching.com, too!<br>

<br>
Oh yes!  We have found geocaches several times when looking for a spot <br>
to plant a box and have sometimes found them when looking for a box.  <br>
We've also found several geocaches while out on hikes just because we <br>
noticed a "suspicious pile of something".  <br>
<br>
We just let the geocaches alone since we don't have any interest in <br>
them.  If planting our own box, we move on to a different area if we <br>
find a geocache (except on one notable occasion when we somehow managed <br>
to plant a gathering box almost on top of a geocache.  We found out <br>
about it later, but both managed to peacefully exist for the month that <br>
the temporary circus box was in WI!)<br>
<br>
We've also found a WOM letterbox that we knew nothing about because we <br>
were so far off track in following the clues to find the box we DID <br>
know about (which we did eventually find, but it was quite a far ways <br>
from where we found the "surprise" box).<br>

However, once when I was checking on my Fish Tank boxes I forgot where I had placed the fourth box (it was one of my first checks and of course I didn't have the clues with me).  Searching the fallen tree where I had clearly remembered hiding it I stumbled upon an ammo box.  I have no idea how I had managed to miss the geocache when I was scouting locations, but there it was!  Turns out my box was actually down the trail quite a bit.  I had thought of hiding the box in that tree but decided against it for some reason.  Later the tree was completely incinerated, so I'm glad I didn't.<br>

We've had one of our hiding spots hijacked by another<br>
box...ours is still there, but I have no idea what the<br>
other box is...no clues posted for it that I can find.<br>
 People have either mistaken it for our box or said<br>
ours was missing...the mystery continues since we<br>
haven't had too much time to try to track down the<br>
owners.<br>

That's how I found my first geocache! It's obviously a popular one, <br>
but my box has been there for awhile now, too. I checked on it a <br>
couple weeks ago and someone wrote on the first page of the geocache <br>
log the directions to my letterbox! <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh yeah!  I remember that day . . . the park was closed so we parked <br>
the car at the closed gate and walked in.  However, we could see that <br>
someone had driven AROUND the closed gate.  We thought nothing of <br>
this until we came to a large open area (sports field?) and found, to <br>
our amusement, THREE vehicles mired up to their axles and covered <br>
with mud.  One of the vehicles was an old pickup with "KISS ME IT'S <br>
MY 18TH BIRTHDAY" written on the back window.  It wasn't hard to <br>
reconstruct the scenario.  Birthday Boy and his pals decided it would <br>
be fun to bust into the park and do donuts on the field.  (Methinks <br>
beer might have been involved.)  They got stuck and phoned for help, <br>
BillyBob showed up with a long chain and attempted to pull out the <br>
truck with his battered 1970's-era Toyota Tercel (or whatever it <br>
was).  After a lot of spinning tires and flying mud, everyone <br>
apparently abandoned all 3 muddy, stuck vehicles AND the chain.  <br>

Wish I knew the rest of the story :)  I would love to hear their <br>
explanations to their parents and the cops heheheh<br>
