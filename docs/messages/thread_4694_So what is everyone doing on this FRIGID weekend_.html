Also, my horses need a little extra hay on these cold days, so I'll probably bundle up and go out to feed them 3 more times today, and check to make sure their water hasn't frozen.<br/>

  later today. As a result, I decided to hunker down the whole time and <br/>

Unfortunately my computer room is still a mess.  We ended up taking down a<br/>
corner cabinet, so everything that was inside the cupboard is now on a card<br/>
table and end table.  It looks messier than when I started the "clean up"!!<br/>
Hopefully we'll be able to repair the cabinet and get it back up - I can't<br/>
stand all this additional clutter!<br/>
<br/>
However I did carve another stamp.  I'm feeling like the Lizards with this<br/>
stockpile of 5 boxes to plant.  I'll probably carve another before next<br/>
weekend.  However one of these will probably be destined for another state.<br/>
<br/>
Me.... I'm sipping red wine instead of tea.  I checked the NFL.com site (no<br/>
TV in our house) and see that the Packers lost.  Too bad!  I thought they<br/>
would win.<br/>

Sometimes, I'm motivated to carve an image but then I can't figure out where to place the stamp.  Usually, I find the location first and carve the stamp to match the location.  Does sipping wine improve your ability to carve stamps?  Is that your trick?  LOL!<br/>

One of our extra bedrooms was turned into my "fun room."  It's sewing, quilting, card stamping, scrap booking, and letterboxing all rolled into one packed space. I admire you for attempting to clean up your computer room.  I'm not as motivated, although it certainly would be time well spent to tidy up in my fun room.  But that wouldn't be 'fun.'<br/>

Today, we were in WI; more 'joy riding.'   The stores and restaurants were empty this evening.  OH!  The Packers were playing football....that explains it.  I'm sorry they lost.  They're a good team.<br/>

  You actually went out in this weather?!?!<br/>
<br/>
  Unfortunately my computer room is still a mess. We ended up taking down a<br/>
  corner cabinet, so everything that was inside the cupboard is now on a card<br/>
  table and end table. It looks messier than when I started the "clean up"!!<br/>
  Hopefully we'll be able to repair the cabinet and get it back up - I can't<br/>
  stand all this additional clutter!<br/>
<br/>
  However I did carve another stamp. I'm feeling like the Lizards with this<br/>
  stockpile of 5 boxes to plant. I'll probably carve another before next<br/>
  weekend. However one of these will probably be destined for another state.<br/>
<br/>
  Me.... I'm sipping red wine instead of tea. I checked the NFL.com site (no<br/>
  TV in our house) and see that the Packers lost. Too bad! I thought they<br/>
  would win.<br/>

  Beetle went letterboxing on Saturday! The letterbox was gone, but I found a<br/>
  geocach in the same location. ???<br/>
  Also this weekend, I carved 3 stamps. I'm making my LTC to exchange with<br/>
  others at the S.I.L.O. 2 event. I'm hand colorizing two printed copies of an<br/>
  original pen and ink drawing; one is gift for a friend and one is for me.<br/>
  And after visiting the Lithuanian Cultural Museum, I came home and I'm<br/>
  reading a book and learning to make Lithuanian Christmas ornaments from<br/>
  white drinking straws. And....sipping lots of hot tea to keep warm!<br/>

  It's been below zero the whole weekend, but might climb up to plus 5<br/>
  later today. As a result, I decided to hunker down the whole time and<br/>
  try to cleanup my computer room. It has been overrun with books and<br/>
  TONS of letterboxing stuff for quite a while. I made a dent<br/>
  yesterday, but still have lots to do today. In between the work I've<br/>
  carved 2 stamps.<br/>
<br/>
  What have the rest of you been up to? I assume it's been pretty cold<br/>
  almost everyone in the Great Lakes region...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, one stamp I carved yesterday just because I liked the image.  After a<br/>
Google search, I think it will end up being placed in New York since there<br/>
is a park that matches the subject.  Who knows when we will be out there?<br/>
It will probably be on our list of places we might want to visit sometime<br/>
this year., especially since it looks like it has some challenging hiking<br/>
trails.  Usually I have a location in mind first, then determine an image.<br/>
However every so often I do it backwards.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'm surprised the Packers lost.  We don't have a TV, but I did check<br/>
the NFL.com site every so often to see how they were doing.  Too bad!<br/>
However it does make things simpler since we are having a few people over to<br/>
our house on FEB 3 for Chinese New Year.  I didn't realize it was Superbowl<br/>
Sunday, but now it really doesn't matter....<br/>
<br/>
Off to bed for me now, with this room still a mess!<br/>

(two out of five, not too bad, but our card is getting<br/>
a tad bit lop-sided now!) and this past weekend we<br/>
were letterboxing in Virginia.  One of my cousins who<br/>
lives in the Williamsburg area got married on<br/>
Saturday, so of course I printed out some clues so we<br/>
could squeeze a few quick finds in early Saturday<br/>
morning before the festivities began.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, down in Virginia it was the equivalent of<br/>
frigidness for them.  All weekend long the newscasters<br/>
were going on and on about the "one to three inch snow<br/>
storm" headed their way while us Clevelanders just<br/>
laughed, "THIS is a storm??"  I have to give my cousin<br/>
credit, though.  His bride wanted a winter wonderland<br/>
themed wedding, complete with fake snow all over the<br/>
ground of the hotel floor where the ceremony took<br/>
place, and just as the wedding ceremony began, real<br/>
snow started falling outside.  We were amazed at his<br/>
bride's control over the weather :)<br/>
