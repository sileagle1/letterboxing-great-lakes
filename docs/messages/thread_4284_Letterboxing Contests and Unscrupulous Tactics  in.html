Couldn't find the box -- the "electric outlet" clue completely eluded us at<br>
the end...........decided to try *all* the trees and still no<br>
box..........but couldn't deny the wealth of wildlife out there this<br>
morning.  And in heading back to the van, we came around the corner and went<br>
nose to nose with half a dozen deer.  I don't know who jumped higher......me<br>
or the deer.  :-)  Boy, can those critters bound --  it's like they were<br>
born with pogo sticks for legs.  Boing boing boing.<br>

I have to second WH on this.  We love Letterboxing and take our<br>
children along with us.  That said, they understand the rules and we<br>
remind them frequently of stealth, etc.(I have one that loves to<br>
forget - sigh.  Getting the 6 yr old to be quiet in the woods is a<br>
true challenge - and he wonders why we do not see many<br>
critters....).  If a hiding place is easy to get to and no one is<br>
around, we will let the children "re-hide" the box and we ALWAYS<br>
double check them on it.  I know the oldest one gets it (she is a<br>
better rehider than I am at times - helps to  be closer to the ground<br>
at times, I guess, LOL!).  The other one, well, he is 6 and is<br>
learning.  Therefore, we are extra diligent with him.  We do all this<br>
simply for the fact that we do NOT want to ruin it for others.<br>
<br>
However, when dh and I get the chance, we do go without them.  It<br>
only happens a couple of times a year (like this last Sat.), but we<br>
take advantage of that time.  We go for the more difficult ones then.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is sort of a rehash of prior thoughts on Letterboxing<br>
with children.<br>
