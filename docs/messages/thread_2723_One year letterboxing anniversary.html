I was going through our logbook last night, and noticed the date of our<br/>
first find... which was June 29th 2005. As of today, we have been<br/>
boxing for one year! I can't believe how quickly it has gone by. Both B<br/>
and I love this hobby and have a hard time imagining NOT<br/>
letterboxing... we scratch our heads and ask, "What did we do with our<br/>
weekends before we 'boxed?"<br/>
<br/>
We have met so many wonderful people and gone to so many new and<br/>
beautiful places this last year... thank you all for making<br/>
letterboxing so enjoyable!<br/>
