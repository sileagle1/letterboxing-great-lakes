She has filled up her own Bingo and Springchick cards using all applicable words from the lists and is going to play along with us at home.

Good luck to all of our fellow Bingo players out there!! :-) And thanks to Familyof6 for providing the fun this year! :-)<br/>

Apparently Mysteryas didn't choose well this year but he may come from <br/>
behind.  Last year, Mysterina's picks were great until the end when she <br/>
had a 30+ day drought with only one square left (no wild card match).<br/>

Thanks to everyone who makes bingo possible (especially FamilyOf6 this <br/>
year)!<br/>
