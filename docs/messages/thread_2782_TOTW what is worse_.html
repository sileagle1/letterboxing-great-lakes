Loosing your log book or your stamp that you worked so hard on? <br/>
Although loosing a log book is sad because of all the people that are <br/>
in it, sometimes the stamp is a heart breaker for me. All those hours <br/>
carving the perfect image (in your eyes atleast), and then you have to <br/>
do them all over again. If it wasn't for Highcounty hikers pushing me <br/>

I've lost a couple of logbooks. Both times the whole box was taken (stamp and logbook). I think I was most disappointed by the logbook loss, so now I take my digital camera with me on maintenance visits and photograph the pages so if the box/logbook goes missing I'll have a digital record of the logs. <br/>
<br/>
Stamp<br/>
I cannot bring myself to put my best carving efforts in a box that could potentially go missing. I make 2 stamps and keep the one that turns out best. My letterbox carvings aren't that intricate so it's not too hard to carve two. I also stamp the image on paper and keep the stamped sheet in my files, so I can re-carve if needed.<br/>

I remember how bad I felt when the first box I placed (FOOW - wasn't even "FOOW1" yet) disappeared.  I was very proud of my first carving (I guess it was my second, after my sig stamp) but what hurt was knowing I no longer had proof that Dragon came all the way from Wisconsin, and SpringChick came all the way from Michigan, and lots of other people from all over the country (there was even a family from Texas that stamped in) came to get the image of my lowly little stamp (what an ego trip for a newbie!).   That box has disappeared I think four or five times since then.  Each time I replace it, it gets smaller (the better to stay hidden, my dear), but it's also fun to watch the progression of my carving skills, since I use the same basic image.<br/>

 Losing the logbook is the worse for me.  There are a couple of stamps --  <br/>
 first hand-carved, etc. that were a bit traumatic for me to lose, but even<br/>
 though there was a lot of time and effort invested in the initial carving,<br/>
 the stamps can be recarved.<br/>
