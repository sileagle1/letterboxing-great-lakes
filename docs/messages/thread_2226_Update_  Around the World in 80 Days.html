                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are happy to announce that the Around the World in 80 Days <br/>
Letterbox Tour will once again be available to interested travelers <br/>
during 2006.  Last year several people successfully completed the 15-<br/>
stop whirlwind tour within 80 days and several others are well on <br/>
their way to becoming world travelers.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for a few unexpected travel delays and black-outs that <br/>
were experienced last season.  We have made the necessary <br/>
arrangements to accommodate these travel-related inconveniences <br/>
during the coming season, including rerouting one leg of the trip.  <br/>
As one of the tour destinations is closed to tourists from September <br/>
through April, the 2006 travel season is set to begin on May 1, <br/>
2006.  As of this date all boxes will be in place and available for <br/>
tourists.  During February, travelers who began the tour last year <br/>
will be sent information specific to their itinerary, including an <br/>
adjusted passport expiration date, allowances having been made for <br/>
destinations that became unavailable during the 2005 tourist season.<br/>
<br/>
New travelers are encouraged to request a passport and make plans for <br/>
this exciting adventure.  All passport requests received prior to the <br/>
end of April, will be mailed out on May 1st, unless you specifically <br/>
request it be mailed earlier.  Passport requests received after May <br/>
1, will be mailed within 10 days after receipt of application.<br/>
<br/>
This is the last year that we will be maintaining this series of <br/>
letterboxes.  As of September 1, 2006, the clues will be posted at <br/>
letterboxing.org and the boxes will remain available, but the "80 <br/>
Days" and "World Traveler" bonus stamps will no longer be available <br/>
and boxes will not be replaced if they go missing.  So if you are <br/>
hoping to do the entire 15-stop tour within 80 days to qualify for <br/>
the bonus stamps, be sure to request your passport by June 3, 2006 to <br/>
allow yourself sufficient travel time.<br/>
