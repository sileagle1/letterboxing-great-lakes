                    <div class="plaintext-content">I JUST got the approval this morning to hide the letterboxes at<br/>
Bristol this year.  I'll see if I can go out and hide them this week yet.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER - as I mentioned a few weeks ago, I will be putting out ALL of<br/>
the Bristol letterboxes/stamps for a limited time this year to<br/>
celebrate 5+ years of boxing at Bristol.  These will be in place for<br/>
the weekend of the 26th-27th and I am encouraging letterboxers to go<br/>
to Bristol that weekend for an informal gathering.  The gathering<br/>
location at Bristol will be the large shade tree to the west of the<br/>
well near the entrance gate.  <br/>
<br/>
Since we will need to share this public area with muggles and we will<br/>
all be coming and going from that location, and the fact that we'll be<br/>
crawling over each other to get the boxes in a limited area, I suggest<br/>
that we each stamp our sig stamp on out left hands so we can identify<br/>
each other as a letterboxer.  (Use your right hand to get the stamp to<br/>
leave/return Bristol.)<br/>
<br/>
I will put this gathering on AtlasQuest so you can sign-up so people<br/>
know what day you will be there.<br/>

Interesting!  I just checked our records and we found 7 Bristol RenFair <br/>
boxes on JULY 26, 2003.  They were our 4th thru 10th boxes that we ever <br/>
found!  Unfortunately we won't be able to be there for the 5th <br/>
anniversary this year.<br/>
