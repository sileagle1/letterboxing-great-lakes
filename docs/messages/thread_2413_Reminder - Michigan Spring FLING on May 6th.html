                    <div class="plaintext-content">With a little over 2 weeks remaining, this seems like a good time to send out a reminder about the Michigan Spring FLING (Fun LIttle Northville Gathering) on May 6th at Maybury State Park in Northville, Michigan.<br>
<br>
This mini-meet has been planned as a very casual gathering, on a smaller scale than other upcoming Great Lakes events.  The primary purposes are to meet other letterboxers and to spend some time 'boxing, either at Maybury State Park or in the surrounding areas.  Other than an event stamp and the primary exchange/mingling time, we don't have any specific activities planned.<br>
<br>
In addition to the four permanent boxes at this park, there will be 8-10 temporary boxes planted just for the event.  (Thanks to J&BBooks and J-Walkers for their assistance!)  Clues to all Maybury boxes will be available at the event.  Also, some attendees may choose to hide boxes themselves, possibly word-of-mouth boxes or other surprises, so be on the lookout for that.   There are also many boxes in the surrounding areas; bring your own clues if you plan to search for those.<br>
<br>
The park is open from 8am to dusk.  We'll be meeting at the Maple picnic shelter from 10am - 11:30am for exchanges and conversation.  A potluck lunch will follow; we'll provide sandwich fixings and beverages, and ask that everyone else brings a side item or dessert.  <br>
<br>
Full details and logistics can be seen on the AtlasQuest event page:  <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=147 <br>
 <br>
Please RSVP so we can plan appropriately for lunch and clue sheets.  Currently, there are nearly 30 people signed up, and we extend the invitation to anyone else who would like to join us!<br>
