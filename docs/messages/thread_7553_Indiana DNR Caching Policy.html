Message: <br>
Greetings,<br>
The Indiana DNR, in collaboration with local geocachers, has revised the<br>
recent <br>
geocaching policy for caches on DNR owned and managed properties.  This<br>
policy <br>
also applies for letterboxing activities.  Most changes to the policy<br>
benefit <br>
geocachers, but one aspect shared among the two policies is the licensing of<br>
<br>
physical geocaches on DNR lands.  <br>
 <br>
The Indiana DNR is currently working with the various geocaching websites to<br>
<br>
remove all geocache listings online pending a new license is submitted.<br>
Similar <br>
to the other sites, the Indiana DNR is seeking the archival of DNR land <br>
geocaches and letterboxes currently.  <br>
 <br>
The full text of the policy and licensing process can be found on one of our<br>
<br>
newer web pages at www.geocaching.dnr.in.gov.<br>
 <br>
If there are any questions, please do not hesitate.  I will be overseeing<br>
the <br>
permitting statewide through the end of the year and will be able to provide<br>
<br>
assistance in identifying caches in need of the new license.  <br>
 <br>
Thanks<br>
 <br>

<br>
fyi, the Indiana DNR plans to ask LbNA to archive every "unlicensed" box on DNR property into the LbNA Basement. If you have a box on DNR property, or know of one, please get a license to keep it. Being good neighbors with the people who administer public lands is both a good idea and required by the LbNA Terms of Use, which we all agree to when we post clues on letterboxing.org. <br>
<br>
The Indiana DNR website to get that done is below.<br>
