Your listing was interesting, Wi Hi.  I would have had 2 of my 3 remaining<br>
words right away, and then would have waited until the 16th to finish my<br>
card.<br>

You did a great job of running the game this year, and made it really<br>
interesting with your comments.  Thanks so much.<br>

I would have. Been able to call in two more days using the wild card for my third empty space<br>
<br>
But, I suspect a lot of people would have been able to call<br>
With Fungus Woman. <br>
