Just dropping a quick note to let you all know that on Wednesday <br>
(2/15) we found out that box # 2 of our Sternennacht Series was <br>
missing.  We went out yesterday to check, and sure enough, the rangers <br>
had done some brush clearing with our mild winte weather.  The <br>
location of the box no longer existed.  We have recarved and replaced <br>
box # 2 today.  We also checked on the other 2 boxes and all is well <br>
with them.  The clues on the LbNA website are up-to-date.<br>

Also, stay tuned later this week, early next week for some Easter news.<br>

especially on a frigid day like today!)  The Easter comment also sounds<br>
interesting...<br>

We were just talking about taking another weekend trip down to Illinois in<br>
March.   One thing we need to do is check on our Playing Possum box.  I got<br>
a report this week that it is in good shape, but it was pretty clear from<br>
the email that the finder had just stumbled across it, since she mentioned<br>
taking a handout from the box and that letterboxing "sounds fun &<br>
exciting!".  I'm worried that the box may not be in its proper hiding spot.<br>
(However relieved that a casual walker was kind enough to send a status<br>
email.)<br>
