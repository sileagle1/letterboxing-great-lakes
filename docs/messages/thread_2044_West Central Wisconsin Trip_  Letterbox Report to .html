<br/>
We just got back from a great long weekend in the Wisconsin Dells.  We spent some time <br/>
letterboxing in the Dells region as well as along the Mississippi.  This email will serve as a <br/>
report to box owners as well as update others on the status of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Friday started out gray, but no snow yet in the Dells.  Agent Ink and Z-fan packed up the <br/>
car, everything in good shape, and headed out like two good ole boys on a long road trip.  <br/>
They made their way over to Lacrosse.  It was snowing by Sparta but they braved the roads <br/>
on into Lacrosse and up to Perrot State Park, but alas the park was closed to all patrons <br/>
EXCEPT deer hunters.  Ah yes, blaze orange was everywhere in the woods this weekend -- <br/>
including on Agent Ink and Z-fan.  (No, they weren't hunting, but they WERE smart enough <br/>
to take orange along on the last weekend of gun deer season in Wisconsin).  Turning <br/>
around, they made a treacherous drive on slick roads back down the Mississippi to Goose <br/>
Island.  After enjoying the island birds they headed to the zoo in Lacrosse.  There, two <br/>
animals made them laugh by an old well.  The animals were playing in the fresh snow!  <br/>
Agent Ink decided to play too and made snow angels on the ground.  The snow started <br/>
tapering off as they finished the visit to the zoo so they decided to see the riverwalk <br/>
before heading back to the Dells.  There were a few fisherman in boats and Z-fan even <br/>
saw a bluegill swim up right by shore.  A long drive later -- they caught the snowstorm <br/>
again around Sparta --  Agent Ink and Z-fan let dinner, drinks, and music on the jukebox <br/>
helped them end the night back in the Dells as they watched five Canadian Pacific trains <br/>
haul tonnage over the trestle bridge across the Wisconsin River.  <br/>
<br/>
Saturday arrived as a crisp, blue-sky day in the Dells.  After a hearty breakfast, Agent Ink <br/>
and Z-fan decided to go crawl along with some deer hunters into a rocky gorge that sports <br/>
a pine forest.  This rocky arboretum was especially tranquil as the sun started to warm the <br/>
freshly fallen snow from the night before.  Nature was at it's finest.  The only signs of <br/>
humans were the footprints made by the hunters and letterboxers.    After finishing a <br/>
coffee thermos while walking in the gorge, Agent Ink said "hey, let's  go round the Bend in <br/>
the Wisconsin River."   Z-fan though this was a cool idea.  The Bend was a sacred place for <br/>
a culture older than the native indians -- so sacred that the peoples of that era buried <br/>
their dead near the Bend to rest for eternity.  Z-fan was content to just stay near this spot <br/>
and watch trains go by all day but NOOOOOOO!  of course not -- Agent Ink wanted to go <br/>
rock climbing.  Now, you may be thinking "what in the DEVIL'S NAME would they be doing <br/>
climbing rocks after a fresh coating of ice and snow!"  Exactly!  See -- trains would have <br/>
been much safer!  On the way to the rock climbing they got diverted by a bear cub spotted <br/>
just along the Baraboo river west of the town itself!  The mother of this cub was not in <br/>
sight, but the cub was nestled up in a den hibernating in the cold air of winter.  The <br/>
excitement of the bear made Z-fan hungry.  There was a cool place to eat by the train <br/>
tracks but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO -- we have to go ROCK CLIMBING!  UP UP AND UP they <br/>
went.  And UP AND UP AND UP AND UP AND UP AND UP AND UP AND UP -- dwelling at the <br/>
top of the rocks to admire the view.  Agent Ink said "hey -- what's that OVER THERE?"  So <br/>
down, down, down, down, down, down, down we went.  Z-fan was disappointed that no <br/>
trains were in sight, although there was track OVER THERE.  Down, down, down, down, <br/>
pant, pant, pant, pant, pant, down, down, down, down, pant, pant, pant, pant.  FInally, a <br/>
beach.  Wait, we have to walk all the way OVER THERE!??!   An eternity later, they crossed <br/>
the train tracks that WERE OVER THERE but now WERE HERE.  Egad, Agent Ink spotted more <br/>
rocks to climb and this time the REAL vertical ascent into snake country began.  Billy goats <br/>
could not have climbed better in the snow and ice than they did that Saturday.  Stabilizer <br/>
muscles working with each step.  Legs carefully balancing the weight as they slowly <br/>
climbed higher and higher.  UP AND UP AND UP AND UP AND UP AND UP AND UP.  Pause, <br/>
look down -- no DON'T LOOK DOWN!!! UP AND UP AND UP AND UP.  Finally, next to a <br/>
dried up well at the tip-top of the rocks, Agent Ink said "wish we had some food."  "But <br/>
there was a cool place to eat back OVER THERE by the train tracks!" was all Z-fan could <br/>
exclaim.  "Well, then, let's get going.  Watch out for rattlesnakes." was all she said as she <br/>
took off.  There she went: Agent Ink, blaze orange umbrella up in the air -- to prevent <br/>
getting shot at by the deer hunters, remember?? -- taking off down the trail.  Z-fan stood <br/>
there in silence wondering how a train fan could ever have gotten UP HERE!???  With a <br/>
grunt and a grumble under his breath he took off after her -- his wife, soulmate, and best <br/>
friend.  She sure looked great with that umbrella.  He smiled.  Down, down, down, down, <br/>
down, down, down, down, down they went.  Back at the car there was just enough time to <br/>
head toward Lake Wisconsin and a bite to eat before starting back to Milwaukee.  The <br/>
ferryboat was running so they stood on the shore awhile and watched it haul cars back <br/>
and forth across the Wisconsin river.  Agent Ink said "funny isn't it, how this part of <br/>
Wisconsin is so different from ours."  Z-fan smiled and said "Yeah.  This lake is small and <br/>
you can see across it.  Our lake is big and you can't.  But, it also has a ferry boat.  A high-<br/>
speed one.  Hmmmm.... wouldn't that make a great letterbox!"<br/>
<br/>
Hours later, Z-fan finished stuffing his face with pizza back in Milwaukee.  A train whistle <br/>
blew in the distance.  They were home.  All was well...  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving 2005 everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Agent Ink and Z-fan<br/>
