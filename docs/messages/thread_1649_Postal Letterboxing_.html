  Count us in that group.  We'd never heard of letterboxing before the Time magazine article.  We were intrigued with the challenge of it, and amazed that these boxes were hidden in some of our favorite places!  Our P3,F30,H1 may not sound like much for our first year, but in the rural Upper Peninsula of Michigan our boxing opportunities are limited.  We are starting to supplement with postal letterboxing and plan to place more boxes in our area.  (If we can lure more boxers to the UP, they may place some more boxes here for us to find!)  :-)  Norse Gnome <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Postal letterboxing is kind of a hybrid between letterboxing and mail art.<br>
The concept of logbooks and stamping into them remains the same, but that's<br>
about it.  I think postals tend to be more artistic in that people often<br>
include little extra stuff you wouldn't typically include in an outside box,<br>
mostly because you don't have to worry about it weathering the elements.<br>
The logbooks are often more elaborate, and stamps often lend themselves to<br>
use of more multicolor images (just because you have more opportunity to do<br>
so, since you aren't precariously balancing everything on your knee in a<br>
mosquito-infested forest, watching out for naked peeing men!  I suppose you<br>
could find someone at home to do that for you if you want that kind of<br>
ambiance, but I won't go there!!!!).  Anyway, back to postals.  Most do not<br>
require solving clues to find them (exceptions: my "Fish Out of Water 3" and<br>
"A question for you", Cherokee's "Pirate's Plunder", etc.), but instead<br>
involve signups, sometimes on AtlasQuest or through WOL, most on the postal<br>
yahoo group.  A currently popular offshoot is the postal ring, where a group<br>
of people create boxes on a particular subject (Disney characters, medical<br>
professions, book titles, etc.), and the boxes are rotated amongst the<br>
members (A to B to C to A, etc).  Some are open to everyone, others require<br>
some sort of condition to qualify for receiving it.  There are special boxes<br>
for newbies (our very own JACKS maintains the "Newbie Pool"), and some<br>
considered Randoms (get sent from person-to-person as a surprise, without<br>
the recipients knowing they are on the list to receive them).  Some people<br>
count postals in their PFX (usually as separate categories), others don't (I<br>
don't, but then again, I don't count any of my boxes).  They are a good way<br>
to get a boxing "fix" if you don't have the opportunity to find many outside<br>
boxes, especially during the winter.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
For more info, check out the postal letterboxing yahoo group, and read the<br>
FAQ's, or drop me an offlist message, and I'll be happy to tell you more.<br>
