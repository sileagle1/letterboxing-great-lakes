Generally I don't post to this list very often, but i'm having a hard <br>

Letterboxers are constantly being warned when they place thier own <br>
personal info that it is not a good idea yet here is the Mankoff <br>
family's info for all to see.  I sincerely hope they have no idea that <br>

letterboxing.  Just my two cents worth, The 7 Huckaby's<br>

Sure!  Why not post the information?  Their 'fans' want to know how to contact them.  I'm sure the Mankoff's LOVE the attention.  Great article.  Fabulous photos.  They're public celebs now.  It comes with the territory.   They brought it all on themselves.   <br>

You can find almost anything on the net... thats a little different <br>
than posting it and encouraging people to be spiteful.  If the tables <br>
were turned i'm sure you wouldn't want your information posted. I know <br>
I wouldn't, I have my children to think about.<br>

Now, on a personal note...  I would strongly encourage you *not* to <br>
write vicious and venomous notes to this family.  Okay, they messed <br>
up (at least in our opinion), but throwing darts is not going to <br>
change what is done and really will make us (collectively, as <br>
letterboxers) look like a bunch of jerks.  We were all new at one <br>
time and many of us have done something stupid along the way.  It is <br>
one thing to voice our opinions and frustration over the article and <br>
those who participated as a group here in this forum, but to attack <br>
this family by sending them spiteful mail is going too far.  If you <br>
really feel strongly about voicing your disapproval, write to the <br>
reporter, who wrote a less than responsible article.<br>

  that is way out of line!<br>
  how about directing all of this righteous indignation at the 'veterans' for their own mishandling of letterboxes?<br>
   <br>
  for instance, some of us having to recarve/relog exchange boxes due to one of our own's negligence.<br>
  or how about the fact that every exchange that i've participated in, i've had to contact the receiver to find out if the box made it to them safely because they didn't bother to take the time/courtesy of an email letting me know that they received it!<br>
   <br>
  btw, our local free paper ran a front page article on letterboxing two weeks ago.<br>
  i went and got the paper today, but ya know, i don't give a  *@~#  what the article has printed so i probably won't even read it.  <br>
