                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone! Glad to see I completely missed the<br/>
last few days of discussion. We, (my mom (trailname:<br/>
Ugler) and I, left on Thursday afternoon and rolled<br/>
into Bowling Green to find Ay Ziggy Zooba alive and<br/>
well. We stayed in BG that night and headed up to<br/>
Pemberville the next AM to find Harry's Camp. Of<br/>
course, on the one day that we set aside to letterbox<br/>
all day...we get RAIN! I did some initial research on<br/>
this box, went to Pemberville, and was unsucessful. We<br/>
have an idea of where it might be, but it was raining<br/>
too hard to give it a good try. So...we headed up to<br/>
Port Clinton and kept hoping for less rain. NOPE. We<br/>
got to where Rest in Peace lives, made some over<br/>
assumptions, got soaking wet digging around were I<br/>
*thought* it was...and then gave up. When I got back<br/>
into the car, I knew exactly where it was (in a place<br/>
too easy for words) and found it. We stamped in the<br/>
car and double bagged everything. Then we headed up to<br/>
Marblehead to East Harbor State Park to find Hazard, a<br/>
relatively new box. By this time, it was letting up a<br/>
little...so we decided to give it a whirl. What a neat<br/>
hike, with beautiful views of Lake Erie!<br/>
Unfortunately, right when we had deciphered the clues<br/>
and was closing in on the box.....it started to<br/>
downpour. We found the box...and were the FIRST<br/>
FINDERS! Yay! We did the human shield to keep<br/>
everything relatively dry and got soaked heading<br/>
back...even through the rain gear. I highly recommend<br/>
this box, if nothing for the spectacular views! We<br/>
then headed to the East Harbor box, as it seemed to<br/>
be, and was, a drive-by kind of box. We stamped in the<br/>
car again and double bagged everything again. We had<br/>
One Hundred Acre Woods on the agenda, but we were too<br/>
soaked to try them. Tomorrow we hope to do some more<br/>
boxing in the NE Ohio area and will head back on<br/>
Monday. We're planning a plant tonight and one on<br/>
Monday. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe it's just that area around Port Clinton that<br/>
causes rain to fall when one's trying to box in the<br/>
area.  Deedle &amp; I were also faced with varying degress<br/>
of rain back in July when we were out that way.  We<br/>
now carry a compact umbrella (the kind you can find in<br/>
Wal-Mart that brags that it's full sized but folds up<br/>
small enough so you can stick it in your purse) in our<br/>
letterboxing backpack for instances when we're boxing<br/>
and it starts to rain so that we can use it to shield<br/>
the stamping-in process.<br/>
<br/>
Congrats, Armadillo Jo, on the First Finder.  Now I<br/>
don't feel so bad about us finding that hitchhiker in<br/>
Ay Ziggy Zoomba :)  <br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
