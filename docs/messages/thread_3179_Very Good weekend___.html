                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, my parents, my kids and I went out in search for more letterboxes <br>
as usual.  We must had luck on our side, we found 2 geocache boxes <br>
before we found the boxes we needed.  LOL  We rehid them, and laughed, <br>
and soon found the box we needed.  We also went on one box hunt, and <br>
then went to do another, and found out it was on the other end of the <br>
same path we were on!!!!  We laughed even harder cause we didn't know <br>
that when we started!!!  We ended at the Chocolate Milk box, which was <br>
worth stopping!!! =)  We didn't realize until we got home that we found <br>
8 boxes!!!  <br>
<br>
I hear alot of concerns in hiding the boxes, and we've been teaching <br>
our kids since the day we started to make sure it's back in the same <br>
spot and covered well.  One of us goes with them to hide it, and we do <br>
our best to "clean up" any boxes we found that were wet, or was missing <br>
a bag.   We were lucky to run into another couple letterboxing, Wormy <br>
Wanderers, who gave us a run down of the dos and don'ts of letterboxing <br>
and even showed the kids on how to hide the boxes as well.  They were <br>
very helpful and we've enjoyed letterboxing every weekend since then.  <br>
We're hoping to plant some boxes soon as well, but we're doing alot of <br>
research and scoping out potential areas, and making sure we clues in <br>
order.  <br>
