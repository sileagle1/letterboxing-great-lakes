emailing with the placer, it was confirmed as missing but a <br>
replacement is in the works.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't ordinarily post status information about somebody else's <br>
box, but due to the location of this box I felt it was prudent as I <br>
would really hate to see prolonged and frustrated searching damage <br>
the surrounding area and/or cause undue attention or suspicion.<br>
<br>
Since I don't believe the placer is a member of this list and the <br>
status is not noted on the clues, I'm not sure how one would know <br>
when it has been replaced.  My suggestion is to e-mail the placer <br>
first if you are interested in this box.  It is a nice location and <br>
would be a worthwhile visit when back in place.<br>
