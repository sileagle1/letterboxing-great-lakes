I didn't participate in the Bingo game last year and I regretted that decision.  I had so much fun playing Lb Bingo the prior year. What was I thinking?  <br>

Oh WFM, it is always a good idea to peruse the various sections of this <br>
message board.  Remember when MM directed you to a helpful file?  Well <br>
there are some other files that explain the Great Lakes BINGO <br>
extravaganza that helps us get through the winter.  It is now a time-<br>
honored tradition after 3 years (THANKS SpringChick!!)<br>
<br>

P.S.  For additional entertainment, just scan back at some old <br>
messages, especially in the FEB-APR timeframe when the game gets heated!<br>

We're crossing our fingers that she runs the game again this year.  If she does, the list would probably be out sometime in the first half of December.  <br>
