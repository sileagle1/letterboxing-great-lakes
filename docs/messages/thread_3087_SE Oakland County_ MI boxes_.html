Hi there,<br>
I'm looking for some boxes in South Oakland County Michigan, <br>
specifically in Southfield, Lathrup Village, Farmington, Farmington <br>
Hills, Franklin, Beverly Hills, Berkeley, Huntington Woods, Royal <br>
Oak, Ferndale, Pleasant Ridge or Oak Park.  I haven't had any luck <br>
finding any on letterboxing.org or atlasquest.com.  I did a google <br>
search, but all I came up with geochaches, which I have no clue <br>
about.    I can't believe South Oakland County is letterbox bare.  I <br>
found a bunch of listings in Clarkston, West Bloomfield and farther <br>
north and west.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know of any sites that have clues to boxes in this area <br>
that aren't published on the 2 main sites?  Anyone want to go hide a <br>
box in one of these cities really quick before the weekend?  LOL<br>
<br>
Some friends and I are going to be in Southfield this weekend for a <br>
scrapbooking crop.  We thought it might be a nice break to go out and <br>
find a box or two while we're there just to stretch a little and get <br>
out of the room.  But, we don't want to have to venture too many miles away.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?<br>
<br>

 <br>
Sorry, I know that I have not heard of any boxes in the vicinity, other than what's on letterboxing.org.   At one time there was a box in Royal Oak and one in Farmington Hills but I think they are long gone.<br>
 <br>
You might try Northville and Milford, instead.  There are a lot of boxes at Maybury State Park, Island Lake State Park, Kensington Metropark, and so on, that are not all that far from Southfield.  Also - West Bloomfield is really quite close to where you'll be, and there are several boxes there.  In fact there are 2 series of 4 boxes each, practically across the street from each other.<br>
 <br>
Have fun!<br>
