http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/letterboxing/crosswinds.htm ?<br>
<br>
I went and was so involved in the scenery that I lost track of where I <br>
was and then the sun set - could hardly see my feet!<br>
<br>
I emailed the author as some of her's have gone missing, but never <br>
heard back.<br>
<br>
So to the group - "Has anyone been there this summer?"<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">FYI - Crosswind Marsh letterbox is alive and well.  Could not find Bald <br>
Eagle stamp at Crosswind Marsh Park but did see 3 Bald Eagles - one <br>
adult just sitting in the tree with that big white head and two very <br>
LARGE babies.  If you go, the nest is visable from the parking lot - <br>
look for a pile of logs in a dead tree.<br>
<br>
Has anyone found Mirkwood's Jabberwocky or Bob White this year?<br>
Details are at: http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/letterboxing/index.htm<br>
<br>
I really like her art work and would like to find more, but alas I only <br>
found one of four today - but the eagles were worth the walk.<br>
