probably will be hunting down the campers on one (or both) nights to sit<br/>
around the campfire (assuming we will have GREAT weather that weekend!)<br/>

Thanks for the nudge, WH! I signed us up here in the database and at<br/>
AQ. BTW, the Inn some are staying at is the Potowotamie Inn in the<br/>
park, right? For a lark, I checked that - and was able to make<br/>
reservations for that Friday and Saturday night! We're bringing DD<br/>
(14yo) so we can show her our college - Valparaiso. She's a usually<br/>
reluctant boxer, but we'll see how it goes. Then again maybe she'll<br/>
catch the LB fever if she's the group's enothustiasm! A mom can hope!<br/>
DS hopes to go to my Bro's for the weekend - DSIL loves how he<br/>
entertains the toddler (it's mutual). We are excited! - WFMary<br/>
