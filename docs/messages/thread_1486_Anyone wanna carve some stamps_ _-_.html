theme is "Just Get Out There and Box" (a saying I'm pretty sure I <br>
ripped off someone!). Any box having to do with games or recreation (in <br>
or outdoor) is fine. Contact us offlist if you're interested...oh, and <br>
feel free to come to the gathering, too! It's in Rochester, NY, which <br>
might not be a big a haul for some of you as it sounds. It's only an <br>
hour and a half from Buffalo, so it's not that bad a drive for Ohio and <br>
Penna folks. Here's the link: <br>
