                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've decided to give up my claim to Calvin &amp; Hobbes. I was going through my cache of already-carved stamps and found a series I did on the evolution of Bloom County's Opus that I used for a postal ring several years ago. I'm going to make some LTCs with them and then send them out for GLG to be permanently planted in the wild. <br/>
<br/>
I believe someone mentioned that CC Family would be interested in C&amp;H, so they are more than welcome to lay claim.<br/>
<br/>
And I have updated the database for the event.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
