As the fire was roaring and friends were eating, drinking, and laughing in the crisp spring night, my daughter, Lunagirl, ran down from the lodge to tell me the news:  several of the guests had found Investigator Francis Bacon's business card in their logbooks.  I do not suspect he was actually in attendence, but I think I know who was responsible.  "Y", I can not say.<br>
