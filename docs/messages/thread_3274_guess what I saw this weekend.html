I felt like I had caught a glimpse of some celebrity or something. I was just looking at the <br/>

I am so tempted to ask for help on finding the rest of this series of 7 boxes... the clues are <br/>
just impossible. I don't know how anyone found these first 2 boxes without help. I have <br/>
been searching this darn forest preserve for weeks. And then I had to ask the placer why I <br/>
could not figure it out based on her directions and she shared with me what she left out <br/>
-- uuuggg -- so I found the 2, and I could not find the next 3 based on the clues either. <br/>
"Where would an elephant hide?" Heck if I know. Elephants are huge. They have no natural <br/>
predators. Not even lions would attack a full grown elephant. And they are native to Africa <br/>
and India -- grasslands and jungle. Not woods. How do I even know WHY an elephant <br/>
would hide?!?!? It wouldn't!<br/>
<br/>
Grrr. Very annoying. I keep telling myself to give up on these but it's bugging me.<br/>

Anyway, it was a bit surreal to see thqt stamp, is all I'm saying.<br/>

Azobox and I spent hours at that place and never found anything beyond #2, which was a shame because the stamps we did find were great.  Sounds like we struggled in the same places you did.  There are some folks in the Chicago area who did find the other boxes and may be willing to give some offlist assistance.<br/>
