<br>
<br>
  Depending on the weather, is anyone interested in a get-together in <br>
  the Muskegon (MI) area on Sat 10/16/04 ??<br>
<br>
  There are lots of boxes in the Muskegon and White Lake area.<br>
  The Lake Express comes across for any WI folks who'd like to join in.<br>
  And best of all ... as Bindle Bum and I are just moving into our new <br>
  land-based winter quarters, I could host a campfire at the end of <br>
  the day. <br>
<br>
  Don't get too excited, I'm NOT thinking "gathering" (as in classes, <br>
  etc) I'm thinking SIMPLE here. <br>
<br>
  Simple as in boxers meeting somewhere for brunch then going boxing <br>
  together; sharing a BYO picinic lunch somewhere (or hitting a fast <br>
  food place -- depending on how cold/wet/hot/sweaty we are), and then <br>
  if anyone wants to join me in driving up to Montague, we could share <br>

If I can get the grandparents to babysit, I'll be there!  I'll know about babysitting early next week.  If I come, I'll help with whatever you need.<br>

Oh, I would love to get together with everyone, especially since you <br>
are looking to be right here in Muskegon.  Unfortunately 10/16 won't <br>
work for me -- have prior obligations related to my daughter's <br>
wedding planning that will tie me up until about 4:00 p.m.  Could <br>
pop in after that if there is anything still going on later in the <br>
day.<br>

I am in the w. mi area and may be able to make this get-together. I <br>
have done only a couple boxes in the Muskegon area, so would be open <br>
