                    <div class="plaintext-content">While it is possible to have more than one Yahoo! identity, it is a bit of a <br>
hassle.  It is tempting to want to use different Yahoo! ID's for different <br>
groups, that apply to different areas of your life.  But you can only be <br>
signed onto one Yahoo! account at a time on a computer and as your Yahoo! <br>
identity can be tied to other things, having to switch between several is a <br>
pain.<br>
<br>
Letterbox-usa was my first experience with Yahoo! groups when I began <br>
letterboxing several years ago.  To that point I did not have a Yahoo! ID <br>
for anything -- not mail or a Yahoo! home page or anything.  Since my <br>
purpose was to join letterbox-usa, I created a Yahoo! name in line with my <br>
LB trail name.  Not long after that I came across a few art-related groups I <br>
wanted to join, and it seemed silly to use SpringChick because it was a name <br>
I used only for letterboxing.  So I created a new Yahoo! ID and joined the <br>
art groups as artsychick.  Around about that time, Flickr (the photosharing <br>
site I use) was purchased by Yahoo! and incorporated your Yahoo! ID into <br>
your sign-in there.  Great, I already had a Flickr ID and it was not <br>
SpringChick or artsychick...  so I created yet another Yahoo! ID for this so <br>
I could maintain the identity I had initially started at Flickr. I then <br>
joined a couple of photography related Yahoo! groups using that ID.<br>
<br>
I quickly found out what a pain it was to have all these different Yahoo <br>
ID's -- I was constantly signing in and out of Yahoo! as one or the other ID <br>
and couldn't have letterboxing groups open in one browser window and an art <br>
group or my Flickr account open in another window.  When I would go to "My <br>
Groups" on Yahoo!, I would see only the groups I had joined using one ID <br>
(whichever one I happened to be signed into at that time), rather than being <br>
able to get a nice comprehensive list of all Yahoo! groups I belonged to.<br>
<br>
Eventually I gave up on the multiple personalities and just used SpringChick <br>
for all of them, which significantly simplifies the Yahoo! process.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When you tried creating a Yahoo! ID with "MC Bear", did you have the space <br>
in there?  I don't think you can have spaces in your Yahoo! ID.  Try using <br>
MCBear or maybe MC_Bear.  If that still doesn't work, chances are it is <br>
because somebody is already using the identity you are trying to claim.  Try <br>
putting a couple numbers behind it -- like MCBear1234 (people often use a <br>
portion of their phone number, address or birthday).<br>
<br>
To create a new Yahoo! ID (the ID you will use for groups):<br>
<br>
1)  Go to http://groups.yahoo.com/<br>
2)  If it says, "welcome [your Yahoo! ID]" and displays a list of groups you <br>
belong to, then you are already signed in with a different ID -- Click on <br>
"Sign Out" to exit this ID.<br>
3)  You should now see a light green box with a "Sign In" button and right <br>
below that is a link to "sign up"<br>
4)  Click on the "sign up" link and follow the instructions to create a new <br>
account -- this will also create a Yahoo! mail account and personalized "My <br>
Yahoo" page.<br>
5)  Once you have successfully created the new Yahoo! ID, then you will need <br>
to go to each of the groups you would like to be a member of and join each <br>
group while signed into Yahoo! with the new ID.<br>
