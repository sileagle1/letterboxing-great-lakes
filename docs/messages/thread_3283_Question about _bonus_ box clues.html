Hi there!  I've heard of boxes whose clues can only be found in <br/>
another box.  I'm thinking of doing something like this in a box I'm <br/>
planting sometime.  But, I was wondering how you do it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you write the clues in the log book, tape it to the inside lid, <br/>
include extra flyers in the box?  Any tips or suggestions on how to <br/>
go about announcing a second secret box?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As someone else pointed out, all of those are valid ways of announcing a bonus box.  I've done two similar things (one is an actual bonus box, the other was a series where in order to find the next box you had to get the clues from the previous box).  The first time I printed up copies of the clues to include in the box so that people could take one with them since a lot of people don't think to bring pen and paper for writing down clues.  This works pretty well if your box is close by and you can check on it regularly to make sure the bonus clues haven't run out.  The other method I've tried is to print the clues on a sheet of paper but leave a note (in red colored pencil I think) to leave the clues in the box (this would be similar to writing clues in a logbook or taping them to the inside of the lid...but with a slightly greater risk of the clues walking off).  This method is well suited for boxes that maybe aren't so close and/or where checking on the box to refill the bonus clues would not be something that you could easily do on a weekend or slow afternoon.<br/>

  It can be done any of the ways listed. We are doing a little twist <br/>
  with ours. We are planting a box this week that will have 5 cards with <br/>
  the "bonus" info for another box that is being planted much further <br/>
  away. We plan on releasing the clues to the second box to the "public" <br/>
  in the Spring.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I usually either write them in the back of the logbook or put extra sheets with the bonus clues into the box.  There are pitfalls to both.  If you use extra sheets, you have to keep them replentished.  If you write them in the back of the logbook, you run the risk that somebody will tear them out (yes, this has actually happened to me -- can you believe it?).  Either way, many people do not think to look for bonus clues -- they are just in a hurry to stamp in and move on.<br/>
