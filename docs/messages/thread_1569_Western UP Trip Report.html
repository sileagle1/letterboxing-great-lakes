                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned from a nice trip to the western part of Michigan's <br>
Upper Peninsula (UP) and thought we'd post a report for those that <br>
might be interested in reading about it.<br>
<br>
Since we started from southern Wisconsin, we first had to pass <br>
through northern WI to get to the UP.  We stopped along the way to <br>
find the Rib Mountain Rendezvous box and while we were there, also <br>
checked in on the Rib Mountain box.  Both were in good shape. Next we <br>
hid a new box (clues will be posted in the near future).  We also <br>
took a detour west to find the Flying Fish and Smoky Bear boxes (both <br>
in good shape).<br>
<br>
[Side note:  The box we placed in WI was in a formerly "boxless" <br>
county.  That leaves "only" 40 more counties in Wisconsin that are <br>
boxless.  It would be great if any Wisconsinites (or others traveling <br>
in our state) considered placing a box in one of these counties.  How <br>
long will it be until Wisconsin is entirely "green" on the LBNA <br>
site??]<br>
<br>
Our ambitious goal in the UP was to "see the sights" by visiting all <br>
the letterbox locations in the "western region" that we knew of at <br>
the end of June.  There was certainly a lot of driving involved in <br>
touring this area filled with forests, lakes and rivers, but also a <br>
lot of nice outdoor experiences.<br>
<br>
We'll start by listing the boxes that we didn't actually find, even <br>
though we were in the general location.  The only clues that really <br>
stumped us were the Copper Country Autumn box.  The clues are 4 <br>
photos.  We found the first easily enough and found the second after <br>
some effort.  Unfortunately our eyes weren't discerning enough to <br>
recognize the third going forwards or backtracking and we weren't <br>
optimistic about recognizing the 4th even if we did find the right <br>
trees pictured in the third.  Reluctantly we agreed to admit defeat.  <br>
For two other boxes (Big Bay Point Lighthouse and Hogback Mountain) <br>
we were pretty sure we were in the right spot for both, but after <br>
searching rather diligently, we couldn't find a box at either <br>
location.  Two other boxes we did find, Shamrock 1 & 2, but neither <br>
contained a stamp or a logbook with any evidence that a stamp ever <br>
existed.  Instead the placer left "message cards" in the box, about <br>
the size of a business card.  Not surprisingly, the messages previous <br>
visitors left were primarily "where's the stamp?"  This format seemed <br>
odd to us, especially since the boxes contained the standard "About <br>
Letterboxing" handouts that describe a box as containing a stamp and <br>
a logbook.  We decided not to stamp in at these boxes.<br>
<br>
Amazingly, we did manage to find all the other boxes and all were in <br>
good shape.  We added a few baggies to some new boxes that didn't <br>
have any and dried out one or two that were slightly damp.  This was <br>
really good considering how much snow this area gets in the winter <br>
and how "old" a few of the boxes are.  We will send private messages <br>
to all the placers to give them an update on the status.<br>
<br>
Listed below are the boxes we found.  Many of them had stamps from <br>
some of Michigan's great carvers and there was also an excellent <br>
stamp placed by a Floridian only a week or so before we visited.<br>
<br>
Beach Bum<br>
Beaver Trail<br>
Canyon Falls<br>
Fumee Lake<br>
Henes Park Series #2 & #3 (After we got home we found out TJ_Mich was <br>
doing maintenance recently and that he replaced #1 this weekend and <br>
posted new clues)<br>
HWY 41<br>
Lake Gogebic<br>
Leelinaw<br>
Marquette Harbor Light<br>
Presque Isle Park #1<br>
Rails To Trails?<br>
Rainbow Canoe<br>
Readers Box<br>
Sparrow Rapids (2)<br>
Strawberry Lake Letterbox<br>
Sugarloaf Mountain<br>
Superior Falls<br>
Superior View<br>
The Engineer<br>
The Paulding Light<br>
U.P. Pasty<br>
UP Wildflower Series - Blueberries<br>
UP Wildflower Series - Jack in the Pulpit<br>
UP Wildflower series - Silver Mountain Wild Rose<br>
(We also found one hitchhiker during our trip)<br>
<br>
Highlights of our adventures included:<br>
<br>
  3 scenic waterfalls (Superior, Canyon and Bonds) -  Definitely <br>
walk a bit further down the trail at Canyon to see the canyon walls <br>
after the falls and also walk down to see Bonds Falls at Paulding <br>
Light.  After a short walk and some stairs, you will get to a point <br>
where you can stand right next to the falls as they make their <br>
initial drop.  Pretty cool!<br>
<br>
  Hiking in the Porcupine Mountains.<br>
<br>
  Sitting on the beach right outside our hotel, drinking wine and <br>
watching the sun set over Lake Superior at 10:00 pm.  We love these <br>
long days!<br>
<br>
  Picking wild raspberries and blueberries along the trails.<br>
<br>
  Seeing and hearing loons on the lakes.<br>
<br>
  Eating a pasty for dinner and find the Pasty box as a fitting <br>
memento.<br>
<br>
  The views from Brockway Mountain Drive in the Keweenaw Peninsula.<br>
<br>
  Visiting the northern end of Hwy 41.  (Maybe we'll visit the <br>
southern end later this year)<br>
<br>
  A sense of accomplishment in getting to the summit of Hogback, <br>
even though it was misty/raining.  In those weather conditions we <br>
certainly didn't have any view of Lake Superior - we were lucky to <br>
barely make out some treetops below us.<br>
<br>
  HUGE expanses of forest.<br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps we'll make a trip to the eastern UP next year! <br>
<br>
Wisconsin Hiker & Martini Man<br>
<br>
P.S.  We also hid two new boxes in the UP; clues will be posted in <br>
the near future.  One of the boxes is in the only western UP county <br>
that didn't have a box yet  Iron County.  That region could now be <br>
all "green" after I post the clues!<br>

We can't wait to get up in the UP this fall (before hunting season,<br>
though).<br>
<br>
Re: WI counties - we've placed boxes in Juneau and Green counties<br>
within the last month.  (At least I think it's Juneau.  The Rocky<br>
Arbor box may be in Sauk.  See earlier discussion.)  We've got sites<br>
on Lafeyette, Grant, Richland, and Crawford in remote SW Wisconsin,<br>
but would love to see some other boxes in SW Wisconsin!  It's<br>
beautiful country down here.  Hopefully by the end of summer, we'll<br>
see SW WI all in green.<br>
