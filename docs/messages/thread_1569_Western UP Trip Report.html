                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned from a nice trip to the western part of Michigan's <br/>
Upper Peninsula (UP) and thought we'd post a report for those that <br/>
might be interested in reading about it.<br/>
<br/>
Since we started from southern Wisconsin, we first had to pass <br/>
through northern WI to get to the UP.  We stopped along the way to <br/>
find the Rib Mountain Rendezvous box and while we were there, also <br/>
checked in on the Rib Mountain box.  Both were in good shape. Next we <br/>
hid a new box (clues will be posted in the near future).  We also <br/>
took a detour west to find the Flying Fish and Smoky Bear boxes (both <br/>
in good shape).<br/>
<br/>
[Side note:  The box we placed in WI was in a formerly "boxless" <br/>
county.  That leaves "only" 40 more counties in Wisconsin that are <br/>
boxless.  It would be great if any Wisconsinites (or others traveling <br/>
in our state) considered placing a box in one of these counties.  How <br/>
long will it be until Wisconsin is entirely "green" on the LBNA <br/>
site??]<br/>
<br/>
Our ambitious goal in the UP was to "see the sights" by visiting all <br/>
the letterbox locations in the "western region" that we knew of at <br/>
the end of June.  There was certainly a lot of driving involved in <br/>
touring this area filled with forests, lakes and rivers, but also a <br/>
lot of nice outdoor experiences.<br/>
<br/>
We'll start by listing the boxes that we didn't actually find, even <br/>
though we were in the general location.  The only clues that really <br/>
stumped us were the Copper Country Autumn box.  The clues are 4 <br/>
photos.  We found the first easily enough and found the second after <br/>
some effort.  Unfortunately our eyes weren't discerning enough to <br/>
recognize the third going forwards or backtracking and we weren't <br/>
optimistic about recognizing the 4th even if we did find the right <br/>
trees pictured in the third.  Reluctantly we agreed to admit defeat.  <br/>
For two other boxes (Big Bay Point Lighthouse and Hogback Mountain) <br/>
we were pretty sure we were in the right spot for both, but after <br/>
searching rather diligently, we couldn't find a box at either <br/>
location.  Two other boxes we did find, Shamrock 1 &amp; 2, but neither <br/>
contained a stamp or a logbook with any evidence that a stamp ever <br/>
existed.  Instead the placer left "message cards" in the box, about <br/>
the size of a business card.  Not surprisingly, the messages previous <br/>
visitors left were primarily "where's the stamp?"  This format seemed <br/>
odd to us, especially since the boxes contained the standard "About <br/>
Letterboxing" handouts that describe a box as containing a stamp and <br/>
a logbook.  We decided not to stamp in at these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Amazingly, we did manage to find all the other boxes and all were in <br/>
good shape.  We added a few baggies to some new boxes that didn't <br/>
have any and dried out one or two that were slightly damp.  This was <br/>
really good considering how much snow this area gets in the winter <br/>
and how "old" a few of the boxes are.  We will send private messages <br/>
to all the placers to give them an update on the status.<br/>
<br/>
Listed below are the boxes we found.  Many of them had stamps from <br/>
some of Michigan's great carvers and there was also an excellent <br/>
stamp placed by a Floridian only a week or so before we visited.<br/>
<br/>
Beach Bum<br/>
Beaver Trail<br/>
Canyon Falls<br/>
Fumee Lake<br/>
Henes Park Series #2 &amp; #3 (After we got home we found out TJ_Mich was <br/>
doing maintenance recently and that he replaced #1 this weekend and <br/>
posted new clues)<br/>
HWY 41<br/>
Lake Gogebic<br/>
Leelinaw<br/>
Marquette Harbor Light<br/>
Presque Isle Park #1<br/>
Rails To Trails?<br/>
Rainbow Canoe<br/>
Readers Box<br/>
Sparrow Rapids (2)<br/>
Strawberry Lake Letterbox<br/>
Sugarloaf Mountain<br/>
Superior Falls<br/>
Superior View<br/>
The Engineer<br/>
The Paulding Light<br/>
U.P. Pasty<br/>
UP Wildflower Series - Blueberries<br/>
UP Wildflower Series - Jack in the Pulpit<br/>
UP Wildflower series - Silver Mountain Wild Rose<br/>
(We also found one hitchhiker during our trip)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights of our adventures included:<br/>
<br/>
  3 scenic waterfalls (Superior, Canyon and Bonds) -  Definitely <br/>
walk a bit further down the trail at Canyon to see the canyon walls <br/>
after the falls and also walk down to see Bonds Falls at Paulding <br/>
Light.  After a short walk and some stairs, you will get to a point <br/>
where you can stand right next to the falls as they make their <br/>
initial drop.  Pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
  Hiking in the Porcupine Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
  Sitting on the beach right outside our hotel, drinking wine and <br/>
watching the sun set over Lake Superior at 10:00 pm.  We love these <br/>
long days!<br/>
<br/>
  Picking wild raspberries and blueberries along the trails.<br/>
<br/>
  Seeing and hearing loons on the lakes.<br/>
<br/>
  Eating a pasty for dinner and find the Pasty box as a fitting <br/>
memento.<br/>
<br/>
  The views from Brockway Mountain Drive in the Keweenaw Peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
  Visiting the northern end of Hwy 41.  (Maybe we'll visit the <br/>
southern end later this year)<br/>
<br/>
  A sense of accomplishment in getting to the summit of Hogback, <br/>
even though it was misty/raining.  In those weather conditions we <br/>
certainly didn't have any view of Lake Superior - we were lucky to <br/>
barely make out some treetops below us.<br/>
<br/>
  HUGE expanses of forest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we'll make a trip to the eastern UP next year! <br/>

<br/>
P.S.  We also hid two new boxes in the UP; clues will be posted in <br/>
the near future.  One of the boxes is in the only western UP county <br/>
that didn't have a box yet  Iron County.  That region could now be <br/>
all "green" after I post the clues!<br/>

We can't wait to get up in the UP this fall (before hunting season,<br/>
though).<br/>
<br/>
Re: WI counties - we've placed boxes in Juneau and Green counties<br/>
within the last month.  (At least I think it's Juneau.  The Rocky<br/>
Arbor box may be in Sauk.  See earlier discussion.)  We've got sites<br/>
on Lafeyette, Grant, Richland, and Crawford in remote SW Wisconsin,<br/>
but would love to see some other boxes in SW Wisconsin!  It's<br/>
beautiful country down here.  Hopefully by the end of summer, we'll<br/>
see SW WI all in green.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   3 scenic waterfalls (Superior, Canyon and Bonds) -  Definitely<br/>
&gt; &gt; walk a bit further down the trail at Canyon to see the canyon walls<br/>
&gt; &gt; after the falls and also walk down to see Bonds Falls at Paulding<br/>
&gt; &gt; Light.  After a short walk and some stairs, you will get to a point<br/>
&gt; &gt; where you can stand right next to the falls as they make their<br/>
&gt; &gt; initial drop.  Pretty cool!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Hiking in the Porcupine Mountains.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Sitting on the beach right outside our hotel, drinking wine and<br/>
&gt; &gt; watching the sun set over Lake Superior at 10:00 pm.  We love these<br/>
&gt; &gt; long days!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Picking wild raspberries and blueberries along the trails.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Seeing and hearing loons on the lakes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Eating a pasty for dinner and find the Pasty box as a fitting<br/>
&gt; &gt; memento.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   The views from Brockway Mountain Drive in the Keweenaw Peninsula.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Visiting the northern end of Hwy 41.  (Maybe we'll visit the<br/>
&gt; &gt; southern end later this year)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   A sense of accomplishment in getting to the summit of Hogback,<br/>
&gt; &gt; even though it was misty/raining.  In those weather conditions we<br/>
&gt; &gt; certainly didn't have any view of Lake Superior - we were lucky to<br/>
&gt; &gt; barely make out some treetops below us.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   HUGE expanses of forest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps we'll make a trip to the eastern UP next year!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S.  We also hid two new boxes in the UP; clues will be posted in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the near future.  One of the boxes is in the only western UP county<br/>
&gt; &gt; that didn't have a box yet  Iron County.  That region could now be<br/>
&gt; &gt; all "green" after I post the clues!<br/>

&gt; Eau Claire county is "green" now as well.  We have hopes to get<br/>
&gt; something up in Barron, Rusk and Chippewa someday.  I would also <br/>
&gt; like to<br/>
&gt; put a box or two in Portage County.  I don't know why Columbia County<br/>
&gt; isn't green yet, but I guess we will have to do something about that<br/>
&gt; soon!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Re: WI counties - we've placed boxes in Juneau and Green counties<br/>
&gt; &gt; within the last month.  (At least I think it's Juneau.  The Rocky<br/>
&gt; &gt; Arbor box may be in Sauk.  See earlier discussion.)  We've got sites<br/>
&gt; &gt; on Lafeyette, Grant, Richland, and Crawford in remote SW Wisconsin,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but would love to see some other boxes in SW Wisconsin!  It's<br/>
&gt; &gt; beautiful country down here.  Hopefully by the end of summer, we'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; see SW WI all in green.<br/>
