                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks to ArchaeoFrog &amp; Verona Bird Patrol for hosting such a great event today!  The weather was perfect, no bugs, lots of trails with a TON of boxes and great food at the shelter.  Even though there were probably ~150 people at the event, the trails were uncrowded and we rarely met another group.  Martini Man &amp; I enjoyed going out with different boxers throughout the day, and that is one of the especially fun aspects of an event.  What is normally a solitary hobby turns into a chance to get to know some of our fellow addicts a bit better!<br/>
<br/>
In addition to chatting with our old friends, we also had a chance to meet several boxers we hadn't seen before and were happy to add several new exchanges to our logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
We managed to find 45 boxes today and are looking forward to getting back out on the trails to hopefully find 34 more boxes tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to our great hosts this year!<br/>

P.S.  We were out with the Pugnasties and PackerBacker on our last loop of the day,  Near the end of the loop, Mr. Pugnasty noticed his glasses were no longer in his case.  If anyone finds his glasses on the TV loop, please contact him!<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to do a little "lost and found" as we found a pair of Steve Madden sunglasses (actually they were turned in from out on the trail) and a silver hoop earing.  If anyone lost these and needs them returned, please contact me.<br/>
<br/>
And thank you all for the donations for the event.  We were able to fully recoup our costs and have a bit left to donate to the park.<br/>

I have a few questions I was hoping I could get some help with. I am not sure how to record a few of the stamps that I got at the pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
1. Rascal stamp, not sure who's it was.<br/>
2. Revell Chocolate Bar, not sure who's it was.<br/>
3. Save the Date, by Light HouseKeeper 1517 and one love journey<br/>
4. Cartoon character in the Pez dispenser<br/>
<br/>
Not really sure if they are just to enjoy or record. If they should be recorded I would like to get them recorded correctly.<br/>

Thank you so much for a GREAT weekend. Now I see why everyone gets so excited to attend an event.<br/>

still tired).<br/>
<br/>
It was great to see everyone, but again, we find that we managed to miss<br/>
most of you.  However, given the great scope of the park, and the fun<br/>
clues, I can fully understand why most of the people were out on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Three cheers to ArchaeoFrog and the Verona Bird Patrol.<br/>

[BTW, we own the Revel Bar stamp, and I've now added it as an event box.]<br/>
