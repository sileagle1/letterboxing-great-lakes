<br>
Just a reminder that the Murder at Boddy Mansion event at Hawk Woods Nature Center in Auburn Hills Michigan is coming up this Saturday.  Plan for a mentally challenging quest to discover the culprit in the murder of Mr. Boddy including an evening bonfire cookout and a mysterious nighttime activity.<br>
<br>
A few spots are still available for anyone has not yet signed up.  Cabins and tent sites are available, but they have to be reserved by me in person, so time is limited.  More info is available on Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you there!<br>
<br>
Papa<br>
