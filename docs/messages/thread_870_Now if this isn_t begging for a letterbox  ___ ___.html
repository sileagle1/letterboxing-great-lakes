I did a quick clue search in OH and OH Mystery boxes and I don't think there is one listed.<br>

Just don't expect to see anything before the spring :)  Actually, I really want to plant a box by the Rock n' Roll Hall of fame, but haven't had a chance to scope out a good hiding location.  I'm afraid that any box placed around there will go missing really quickly.<br>
 <br>
Cute story about the FREE stamp - when I was student teaching way back in '97, we took the kids to Playhouse Square.  One of the students was a gal whose family had recently moved to Cleveland from Maryland.  The school bus drove past the free stamp, which most of us just take for granted as being there, and she cried out, "Oh my God, what the hell is that??"  (Esp. funny with that language since I was student teaching in an all-girl's Catholic school).<br>
 <br>
But, if you REALLY want weird art in Cleveland, check this out:<br>

I never knew it had a name until I tried doing an internet search just now to send you all a photo.  I just call it, "That really weird thing with the beak."<br>

I kinda thought you might be up for the challenge.  I would put it on my must-find <br>
letterbox list.  I also thought the Politician: the Toy was absolutely great.  Weird, odd, and <br>
outrageous sites ... our Griswold vacations.  Would any of you admit to visiting <br>
Luckenbach, TX just because you were in the area?  We saw Uptown Luckenbach and <br>
Downtown Luckenbach in July.  Waylon, Willie and the boys were not in town (snicker, <br>
snicker).  And the honest, "good Catholic girl" response was classic (My dh is a Catholic HS <br>
principal ... coed ... lots of entertaining stories there.)<br>
