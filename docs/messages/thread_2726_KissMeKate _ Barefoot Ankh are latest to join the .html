Documentation has been received that authenticates the recent travels<br>
of KissMeKate and Barefoot Ankh. The two Illinoisans traveled north<br>
and east (then west and south and north and east again then south,<br>
perhaps) to try their luck at the worldly quest. KMK & BA completed<br>
their tour of the "Around the World in 80 Days" series within the<br>
required time to qualify for the bonus letterbox as well as the<br>
'mission completed' box.<br>
<br>
BTW, to casual readers:  the Travel Team does not learn the order in<br>
which the fifteen sites are visited. It remains a curiosity to the<br>
Passport Office as to what particular routes are followed. The<br>
submitted documents only verify the journey's completion.<br>
And it shall remain a mystery.<br>
<br>
They  have been swamped with positive passport participation.<br>
<br>
Box safely,<br>
The Travel Team<br>
