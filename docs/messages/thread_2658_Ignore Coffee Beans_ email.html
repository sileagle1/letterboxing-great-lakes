Apparently you don't have to actually open the attachment to get infected, <br>
only the message containing the attachment.  If your virus definitions are <br>
up-to-date, they should catch it because it plants itself onto your <br>
computer, however if they are not, it will infect your computer and <br>
automatically e-mails itself to randomly selected addresses in your address <br>
book<br>
<br>
I deleted the message from the LbGLK group shortly after it was posted, but <br>
anyone who gets e-mail and/or the digest will still get the message.  DON'T <br>
OPEN THE MESSAGE titled "New Graphic Site" even though it says it is from <br>
Coffeebeans!<br>
<br>
If you accidentally do/did, you should run a virus scan on your computer to <br>
ensure that you were not infected or to clean the virus if you were <br>
infected.<br>

Subject: [LbGLK] Ignore Coffee Beans' email<br>
<br>
<br>
For those interested, you might want to ignore the last post by Coffee<br>
Beans.  We are trying to figure out what got onto her computer....she<br>
seemed to have gotten something via email that is automatically<br>
generating email from her.  (FYI, this was originally sent to her via<br>
another boxer!)<br>
