Peabody and KMU14, my DH and DD, decided today that I must have a serious case of D.A.M. - Dead Animal Magnetism. While out LBing today for a box listed in LBNA's basement, I did not find the box (didn't expect to), but I did find a "sleeping" squirrel. At least this D.A. was out in plain sight - I didn't find it by touching it's fur like the D.A. from a couple of weeks ago. My official "No Dead Animals" checker, my DSage8 NatoShark, was off throwing rocks in the Fox River. And before that, there was a deer skull by Dragon's lockbox. <br>
