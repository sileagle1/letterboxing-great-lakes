I'm not sure why it says "bulk orders only" because they took our <br>
order of a meager 4 patches (2 LbNA's, 1 P patch, and 1 F patch).  <br>
It does take a little while to get them (bank on up to a month or a <br>
little longer), but they are high quality and well worth the wait.<br>

I just ordered only two patches and received them with no problem in <br>
about a week's time.  They are quite nice!<br>

It seems that the person/people in charge of making changes to the <br>
LbNA regalia pages isn't doing it very fast, so Mohmers made another <br>
page. Unfortunately, it is hard to find out this information if you <br>
don't know it exists. Some prices have changed as well as where you <br>
send your order to. If you have any questions, e-mail Mohmers. She <br>
will help you out if you have any questions. She certainly helped me <br>
out with all my questions.<br>
