Today (and yesterday), Skootching Dog and I went seeking out places to<br/>
plant letterboxes.  I remember a tutorial about planting letterboxes,<br/>
and there was a note in there about not planting in the fall where it<br/>
might be under 4' of water in the spring.  WELL, as MN is in flood stage<br/>
all over the place, we've been out exploring all kinds of parks, trails<br/>
and places to make sure that as bad as it gets in the Mississippi<br/>
Valley, we can still plant boxes!<br/>
<br/>
This has also helped with walking in a fitness challenge for my<br/>
workplace, too! (55 miles in a week to honor the Civil Rights Marchers<br/>
who walked from Selma to Montgomery in 1965)  AND we've found some<br/>
really great places with no bum scat!<br/>
<br/>
This awesome hobby is getting us outside and active!  so cool!<br/>

yesterday and got a kick out of Skootching Dog. ;) Also, your series of<br/>
ancient gods was our first excursion after LK and I moved to Mpls! Very nice<br/>
for someone who considers herself to be a newbie!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to more of your boxes and perhaps meeting you on the trails<br/>
some day!<br/>
