through the BINGO!"<br/>
<br/>
This has been the longest winter in a long time......  <br/>
but another bingo to get us thru LOL, i nearly fell off my chair.<br/>
I'm afraid that might make it feel all the longer.  <br/>
Then i got curious what my longest span with only one word in it was....<br/>
I can top you on that one 27 days. <br/>
Now i must admit i had a really good run before it, and a fairly decent <br/>
run since.  I was really excited when I saw "Two for Tuesday".  but my <br/>
hopes were quickly dashed on that.  <br/>
<br/>
But, what scares me more is i may need a Bingo this summer.  With very <br/>
few boxes within 30 miles, I'm thinking i may have to carefully plan my <br/>
IL roadtrip adventures.  I'm actually figuring "LB Gas $" into my <br/>
entertaimment budget.  And the GL gathering is starting to look like my <br/>
vacation to me.  I must say if the price of gas gets much higher and i <br/>
can't talk my cousin into visiting her son in Coon Rapids and spliting <br/>
the gas $ with me, I may not make it. <br/>
<br/>
I'm just going to have to work harder on getting some more boxers down <br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>
PPE ( who thinks the prizes for summer bingo should be gas cards. and <br/>
no i'm not serious about summer bingo; it's jsut the cabin fever <br/>
talking.)<br/>
