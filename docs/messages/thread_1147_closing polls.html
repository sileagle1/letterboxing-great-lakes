I'm not really sure why you weren't able to close the poll.  It is not<br/>
something that I am even able to set to 'moderator only.'  My understanding<br/>
it that the moderator can close ANY poll and non-mods have the ability only<br/>
to close a poll that they created.  I know that a few people here have been<br/>
able to close their own polls in the past.  Were you logged in with the same<br/>
ID you used to create the poll?  I guess just chalk it up to the quirks of<br/>
Yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looks like you got a good response on the T-shirts!  I am excited that so<br/>
many people will be coming to the gathering.  Looking forward to meeting you<br/>
there!<br/>
