                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All,<br/>
I'm azobox and my Lb partner is Artistamp. We're in Kalamazoo and <br/>
have been letterboxing since July 2002. Artistamp saw an article in <br/>
the Washington Post on a Saturday morning and we were off with the <br/>
clues in hand that same day. The same two boxes in Saugatuck that <br/>
drew SpringChick also beckoned us.<br/>
Since then we have logged finds in MI, DE, MD, NM, IL, and probably <br/>
some I'm forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoy being outdoors and often comment that without letterboxing <br/>
we never would have visited many of the out-of-the-way places, even <br/>
in our own community. Initially stamp carving was a formidable part <br/>
of the game for me, but now it's a part that I especially enjoy. <br/>
Scoping out good sites for boxes and writing clues that challenge the <br/>
seekers are also high points. I've got a couple of unpublished boxes <br/>
in urban settings that were a great winter diversion.<br/>
One of our thrills is meeting other letterboxers on the trail.<br/>
I'm glad to have a regional list that will allow Great Lakes area <br/>
letterboxers an opportunity to share concerns and stories.<br/>
<br/>
Like Tom &amp; Jill, we fondly recall the 2003 Great Lakes Gathering and <br/>
hope that another might come to pass.<br/>

about letterboxing through links on the geocaching website.<br/>

When I started the closest letterbox was over 75 miles away (and even <br/>
now they're few and far between). What with work (including being on-<br/>

limited, and I only get to go letterboxing/geocaching about once a <br/>
month. So I tend hunt geocaches more often (greater numbers in <br/>
concentrated areas) and to only search out letterboxes that are near <br/>
the area I'm geocaching in (if any). <br/>
<br/>
I have my grandkids most weekends, but now that they are 3 &amp; <br/>
4 "dragging them along" will be easier than last year (when they were <br/>
2 &amp; 3) so I'm hoping this summer to get out more often. <br/>

Looks like I'm not alone in being a relative newbie to letterboxing. <br/>
Discovered it when someone in an online art group I belong to <br/>
mentioned it in a post. Got intrigued and had to go Googling. I've <br/>
never been a huge hiker (I'm pretty much an indoor person and <br/>
my allergies make non-urban hiking kind of less-than-fun a lot of <br/>
times), but I love the treasure hunt aspect of letterboxing and the <br/>
stamps. Besides, anything that forces me to exercise can't be all <br/>
bad, right? :-)<br/>
<br/>
I found my first box last summer here in the Milwaukee, WI area. <br/>
Have found about 20 since then. (Would have been more this <br/>
weekend, had we not gotten caught in the torrential downpour <br/>
while out hunting for all the Brown Deer Park boxes.) I haven't <br/>
placed any yet, but I'm working on some ideas for them. Just <br/>
have to find the time to do the carving and the placing.<br/>
<br/>
Took my mom out on a hunt for a box last weekend and she <br/>
seems to have gotten the bug. (Yay! Someone to hunt with!) I <br/>
even carved a stamp for her. (It's the best stamp I've done so far. <br/>
It was hard to let go of it!)<br/>
<br/>
Managed to get out for a little bit on Saturday afternoon and was <br/>
heading for the Lucky Leprechaun box. Kept seeing someone a <br/>
bit ahead of me on the trail. It never occurred to me it could be <br/>
another letterboxer until I saw him disappear into the woods <br/>
where I needed to go. I followed him in and got to meet The <br/>
Dragon. It was a really nice surprise. He's the first other <br/>
letterboxer I've ever met!<br/>

I'm looking forward to meeting many more of you and finding and <br/>
planting a ton of boxes.<br/>

How lucky to run into Dragon on the trail!  I have only a couple <br/>
of "true" on-the-trail exchanges, the others were from gatherings and <br/>
arranged meetings.  I think everyone I pass in the woods is <br/>
letterboxing, but they never end up at the box, so it is just some <br/>
kind of weird paranoia.<br/>

from the <br/>

<br/>
It's a mail art site I'm on, so we do things like handmade <br/>
postcards, altered books, artist trading cards, hand-carved <br/>
stamps and other stamp art, etc. Stuff you can send through the <br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not much of an artist myself, but the site has folks of all <br/>
artistic abilities and I'm learning as I go. I'm a production artist by <br/>
trade, so I'm far better at making other people's art work well <br/>
than I am at creating my own, but I'm starting to like to dabble. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think that's part of how I got drawn into the letterboxing -- the <br/>
stamp carving and seeing other people's designs. I really like <br/>
the carving. I'm not all that adept at it yet, but I'm getting better <br/>
with each design.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also kind of intrigued by the idea of the postal letterboxes, as <br/>
it crosses over between the letterboxing and the mail art. Doesn't <br/>
get quite the same "treasure hunting" feel as the regular <br/>
letterboxing though, I imagine.<br/>

<br/>
Just thought I should introduce myself to the new<br/>
list. I met some of you all at the gathering last year<br/>
and hopefully will meet more at this years event.<br/>
<br/>
I heard about letterboxing a few years ago from my<br/>
brother, who is into geocaching (and a techie<br/>
engineer). But letterboxing is more up my alley, since<br/>
I love book arts, puzzles, maps, local history, and<br/>
general hiking &amp; exploring. You may wonder about my<br/>
trail name, which came from a bike club I started<br/>
(look up Rat Patrol on google if you are interested),<br/>
but it fits with the kind of places I often end up<br/>
hiking, the places where nature is reclaiming<br/>
artificial landscapes. I would love to hide<br/>
letterboxes in abandoned factories and under railroad<br/>
bridges, but I'm a little worried about any of you<br/>
getting hurt (or caught) looking for them, so I'll<br/>
stick to safer areas!<br/>
<br/>
In the last year a lot of things have conspired to<br/>
keep me away from letterboxing, but I promise I will<br/>
soon replace the Chicago Underground &amp; Magic Hedge<br/>
boxes that have been lost, and hide a few more.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Matt!  So good to see you around again.  You absolutely must <br/>
replace the Chicago Underground box -- that was the very first LB I <br/>
found, and the Magic Hedge was #2 (did either I or OldShoe tell you <br/>
the story about the "stuffed" sleeping bag that was at the hedge?)  <br/>
And also, did you get the pic I e-mailed you last fall of the <br/>
graffiti rat I snapped in Central Park (NYC)?  It had reminded me of <br/>
you.  I still have it if you didn't receive it...  might make a cool <br/>
stamp.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just thought I should introduce myself to the new<br/>
&gt; list. I met some of you all at the gathering last year<br/>
&gt; and hopefully will meet more at this years event.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I heard about letterboxing a few years ago from my<br/>
&gt; brother, who is into geocaching (and a techie<br/>
&gt; engineer). But letterboxing is more up my alley, since<br/>
&gt; I love book arts, puzzles, maps, local history, and<br/>
&gt; general hiking &amp; exploring. You may wonder about my<br/>
&gt; trail name, which came from a bike club I started<br/>
&gt; (look up Rat Patrol on google if you are interested),<br/>
&gt; but it fits with the kind of places I often end up<br/>
&gt; hiking, the places where nature is reclaiming<br/>
&gt; artificial landscapes. I would love to hide<br/>
&gt; letterboxes in abandoned factories and under railroad<br/>
&gt; bridges, but I'm a little worried about any of you<br/>
&gt; getting hurt (or caught) looking for them, so I'll<br/>
&gt; stick to safer areas!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the last year a lot of things have conspired to<br/>
&gt; keep me away from letterboxing, but I promise I will<br/>
&gt; soon replace the Chicago Underground &amp; Magic Hedge<br/>
&gt; boxes that have been lost, and hide a few more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

I heard about Lbing through a Girl Scout yahoo group a couple years<br/>

picked up Randy's book from the library (only one library in the<br/>

and want to read up everything I can find.  I've got a number of<br/>
sites for boxes of my own to place, which should be out<br/>
as soon as I carve the stamps.  I haven't given up on my idea to<br/>
introduce our GS council to Lbing either!<br/>

The book is really nice.  I ordered a copy from Borders, but may check into<br/>
the Amazon route.  Even though I'm sure I won't need it soon, it helps to<br/>
explain it to others.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am from the near west Chicago suburbs (you'll know where I'm from<br/>
when you read my clues).  BTW, I just planted my first box this AM<br/>
[*excited dance*].  Hope you guys are in the neighborhood (literally) to<br/>
search it out.  It isn't hard by any means, but it is a (sub)urban box in a<br/>
fairly high traffic area (at times, other times dead as a doornail).  Let me<br/>
know what you guys think.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I can make the gathering too!  I thought I was tied up that<br/>
afternoon, but it turns out the morning is taken, so I'm hoping the location<br/>
works out.<br/>
