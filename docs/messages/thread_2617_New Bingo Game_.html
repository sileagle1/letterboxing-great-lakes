I will modify the game a little though so it is not quite so long and to provide a little variation from last year.  It is a good way to keep everyone involved during the colder months.  Now that the weather is nice, people are out letterboxing and busy with family activities and not so tied to their computers.<br/>

1 Roll of Camo Duck Tape<br/>
Speedball Cutter Set (Basic set w/five tips)<br/>
Carabiner(sp?) w/built-in compass<br/>
Strathmore medium-size drawing pad (The same size that Rainy-Day uses)<br/>
3"X3" Mini Scrapbook Kit<br/>
Block of Mastercarve<br/>
Rubber-Stampede 12 pack of inks (can never have too many ink pads)<br/>
3 VersaColor inks (ditto)<br/>
2 "Get Out There and Box" bracelets  Green (M?) and Pink (F?)<br/>
Camper First Aid Kit<br/>
$25 Mobil Gas card<br/>
2 boxes of "Resealable" Storage Bags  - Quart Size (25 each)<br/>
"Hitchhiker Kit"  - Tiny Tupperware, Log, and Carving Material to <br/>
assemble a HH (Hilarious  Very professional looking, in a baggie and <br/>
card, like an impulse item!!)<br/>
Box of Ziploc Snack Bags (100)<br/>
Map Compass<br/>
2 Slabs of Speedy-Stamp<br/>
A box of Cherry Jell-o (traditional BINGO prize)<br/>
.5 Quart-size Lock &amp; Lock w/small logbook, small block of <br/>
Mastercarve, and 5 "This is not a Geocache" Labels (Do-it-yourself <br/>
box - I think this all went together)<br/>
A Camo tape-covered tube (originally for pencils, maybe?) complete <br/>
with a long, skinny logbook (another DIY)<br/>
Tiny Maglite  written on the envelope it was in, "For Dark Places"<br/>
Replacement set of carving tips<br/>
Hot Cocoa ("To be enjoyed after winter boxing")<br/>
A waterproof tube (perhaps from a centrifuge?)<br/>
A box of 4 Seal'n Savers of various sizes<br/>
2 Letterboxing Ornaments (The LBNA and GLKLB patches mounted and <br/>
ready to hang on a Christmas tree!)<br/>
A pair of handmade hiking socks  (warm and cozy with green stripes, <br/>
my favorite)<br/>
A Gwen Frostic blank journal  (we have two of her books of block-<br/>
prints  I'll have to be very creative with this!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, thank you so very much to everyone who participated in <br/>
SpringChick's BINGO.  Now I have no excuse to not plant, oh, 12 or so <br/>
boxes in the next couple months!!<br/>

I just loved your list of winnings! They were all great items. Am I correct in assuming they <br/>
were all donated by the individuals playing bingo? I look forward to next winter when I can <br/>
join the crowd and play that game!<br/>
<br/>
Another question ... the JELL-O ?!?  Would you please explain this inside joke to those of <br/>
us who are not in the know?!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

&gt; Holy Crap Brownrabbit you really made out!! Why is a box of cherry <br/>
&gt; jello a traditional bingo prize?<br/>
&gt; Double Dragon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were the ones who sent in the jello--it is a Bingo joke in my <br/>
family.  When I was little, our extended family would always go to <br/>
my Aunt Evelyn's house for Thanksgiving.  After the big meal, she <br/>
would always have Bingo for the kids to play--complete with wrapped <br/>
prizes.  You would start out with good prizes like Cracker Jack and <br/>
gum and candy bars.  But she never, ever bought enough of the "good <br/>
stuff".  Pretty soon, she would be back in the bedroom wrapping up <br/>
cans of soup and boxes of Jello to give out as prizes.  So you <br/>
definitely wanted to win early when you played Bingo at her house!  <br/>
My mom has carried on the Bingo tradition.  Now our whole family <br/>
plays at Christmas time.  In the midst of the good prizes she always <br/>
wraps some soup or jello in memory of Aunt Evelyn.  So I carried <br/>
that tradition on into Letterboxing BINGO.<br/>
