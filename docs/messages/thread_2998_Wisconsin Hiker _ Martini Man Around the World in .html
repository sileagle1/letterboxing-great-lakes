                    <div class="plaintext-content">The dynamic duo from Wisconsin left records in the dust during a<br/>
whirlwind weekend in Michigan. Yes, it was less than 80 HOURS for<br/>
their search for the elusive "Around the World in 80 Days" series. The<br/>
travel staff was aware that an attempt on the record was afoot and so<br/>
the telegram-like reports received throughout the search were<br/>
carefully studied and the documents of authentication were scrutinized<br/>
for accuracy. In the end there was no question: a record had been set!<br/>
While speed was a factor for the series (after all, it is named "80<br/>
DAYS"), the travel staff could not have imagined the warp-speed<br/>
demonstrated by Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man.<br/>
<br/>
Though obstacles of all types were thrown before the travelers (ferry<br/>
canceled, grave diggers very close to an important site, etc) plus the<br/>
usual clue interpretation challenges, WiHi and MM persevered and<br/>
brought home the prize!<br/>
<br/>
The Travel Staff does not recommend that others attempt to better this<br/>
record.<br/>
Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man are professionals.<br/>
(you know the drill:"professional drivers, closed course..do not try<br/>
this at home.")<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations to the latest winners of the "World Traveler" and <br/>
"Around the World in 80 Days"  letterbox/bonus box.<br/>
<br/>
Reminder: the series will not be maintained after Fall 2006. <br/>
<br/>
Box safely,<br/>
