Ealge Days have been planted and clues are up on AtlasQuest.  I should <br/>
get the clues for Hammerin' Hank here in Milwaukee up today also.  Big <br/>
time woohoo!!  One of my uncles went along with me to the parks to <br/>
plant them and is very curious about who's going to come find them, <br/>
where they'll come from.  I kept telling him we'll just have to wait <br/>
and see.  And that people could come from all over. Thanks to everyone <br/>
who's answered questions for me in the past couple of months about <br/>
carvings and supplies and all the rest.  It was greatly appreciated!  <br/>
You are all fabulous!!<br/>
