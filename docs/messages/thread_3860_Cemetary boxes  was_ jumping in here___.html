  I have a whole series of cemetery boxes here in Ottawa Co.<br>
   <br>
  I love old cemeteries -- they bring back wonderful memories of times I spent with my Grandma who was an avid genealogist.  We would pack a lunch and travel down dusty old country roads looking for that one cemetery, with that one grave stone...and I would get down and take a rubbing for her.<br>
   <br>
  I believe that you should take special care to protect the surroundings and be sure to be respectful of graves and visitors.  All the boxes I've placed are either around the perimiter or in a respectful location within the grounds.  I love walking around, looking at all the lovely markers -- I imagine loved ones have placed these markers for others to see and enjoy.  These little country treasures should be enjoyed -- they are like a little bit of heaven here on earth - lovely, quiet and peaceful.<br>
