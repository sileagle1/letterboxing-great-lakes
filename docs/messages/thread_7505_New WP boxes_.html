                    <div class="plaintext-content">Woo-hoo!  Glad to see more Waltzing Pigs cemetery boxes posted!  We have enjoyed all the previous boxes, particularly due to all the interesting stories associated with the specific graves.  The new boxes will give us something to look forward to when we get back home.<br/>
<br/>
We are happy that we are vacationing in the mountains of Idaho this week and thereby escaping the brutally HOT temperatures at home.  We were in the Boise area our first day out here and it was VERY hot!  However after that we headed to cooler areas and have really enjoyed finding many older boxes out here.  A lot of them were planted the first year we started boxing (2003) and many haven't been found in 2+ years.  The most exciting was being first finders on two boxes that were planted 9 years ago!  We're also planting a few boxes out here for people that like to hike (some on a 5-6 mile hike and some on an 11 mile hike).<br/>
<br/>
We agree with what everyone else has said - it would NOT be fun to take a 2-year old to Blue Mounds in the extreme heat.  We were extremely lucky to have perfect conditions on the weekend of the event. It would be best to wait for temperatures in the 70s or low 80s. (I like it warmer than most).<br/>
