Hi - Just a question - <br>
<br>
I'm sure this will be very silly to all you pro LBers, but I guess <br>
we've been pretty bad re: cleaning off the stamps after we use them - <br>
(and we call ourselves The Honor Guards :)). I didn't know that we <br>
should be cleaning the stamps after we use them - whoops :) <br>
<br>
Should I just bring along baby wipes and a towel or is there something <br>
better to use. I noticed on this site (I think) that one of you brings <br>
a sponge - are wipes ok too? - they seem to be so much easier to pack <br>
(plus with 3 little ones we always have them anyway).<br>
<br>
We do bring extra baggies and a plastic bag to pick up garbage along <br>
the way - we've just need some help re: cleaning the stamps.<br>
<br>
Thanks for filling us in. <br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes this would be true if using alcohol or lanolin based baby wipes, but most of the wipes I have seen are alcohol-free.  Wouldn't want to be wiping a little one's behind with alcohol.  I guess I am learning something here because I have been a rubber stamper for several years now and have always been taught that baby wipes are ideal for quick stamp clean-ups.<br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind about cleaning hand-carved stamps versus store-bought stamps is that they tend to be much more delicate.  I often use an old toothbrush for cleaning my art stamps, especially after some of the pigment inks that can almost be kind of gooey.  But when cleaning hand-carved stamps, never use anything abrasive or a rough side-to-side cleaning motion as this can easily damage the carving.<br>
<br>
I really like the sponge in the soap dish idea from Deedle -- Seems quick and not messy.  I am stopping this afternoon at the local $$ store for a dish and a sponge and adding this to my pack.  Thanks!<br>
