Ring tones, the bane of society. However, if you really must know, my ring tone is "That's all Folks!" by Porky Pig. I would be more than happy to give you my phone number, 765-832-5837. <br/>

I am sure that it did not escape you that the axe wielding employee of Hamlet's Fine Pork was himself a pig. Then there is the reference to Hamlet, a tragedy of moral corruption. The culprit is obvious; it is our own greed. <br/>

We'll be taking a roundabout route to the GLk event at the end of May and are therefore interested in any boxing recommendations anyone has for Indiana. We'll be coming from the southwest and since the event is in the northeast part of the state, almost anywhere is fair game.<br/>
<br/>
As most of you know, we prefer to get out on hiking trails rather than stop for drive-bys, so if there are any good areas for hiking that have some boxes, those would be of particular interest to us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

The Spirit of Kokiwanee is one of my favorite spots. We attempted Corbeau,<br/>
the first box in Indiana, several years ago, but we were not prepared as we<br/>
should have been, so we turned back. I haven't had the time to get back down<br/>
there. I have a photo from the day and that was a super reward.<br/>
