                    <div class="plaintext-content">i have recently received messages from lbna that the status has been <br/>
changed on one of my letterboxes to 'found' by two different lbers.<br/>
the problem is that this letterbox has been considered missing for <br/>
several months.  when i returned to mi i didn't even bother checking <br/>
it.  the lb is turkeyville, and i was wondering if a 'seasoned' seeker <br/>
could give me some input on it's status?  has anyone from this board <br/>
tried to find it this summer?<br/>
thanks,<br/>
