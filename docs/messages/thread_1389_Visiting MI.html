Both Franzsolo and Scoutdogs are excellent carvers.so any of theirs would be<br>
worth the effort.  I think they both have kept up the status pretty well,<br>
tho this past winter has been somewhat challenging weather wise.  Miami<br>
White Water Park has quite a few very nice stamps.  Winton Woods has some<br>
good ones also, but are more likely to be missing.  I'll have to check and<br>
see what other ones are must finds.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I would highly recommend you make the effort to head east to Jackson or<br>
Chillicothe sometime.  It's like a mini-Connecticut as far as the number of<br>
boxes available.  One of my favorites in that area is Leo PEtroglyphs.  They<br>
are really cool.<br>

Our youngest and I recommend the N. KY Archealogy Box (actually a micro) for it's outstanding location in Kenton County, KY.  It has a spectacular view of Cincinnati and a nice little museum. And don't forget to pack your picnic lunch.<br>
<br>
A great perk of letterboxing is finding the neat places that you might have bypassed. <br>
