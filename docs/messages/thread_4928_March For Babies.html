our team.  (You will be rewarded....)<br/>
<br/>
We are quickly approaching $1000, but we're not quite there yet.  We <br/>
raised over $1700 last year, and we're hoping to do the same this <br/>
year.  Keep those donations coming to help adorable little babies.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't visited our blog in the last couple of days, there is <br/>
a "video" of Emily walking for more donations (She's about halfway to <br/>
her personal goal).  You'll have to see it to truly appreciate it, it's <br/>
cute!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!!!<br/>
