  Just wanted to let you all know that I am changing my trailname to one that better suits me: Sunny Side Up. Peabody suggested Carpe Nestle (Seize the Chocolate). DS likes "Sunny with a Chance". My yahoo ID has an M at the end (it's so challenging to find a name that other's haven't taken!), but for LBNA and AQ, I am Sunny Side Up. <br>
<br>
  - Sunny Side Up, with a smile on her face :)<br>
