 Just a heads up for one and all on the list.. Yesterday, I planted<br>
two letterboxes, One Brand New, and one a Re-Location. Clues posted so<br>
far on AQ. *Hand Carved Stamp*<br>
<br>
New: Baby Bear - Location: Hoffma Park, Grand Haven, MI. area.<br>
**Caution ** Baby bear is near a high traffic area, so you'll need to<br>
be sneaky and watch for hikers along the trail.<br>

Re-Located: "Rattle in the Woods" - From "Duncan's Woods" to Hoffma<br>
