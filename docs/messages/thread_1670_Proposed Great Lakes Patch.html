<br>
Several other regions in the U.S. have developed their own patch in <br>
addition to using the national LBNA patch and I thought it would be <br>
nice to have one for our region.  Spring Chick has OK'd using the <br>
message board graphic as the basis for a patch for the Great Lakes <br>
region and I am pursuing having some made.<br>
<br>
I've posted a graphic of the proposed patch in the FILES section of the <br>
message board (didn't have the .jpg available on this computer, so it <br>
is embedded in a MS Word document).  I can post it as a .jpg later <br>
today.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to determine if there is much interest among the boxers in <br>
the area in having a patch like this.  Cost would be approximately $2 <br>
per patch.<br>

<br>
<br>
  Hi!<br>
<br>
  Several other regions in the U.S. have developed their own patch in <br>
  addition to using the national LBNA patch and I thought it would be <br>
  nice to have one for our region.  Spring Chick has OK'd using the <br>
  message board graphic as the basis for a patch for the Great Lakes <br>
  region and I am pursuing having some made.<br>
<br>
  I've posted a graphic of the proposed patch in the FILES section of the <br>
  message board (didn't have the .jpg available on this computer, so it <br>
  is embedded in a MS Word document).  I can post it as a .jpg later <br>
  today.<br>
<br>
  I'm trying to determine if there is much interest among the boxers in <br>
