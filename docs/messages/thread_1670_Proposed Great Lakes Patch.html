Several other regions in the U.S. have developed their own patch in <br/>
addition to using the national LBNA patch and I thought it would be <br/>
nice to have one for our region.  Spring Chick has OK'd using the <br/>
message board graphic as the basis for a patch for the Great Lakes <br/>
region and I am pursuing having some made.<br/>
<br/>
I've posted a graphic of the proposed patch in the FILES section of the <br/>
message board (didn't have the .jpg available on this computer, so it <br/>
is embedded in a MS Word document).  I can post it as a .jpg later <br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to determine if there is much interest among the boxers in <br/>
the area in having a patch like this.  Cost would be approximately $2 <br/>
per patch.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Hi!<br/>
<br/>
  Several other regions in the U.S. have developed their own patch in <br/>
  addition to using the national LBNA patch and I thought it would be <br/>
  nice to have one for our region.  Spring Chick has OK'd using the <br/>
  message board graphic as the basis for a patch for the Great Lakes <br/>
  region and I am pursuing having some made.<br/>
<br/>
  I've posted a graphic of the proposed patch in the FILES section of the <br/>
  message board (didn't have the .jpg available on this computer, so it <br/>
  is embedded in a MS Word document).  I can post it as a .jpg later <br/>
  today.<br/>
<br/>
  I'm trying to determine if there is much interest among the boxers in <br/>
  the area in having a patch like this.  Cost would be approximately $2 <br/>
  per patch.<br/>
