probably did about 250 miles round trip that day.  I'm not much of a power<br/>

OldShoe and I are headed up into the U.P. for a week at the end of the month<br/>
and have a pretty ambitious list of boxes, but considering we will be<br/>
checking on our own boxes at the same time and have already done some of the<br/>
older boxes, there aren't any areas concentrated enough to do more than<br/>
maybe 6 boxes in a day -- and still take time to enjoy the sights and do<br/>
some photography.<br/>

Leapin' Lizards or Dragon may be able to throw out some amazing numbers for<br/>
boxes found in one day...<br/>

<br/>
Up until a couple of weeks ago, my personal best day was 17 (not including <br/>
hitchhikers). I did it twice, once in and around Kernville, CA, and once on <br/>
the way from Erie to Detroit via Cleveland (one box in Erie, then 16 in <br/>
Cleveland).<br/>
<br/>
Then I went to Connecticut for the first time....<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer and I found 32 on a single day in SW CT a couple of weekends ago <br/>
on a Saturday, starting at 8:30 am and wrapping up at 7:30 pm.<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend, I went boxing in SE Massachusetts and found 19 on Saturday, <br/>
then we found another 17 in NW CT on Sunday (including 5 in the DEP state <br/>
forest letterboxing program to qualify for their patch).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the boxes in CT and MA are so much more highly concentrated than <br/>
elsewhere in the country, so it's easy to rack up big numbers without <br/>
driving a lot of miles. And we've found so many of the boxes here in my <br/>
neck of PA that it's hard to find too many more than a dozen in a single <br/>
day, and that might include 150 miles of driving. When we go out boxing <br/>
around here, we're much more interested in a good day's hiking, and don't <br/>
plan for lots of finds but rather to enjoy longer hikes and interesting <br/>
places. But when I travel, I tend to try to find as many boxes as I can, <br/>
since I don't know when I'll be back to that part of the country. For me, <br/>
it's all part of the fun, both the days with lots of finds and the days <br/>
with challenging hikes and all the variations in between.<br/>

so....so much for the interesting story!<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow we're heading out to Geauga County here in<br/>
Ohio to find a few boxes out that way.  We've got 5 on<br/>
our list.  I was wondering how many others are using<br/>
the long weekend to do some boxing, and what the goals<br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
Wow...just looked at our letterboxing log, and if we<br/>
find all 5 tomorrow, we'll be three boxes shy of<br/>
hitting the F 50 mark.  P is still at 0, but,<br/>
but....might not be come Tuesday!<br/>

That was my trip to Portland, OR early this year. However, I think <br/>
the area around Portland has more boxes than the entire STATE of <br/>
Michigan! <br/>
<br/>
This was truly a day of power boxing! We left my hotel room at 8am <br/>
and by 10:04am we had found 10 boxes. You should know that up until <br/>
then, I had only found 12 other boxes (all of them in Michigan).<br/>
<br/>
Before the trip, I had started calling Portland "letterbox heaven" in <br/>
jest, but I don't say that in jest anymore. (grin)<br/>

and found 14 boxes of 19 boxes.  I was first finder on several new boxes, yeah.  I missed <br/>
Schoolbus ... shooting range nearby gives me the heebie-jeebies and there was a huge <br/>
monster tractor/truck pull setting up.  We were kinda conspicuous and didn't linger.  At <br/>
Franklin County Park, we found a number of scoutdog boxes, but Napalm is probably <br/>
missing; found the definitive urinal tree and paced correctly to the stone, but alas, nothing <br/>
below.  We passed on 2 ... today the holiday campers were out in full force and it would <br/>
have been a little rude to go through the picnic campsites.  We saw a baby deer in full <br/>
daylight grazing by the road and a huge turtle with great color near campsite 84.  We will <br/>
return later.  We skipped one of scoutdogs' boxes at Brookville Dam due to time.  So we <br/>
really only seriously looked for 16 and came up with 14.  It was a very humid day.  We saw <br/>
a HUGE old oak tree and the hiking was really quiet and relaxing in southeastern Indiana.  I <br/>
highly recommend the Mary Gray Bird Sanctuary boxes ... even without a map.<br/>
