Beetle asked me to list the S.I.L.O. II event on AQ, so I did.  She's told me however she cannot see it listed unless I send her the direct link.  Could a few of you look and see if you find it listed there under Feb 16?<br/>

I am able to find the listing of the SILO II event; it's #25 in the listing.  Previously, I was typing in the date and location and nothing was coming up.  Best to just scroll down and click on the listing rather than typing in a location and date.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for being the technical brains behind the annual SILO events. I couldn't do this without you.<br/>

The little ones of the pack love the theme and I think they may try to dress up to blend in the crowd.  I PROMISE, this year we won't do any cooties, but the little ones will be doing the LTCs that we will be making.  I already have 1 in mind, maybe 2, and I think I'll have the 4 oldest ones think of some to create as well.  (something to keep them busy, not fighting, and entertained, even if it's for 15 minutes!..LOL)   I thought there would be a way to list the LTCs that may be at the S.I.L.O. on the event page, but to no avail there was not that option.  =(  OH well, back to creating ideas and stamps while Lil' A is taking a nap, and Diego is entertaining Swee' Pea.  YEAH!!  School is back in session, and I get a breather now during the day! LOL  j/k  <br/>
