had a free afternoon after dropping off the kids for an outing with <br/>
Grandma and Grandpa.  We were planning on a bike ride--somewhere--and <br/>

As we were riding our bikes through a forest preserve, we thought this <br/>
would be a great place to hide boxes.  Unfortunately, there was no way <br/>
to look up clues.  Then, as we were passing through an area, something <br/>
caught my attention that reminded me of "Samuel Curtiss's sheep <br/>
pasture".  I remembered seeing clues about a mystery letterbox <br/>
relating to this, but my memory wasn't good enough to remember all of <br/>
the clues.  Another missed opportunity.  Then, as we were driving to <br/>
pick up the kids, we passed Lyman Woods.  We remembered that there <br/>
were clues to a box there as well, but again, no way to find the <br/>

Amazing how we used to do the straight thru drive 12+ hours. Now we find boxes along the way and end up trying to time it so we can hit a few boxes and get a hotel room for the night. LOL<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have an excel spreadsheet, each tab is a different state.<br/>
The boxes/clues are stored on the each State's page - I copy and paste<br/>
them from LBNA.  Not ALL of them are there, only the states I know I<br/>
travel through (Illinois, Iowa, Wiscinsin, Indiana, Michigan right now)<br/>
Once I find a box, I remove the clue from the state tab, and list the box<br/>
name &amp; date found on a separate "Found" tab.<br/>
I keep the spreadsheet on a thumb drive, and we do have a laptop that we<br/>
can bring with us on road trips, but I've never actually thought to look<br/>
up my clues with it, LOL!  <br/>
I also keep a stack of printed clues in the back of the car to pull out<br/>
when needed  :-)<br/>

I have a free program called Plucker that coverts web<br/>

gives me one PDA file for each region, just like they<br/>
have one page of clue listings for each region on the<br/>
LBNA web site.<br/>
<br/>
I can carry the PDA with me on the trail and follow<br/>
the clues.  It is easy to update it any time I need to<br/>
before walking out the door in case clues have changed<br/>
or been updated.  And I can put any regions I need on<br/>
there.  The whole process takes about 5 minutes for<br/>
each region. <br/>
