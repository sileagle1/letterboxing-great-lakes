The weather was great for most of the day - much cooler than the gatherings in our region earlier this summer - and we were lucky enough to be not too far from the car during the brief downpour.   We had rain gear in our pack, so we avoided a soaking and had just a brief wait before going back on the trail.  </span><br/></p><p><span><b><br/></b></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Thanks to carry on grandma for sharing her company and ink along the trail, too!</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The Christmas Elves</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p></body></html>
