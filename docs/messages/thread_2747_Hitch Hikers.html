<br/>
I don't often chime in here, although I do enjoy reading everyones <br/>
comments, but I recently found a Hitch Hiker for the second time.  I <br/>
found it last July in Dexter, Michigan and then this July in Lansing, <br/>
Michigan (at least 50 miles apart). In the HH log book there were <br/>
about a dozen boxes it had visited since I last found it (several <br/>
right before or after I hit those same boxes.)  My question is should <br/>
I have taken it?  Or leave it for someone else to find?  I ended up <br/>
taking it so I could move it further up north when I go later this <br/>
month.  Any thoughts?   <br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
