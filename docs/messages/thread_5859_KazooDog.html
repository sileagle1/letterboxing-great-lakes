The last time we spoke she had agreed to let me take over her boxes. Regretfully I didn't act upon it while she was still alive.<br/>
I have sent the webmasters a request to adopt the boxes. I will keep you informed of the outcome. <br/>
<br/>
I know some of you have had some issues with her boxes and I hope to correct them for future finders.<br/>

She was a wonderful woman and she will be missed by many.<br/>

I don't think I've had the opportunity to look for any of her boxes yet, but I do believe that they are on my list for if I ever get up that way again. It is good to know however that you will be taking over her boxes so that her letterboxing memory can live on through their maintenance. <br/>
