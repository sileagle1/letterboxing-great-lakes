Dearest Fam O'Many...Our family and friends already think it's enough of a "sin" that we spend our time letterboxing!  They wouldn't stand for us to add two more "sin" games...but, if we were persuaded enough......we could possibly give in and join the hanky-panky you have up your sleeve with the 50 Boxes of Springchick!  Care to share the solution?....or would that be a third sin?<br>

I, under my good conscience, cannot give away that secret of the code.You should look again. You wouldn't want to step down now, would you? the 50 BOS await. As they say in the Haunted Mansion movie..."You try, you fail. You try, you fail....Try again"<br>

<br>
Nonetheless, you do NOT need to solve the puzzle to play the 50 Boxes of SpringChick game. All you need to do is fill in your card w/50 of the 104 box titles and send it w/a small prize to Fo6. If you figure out the puzzle, that is a bonus, but not necessary for playing the game. Just go visit your Swedish sauna, roll around in da snow, and RELAX!<br>
