While I don't wish this on anyone, I was wondering if anyone else runs into<br>
a problem reading notes from planting a box and remembering the details of<br>
the plant. I shouldn't have waited to write up the clues! Of course, I could<br>
plan a trip towards the southwest corner of the state - and doublecheck my<br>
plant along the way. "Gotta get finds while the sun shines!"<br>
