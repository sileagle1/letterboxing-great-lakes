I am not even Polish and I am ready to have pierogis for Christmas!!  <br/>
The only ones I have had are the (gasp!) frozen ones, not all these <br/>
yummy home-made ones.  Although the ones with sauerkraut might fit in <br/>
with my German heritage.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you buy the Kasia's they are very very good.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if they are anywhere but in Chicago though -- Kasia's is a Polish deli <br/>
on Division.  Kasia's freezes their signature pierogies and sells them in local <br/>
grocery stores. Actually I have 3 Polish delis near me and they all sell pierogies. <br/>
<br/>
Plus paczkis on paczki day! [fat tuesday]. I fry them in butter with a little bit <br/>
of water mixed in with a lid on the pan. Then they are both steamed and <br/>
they get that nice brown crispy texture too.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone comes to Chicago and is dying for good Polish food, The Red<br/>
 Apple (or Czerwone Jablusko) has an absolutely amazing buffet.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.planet99.com/chicago/restaurants/2147.html<br/>
<br/>
They start you with zupy (soup), usually rosl (chicken noodle soup -- <br/>
made with parsley) and grzybowa (a creamy mushroom and noodle <br/>
soup). Then you hit the buffet for salatki na zimno -- the salad course. <br/>
The Red Apple is famous for their mouth watering salads. I like to <br/>
start with plain buraczki (beet salad -- good for the blood) and they<br/>
 also have it w zalewie octowym (with vinegar), as well as salatka z <br/>
porw (egg and leek salad), and they usually have salatka z makaronu <br/>
(macaroni salad), salatka fasolowa (bean salad), kiszona kapusta (cold <br/>
sauerkraut), and czerwona kapusta (red cabbage) to name a few, <br/>
plus regular salata z dressingiem (salad with dressings) and all the<br/>
 add ons you would need -- cottage cheese, sour cream, apple sauce, <br/>
etc. <br/>
<br/>
Then we have dania gorace -- the hot dishes, and the meat course. <br/>
yum yum, my favorite is kapusta z kielbasa (sauerkraut and Polish <br/>
sausage) which we also have at all holidays, papryka faszerowana <br/>
pomaranczowym (baked ham, carved off the bone), ryba pieczona <br/>
w sosie cytrynowo maslanym (baked fish in lemon butter sauce), <br/>
and kaczka pieczona z jablkami (baked duck with apples). <br/>
<br/>
And if you don't want to be a total carnivore, like me you'll have <br/>
some jarzyny na goraco (hot veggies) -- ziemniaki (potatoes) of <br/>
course, both gotowane (boiled, with parsley) and pur, or mashed, <br/>
as well as zielona fasolka (green beans) and kukurydza (corn -- <br/>
on the cob).<br/>
<br/>
But the verrrrry best part of Polish food is, as we've been saying --<br/>
heavenly! fried! carbs! placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes), which<br/>
I swear is nothing more than a blob of hot grease held together with <br/>
a few shreds of potato, mmmmm.... and racuszki (apple pancakes), <br/>
both with apple sauce, nalesniki (cheese blintzes) and of course <br/>
pierogies.<br/>
<br/>
And then dessert.... I love kolacky of course!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately they do not have the Traditional Polish Winkie at The <br/>
Red Apple. They have some sad little impostors there, but I pass them <br/>
by. [I have a picturre of a Winkie ot share but my host site won't <br/>
load today]<br/>
<br/>
Also no where in here do I mention the dreaded czarnina. Duck Blood<br/>
Soup. That stuff is nasty.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am starrrrrrrvvvviinnnngggggg........<br/>

&gt; Well, we could always buy pre-made, frozen 'ogis' but they just aren't the same.  <br/>

&gt;   I've never tried them with meat, but there was (is?) a shop in Parma Ohio that was/is <br/>
like the dunking doughnuts of pierogis! Every filling imaginable and as fast as fast food! <br/>
Never ate there though.<br/>

&gt;   My mouth is watering!!! My mother-in-law is Polish and she makes pierogis for every <br/>
holiday. She will make three large serving platters piled high with those little dough <br/>
dumplings. Each platter contains a different filling: sauerkraut, mashed potato with <br/>
onions, and shaved roast beef. Very gourmet! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   My grandmother (my dad's mom) was born in Lithuania. She made different pierogis <br/>
and we simply called them Lithuanian Dumplings. She rolled out the dough but never too <br/>
thin. They were suppose to fill you up...and they did!!! She filled them with pan fried <br/>
ground beef and pork and onions. She boiled them the first time, but we would reheat <br/>
them in a frying pan with melted butter. OH! My heart! She always made a white sauce with <br/>
mushrooms (sorry Fungus Woman!) and poured that over the dumplings. MMMMM!!!! I <br/>
learned to make them just because they are so delicious to eat! Flour all over the <br/>
kitchen....a big clean up mess....but soooooo worth the effort! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Now I'm hungry!!! <br/>

  Oh, would you be speaking of Parma Pierogies? Made famous by <br/>
  President Clinton. Alas, they closed their doors in 1999 (and I <br/>
  never got to eat there!). <br/>
<br/>
  But....fear not...I found a link for a seller at the West Side <br/>
  Market, the Pierogi Palace! http://piepal.com/bottom.php?<br/>
  server=piepal.com&amp;file=/ <br/>
<br/>
  And...and...and...for those of you who don't live nearby, it looks <br/>
  like they'll deliver to almost anywhere in the US! "Pierogis <br/>
  purchased on-line are mailed fully cooked and frozen, and include <br/>
  reheating instructions."<br/>
<br/>
  Methinks I may need to bring some of these to the gathering in June...<br/>
