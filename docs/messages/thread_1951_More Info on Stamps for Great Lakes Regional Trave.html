                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spoke earlier today with She_Who_Plants about the Great Lakes <br>
Regional Traveling Event Stamps and have a little more info to pass <br>
along for those who are considering...<br>
<br>
She is not setting a theme for us, but would like the package to <br>
have a theme.  This is something we can decide as a group once a <br>
group has been put together.  I'd like it to be something that is <br>
representative of our area but yet allows enough room for creativity <br>
so everyone is free to produce some awesome carvings.  Also, the <br>
complete package is not due to her until early spring, so this is <br>
not something you would have to get done within the next few weeks <br>
or even by the end of the year.  I will probably set a deadline of <br>
mid-February.  She would also like us to make a logbook to go with <br>
the package and I have approached an individual about making that.<br>
<br>
Thanks to those who have already e-mailed me.  I will be getting <br>
back with everyone during this weekend.<br>
