  Subject: [LbGLK] Cootie count at the SILO<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  7 cooties passed through my hands, but none came home with me that I know of :)<br/>
<br/>
  I'd like to belatedly thank the Brat Pack for the origami gift bags with stamps. What a lot of work must have gone into this project!<br/>
<br/>
  A question: do the 8 miniboxes hidden at the SILO event count as "finds" in my total?<br/>

<br/>
But I think on AQ, only the traditional finds count toward the finds in the ribbon symbol by your name.  That's why I don't have very many finds on my ribbon, but over 700 stamp images in my log books.  I mostly do postals now due to bad knees and limited time and I don't keep track of my count anymore.<br/>
