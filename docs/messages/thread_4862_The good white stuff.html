  heaviest from 12-7pm.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Absolutely!  PZ Kut is the best 'white stuff.'  I don't think it would taste very good, not that I've tried to eat it.    Recently, I ordered some of the orange stuff.  My eyes don't seem to mind the color.  <br>
<br>
Oh, I love those night owls like myself.  Love to sit up late, while the creative juices are flowing, the house is quiet, and I can carve without being interrupted.  <br>
<br>
Don't let this snow get you down.  Let's all keep carving and creating new boxes.  As soon as the snow is gone, we can plant all these new boxes. Then, it will have been worth the wait.  Spring is a time for letterboxes to be 'blooming' all along the trails.  Ahhh....makes me smile just to think about new boxes for 2008.<br>
