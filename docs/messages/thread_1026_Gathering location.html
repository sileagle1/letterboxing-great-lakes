Hello everyone!<br>
<br>
Sorry if we kept you waiting...<br>
<br>
Our scouting is done - the weekend weather certainly helped! Please <br>
come one and all to the 2005 Great Lakes Gathering: Mo' Boxin' In <br>
Motown on June 18, at Hudson Mills Metropark.  A $4 entrance fee is <br>
required, but we promise lots of fun and treasures to find (and, as <br>
an added bonus - MI's VERY FIRST letterbox!).  The park is easily <br>
accessable from both US-23 and I-94...<br>
<br>
Visit this link for a map (left side of the page).  Our shelter is <br>
#5, the secluded "Pine View".<br>

<br>
Thank you to TJ_Mich, Dragon, and the Cichlid Guy in helping narrow <br>
the many choices down to just one! <br>
<br>
As always,<br>
Team Rabbit<br>
at your service<br>

last August for my friend's wedding, we drove right by<br>

go back!<br>

(I'm working on coaxing that "Yes, we can go" from<br>
Deedle, who's hemming & hawing 'cause it's fathers day<br>
weekend and there's this car show his family likes to<br>
goes to that weekend)<br>
