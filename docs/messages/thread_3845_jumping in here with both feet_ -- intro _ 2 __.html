                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi and welcome to letterboxing!  In answer to your questions<br>
   <br>
  1. yes cemeteries are mostly off limits although I did find one or two that had boxes. As far as Parks - National Parks are definately off limits but State and Metro Parks like Kennsington are more of a don't ask don't tell situation.  I have letterboxes planted in Kennsington and in State Parks that have been there over a year and have not caused any problems. <br>
   <br>
  2. Draw away!  In my mind Letterboxing is about much more than rules.  Its about planting boxes where the view & the hike is worth sharing, its about creating boxes with clever clues that challenge the boxer but are still solveable!  Its about following some ones clues on a beautiful day and hopefully finding a great new spot.  Once you find the box who cares if you stamp in or draw in, as long as you rehide the box where it was and maybe notify the placer of its condition.  The point is to enjoy the hunt, try not to distrub the natural surroundings of the boxes hiding place and do not worry about the rest!<br>
   <br>
  I hope you'll enjoy the hobby and let me know if you find any of my boxes!<br>
   <br>
  Sincerely<br>
   <br>

As for drawing your stamp now, thats cool. We just put our finger <br>
print in the first 2 boxes we did, because we didn't know if we would <br>
like it or not. It has been 3 years and counting so I think we like <br>
it! Have fun and remember to hide and rehide boxes well, so the <br>
muggles don't get'em!!<br>

Welcome to the insanity... er, I mean hobby!<br>
<br>
This is a really great group.  Sounds like you live a couple miles <br>
from me, I'm in the Redford area.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of great finds in the Livonia/Redford/Northville <br>
area.  There are a ton in Kensington, although I haven't made it out <br>
there to find any of those yet.<br>
<br>
As far as cemeteries, I wouldn't think they are any more off-limits <br>
than most places.  Technically, I suppose you should get permission <br>
to plant any where, but I don't think most people do that.  I <br>
wouldn't plant anything in certain cemeteries, like the ones that <br>
seem really well maintained.  And I wouldn't plant any thing near any <br>
of the grave sites or with clues that make people infringe on graves <br>
too much.  But, there are plenty of trees and places around the <br>
periphery that would be good sites.<br>
<br>
I'm mentally semi-planning a series of boxes for cemeteries that are <br>
in close proximity to Telegraph Road from 7 mile on down through <br>
Dearborn.... and maybe a few Downriver cemeteries where my relatives <br>
are buried.  Most of these places seem to be less maintained and <br>
visited.  If you believe in this sort of thing, maybe the occupants <br>
would appreciate some visitors!  Who knows.  I've heard a lot of <br>
people say they don't like the idea and prefer not to plant or search <br>
there.  But, I like looking at the tombstones.  I think as long as <br>
you're respectful of the graves and any mourners that happen to be <br>
there, it's fine.<br>
<br>
Double Dragon has a cemetery box somewhere in this area that houses <br>
one of my favorite stamp finds.  The clues are great and the stamp is <br>
awesome.  It's a mystery box, so I can't tell you much else.  But, <br>
it's fantastic.<br>
<br>
There seems to be a major void in the south eastern Oakland County <br>
area for planted boxes.  So, I hope you really enjoy the hobby and <br>
decide to start planting a ton of boxes in Southfield, Farmington, <br>
Royal Oak, etc!  LOL<br>

LOL Trail Tracker!  I was trying to encourage someone ELSE to plant <br>
boxes there!  I could eventually, but it's not in my immediate <br>
plans.  I have it in the back of my head somewhere, though.<br>
<br>
Here's a thought... go visit your family and plant some boxes for us <br>
locals while you're here!  ;)<br>
