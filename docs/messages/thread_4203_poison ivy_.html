June 26, 2007 - Watch out. <br>
This year's climate changes are making poison ivy more potent. <br>
Apparently, rising ambient carbon dioxide levels have created ideal conditions for the plant, making bigger leaves and oil that's even more irritating than usual. <br>
The Wall Street Journal suggests going to www.poison-ivy.org. The Web site offers cards with life-size images of the plant to help with identification.<br>

I had the misfortune of getting a nasty case of poison ivy already <br>
this year, last month.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, the rash appeared just a few days after staying at <br>
Poison Ivy's home on a letterboxing road trip.<br>
<br>
Coincidence? I have to wonder.....<br>
