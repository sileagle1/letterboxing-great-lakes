about 2 weeks.  My daughter's computer has decided to die...  yep, just <br>
in time for the last week of classes and finals.  So, i am taking my <br>
laptop to her tonight.  <br>
<br>
i will have some limited opportunities to check e-mail.<br>
If you happen to have my home or work e-mail, those will be more likely <br>
to be checked than say the AQ e-mail.<br>
<br>
this will be posted in multiple places that i frequent, so sorry if you <br>
see it more than once, but it's the only way i know how to do it. <br>
<br>
PPE  -doing what a Mom's got to do....  but, i might be able to snag a <br>
box on the way!<br>
