  Since it is now Thursday at 5:11, I was wondering what the results of the theme poll (which was supposed to close Wednesday at midnight) are?  I just can't handle the suspense anymore!!!<br/>

Sorry about the delay -- my e-mail address has been bouncing so I <br/>
couldn't reply.  I was waiting for my web host to get it straightened <br/>
out, but it's been a couple of days now...  So anyway, different e-<br/>
mail address for now.<br/>
<br/>
The winner is...  "Hometown Landmarks"<br/>
<br/>
The point of the Great Lakes Letterbox Exchange is to get the group <br/>
working on a joint project.  It is my experience that group projects <br/>
like this tend to be more successful and more easily recognized if <br/>
there is a central theme connecting it all together.  Because I <br/>
wanted to make this a group effort, and not just my project I put the <br/>
theme up for suggestion and vote instead of just mandating one.  <br/>
Understandably in a group with this many people, not everyone is <br/>
going to want the same theme, and the fairest way to do this is to <br/>
put it up for vote.  I would hope that the fact that your favorite <br/>
theme was not chosen will not keep anyone from playing, after all we <br/>
are all adults.  It is more about working on a joint project than <br/>
about the specific theme that was chosen.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  want to play?  See the next message for details on how to <br/>
get in on the fun.<br/>
