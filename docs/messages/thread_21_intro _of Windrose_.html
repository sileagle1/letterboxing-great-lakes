                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Welcome, Windrose. It's nice to see you here AND feeling <br/>
comfortable enough to introduce yourself. I, for one, like having a <br/>
bit of personal information about the people I "know" online. <br/>
<br/>
For one thing, it's just plain enjoyable for me to know someone <br/>
better.  Another thing is that it gives me ideas for either boxes, <br/>
or box placement. For example, it's great to know that you go boxing <br/>
and caching with two young grandkids. It's good to remember that not <br/>
everyone is into tortuous long hikes or obscure clues. <br/>
<br/>
Limited amount of time and small children means ... sometimes ya <br/>
just wanna get out to enjoy the natural world and have a little <br/>
cheap harmless fun along the way!<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you about the big list. But I stayed with it because <br/>
there was so much I still wanted to know! I'm grateful to Spring <br/>
Chick for starting this local list. I know how much work can go into <br/>
having a well run list.<br/>
<br/>
The geocaching vs letterboxing reminds me that those same kinds of <br/>
thing go on re: powerboaters vs sailboaters. You know, there's <br/>
enough room for all of us. It just comes down to being tolerant. <br/>
(And it never hurts to be a little more kind than necessary.)<br/>
<br/>
One more thing re: letterboxes being few and far between. <br/>
Do you remember that Kevin Costner movie, Field of Dreams? Well, <br/>
same thing for boxes.. if you place them, we will come. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
We're busy getting all the ones I had carved during the winter put <br/>
out before boating season really kicks off. <br/>
<br/>
I feel fortunate that Spring Chick and some others were as prolific <br/>
as they have been! Lots of boxes for me still to find over here in <br/>
West Mich.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
