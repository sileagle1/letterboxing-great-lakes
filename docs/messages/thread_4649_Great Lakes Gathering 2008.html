the year, so I figured we'd better nail down some of the logistics for<br/>
this year's Great Lakes Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this post is to solicit interested volunteers to host<br/>
the gathering, not to debate the date of the gathering.  As is<br/>
customary, the gathering will be held on the first Saturday after<br/>
Memorial Day, which is May 31, 2008.  The only two states that have<br/>
not yet hosted are Indiana and Minnesota so host volunteers from<br/>
either of those states have first chance.  If you are from IN or MN<br/>
and are interested in hosting the GLG Gathering on May 31, 2008, or<br/>
may be interested in working together with somebody else to host,<br/>
please contact me offlist by January 10.  If there is no interest from<br/>
either IN or MN by that date, I will open it up to anyone in the<br/>
region.  If there is interest from more than one person/state, it will<br/>
be put up for a vote in a poll.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, please let me know where you are from and the<br/>
general vicinity where you would plan to host the gathering -- i.e.<br/>
Minneapolis area, Indy area, SE IN, et.  You do not need to commit to<br/>
any specifics at this time (i.e. park, theme, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
If you are wondering what is involved in hosting the gathering, there<br/>
are a couple of documents in the files section of the list with an FAQ<br/>
and some basic info about hosting the gathering.  Additionally, I'm<br/>
sure you could post to the list or directly contact any of the<br/>
previous hosts (M&amp;8X &amp; Eagle Eyes, WI_Hiker &amp; Martini Man, Dragon,<br/>
Team Rabbit, SpringChick &amp; OldShoe) with questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
