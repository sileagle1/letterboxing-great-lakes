who "gets it" and one who doesn't.  The older already wants his own <br>
journal and found one very cool hiding spot.<br>
The other-well, he talked incessantly and was dragging a branch three <br>
times his size around. When I asked what he was doing, he said it was <br>
so he could "fight any wild animals that came" (you know we just have <br>
so many scary animals in Illinois-as if he could even lift the <br>
branch!).  "You mean all of the squirrels and rabbits that can hear <br>
you four miles away and are running and hiding now?"  Even his <br>
footsteps were noisy.  I'm sure that every living thing within a 6000 <br>
yard radius knew what we were doing.<br>
<br>
Even so, it was a great day.  Now tomorrow we're going hunting!<br>
