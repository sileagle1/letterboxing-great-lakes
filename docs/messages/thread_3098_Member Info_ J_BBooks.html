<br/>
Our trail name, J&amp;BBooks, stands for our names, Jen and Brad, and our <br/>
love of reading (we currently have six full bookcases in our house!). <br/>
Although there are two of us, we decided to use one signature stamp and <br/>
trail name because from the get-go we have treated letterboxing as <br/>
something to do together. In fact, neither of us has ever 'boxed <br/>
without the other!<br/>
<br/>
We live in Ann Arbor, MI and have done a lot of boxing in the area. We <br/>
just got back from a 10-day vacation out east, and picked up <br/>
letterboxes in OH, PA, NY, CT, and MA. (More about that on our blog <br/>
when we have the time to update it!) We discovered letterboxing in June <br/>
of 2005. The LBNA site was a Yahoo link of the day. I read the <br/>
description, thought it sounded fun, and forwarded it to B. That night, <br/>
we carved our first stamp (out of an eraser) and headed out to our <br/>
first box, despite the fact that it was rainy and buggy out. We were <br/>
hooked immediately and have been happily boxing ever since! We have <br/>
only planted three boxes at this point, but hope to increase that. I <br/>
think we have found around 270 or so? Clearly, we like finding more <br/>
than planting! But that is one of the beauties of this hobby, you can <br/>
really participate in whatever way you most enjoy. And we love <br/>
gatherings... and hope to meet some more new people at the MI fall <br/>
mystery gathering! <br/>
