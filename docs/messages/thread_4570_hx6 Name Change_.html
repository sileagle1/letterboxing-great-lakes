  Thanks for the uppercase T! Even though I learned the correct pronunciation in Iowa, I still had it stuck in my head a different way.<br>

LOL  I like the 6th of Hearts idea, too.<br>
<br>
Or, you could be Hart to the 6th<br>
<br>
I don't know how to type the little 2 so it ends up above the last <br>
letter of your name, though...  But your stamp could be <br>
"Hart^6"  (picture the 6 above the t) or a picture of a heart with <br>
the 6 slight above and to the right of it.<br>
<br>
It's funny how some trail names seems to obvious to us, but to <br>
others, the obvious meaning/pronunciation is completely <br>
different.  Without OlsenTrio's punctuation change, I had it <br>
pronounced completely different in my head.  Ol Sentrio or Olsent <br>
Rio.  LOL  Now that I see how it should be, I can't believe I didn't get it!<br>

I was surprised at my first gathering to hear people ask me how to <br>
pronounce it, seeing as how I obviously already knew how  =)  Having <br>
Olsen spelled with an "e" doesn't really help the matter either, since <br>
most Olsens are spelled with an "o". <br>

With Hart as a family name, there's a load of options.  Creative people have a difficult time limiting themselves to just one design or one visual form of their trail name.  Fungus Woman changes her personal stamp annually.  Great idea!  I've decided to do the same for variety and the freedom to change my stamp when the creative inspiration hits me.    <br>
<br>
So, permission granted to you...change the way you write your trail name.  You have between now and Jan. 1 to come up with your 'new look' for 2008.  We know who you are - The Harts.<br>

Funny you should reply to this string again . . . I thought it was  dead.<br>
 <br>
I have been going through a personal crisis of sorts with this hobby. I  love <br>
this hobby and I will never give it up, however, the honeymoon is  definitely <br>
over.<br>
 <br>
I've noticed over the course of the last 6 to 8 weeks that I'm just not as  <br>
excited as I once was. I think this is in large part to my over ambitious  <br>
nature... when I get hooked on something I go FULL throttle. <br>
 <br>
For example, our one year anniversary is next week (Nov. 25th), our counts  <br>
are P 64 F 243 X 83.<br>
 <br>
I currently am in the middle of carving my 100th stamp!!<br>
 <br>
I guess I'm a bit burned out, I never thought it would happen with  <br>
letterboxing though. Perhaps some of you seasoned veterans of the hobby can give  some <br>
words of encouragement.<br>
 <br>
I figured with any addiction you have to raise the risk factor to get the  <br>
same thrill you once did... so tonight while driving to Oregon, Illinois for  <br>
work I decided to find Pastors Wife's "John Deere Plow" in the dark during  <br>
hunting season!! There were signs everywhere saying the park was closed due to  <br>
the fact that hunters could bag a deer or two. Don't worry.... no one shot at  <br>
me, though in the dark I may or may not look like a deer.<br>
 <br>
Beetle, with a last name like Hart there are many options... I will forgo  <br>
the 2nd grade humor though ;-)<br>
I have no problem with changing my signature stamp... though changing our  <br>
trail name seems to be a little bit of a snag to me.<br>
 <br>
I don't know if I draw to much of my boxing "identity" from our trail name  <br>
or the tape I may have to cut through on LBNA and AQ to change my trailname. I  <br>
must say though, I am very intrigued by "6 of Harts" that you recommended and <br>
I  have even sketched out a few possibilities for signature stamp images <br>
going on  that name.<br>
 <br>
Sorry for the long, rambling Email, just kinda down I  guess.<br>

as much as we did in 2005 and 2006. I think it was a combination of <br>
being slightly burned out on boxing and both of us being very into <br>
other hobbies this year, as well. Does it mean that we have given up <br>
on letterboxing? No, just taking a slight breather. Maybe the winter <br>
months would be a good time to take one yourself? I think it is worth <br>
it, because by this fall, both B and I were eager to hit the trails <br>
again!<br>
