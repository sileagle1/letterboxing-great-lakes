Hey SpringChick, I was wondering if we were going to revive this Group<br>
Project for this coming tourist season?<br>
<br>
I was looking through my list of box locations, and think I have quite<br>
a few that fit the criteria you had listed last year.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do not plan to revisit the Letterboxing 'Round the Lake series idea.  I have learned a lot about letterboxing in the past year and my respect for the game has grown tremendously.  I do not think the kind of publicity that had been planned for this series would be in keeping with the spirit of letterboxing.  At the time, letterboxing was in its infancy in many areas around Lake Michigan and I thought such a series would be a fun way to possibly attract new participants.  During the past year, 'boxing has picked up considerably in these areas and rather than concentrate on attracting new 'boxers and just handing them clues, I would rather focus my attention on improving the quality of the game in the area where I have impact by creating quality boxes and clues and challenging people to a more advanced level of play.  At one time West Michigan had a reputation for "awesome boxes" and it was on every serious letterboxer's list of "places I must go 'boxing."  I would like to see that renown reclaimed.<br>
<br>
I certainly think it is a cool idea and am tossing around ideas for an alternative project in which something similar would be featured, just not publicly available.<br>
