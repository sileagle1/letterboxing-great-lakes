<br>
I've been working on putting together the clues, but also wanted to <br>
post some additional info re: checklists, nearby stores and a possible <br>
pre- and post-event get-together.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, anyone that does not have, and does not plan to <br>
purchase, a WI annual park sticker should print the .pdf certificate <br>
from the website.  The certificate will allow you to pay only a $3/car <br>
fee, rather than $7/$10.  Remember that Sunday will be a "free" day <br>
since it is the State Parks Open House day.<br>
<br>
Here's a link to the checklist and certificate:<br>
