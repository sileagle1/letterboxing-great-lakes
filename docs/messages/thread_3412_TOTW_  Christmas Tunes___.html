HEY!  That was me yesterday!  Too funny.  Actually, I'm not at work <br>
today because they're putting a new furnace in, so the boss closed the office.<br>
<br>
So, my list has to top off with The Little Drummer Boy (Bob Segar <br>
version), Carol of the Bells (although I hate it because it stays in <br>
my head for hours) and Do They Know It's Christmas?<br>

I find myself humming and singing this song throughout the Christmas season.  "We're simply having a wonderful Christmastime...."  <br>
<br>
Happy Xmas (War Is Over), By John Lennon is another good contemporary song, but I just can't stand listening to Yoko's screeching.  I prefer that song sung by other artists.   <br>
<br>
And, to show you how vast my appreciation for music is, my favorite Christmas CD is:   Holiday Sing Along With Mitch   By Mitch Miller<br>
What a classic sound!  I grew up watching Mitch Miller and The Gang on TV.  I have two copies of the album (complete with song sheets inside), but last year I actually found the album on CD!  I couldn't believe that it was available.  No song sheets inside however.  <br>
<br>
So....the million dollar question is....what are you up to?  Are you producing "Spring Chick and The Letterboxers Favorite Sounds of The Christmas"?<br>
If the answer is yes, then my next question is, how do I get a copy?  Will it be available through Best Buy?  I can't wait to hear it on the radio.  <br>

Oh,  this will be hard to narrow down.  Every year, my son & husband <br>
give me a new Christmas CD so I have lots to choose from!!  But my all-<br>
time favorites would have to be:<br>
<br>
<br>
~~O Come, O Come, Emmanuel--like the tune and the words<br>
<br>
~~The 8 Polish Foods of Christmas--by VeggieTales (although the entire <br>
CD is pretty funny--esp. all the commentary between songs)<br>
<br>
~~What Child is This--I've always loved that tune<br>
<br>
~~Carol of the Bells--I play in our church's handbell choir and would <br>
just love it if our director would pick this some year (I played it in <br>
college and it sounded really great)<br>
<br>
~~Mary, Did You Know? (by Mark Lowry)--I really like the idea behind <br>
the lyrics:  Did Mary really know that her Son would grow up to calm <br>
storms and heal the sick and raise the dead--and die for her (and our) <br>
sins.  Last year, our Sunday School acted out the scenes from this song <br>
while I took pictures.  We put the pictures to the music to create a <br>
music video.  Very moving--lots of crying moms when we showed it.<br>
<br>
~~One King (by Point of Grace)--"One king held the frankincense, One <br>
king held the myrrh, One king held the purest gold, One King held the <br>
hope of the world"--Beautiful song.<br>
<br>
~~Jolly Old St. Nicholas--the only song my sister can still play on the <br>
piano.  As soon as she gets to my folk's house for Christmas, she sits <br>
down and plays it--so I like it for the family tradition.<br>

You beat me to it -- those are my favorites too. And "Personent hodie".<br>
<br>
"In the Bleak Midwinter" is so hauntingly lovely. I love to sing it, I love to listen to it.<br>

<br>
The Little Drummer Boy is my favorite Christmas song.  A couple of <br>
years ago I put together a CD of 19 different versions/artists singing <br>
the Little Drummer Boy -- OldShoe, who is not one to play a song he <br>
especially likes over and over again, just cringed when I played it -- <br>
now I just listen to it in the car once in a while when he is not <br>
around.  The Bob Segar version is one of my favorites, along with the <br>
versions with Bing Crosby & David Bowie, Johnny Cash & Neil Young and <br>
the Joan Jett version.<br>
<br>
A few other songs I would have to include -- "O Holy Night" (not <br>
partial to any particular version), Emerson, Lake & Palmer's " I <br>
Believe in Father Christmas," John Lennon's "So This is Christmas" <br>
and "Happy Christmas (War is Over)" -- until this year the Neil <br>
Diamond version was my favorite, but the Sarah McLachlan version on <br>
her new Christmas CD, Wintersong, is giving him a run for his money.<br>
<br>
And just for fun...  "Snoopy's Christmas" by the Royal Guardsmen <br>
and "Nuttin' for Christmas" -- the version of this song I had as a kid <br>
was done by the Blue Jean Singers, but I have not been able to find <br>
that version, at least not a worthy copy.  The Barry Gordon remake is <br>
pretty close.<br>
<br>
As for instrumental, "A Carol for Alex" by Wind Machine, "Jenna's <br>
Dance" by Paul Cardall and "Angels in the Snow" by David Arkenstone <br>
would have to be there.<br>
<br>
To round it off, anything by Trans-Siberian Orchestra or Mannheim <br>
Steamroller.<br>
<br>
Can you tell I love Christmas music?  I make a holiday mix every year -<br>
- I will have to check out some of the music suggested by other <br>
posters here for this year's CD.  I really like the song, "In the <br>
Bleak Midwinter," but haven't found a version that blows me away (yet).<br>
