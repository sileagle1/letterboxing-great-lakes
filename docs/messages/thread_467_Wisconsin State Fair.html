I'm just running out the door, so I'll have to get back to you tomorrow about good quick <br>
boxes in the area, but I just wanted to check in on the bouncing.<br>
<br>
I moderate over on the "big list" and I saw your name on the bounce list. I sent you <br>
another reactivation request. (Which I'm sure you've already seen and done.)<br>
<br>
Are you close to your mailbox quota? If so, you may need to delete old messages you no <br>
longer need. It seems odd that you'd be full, since mailbox quotas are pretty large these <br>
days, but it could happen if you get a lot of mail. (Your trash and bulk folders don't count <br>
toward your quota, FYI.)<br>
<br>
As for the spam getting through, yeah -- I get a lot of stuff that doesn't get dumped into <br>
the bulk folder, too. (Which went up by about 75% once I started moderating, oh joy!) <br>
Spammers (grumble, grumble).<br>
<br>
Let me know if you have any questions about the bouncing.<br>

weekends). Arab World Fest -- which is a lot of fun -- is this weekend. I don't know if <br>
they're using the island or not, but you may want to take that into consideration while <br>
planning boxes.<br>

Also -- if you're worried about keeping your non-boxing husband entertained, the <br>
Squished Pennies and Watery Grave boxes are down in Wauwatosa's village, which has <br>
some pubs, restaurants and shops within 2-3 of blocks of the areas where the boxes are. <br>
He could easily keep himself occupied while you hunt your treasure. :-)<br>
