There are just over 110 days to go untill GLG and as hosts we have been<br>
pretty quiet.  Here is an update so you all know what is going on and<br>
how to plan.<br>
<br>
If you don't have a campsite at the Dunes, chances are that you will not<br>
be able to get one.   As of this morning there were 2 campsites left for<br>
the weekend of June 14 to 16th.   I did say that they go fast...for<br>
alternative campsites you can camp in the National Lakeshore <br>
www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm<br>
<http://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/campgrounds.htm>   These are1st<br>
come/1st serve sites, no reservations  $15/day Credit/Debit Only. <br>
Please review the lodging information pdf for more information and a<br>
listing of some hotels in the area.  Also once you know your lodging<br>
information you can edit the Database to add it in for all.<br>
<br>
We also are in need of a few more carvers/stamps.   Stamps should be<br>
mailed no later than mid May so we have them prior to June 1. Please<br>
limit the size to fit on a 3x5 index card. Please contact us<br>
individually if you intend to carve so we can maintain a master list and<br>
avoid duplication.  Also, please indicate if you want your stamp back.<br>
<br>
The itenerary has yet to be set in stone, however expect it within the<br>
next few weeks.  Also if anyone is interested in hosting a Friday night<br>
event, there is a shelter in the campground that doesn't require<br>
reservations.  I can inquire with the park ranger if we can use it that<br>
evening.<br>
