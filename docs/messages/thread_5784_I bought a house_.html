(This is related to letterboxing.)<br>
<br>
I've been a little busy buying a house lately... which was not fun, due to weird economic situations like Central States Mortgage closing.<br>
<br>
Anyway...without trying to spoil anything, I found a certain WiHi and Martini Man box a long while ago. In the logbook I wrote about what a nice Milwaukee Neighborhood it was in. Recently, searching online for homes, I found a house listed in that very neighborhood and bought it!<br>
<br>
You just never know where the hobby of letterboxing will take you.<br>
<br>
Thanks WiHi & Martini Man for bringing me to the neighborhood! And thanks Aimlesst, Musical Muggles and Punxygal for reminding me of my logbook entry. :)<br>

That would've made for a cool housewarming present.<br>
