Perhaps this box was destined to be washed away--isn't aquarius <br>
associated with water??  :~)<br>

OK, now that I have replaced the two missing boxes from my "River Fauna"<br>
series, I was able to do some checking elsewhere today and found that "Signs<br>
of the Zodiac: Capricorn" is gone, apparently the victim of an overzealous<br>
burn-and-clear campaign by the county conservation department. I will get it<br>
recarved soon and hidden in a hopefully safer location.<br>
<br>
Also, "Signs of the Zodiac: Aquarius" had been washed away by the<br>
early-April flooding in this area. You'd think I would have learned my<br>
lesson since it was FIRST washed away last August, and I went right ahead<br>
and replaced it in the very same place last fall. But now I do believe I may<br>
just have finally wised up, and today NamVet and I rehid Aquarius III in a<br>
higher, dryer place and updated the clues.<br>

strewn about the area.<br>
