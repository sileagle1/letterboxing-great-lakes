Howdy Girls signed up, a quick Email and response secured a ride with <br>

My package never hit the mail, I'll be bringing it in person!!<br>

I'm thrilled to be able to attend, thanks Howdy Girls for your <br>

He's been praying too hard for rain ... we're going to get inundated on Saturday!!!" What a relief to see that "rain" isn't the reason you are able to come!!<br>
<br>
Be sure to check out Chris' website (www.mothkovich.com/boaf.htm) for the latest.  There's a box to pick up on your way into MacQueen!  And ... bring mosquito repellant!<br>

headed off to scout camp EARLY Sunday morning for a week as a leader <br>
for Barrel's troop, it seems fitting I step in sooner rather than later <br>
to express our thanks, too, to the whole crew, from the planners and <br>
families who organized this event with finesse, to all those who carved <br>
such great stamps to be found, to everyone who came to find the great <br>
boxes.  As usual, we were awed and amazed by the creativity in this <br>
group, both in carving and hiding, and are ever inspired to see how we <br>
might help to push the envelope of this already creative hobby.  We met <br>
nowhere near everyone out there that day and look forward to yet <br>
another event when we have a chance to meet more of you all!  Thanks <br>
for yet another great LB memory!<br>
