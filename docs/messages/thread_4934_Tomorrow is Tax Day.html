<br>
I just wanted to send a quick reminder to everyone that tomorrow is <br>
April 15th, Tax Day.  As a reminder, contributions that you made to the <br>
March of Dimes in 2007 are deductable charitable contributions.  Now is <br>
also a good time to get a jump on your deductions for your 2008 taxes <br>
and make a contribution today!!  Making online donations is easy, just <br>
click the link below and click on make a donation.  Last year our team <br>
raised over $1700 and we hope to beat that this year, $0.90 of every <br>
dollar goes to the programs supported by the March.  Take some time <br>
today to help adorable babies.<br>
