                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there!<br/>
I'm working on setting up my blog site.  I'd love to post some <br/>
sites/blogs of other letterboxers in this region.  I don't want to <br/>
just go randomly adding links of sites without permission though.<br/>
<br/>
So, does anyone have a blog or link they'd allow me to list as a <br/>
link?  There are a lot of great sites out here, I'd love to post them!<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you have any great website resources that you use for boxing <br/>
(even if it's not your personal site) that you'd like to share, <br/>
please pass those along as well.<br/>
<br/>
You can email me personally, rather than posting to the list, to keep <br/>
the mail volume down.  baliddle@sbcglobal.net<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

Hey did you ever get that LB where your knome is? The Rabbits and I <br/>
went there before the gathering to look for the Lake Erie Creature and <br/>
think that it was missing. You know anything about it? I think it is <br/>
in the same park, you know I think I forgot to post those finds on the <br/>
way down and email all those wonderful boxers about there boxes, bad,m <br/>
bad, bad. Well any who was it expensive to have this blog site and was <br/>
it hard to put up? Could anyone do this? I would like to use something <br/>
like this for an interesting LB but I really don't want to pay alot o' <br/>
money.<br/>
