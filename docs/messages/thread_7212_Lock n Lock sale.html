I sawthe post below on the Texas LB board and immediately went to check<br/>
out the link.  I ordered the approximately 4"x6" container size and got<br/>
NINETEEN of them for only $23 (which INCLUDED shipping)!<br/>
<br/>
I thought some of you might also be interested, so here is the post from<br/>
the Texas board.<br/>

2. Durability<br/>
It has passed the KEMTI`s bending test. The container and the wing were fixed to the bending test machine and bent 3,000,000 times 80 degrees left to right. If the container were to be used 10 times a day, it could be used for 821 years(semi-permanently).<br/>
Durability of Lock and Lock is safe for change of temperature from -4F to 210F. It makes Lock and Lock available for use in the microwave, freezer and dishwasher.<br/>
<snip><br/>
<br/>
...and noticed the "-4F".  I suppose only a few hardcore folks might be out at that temperature (we have been known...), but if it is very cold it would be a good idea to warm up the hinges before trying to open the box.  Otherwise the tabs might just break off.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think I've posted this before, but it bears repeating.  We use similar (albeit more rigid plastic with actual hinged flaps, not just molded like LnL's)boxes as anaerobic chambers at work.  The instructions say to always open or close opposite ends simultaneously (i.e., both long flaps then both short flaps) rather than one at a time in random order or going around the box.  This prevents torquing and missealing (is that a word?  you know what I mean...) of the lid.<br/>
