have been a collector of many things for 40+ years. Now it is time to <br/>
let go, so we're having an Estate/Garage sale on Aug. 17 &amp; 18 (Fri. &amp; <br/>
Sat.) I will carve a stamp for this sale. I will also have the <br/>
Traveling Garage Sale Stamp from Dragon and Gone Garage Saling from <br/>
morel Belle's sale a few weeks ago. You're all welcome to come stamp in <br/>
and have some fun with us. I will list the stamp soon and it should <br/>
have a map in it. <br/>
