stamp carving is for the non-artistic type. I use the computer to get <br/>
my images, either from clip art or just altering regular images (like <br/>
combining a camera and butterfly for my stamp). I guess actually <br/>
creating the image and getting it on to the stamp material is the <br/>
hardest part. Once it is on there, all you do is take away what you <br/>
don't want. Don't rush and if there are parts that might be harder to <br/>
carve, start with those first.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck! If you need any help, I'm sure you can find one of us from <br/>
the area to help you out!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Here's a good spot to find links to lots of carving related sites:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/links/?id=77<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has their individual preferences, but you might want to start with<br/>
a Speedball Stamp Carving kit (available at Michael's Craft stores &amp; don't<br/>
forget the 40% off coupon in Sunday paper if you have them in your area).<br/>
That will give you some tools (#1 blade seems to be most popular) and some<br/>
carving media.  If you want to start out really basic you can use a rubber<br/>
eraser and an x-acto blade.  (I now prefer the x-acto blade.)<br/>
<br/>
You can get your design images from anything - draw something, use clipart,<br/>
copy/modify a neat graphic from some other print media, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I've personally had the best luck transferring an image by making a<br/>
photocopy of my drawing/image, then cutting around the image on the copy<br/>
paper, placing it upside down on the carving media and using a cotton ball<br/>
soaked in nail polish remover  to "pat" the paper.  Doing this transfers the<br/>
toner from the paper to the carving rubber.  To use this method you must<br/>
start with something that has toner (copy machine or laser printer, NOT an<br/>
inkjet printer),<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
