VPB&amp;AF----MAJOR thanks for this AWESOME time, planning, efforts, and success of the entire weekend. This was a great park, lots of trails(many of which were shaded) The pool would have been wonderful, but the screaming number of 80 was on our minds 24-7. The potluck was delicious, and the trail snacks were a treat to take with. But I cannot believe we(shorty and pitties) missed the group picture! Literally we finished eating after 5 minutes, everyone still coming in, eating, stamp, spread out. Go for box #1 we missed earlier for 6 minutes(at which we heard 2 applause) and get back to looking like we left it, everyone at their table, spread out, eating.... We Missed the Picture! We've have Never missed it... But I guess the plus side, we have left Wisconsin with exactly **95** finds! And tiredly WiHi, MM, this number does not include your boxes, we will have to revisit with more energy, x5 lol! Continuing... The Campgrounds were great(P.S. my Camping with<br/>
 Shorty IS a permanent box, and will stay there as long as it last for returners, although many of you did get it), its fun to camp in the same place as all of these boxes, and the Weather was Perfect! Not too hot, trails were shaded, and the breeze(the saying is, "Pits Up!")  And<br/>

ALL<br/>

of the carvers(ALL too of which were SO great!), contributors, helpers, planners, finders, ect did an excellent job at making this a great success. <br/>

I had a great time yesterday and a fun morning doing another loop today. I'm stiff and sore, and my gimpy knee is still complaining about doing so much work, but I had a great weekend. Extra special thanks to Speedsquare, Mr. Speedsquare and TrailTroll for the loan of a walking pole, driving to and from the pool, keeping my water cold, and being fabulous company through the day and at dinner.<br/>
Maybe next year I won't do anything silly and not wrench/dislocate my knee two days before the GLG.<br/>
Fabulous event, great site, and excellent company!<br/>

I really wanted to come back on Sunday for more, but I was so sore I could hardly walk, and after a short visit to the zoo with my husband (The Duke) he ended up in the hospital ER with what I thought at the time was a stroke (turned out, we think, it was low blood sugar).  So we went back to the hotel &amp; stayed in for the rest of the day &amp; left for home early Monday.  Didn't do too bad, we finished the 2 longest trails for 35, plus stamps at Brigham Park &amp; a couple local churches.  Had a great time boxing Friday nigh &amp; Saturday.  Didn't get to meet very many people, though, &amp; only saw a couple on the Smurf &amp; TV trails.  We were alone most of the day.<br/>
