exchange student from Brazil, Brazilian Babe, and my hubby, The Lighthouse Guy.<br/>
<br/>
This will be their first event and we are excited.  I can't find the <br/>
directions to the restaurant.  Would someone be so kind as to mail them again, so that <br/>
I can print them out?<br/>
<br/>
How many boxes are hidden just for the event?<br/>
<br/>
I just talked to Dumpster Diva.  She is in art class in CA, and will be <br/>
coming home today.  She's pretty jealous that she can't attend.  Can you say, <br/>
PRIORITIZE?<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to be talking to my husband and son about coming up with a team <br/>
name.  Should we come up with one for our whole family?  Or should just the guys <br/>
come up with one?  I already have the name TEAM JoJo with Dumpster Diva.  I <br/>
had no clue my family would finally come around and see the fine art of LBXing.<br/>
Looking to seeing everyone,<br/>
