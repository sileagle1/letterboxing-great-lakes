                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spent yesterday carving stamps for my son, Pokemon Perry, my foreign <br>
exchange student from Brazil, Brazilian Babe, and my hubby, The Lighthouse Guy.<br>
<br>
This will be their first event and we are excited.  I can't find the <br>
directions to the restaurant.  Would someone be so kind as to mail them again, so that <br>
I can print them out?<br>
<br>
How many boxes are hidden just for the event?<br>
<br>
I just talked to Dumpster Diva.  She is in art class in CA, and will be <br>
coming home today.  She's pretty jealous that she can't attend.  Can you say, <br>
PRIORITIZE?<br>
<br>
I'm going to be talking to my husband and son about coming up with a team <br>
name.  Should we come up with one for our whole family?  Or should just the guys <br>
come up with one?  I already have the name TEAM JoJo with Dumpster Diva.  I <br>
had no clue my family would finally come around and see the fine art of LBXing.<br>
Looking to seeing everyone,<br>
