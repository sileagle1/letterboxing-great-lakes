I'll update the map sometime this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate a MI native helping out.  I have also helped out in MI.  <br/>
Last year I noticed there were only 2 boxless counties in the U.P., so <br/>
in July 2005 I decided to plant boxes in those locations when we <br/>
traveled up there.  I thought it was fun to "complete" that area and it <br/>
is what got me interested in trying to get a box in all the WI counties <br/>
(a much more daunting task).  I've been very happy with my decision to <br/>
publicize the mission, because as a group project we have made great <br/>
progress!<br/>
<br/>
Only 15 counties left.....<br/>

LOL ... just kidding, that's cool that you were able to get out <br/>
place some boxes.  You know, we're ALL going to be winners because <br/>
the race to cover WI and MI counties means there will be more boxes <br/>
for all of us to find in the Great Lakes area.<br/>
<br/>
So the standings are: MI and WI are now TIED ... with each state <br/>
have 15 counties needing a box placed. <br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>

Hmmmmm...  I thought MI only needed 14 counties.  I think you're still in<br/>
the lead!   (but for how long????)<br/>
