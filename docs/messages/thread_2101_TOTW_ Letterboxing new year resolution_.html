My only real goals are to get a bunch of boxes set up this winter for<br>
planting this summer. I'm always much more motivated to find than carve in<br>
the summer.<br>

Right now, I'm still sitting on the story (half done) type clues for<br>
about 20 boxes that Mrs DogLvrs and I placed at Clear Springs Nature<br>
Center (Montague, MI - near the Henderson Lake area) last summer! <br>
<br>
What's worse, is that this isn't the first time I've had boxes placed<br>
and didn't post the clues for a long time. Twice, it ended up that<br>
other boxers placed very near the ones I already had out there ... but<br>
hey, how could they KNOW ... I hadn't posted any clues! SHAME ON ME!<br>

stranger than fiction.....<br>

In the interest of fairness and full disclosure.....<br>
I have not been influenced by either<br>
(1) Bingo Mojo (which sounds way too cool for me to even know about!)<br>
or<br>
(2) The Letterboxing Fairy (whom I would probably like to meet)<br>
<br>
Thanks to the latest batch of Bingo side-wager players.<br>
<br>
Dates submitted so far have reflected everything from birthdays, to<br>
various official and unofficial holidays, and everything inbetween.<br>
And the range is extreme!<br>
