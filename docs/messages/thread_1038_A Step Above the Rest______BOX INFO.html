Today while in Ottawa at a breakfast get-together, I stopped by and <br/>
checked on A Step Above the Rest.....it had been found and <br/>
destroyed.  It's hiding space was turned over, the contents of the <br/>
box were gone, and the lid to the box was about 30 yards up the <br/>
trail.  I have temporarily pulled and am debating whether or not to <br/>
replace it.  Thanks to all who had stamped in the now lost logbook.<br/>
