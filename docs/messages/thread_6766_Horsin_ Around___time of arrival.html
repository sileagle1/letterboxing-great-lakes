is usually a group picture scheduled but hey, if you miss it, we'll just <br/>
take your picture when you make it back to the shelterhouse!  The most <br/>
important activity is the BOXING (although some might say the socializing, <br/>
and NamVet would certainly say the eating).<br/>

Just come when you can ... we're planning for the potluck lunch at 12:00 and will have a group photo taken at that time.<br/>
<br/>
Someone will be at the shelter the entire day, so we'll just be happy to have you there!<br/>
