<br/>
But for all those letterboxers who just 'need' to find a box and don't have a boxing partner, my heart goes out to them.  Tonight just before the sun went down, I was planting boxes.  Then, I posted the clues for this new series on AQ tonight.  Also, I did some investigative work.  Hmmm....where to plant this next box?  The search proved to be successful.  More boxes to come.  <br/>
