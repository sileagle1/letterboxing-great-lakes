first when I saw that we (MN) missed out on getting to<br>

forward to the 12  hour drive to Ohio I am looking<br>
forward to something very special that Ohio has to<br>

realized a few days ago that Ohio has the best<br>
amusement park in the country for roller coaster<br>
fanatics such as myself. That's right, Cedar Point in<br>
Sandusky! I am now overjoyed at the 12 hour drive to<br>
get to Ohio. Of course I'm looking forward to the<br>
gathering, but WOOHOO! Cedar Point!<br>

enjoy coaster such as Shivering Timbers, Wolverine Wildcat, and the good ol' <br>
Corkscrew but there is no way I'm gonna get on anything called Magnum XL-200 <br>
or Top Thrill Dragster!!!<br>
<br>
Now...here's a thought - anybody like Rock and Roll better than coasters?<br>
'Cause I know I could go to the Hall of Fame about 100 more times!<br>
Two pre-gathering gathers?!?  Say it isn't so!!  : )<br>

out there. I better start looking for some ideas so I<br>
can carve and event stamp. It will definetely be a big<br>
one (those of you I met this summer know how I love<br>
large stamps) I'm thinking at least a 4x6 block of<br>
Mastercarve, maybe larger? He He He. I will keep<br>
everyone in the loop as the months go by.<br>

The two shelter houses in the "below dam area" have been reserved. <br>

I see, by the group messages, that we have people attending.<br>

I couldn't agree more on the "Circle" stamp. Any<br>

Hi!<br>
<br>
We'll be part of the "hotel group", but would love to stop by the <br>
campground Friday and/or Saturday evening to join the rest of you!<br>
<br>
We'll also each make a box and will plant it ourselves when we get <br>
there, sometime before the gathering.  Martini Man would like to do <br>
a "Buddy Holly" box and I would like to do a "James Dean" box.<br>

Or perhaps, since I plan to just sleep in my van (I don't own a tent and prefer a mattress I put in my van)... I'm wondering if I could "share" a campsite with someone on Fri night?  I just need a single outlet for an extension chord to a light and heater/fan.<br>

Can you tell I'm still undecided? LOL<br>

Ask away!  There are several new boxers on the list who have never been to a gathering.  And the annual gathering is bigger than most of the local gatherings usually drawing in 100+ so even those who have been to smaller gatherings may have similar questions.<br>

I'd also be willing to answer any questions, on-list or off.<br>
<br>
Here's some info I posted in an FAQ section for last year's regional<br>
gathering:<br>
<br>
<br>
I've never been to a Gathering before.  What should I expect?<br>
<br>
* Friendly folks - Don't be shy, just walk up and say hi!<br>
* Tasty food<br>
* Lots of boxes, some will be WOM boxes (Word of Mouth) so stay alert<br>
for verbal hints, unusual questions or clues that get distributed in<br>
ways other than the clue booklet.<br>
<br>
*  More tips can be found here:.<br>

The only thing that still comes to mind is about bringing boxes with <br>
me.  I know not to bring HHs, and that there will be lots of cooties <br>
and PTs.  But what about other letterboxes that I might want to bring <br>
with me?  For example, a postal that has returned home and still has <br>
room, or a box that is ready but not yet planted?  Do they all need to <br>
be on the theme of the gathering or can I bring others that I might <br>
want to share?  <br>
<br>
I'm sure more will come to mind, but right now I'm going to bed.<br>
<br>
Ooooh!  I just thougth of something!  Do we get to wear 50s costumes?!  <br>
Can't you just picture me out letterboxing in a forest preserve in a <br>
poodle skirt and saddle oxfords?<br>
