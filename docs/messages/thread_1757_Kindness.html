Ummm, Nope! They dislike the new and improved Scheherezade quite a bit.<br>
<br>
The old one use to dote on them all day and night, trailing after<br>
them, picking up every little crumb they dropped, singing and dancing<br>
for them. Never ending attentive devotion. Cleaning house like a mad<br>
woman, writing love letters all over, even on them. <br>
<br>
New Scheherezade, loves Letterboxes toooo much and the house is a<br>
wreck, and I sing songs to my stamps, to tupperware and love songs to<br>
my computer when it delivers me a new e-mail.<br>
<br>
I am a doomed woman, teetering on the brink of Letterboxing insanity.<br>
Has anyone ever lost custody of their husband and daughter because of<br>
Letterboxing???<br>
<br>
Well, I am off to try to learn the art of balance!<br>

Are you REALLY sure you can't make it to the Haunted Harvest Gathering,<br>
where "We're planning a gathering of those who are "possessed" by<br>
uncontrollable inner voices urging them on in an endless quest for hidden<br>
boxes. "?  It seems like the perfect place for you...<br>
<br>
We'd LOVE to have you give a workshop on creating customized logbooks!<br>

Hey Scheherezade,<br>
I'm so glad you have found a hobby that gets you excited and out! <br>
<br>
There is a current book called "A Treasure Trove" that has been on the <br>
market since November.  13 jewels were hiddend around the USA and the <br>
last one was found last weekend at Newaygo State Park.  The man who <br>
made the book was a follower of Kit Williams and decided if he ever had <br>
the time, he would do one.  Well, he made a boatload of money on <br>
Software, so when he retired at 50, he wrote this fairy tale, self <br>
published it and commissioned $1 million of jewels.  I have enjoyed it <br>
alot and what is very strange is few letterboxers have participated <br>
(lots of those geo people) and few on the Trove talk groups have even <br>
heard of letterboxing.  Oh, well - details about it are at <br>
