I have some files on my yahoogroup, about the various carving<br/>
materials that you might be interested in.  Here is the link to the<br/>
homepage of the yahoogroup:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Letterboxing_Bindlestiff/<br/>
Go to "files" (on the left side of your screen) <br/>
then select "supplies"<br/>
You will find two files of interest:<br/>
1. Carving Material experiments - with personal opinion reviews <br/>
2. Carving Material Types - and cost comparions of alternative<br/>
products to PZ-kut<br/>
<br/>
Also, my daughter, Jade (formerly known as Enders Angel) really likes<br/>
the soft, smooth, easy way that Speedy-Cut carves. However, it doesn't<br/>
do well with fine detail and it doesn't hold up under heavy use. That<br/>
doesn't mean it's not a viable option for learning to carve on,<br/>
though. We've found that mounting it extends the life by a long-shot.<br/>
(I have a picture trail site with a mounting tutorial using cheap<br/>
materials that's easy to follow; if you're interested)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to hear you're backing down on you initial excitement and plans<br/>
for carving. When I stumbled onto letterboxing, I was so excited I<br/>
couldn't wait to begin!  I found an eraser in my studio and hacked out<br/>
my first stamp with a steak knife. (Boy did it look like it, too! LOL)<br/>
I placed that box (Kent Trails letterbox) the very next morning.  When<br/>
the box went missing after a year, I re-carved the stamp to be very<br/>
similar to the original in order to give hope and inspiration to new<br/>
carvers. I'll throw a copy of the image up in the photos section (look<br/>
in the misc album) so you can compare it to things I've carved more<br/>
recently. I find it amazing that ~I~ have come so far.<br/>
<br/>
Geez oh pizza, everyone starts somewhere. I don't see the sense in<br/>
being ashamed or embarrassed about the beginning of any journey,<br/>
artistic or otherwise. <br/>

have the patience for uber-fine details, so I don't really mind a<br/>
slightly softer material. My advice is to go ahead and try a couple of<br/>
different materials if you can to see which you like best.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now the more important question for you is, did you get the white<br/>
speedy-cut or the pink speedy-cut? Most people don't like the white<br/>
stuff as it tends to be crumbly (a property I have used in a few<br/>
carvings to my advantage). I used the white stuff for many of my<br/>
earlier carvings. My Fish Tank series doesn't see much use right now,<br/>
so it has worked fine for that. However, my first sig. stamp made out<br/>
of the white stuff had many "added character" marks by the time I<br/>
retired it from things banging against it in the back pack. The pink<br/>
stuff is a much harder material and seems more durable than the white<br/>
stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck on your first stamp! And if you are a bit dissapointed<br/>

takes practice to work up to some of the intricate masterpieces you<br/>
have seen.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks for that info speedsquare! I didn't get as far as the<br/>
sporting goods store tonight, so I will look for that when I do get<br/>
there. I did get to Michaels and bought carving material and blades<br/>
and am going to attempt my first stamp and box once we are done with<br/>
school this week. <br/>
&gt; &gt; So a secondary equipment question. I'm hearing that there are 2<br/>
types of carving material and that the harder material is better. All<br/>
that the Michaels here had was Speedy-Cut. I'll work with this, but is<br/>
there something preferable, or is this what I want? And if there is<br/>
something else, any ideas on outlets for it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; And just for the record, I came home from the gather with visions<br/>
of all these great stamps in my head. I have since then given myself a<br/>
few good slaps and have been repeating to myself, "It's your first<br/>
stamp. Keep it simple!!!"<br/>

I'm going to try to find a couple of  other materials, but I want to get started right away with what I've got.  The link for mounting a stamp would be great.  Given that I do have this material, I'd like to mount it if it will help it along.   I'm not discouraged at all really here.  I think that I am being realistic about my ability level starting out on my first stamp.  I would like to carve a couple basic stamps and get a feel for material and tools, then start out on some more ambitious stamps.  I'm thinking that it would be better to build some success on little stamps and work my way up to the bigger ones.  (And I am not going to admit how much I spent at Michaels last night!)  <br/>
  I really want to plant the first boxes in the southwest part of Wisconsin.  My dad's side of the family is from that area and I'm already looking for images!  Now if school would finish up and let me get on with the important things in life!<br/>

We all need a pep talk from time to time.  But I had to chuckle when I read PJ's comment about the eraser carved with a steak knife.  When the LB bug first bites some people, it must really bite hard.  The bug bit me too.  I didn't wait to carve a stamp; I bought a commercially made stamp and just hit the trails.  <br/>
<br/>
This recent LbGLK Gathering was my first, and I too was impressed with the gathering stamps.   They were definately the crme de la crme of stamps, maybe because only experienced carvers are confident enough to volunteer to submit a box.  But sometimes a simple, well done stamp is all that is needed for a box on a trail.  Once, I found a box with a stamp carved by a 5 year old girl.  I could hardly make out the image (Piglet), but I just love that little stamp. <br/>
<br/>
It's not a competition. The more you carve, the easier it becomes and you develop your own technique and style.   This group of creative carvers has been very encouraging and helpful when it comes to sharing advice and experiences with products on the market.  <br/>
<br/>
Just have fun.<br/>

  I have some files on my yahoogroup, about the various carving<br/>
  materials that you might be interested in. Here is the link to the<br/>
  homepage of the yahoogroup:<br/>
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Letterboxing_Bindlestiff/<http: group="" groups.yahoo.com="" letterboxing_bindlestiff=""></http:><br/>
  Go to "files" (on the left side of your screen) <br/>
  then select "supplies"<br/>
  You will find two files of interest:<br/>
  1. Carving Material experiments - with personal opinion reviews <br/>
  2. Carving Material Types - and cost comparions of alternative<br/>
  products to PZ-kut<br/>
<br/>
  Also, my daughter, Jade (formerly known as Enders Angel) really likes<br/>
  the soft, smooth, easy way that Speedy-Cut carves. However, it doesn't<br/>
  do well with fine detail and it doesn't hold up under heavy use. That<br/>
  doesn't mean it's not a viable option for learning to carve on,<br/>
  though. We've found that mounting it extends the life by a long-shot.<br/>
  (I have a picture trail site with a mounting tutorial using cheap<br/>
  materials that's easy to follow; if you're interested)<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry to hear you're backing down on you initial excitement and plans<br/>
  for carving. When I stumbled onto letterboxing, I was so excited I<br/>
  couldn't wait to begin! I found an eraser in my studio and hacked out<br/>
  my first stamp with a steak knife. (Boy did it look like it, too! LOL)<br/>
  I placed that box (Kent Trails letterbox) the very next morning. When<br/>
  the box went missing after a year, I re-carved the stamp to be very<br/>
  similar to the original in order to give hope and inspiration to new<br/>
  carvers. I'll throw a copy of the image up in the photos section (look<br/>
  in the misc album) so you can compare it to things I've carved more<br/>
  recently. I find it amazing that ~I~ have come so far.<br/>
<br/>
  Geez oh pizza, everyone starts somewhere. I don't see the sense in<br/>
  being ashamed or embarrassed about the beginning of any journey,<br/>
  artistic or otherwise. <br/>
<br/>
  Sail on!<br/>

  &gt; White speedy-cut was all that the Michaels by me had, so I bought a<br/>
  block of that. I'll have to try to find a store in the area that<br/>
  carries the other kind. I confess, that I have had dreams of jumping<br/>
  right in on a huge stamp after seeing the gather stamps. I have been<br/>
  pulling back on my ambitions for the first try to something that will<br/>
  be realistic.<br/>

  &gt; The type of carving material that is best is largely a<br/>
  matter of personal preferance. I am a strong believer that there<br/>
  aren't many "bad" carving materials out there...just that some are<br/>
  better for certain applications. Harder material will support more<br/>
  detail, but is more difficult to carve. Softer material is easier to<br/>
  carve but may not be a good choice for very fine detail (like the Rose<br/>
  Gardener or March Hare stamps from the gathering). Personally, I don't<br/>
  have the patience for uber-fine details, so I don't really mind a<br/>
  slightly softer material. My advice is to go ahead and try a couple of<br/>
  different materials if you can to see which you like best.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Now the more important question for you is, did you get the white<br/>
  speedy-cut or the pink speedy-cut? Most people don't like the white<br/>
  stuff as it tends to be crumbly (a property I have used in a few<br/>
  carvings to my advantage). I used the white stuff for many of my<br/>
  earlier carvings. My Fish Tank series doesn't see much use right now,<br/>
  so it has worked fine for that. However, my first sig. stamp made out<br/>
  of the white stuff had many "added character" marks by the time I<br/>
  retired it from things banging against it in the back pack. The pink<br/>
  stuff is a much harder material and seems more durable than the white<br/>
  stuff.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Good luck on your first stamp! And if you are a bit dissapointed<br/>
  with your skills the first few times around...just remember that it<br/>
  takes practice to work up to some of the intricate masterpieces you<br/>
  have seen.<br/>

  &gt; &gt;Thanks for that info speedsquare! I didn't get as far as the<br/>
  sporting goods store tonight, so I will look for that when I do get<br/>
  there. I did get to Michaels and bought carving material and blades<br/>
  and am going to attempt my first stamp and box once we are done with<br/>
  school this week. <br/>
  &gt; &gt; So a secondary equipment question. I'm hearing that there are 2<br/>
  types of carving material and that the harder material is better. All<br/>
  that the Michaels here had was Speedy-Cut. I'll work with this, but is<br/>
  there something preferable, or is this what I want? And if there is<br/>
  something else, any ideas on outlets for it?<br/>
  &gt; &gt; And just for the record, I came home from the gather with visions<br/>
  of all these great stamps in my head. I have since then given myself a<br/>
  few good slaps and have been repeating to myself, "It's your first<br/>
  stamp. Keep it simple!!!"<br/>
