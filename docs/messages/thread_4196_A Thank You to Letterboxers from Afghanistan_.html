I have an update and a personal thank you from my son and his platoon<br>
in Kandahar, Afghanistan to you all.  There is also a new picture he<br>
just sent that I have posted if anyone wanted to see it.  The picture<br>
was taken in January when they first got to Afghanistan.<br>
<br>
Here is the link:<br>
