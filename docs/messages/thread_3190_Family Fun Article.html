                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been reading all that is being said about box destruction and coming up missing and agree with everyone about how disheartening it is. I, too, have checked on my boxes to find them in a totally new spot or squashed vegetation. This I find irksome since I planted this one box on the trail and specifically say don't leave the trail and don't hurt the plants. What do I find, flat plants leading off to trees ten feet off the path! <br>
 <br>
That being said, I realized when I started (after reading Family Fun) that I would loose boxes and not find some when I hunted. All okay; part of the game. I'd rather it didn't happen, but it will. I'd like to think that the 20+ boxes I've hidden have been an asset to the boxing community and wouldn't have given others adventures if I never read the article. We can't assume that just because an article is out there the new people are the issue. I'm always amazed to find one of my boxes stamped in by a veteran last, not sealed shut or has the lid on upside down! <br>
 <br>
Kids aren't the issue. Parents are. If we take them, we need to watch them and utilize this time for teaching. I always bring my 2 year old with me and am amazed at all she's learned. She doesn't know her colors yet, but she knows "stump" and "log". I never let her handle others boxes and will teach her gradually what she can do (not much for a long while). Hiding is perfect for kids to do: if their parents are WATCHING and HELPING! I can't wait for the day that my little Bug can hide superbly with my supervision.<br>

Sorry, I'm done now! Happy Hunting. Travel'n Turtle & Laney Bug<br>
