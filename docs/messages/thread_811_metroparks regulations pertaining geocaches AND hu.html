1) In past weeks there have been some posts on regulations of geocaching and letterboxing in DNR administered public land in Michigan.<br>
 <br>
I found this link in a forum:<br>
http://www.metroparks.com/activities/geocaching.php<br>
 <br>
Hope that initiatives like this come to other counties/areas. <br>
 <br>
I recognize that the impact of the activity on a metropark (maily recreative area) may be quite different from the impact on a natural area set for dual (reacreation/conservation) purposes, so this is NO critic to the MI-DNR, just a FYI, specially for southeastern MI boxers.<br>
 <br>
2) Bow hunting season is in order and in about 15 days the firearms deer season will start in Michigan, some recreation areas and public land are heavily used by hunters, please have this in mind while going out especially from nov 15th to dec 1st: <br>
 <br>
Remember to wear orange vest and cap ALWAYS. <br>
NEVER wear hats/caps/vests with white color over darker colors. <br>
Avoid dusk and dawn hours as most of the hunters are active at those times.<br>
 <br>
Personally I'll try to limit my activities (hiking, fishing)  to county parks and land where hunting is not legal and even in that case I take precautions.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
I'll post another remainder a couple of days before firearms openning<br>
Have fun!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Cleveland Metroparks, I noticed from perusing their website (www.clemetparks.com) also has some geocaching regulations, and you're supposed to get a permit in order to hide a cache.  From my quick perusal, it looks like it doens't cost to get the permit to hide a cache, more-so that they just want to track where they're being hidden to monitor the land.  <br>
 <br>
However, I also noticed that there's no mention of letterboxing on their website, so I'll assume that their regulations only apply to geocaching..... *innocent humming*<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the link to the Metroparks policy.  It is great to see that they<br>
are encouraging the outdoor hobbies like geocaching.  I think their<br>
regulations are reasonable and wouldn't have a problem staying within such<br>
guidelines if the State Parks were to be of the same reasoning.<br>
<br>
Also, good warning about hunting season.  I am with you -- staying out of<br>
parks where hunting is permitted.<br>
