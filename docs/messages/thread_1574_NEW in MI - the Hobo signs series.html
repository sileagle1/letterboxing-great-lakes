The first few boxes have been placed and clues have been posted.  You<br>
can find the clues on letterboxing.org and our yahoogroup. FYI- lots<br>
more interesting stuff at our yahoogroup than what is at the big site.<br>
<br>
We anticipate this to be a very long-term project (series) with<br>
constant additions, albeit at irregular intervals.<br>
<br>
With the Hobo signs series, I'm limbering up my writing skills so I<br>
can put together a good tale of story-based clues for the series we<br>
are working in cooperation with the DogLvrs family on.  <br>
<br>
HINT: The plot line of our cooperative series involves the Greatest<br>
Piano Teacher in the World having her Piano kidnapped by an evil<br>
character who not only wants to silence music but also to keep<br>
children from ever being able to create it in the future. The stamps<br>
for this large-ish series are all carved, the location all picked out<br>
with the prelim trips made. We simply need to coordinate our schedules<br>
to get them placed (not an easy feat in the summer!)<br>

Maybe next year ...  Hopefully the "Around the World" series will still be<br>
available then also.<br>
