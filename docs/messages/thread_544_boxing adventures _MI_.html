                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesteray, Bindle Bum was away doing prep for an upcoming sailboat <br/>
race, so I took the opportunity to go place another box and do some <br/>
solo boxing as I want to get some more of the boxes around Muskegon.<br/>
<br/>
First up was Spring Chick's Sung Harbor box, which is in great shape <br/>
and getting plenty of visitors. <br/>
<br/>
As I was getting my backpack on in the parking lot, I thought I saw a <br/>
family in the picinic area getting ready to go boxing.  You know how <br/>
we think we see them all the time; and it turns out not to be true. <br/>
<br/>
Just in case, when I stamped in, I added the time plus a note to look <br/>
for the LbNA logo on my backpack and flag me down if there were other <br/>
boxers out today. <br/>
<br/>
I hiked on and crossed over to the Devil's Kitchen trail. Beautiful <br/>
hike, but longer than I thought it would be. On the way back, I <br/>
peeked but didn't see anyone near the Snug Harbor box, so thought, <br/>
just like usual, I must have been wrong about the people at the <br/>
picinic area.  <br/>
<br/>
A ways further on the trail, I noticed that there were a couple of <br/>
boys messing around in the woods up on the West side of the trail. <br/>
After I went past, one of them yell, "It's her! Mom, Mom...I found <br/>
her!" <br/>
<br/>
I got to meet the Found Objects Family, vacationing here from Denver. <br/>
They're geocachers doing a little letterboxing after seeing the Time <br/>
article and investigating online. They don't have a rubber stamp, <br/>
they only use found objects. "Cache in, trash out" the boys said, <br/>
almost in unison. Today they were using a leaf to stamp in with. <br/>
<br/>
This was the first time they had done an exchange. I told them this <br/>
was the second time I'd been prepared when I met a letterboxer in the <br/>
wild. This promptly earned me the name Wild Boxer(LOL!)from the <br/>
youngest boy, who had been having trouble with Bindlestiff. (Enders <br/>
Angel has never let me forget the time we ran into Grandvilla and <br/>
Mobiusklien and *I* didn't have my logbook, stamp or anything, but <br/>
she did, and got to count it as an exchange, but won't let me.)<br/>
<br/>
I then drove up to the Block House to work on boxes in that area. <br/>
Found Julies Locket safe and sound. OMG .. someone had already <br/>
stamped in with the same date! I may have just missed another trail <br/>
exchange. If you know who signs in using CRZ and their names, that's <br/>
who signed in yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
By then, my gimpy foot was complaining and it was nearly time to head <br/>
over to Dockers to meet up with Bindle Bum and the others for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
I got an email from Spring Chick saying she checked and the Indian <br/>
Point box is not missing .. it's alive and well! Arrrgh ... I'll have <br/>
to go back for that one. I get restless and edgy knowing I've missed <br/>
a "live" box!<br/>
<br/>
Also, someone has cracked the code and solved the clues to the <br/>
Mystery Box we just placed. Congrats, on being first finder!<br/>
<br/>
Clues to the box I placed yesterday will be coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy! <br/>
