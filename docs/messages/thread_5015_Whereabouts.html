that goes by Flying J?  I've attempted a box of his that said it was <br>
still active, but it hasn't been found for over a year and as far as I <br>
know, there's been no maintenance on it for a while, if at all.  I've <br>
tried contacting this person about the box, done other boxes by the <br>
same person and left comments too about needed maintenance, but no <br>
responses at all.  So, I was curious to know if anyone's heard anything <br>
about this person moving or whatnot as it's a little disconcerting.<br>
