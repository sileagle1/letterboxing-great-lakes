<br/>
Since the LBNA website is still down, I figured I'd post the clues <br/>
for one of our newer boxes on this board in case someone is looking <br/>
to go out on the hunt tomorrow.  We did rehide our two Marsh boxes <br/>
today, but won't have time to get clues written before we head out <br/>
for the evening.  Maybe tomorrow morning...?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here are the clues for "Year of the Dog":<br/>
<br/>
Year of the Dog<br/>
Last found/checked:  21-JAN-05<br/>
<br/>
Time:  Approximately 30-45 minutes roundtrip, depending on season &amp; <br/>
trail conditions<br/>
<br/>
Terrain:  Mostly level paved and gravel paths.<br/>
<br/>
Around the globe, the Chinese New Year celebrations will take place <br/>
based on January 29th 2006, which is start of the Lunar New Year. Of <br/>
all the traditional Chinese festivals, the New Year is perhaps the <br/>
most elaborate, colorful, and important. This is a time for the <br/>
Chinese to congratulate each other and themselves on having passed <br/>
through another year, a time to finish out the old, and to welcome in <br/>
the new year. Common expressions heard at this time are: GUONIAN to <br/>
have made it through the old year, and BAINIAN to congratulate the <br/>
new year.<br/>
<br/>
In Chinese Astrology there are five elements (wood, fire, earth, <br/>
metal and water) and twelve animals (rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, <br/>
snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig) forming a complete <br/>
cycle of sixty. This means there are five different types of Dog <br/>
years: wood dog, fire dog, earth dog, metal dog and water dog. 2006 <br/>
is a Fire Dog year.<br/>
<br/>
The Dog is a giving, compassionate personality. He offers kind words, <br/>
support and advice to friends and family. He is a listener, always <br/>
available to lend an ear or a shoulder to a friend in need. Often <br/>
Dogs know more about their friends than their friends know about them <br/>
or even themselves! Dogs are incredibly attentive. Sometimes though, <br/>
Dogs should pay more attention to their own needs. In private, many <br/>
Dog people worry a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Traits for specific Dog years:<br/>
The Fire Dog - Intractable, kind-hearted, patient, controlling temper <br/>
will lead to success.<br/>
2 Feb 1946 to 21 Jan 1947 and 29 Jan 2006 to 17 Feb 2007<br/>
<br/>
The Wood Dog - Independent, creative, protective, if confidence <br/>
increases, will lead to success.<br/>
14 Feb 1934 to 3 Feb 1935 and 10 Feb 1994 to 30 Jan 1995<br/>
<br/>
The Earth Dog - Materialistic ambitions, hard-worker, uses the <br/>
relationship with friends to gain success, not many close friends.<br/>
18 Feb 1958 to 7 Feb 1959<br/>
<br/>
The Metal Dog - Loyal, work with their intuition, calm will lead to <br/>
success, know how to control outgoings.<br/>
10 Feb 1910 to 29 Jan 1911 and 6 Feb 1970 to 26 Jan 1971<br/>
<br/>
The Water Dog - Active, charming, sociable, systematic, accept advice <br/>
from friends and have numbers of close friends.<br/>
28 Jan 1922 to 15 Feb 1923 and 25 Jan 1982 to 12 Feb 1983<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
Begin your adventure at the park located at 10300 W. Wisconsin Ave. <br/>
Since the Fire dog is a natural leader, he immediately trots over to <br/>
the large green oak leaf when he sees you get out of your car.  <br/>
Expecting you to follow, he then continues east until he sees a black <br/>
path heading north.  He heads that direction, remembering how he used <br/>
to meet all his friends in the adjacent fields. It was great to <br/>
listen to all the latest gossip and give advice to all the other <br/>
pooches when they were allowed to run loose in the area. However the <br/>
field is now filled with large office buildings.  Grrrr!<br/>
<br/>
Putting his nose to the trail, he heads toward the pond, and then <br/>
heads clockwise around a second pond.  Instead of chasing some cars, <br/>
he crosses to a third smaller pond and again travels clockwise, <br/>
stopping to sniff the interesting smells along the way.  When he <br/>
reaches a "T", his intuition leads him right, but when he spots some <br/>
LARGE conifers, he heads that direction to mark his presence. <br/>
Continuing on this trail, he passes by some picnic tables and spends <br/>
some time checking to see what tasty items may have been left in the <br/>
area.  Then he bounds along the trail as it enters the woods again.  <br/>
When he spots a large fallen tree on the right, he decides it looks <br/>
like a great place for a nap.  He crawls into a cozy spot midway <br/>
under the tree and settles in.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to start (or end) your search with a meal at one of the <br/>
nearby Chinese restaurants.  Peony is at 11120 West Blue Mound Road <br/>
and P.F. Chang's is at 2500 N Mayfair Rd.<br/>
