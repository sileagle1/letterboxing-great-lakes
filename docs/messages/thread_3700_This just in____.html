(who I worked with when I was an intern at Fox 6) and<br>
to Vince Condella expressing our concerns with giving<br>
letterboxing such exposure on the local news. I<br>
explained the negative effects this "over" exposure<br>
can have on the hobby and asked them, for the sake of<br>
the letterboxers who would like to preserve this<br>
hobby, not have their boxes go missing, be vandalized,<br>
etc. to please reconsider doing the segment. <br>
<br>
Who knows if it will do any good, but at least they'll<br>
know there are some letterboxers out there who are not<br>
happy to see letterboxing have such publicity.<br>

The worst part is that they showed the actuall hiding place of the box<br>

<br>
All in all, not too bad.  What gets me is that they seemed to feature<br>
the 4-H person/group that has been advertising letterboxing in the<br>
area to various groups but never responds to inquiries from us.  I<br>
didn't recognize any of their stamps or people.  You'd think that<br>
they'd look to see who's hidden alot of boxes in the area and ask them<br>
about doing the piece.<br>

One good note is that Vince switched right back to caching at the end,<br>

Oh, and they didn't stress the secrecy or stealthiness of<br>

Do you happen to know which 4-H group it is?  I have some friends who <br>
are in 4-H and would be willing to ask them to find out who to talk <br>
to, etc.  I have actually take our friends with us before and I know <br>
by the time I was done with them, they totally understood the secrecy <br>
factor (that and the fact that her poor husband almost ended up in <br>
the lake helping me and my husband look for one of Martini Man's boxes, LOL!).<br>

Dragon was right - there was no indication that stealth is of <br>

that at least with many of the clues, you cannot be completely <br>

<br>
I thought the news piece was just fine. Honestly, it was fine. She<br>
showed mostly her own Sig stamp being stamped and the box was her box.<br>
 There were maybe 6 people, or so, in the group. It was educationally<br>
done and it didn't expose anyone's boxes. No names of the park<br>
location were mentioned. I think some legitimate people may think of<br>
checking out letterboxing so that they can use a compass and count paces. <br>
<br>
If you're interested in my larger opinion, read on. <br>
<br>
This is my first time getting in on this annoying thread topic, but<br>
I've passed it up a few times now... so I'll just say everything I<br>
want to say and that will be that. :)<br>
<br>
Regarding hearing about letterboxing in public:<br>
Most of the people I know who letterbox are in this hobby because of a<br>
piece done on public radio, which led to a friend finding out about<br>
the hobby, which led to her recommending it to us. The piece, which<br>
you can still hear online, was nearly identical to this one in the<br>
sense that they followed some staged clues to a box planted by the<br>
interviewee. Seems fine to me. No radicals are going to jump on this<br>
hobby-wagon.<br>
<br>
Regarding secrecy, in general:<br>
The act of letterboxing does require stealth to a certain degree, but<br>
it is not exactly a secret society...unless of course the Knights<br>
Templar were actually letterboxers... which would be pretty funny. I<br>
bet the great pyramid eyeball conspiracy of Masons is actually a<br>
dollar bill clue to a giant letterbox! <br>
<br>
It's just a stamp in a box (a metaphor(?) for your enjoyment):<br>
This reminds me of when I first became a librarian. Every new book was<br>
my baby, needing my protection. But now I simply wish to share the joy<br>
of books and reading with as many people as I can. I want people to<br>
take the books home! I know that they'll use them as a coaster. I know<br>
the dog will use them as a chew toy. It is possible that before that<br>
happens someone will actually read it... and become a Reader some day.<br>
I choose to think of my stamps the same way. At first they felt like<br>
my babies that needing protecting, now I want to share them. It seems<br>
as though letterboxing sometimes feels like a baby needing protection.<br>
 Or a possession to be kept behind glass. I am suggesting that as<br>
letterboxers we shouldn't fear exposer. We might just want to share<br>
our hobby in the hopes of someone become a capitol "L" Letterboxer.<br>
<br>
People, especially kids, need guidance:<br>
Mostly I'm in the woods by myself finding a box. And that's just fine.<br>
If someone wants to show a group of kids a worthwhile hobby that I<br>
love, that's super. At least they're not standing outside a school<br>
with a baseball bat calling their friends to a brawl on their cell<br>
phones. They're learning orienteering skills, respect for nature, etc.<br>
<br>
Hobbies are for sharing:<br>
Letterboxes are for other people to find. I, for one, believe this 4H<br>
Letterboxer is doing a noble thing to spend time with kids giving them<br>
a peaceful hobby. I suspect she DID tell them the secrecy aspect. Yes,<br>
be secretive. No, don't hog your hobby and distrust the world. This is<br>
A hobby, not YOUR hobby...it's free an open to everyone. We try to<br>
influence it to the best possible practice. <br>
<br>
...I seem to remember a HUGE group of us trampling the daylights out<br>
of plenty of snow at a certain park on Dec. 2nd... A much, much larger<br>
group that the one they showed for 2 minutes on late night news. <br>
<br>
I'm gettin sassy. Better go get some sleep. Before I go here's the<br>
best bit of advice I've gotten in months and it's been serving me well:<br>
<br>
Always assume best intentions. <br>
<br>
Thanks for listening!<br>

Anyway, I don't recall seeing or writing any bad or negative comments,<br>
so I'm not sure why some think there has been any.  The only thing<br>
I've seen or said is a critique on how the piece was done, not on any<br>
individual.  The piece was lots better than the new article done in MI<br>
a few months back not to mention the TIME article.  I think the video<br>
does the story better than a written article, particularly how it<br>
shows the kids doing art and solving problems.  Can't go wrong showing<br>
kids learning by doing!  Hopefully it will be parents that appreciate<br>
that who will join our hobby because of the piece.<br>
<br>
I also agree that 2manyhobbies probably did say something about the<br>
stealth factor, etc. but it probably was cut.  Considering how much<br>
Vince talks about all the caches out there, I don't think stealth is<br>
on his mind or on the mind of the producers of the pieces.<br>

<br>
I'm going to have to agree with LibraryGrrl. On one hand I'd like it <br>
never mentioned, but on the other hand maybe after the rash of <br>
Police/FBI letterbox shakedowns (yes, I'm exaggerating for a point) it <br>
can't hurt for people to be AWARE of letterboxing and what that little <br>
box really is. Wouldn't it be nice if one of the officials swarming in <br>
to attack, said, "hey, that's a letterbox, my 8 year old does that". <br>
See, no longer threatening. <br>
<br>
As to the large group: When I hear that a troup of Girl Scouts, Boy <br>
Scouts, 4-H etc. hits one of my boxes I have a mixed set of feelings. <br>
Better check on that and I sure hope they enjoyed it!<br>
<br>
Delusional, maybe! Happy Stealthy Trails, Travel'n Turtle<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think there is a difference between articles in<br>
various publications and those broadcast TV...even the<br>
article on NPR leaves the listener with a sense of<br>
mystery.  Articles in magazines, while fairly widely<br>
distributed may only be read by people interested in<br>
what the magazine normally has to offer.  ie. a hiking<br>
mag or a regional activity magazine.  Having<br>
Letterboxing on the weather report when secrecy or<br>
stealth is neither said or implied (the large<br>
group)isn't the biggest deal..especially when they are<br>
finding their own box...but we have to remember that<br>
most of our (the group) boxes are listed on one of the<br>
two big sites for letterboxes.  I'm sure that we will<br>
get many new letterboxers from the exposure that could<br>
be good for the hobby/sport/obsession.  But with each<br>
exposure it does sometimes seem that there is a rash<br>
of missing boxes afterwards.  Could be coincidence..I<br>
don't know.  Even if more people are aware of the<br>
hobby...such as the FBI as someone mentioned, it<br>
doesn't mean that they will respect it.  So I guess we<br>
all just walk the tightrope of harder clues to keep<br>
the boxes visited less easily, but hopefully often, or<br>
easier clues that keep the boxes easily accessible but<br>
also more susceptible to damage from either<br>
carelessness or vandalism.<br>

post at the big list was kind of a sympathy ploy to garner support <br>
after-the-fact and exaggerated the backlash she received from this <br>
list.  It really is too bad because I did not think the comments I <br>
read here were nearly as negative and nasty as she said, rather <br>
there were some very valid and insightful concerns and opinions <br>
expressed, from all perspectives.<br>
<br>
I noted that in her post she made a point to say that she had <br>
stressed being discreet, however I have watched the story several <br>
times now and have seen no mention of being discreet or rehiding <br>
boxes well at all.  Publicity is a double-edged sword for <br>
letterboxing and along with that people have very valid concerns <br>
when it happens, particularly when it happens so in-your-face <br>
visually.<br>
<br>
While many people do not especially like publicity, they do realize <br>
it is reality and the best we can do when it comes knocking is to <br>
handle it responsibly, to offer experienced letterboxers who stress <br>
the aspects of education, being discreet and rehiding boxes, etc.  <br>
But anyone who actively seeks out publicity has to expect there are <br>
going to be many people who are less than supportive and <br>
appreciative of that action, particularly when that person is <br>
somebody that very few people know and things such as being discreet <br>
and rehiding, etc. are not stressed, or in this case, even mentioned.<br>
