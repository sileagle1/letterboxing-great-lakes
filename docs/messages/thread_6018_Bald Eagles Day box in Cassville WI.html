I had a couple of emails about it, and this was the first chance I had to get out to the west side of the state there with time to check on the box.  A bench that was on the trail and was one of the landmarks is no longer there.  Thanks for the update on that Dragon.  So clues are updated and the box is where it is supposed to be.<br>
