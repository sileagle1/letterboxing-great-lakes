&gt; As a side note, I think we could do new letterboxers a service by <br/>
&gt; having more helpful information about how to begin letterboxing <br/>
than <br/>
&gt; what is found at the LBNA site.  The FAQ that everyone refers to <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; out of date and it only touches the surface.  I didn't find it <br/>
&gt; overly helpful.  Maybe we should make one of our own for all the <br/>
new <br/>
&gt; LBers in our area.<br/>

[shameless plug here] I usually refer people to the "getting <br/>
started" page at my letterboxing site.  I have gotten really nice <br/>
comments on it from several people and have tried to give the basics <br/>
and just a little more, but not so much as to overwhelm people.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterbox-mi.com/lbstart.asp<br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug also has a very good basic "getting started" page at his <br/>
web site.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000002.shtml<br/>
<br/>
I have created a folder in the LINKS section of this group <br/>
called "Getting Started" and have put in links to these sites as <br/>
well as the LbNA FAQ page.  If anyone else knows of a good "getting <br/>
started" page, please feel free to add it.<br/>
