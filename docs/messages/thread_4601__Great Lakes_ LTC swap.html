                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  I just wanted to let you know that I put a tracker up on AQ for <br>
this swap.  I wasn't getting enough response from just the Great <br>
Lakes states, so I decided to open it up to everyone.<br>
<br>
If you're interested... could you please sign up <br>
here:  http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/tracker/showinfo.html?gTrackerId=1256<br>
<br>
You can just add your name at this point.  This is technically a <br>
"postal tracker", since they don't have one for LTCs yet.  So, don't <br>
let that confuse you.<br>
<br>
I put the due date down as Feb 2nd to be mailed to me.  I will swap <br>
them out after that fact. I'll send my address to everyone and <br>
further details once the swap is filled.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
Bali<br>
