You can bring a logbook if you want to collect recipient stamps.  We're going to try to set up a "head table" (like a wedding) where all the stamps and any show-and-tell items will be placed, so they don't get messed up by food or get accidentally lost/discarded.  It will be more of an art exchange than letterbox hunting.<br/>

PS:  I've got word that more guest event stamps are soon to be arriving from around the country.  (Carve for others, and they will carve for you!)<br/>
