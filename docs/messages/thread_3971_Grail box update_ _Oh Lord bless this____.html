("Oh Lord bless this thy hand grenade") to make sure things were still <br>
okay with it.  Well, it turns out the city is doing construction on the <br>
road to get to the park. :(   The road is torn up and closed right <br>
around the park entrance.  So take into consideration the extra <br>
directions below:<br>
<br>
As of 4/15/07, Osterhout Ave is closed to thru traffic between Oakland <br>
Dr. and Westnedge Ave. while the city puts in new sewers.  However, the <br>
road is still partially accessible, so we suggest that you approach from <br>
Oakland and drive east on Osterhout as far as you can get before the <br>
construction starts (this should be just before you reach the Lakes Area <br>
Conservation Club gun range).  Find a place to street park and carefully <br>
walk around the construction area and continue walking east until you <br>
get to the Schrier Park entrance, not more than 0.25mile further, and <br>
follow the rest of the clue from there.<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work with the grail quest, all you valiant knights!<br>
