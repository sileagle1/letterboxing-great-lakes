I've used sandpaper to create "stubble" on "Jack's" beard on my "The Shining" stamp. You can see it on my picturetrail site listed in my signature.  Look in the "my stamps" album.<br/>
It took a few tries to get the effect acceptable.  I think the stamp I used was my third attempt for that stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I added a bunch of new photos to the "my stamps" album on my picture trail website.  I added some new ones of the dogs in their album too &amp; updated my home page. www.PictureTrail.com/scoutdogs<br/>
