Pennsylvania, but I am moving to Michigan in December. I am looking <br>
forward to finding all the boxes in the area. I also have plans to <br>
start several boxes in southeastern part of the state. I already have <br>
four stamps carved. There is also going to be a tribute series. More <br>
details on that one at a later time. I am even bringing a box with me <br>
that I planted in Pennsylvania to re-plant here. Until I plant those <br>
boxes, I hope everyone enjoys the two HH stamps that I started in <br>
Michigan. Traveling Rabbits HH and Traveling Pumpkins HH.  BTW Team <br>
Rabbit, great job on planting three more rabbit-day boxes! I look <br>
forward to finding the rest of your series!! Have a great day <br>
everyone and happy letterboxing.<br>
