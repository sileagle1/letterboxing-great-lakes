Here's more info for those interested...<br/>
<br/>
I started the day by checking on Calatrava/Green One and I'm happy to<br/>
say that Calatrava is there (cleaned up with new baggies too), but I'm<br/>
sad to report that the Green One is completely gone.  I have plans to<br/>
replace Green One as soon as I contact Birkie Bob and Moofie and Blaxe<br/>
(read on for info on them!)<br/>
<br/>
German LB - ok, two visitors so far...<br/>
<br/>
MCP/Oak Leaf Grant Park - found the area that it is in to have<br/>
sustained considerable damage do to weather.  Also found the box on<br/>
the ground out of place, so I found a new location for the box and<br/>
updated the clues.  If you thought this one was missing, it was not,<br/>
so look up the new clues and go find it!<br/>
<br/>
Then I traveled to check on Stampin' Kitty as I heard it was gone. <br/>
I'm happy to report that it is still in place.  I cleaned it up and<br/>
gave it new bags too.<br/>
<br/>
Since I was in the area, I decided to actually go and FIND a box!  So<br/>
I went to downtown Racine and found Joshua'a Journey.  What a treat! <br/>
Good job girls!  Give us more!<br/>
<br/>
MCP/Oak Leaf Mitchell Park - replacement box seems to be doing fine in<br/>
its spot.  Only one visitor to new spot!<br/>
<br/>
MCP/Oak Leaf Doyne Park - found it with a huge white bag around it,<br/>
apparently to keep the water out because the box wouldn't close.  Why<br/>
wouldn't the box close?  Because someone turned it into a geocache and<br/>
left a bunch of kids toys!  It is now a letterbox once again and in<br/>
working order.<br/>
<br/>
Then I stopped to do Figure Eights.  This mathematician couldn't get<br/>
the math to work either, but I guess I used the wrong number too (note<br/>
the Czeltic Girl, that number IS an ID number too, not a phone number,<br/>
as you find out doing the TTE series).<br/>
<br/>
AND!!!!!!!!!<br/>
MOOFIE AND BLAZE ARE ALIVE!!!!!!!  THEY WERE AT FIGURE EIGHTS ON<br/>
3/27/05 DOING THEIR "FIRST BOX OF SPRING"!!!!!!  WILL YOU TWO PLEASE<br/>
POST TO THE LIST SO WE KNOW HOW YOU'RE DOING???!!!!<br/>
<br/>
ahem, ok now, then I went on....<br/>
<br/>
Watery Grave - ok<br/>
Squished Pennies - ok, lots of trains again<br/>
<br/>
New WI letterboxers! - Tooters Too from Tosa and others!<br/>
<br/>
I then snuck in to check the Creative Writing box and HH Hostel.  If<br/>
you haven't been there for a while, you might want to go check those<br/>
boxes again.  I removed the mechanical device from CW because it was<br/>
FULL!!!  Time for some fun!!!  Watch for a post to the GL site soon.<br/>
<br/>
MCP/Oak Leaf Hansen - ok<br/>
<br/>
Mathman 9 Lockbox - missing as feared.  I have plans to replace it.<br/>
<br/>
Mathman 10 Zoo Box - didn't check, but still assumed gone. I have<br/>
plans to replace it yet too, but I need to talk to the students<br/>
involved next week when school is back in session.<br/>
<br/>
Whew!  One more day of vacation and just a couple of boxes to check<br/>
yet by home!  THEN I CAN GET OUT AND BOX!!!!!<br/>

Ooh. The elusive Chrysalis. Every time I think I've finally figured this one out, I find out I <br/>
haven't. One of these days, I'll get it! :-)<br/>
