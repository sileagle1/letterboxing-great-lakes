While we were in the park, we also checked on a few other boxes and are happy to report that "Out &amp; About Box 2 - Kilroy", "The White Knight" and "Humpty Dumpty" are also alive &amp; well and waiting for more visitors.  We had to dry out some of the boxes, but since the previous finders had done a great job of sealing the baggies, the contents were in fine shape.<br/>

P.S.  We think our bug spray had passed its expiration date, since it didn't seem to faze the swarms of blood-thirsty mosquitoes one iota!<br/>

Milwaukee instead of Duluth for my birthday in August. Wanted to see family<br/>
and friends... and wanted to work on our long list of Milwaukee area boxes.<br/>
Lot harder to get there these days! We will be in town August 24-26... you<br/>
know, in case anyone wanted to get together or go find a few boxes with us!<br/>

Love to you all!<br/>
