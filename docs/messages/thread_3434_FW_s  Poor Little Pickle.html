What is sadder is that maybe no one is looking for it...yet.  But with all this Polish food chat, you think someone may have eaten the pickle?  Well, here's another sad story, someone may have decided to eat some goose too.  My small cement goose is missing from my front porch!  At first, I thought that it was shoved up with the snow and tossed onto the front lawn.  But the snow is thawing and no goose.  BOO HOO!!! <br>
