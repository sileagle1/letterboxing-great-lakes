a gathering so you can start planning...<br>
<br>
Date: Sat., Dec. 2, 2006<br>
Place: Near Fox Brook Park in Waukesha, WI<br>
Time: Noon - 6?<br>
Theme: A St. Nick Gathering<br>
<br>
Letterboxing themed "Secret Santa" gift exchange among all attending.<br>
(I hope to have a Christmas Tree at the meeting place.)<br>
<br>
The location is near WI Hiker's "Winter Fun" boxes and CignaCats<br>
"Twelve Days of Christmas" boxes, in case you haven't got those yet.<br>
<br>
I would like St. Nick/Christmas/Winter Holiday themed boxes to be<br>
found during the gathering - either sent to me or you plant them when<br>
you come.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got out to scout the area today and I have a few more details:<br>
<br>
The gathering will be at Mitchell Park in Waukesha (NOT the one in<br>
Milwaukee).  It is bounded by Barker Rd and Capitol and River Rd.<br>
<br>
I'm going to go out on a limb and not officially rent one of the<br>
picnic shelters.  I'm hoping that we won't be fighting anyone for<br>
either of the two that are there.  We'll meet at one of the picnic<br>
shelters for the gathering from 10 am until 5 pm.  (The shelters are<br>
closer to River Rd and are next to each other, so you can't miss us.)<br>
 I will bring our cross country tent which has sides in case it is<br>
cold, and either I or someone will bring a grill to cook on (and maybe<br>
keep warm?)  After the gathering, those interested can meet at<br>
Peppino's (an Italian restuarant) nearby for reminissing and<br>
celebrating our filling the WI Italy boot to beat MI in the county<br>
contest.<br>
<br>
I would be looking for someone to volunteer to carve a gathering stamp<br>
as I can't guarantee my time.<br>
<br>
Also, the gift exchange will be voluntary - not applied to all that<br>
come.  Since there would be no postage expense for the gifts, I'll set<br>
the gift cap off at $10.  If you would like to be involved in the gift<br>
exchange, let me know when you tell me you're coming.<br>
<br>
Oh, and the shelters are near the Bark Park, so bring your dogs to<br>
help keep us warm and to go find Sophie's Box!<br>
<br>
I'll try to get a gathering website up sometime mext week.<br>

Are we hiding stamps in that area, (around the Wynn Arts Center)?  Sophie's box is already there, but we'd like to hide another one in honor of my favorite Christmas movie of all time.  Please let me know.  We'll be there with treats and beverages to share.....and maybe a few new friends for everyone to meet!<br>
