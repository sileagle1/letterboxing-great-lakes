Looking at the map, it's the right place.  For those on or near the <br/>
BNSF West Line Metra, you can get off the train at the Hollywood or <br/>
the Zoo stop.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you can make it!  It's a neat place!<br/>

Have you ever gone to Google Moon and zoomed in all the way??  (-:<br/>

I carved an event stamp last night, and am going to carve mini stamps to go<br/>
along for Micro-Meets 1-5.  You know how sometimes Scouting and other events<br/>
will have a main patch and then have year bars (etc) to add onto it for<br/>
subsequent attendance or participation?  Well, if you've attended any of the<br/>
previous Micro-Meets, you will be able to obtain the event stamp and<br/>
appropriate add-on mini stamps.  Those who can't make the July 1st event can<br/>
request to receive them as a postal - details to follow.<br/>
