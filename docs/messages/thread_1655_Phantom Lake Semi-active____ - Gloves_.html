DOH!  Why didn't I think of that before?  My extra pair will be going into<br/>
my letterboxing backpack tonight.<br/>
LOL, you should see me trying to get some boxes out of their hiding places<br/>
using sticks like salad tongs  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for mentioning the gloves!<br/>

&gt; Hmmm - I bet this is the one we were looking for, LOL!  We were <br/>
&gt; thinking that was where we should have been looking, but I want my <br/>
&gt; gardening gloves before I try that one again - I am not overly found <br/>
&gt; of the aracnids that live in that kind of habitat, LOL!  We went to <br/>
&gt; look last week, however, we had to head off of the trails before we <br/>
&gt; could search due to incoming rain - Ugh - and with lightning, well, <br/>
&gt; I am not willing to risk it with the children with me.  Someday, <br/>
&gt; perhaps November or December when the creepy crawlies are not so <br/>
&gt; fierce, LOL!<br/>

&gt;  We hid a bunch of boxes in January, so I suspect things are<br/>
&gt; &gt; VERY different now (I know a certain woodpile that houses one of <br/>
&gt; our boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; is virtually obscured from view by vegetation now - requires much <br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; diligent searching).  A good tactic might be to look for boxes in <br/>
&gt; the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; season they were placed, to have better luck recognizing landmarks<br/>
&gt; &gt; mentioned.  Of course a lot of snow could even mess this up...<br/>
