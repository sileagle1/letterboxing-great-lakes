                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know there were a few people from this message board working on the <br>
Treasure's Trove book after it first came out. All the clues in the <br>
book have been figured out and the tokens found, unfortunately. <br>
But...but!...a solution guide has come out and it shows how to decipher <br>
the clues. I purchased it on Amazon and it is really interesting. I am <br>
kicking myself for not being able to figure some of them out, but I <br>
have to be honest with myself, I never would have in a million <br>
years! :) Some of the ideas in there might make for interesting <br>
letterboxes...<br>

I got sooooo into Treasure's Trove I even did a letterbox for it - it <br>
is a mystery of course called "Zac and Ana's Wedding Guest Book". To <br>
date, no one has found it and there is a bauble in it! The book was so <br>
absorbing I actually went out twice looking for Pook.  Early on, I <br>
believed that one was at Newyago SP in MI, but after I heard several <br>
people went and didn't find it, I gave up (acutally, I have to work for <br>
a living) and it really was there.<br>
<br>
They were all so difficult, even with the solutions, I too don't think <br>
I would have solved them on my own.  Waiting for my copy of the <br>
solution book.<br>
<br>
Look for the next one in September.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I was intrigued by this conversation and picked up a copy of both <br>
the original Treasure's Trove book and the solution book.  OMG...  <br>
this is incredible!  I am in awe by this guy's creative ingenuity <br>
and how he has embedded clues and pieces of code into this wonderful <br>
story and its illustrations.<br>
<br>
It has been great reading through the finders' stories and following <br>
the thought process for solving each of these.<br>
<br>
I was even more pleasantly surprised to find that there is still a <br>
14th treasure at large (and possibly more after that?).  I had <br>
thought that once the Crystal Pook was found in Newaygo State Park <br>
that they were done.  Not that I think I have a chance in a million <br>
of finding it, but it is still much more fun trying to work through <br>
clues that are unsolved than those that have been figured out <br>
already.<br>
<br>
I haven't been able to put this down since I picked it up on Friday.<br>

that I took my original book that and punched holes in it in put it <br>
in a 3 ring binder and bought a second book for "show".  <br>
<br>
His next book will be world-wide.  Hopefully someone in the great <br>
lakes area will find the mystery box related to Treasure Trove - it <br>
even has a "jewel" for the first finder.<br>

Have a great week and here's hoping that this weeks BINGO will be <br>
more fruitful for LindaFay!<br>
