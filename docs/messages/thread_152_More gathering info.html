                    <div class="plaintext-content">I scanned a map of Moraine Hills SP and Chain o' Lakes SP today.  <br/>
They will be placed into the "2004 Gathering" folder in the photos <br/>
section.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see from the maps, there are a number of places that one <br/>
can drive to, park, and go LB hunting at both parks. (There are also <br/>
a number of other nature preserves in the area.)  There are also a <br/>
number of trails.  Let's do this:  If you are planning to do a box <br/>
or series of boxes on your own (i.e. you make, you hide) for the <br/>
gathering or for permanent placement in either of these parks, just <br/>
let me know what picnic area or trail you plan to place it/them on.  <br/>
Then I'll use the other trails/picnic areas for the boxes that I'm <br/>
asked to place.  That way we won't all be bunched up.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
As for the "night boxing", I think if we are going to do it, it <br/>
would need to be done at Chain o' Lakes, since Moraine Hills closes <br/>
relatively early (8pm), although CoL closes at 9 pm.  If I can find <br/>
(or someone knows of) a place open later that we could use for night <br/>
boxing, we'll do it there.  I think to allow as many as possible to <br/>
try them, I'd prefer to have them available for both Friday night <br/>
and Saturday night (planted Friday and picked up Sunday with the <br/>
other non-permanent boxes).  Granted they'd be technically available <br/>
during the day, and it would be okay to find them then, but <br/>
the "fun" would be to do them in the dark as intended.  I still <br/>
don't know all the details about night boxing, but I'm willing to <br/>
make this series and do the research, but if anyone else out there <br/>
would really like to give this a go, I'd be more than happy to hand <br/>
it over to you (how about it Melinda?)  I have some ideas I could <br/>
share too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! One way we can get the attention of annonymus letterboxers to <br/>
our gathering and to this group is to have some of you plant some <br/>
new boxes and include in the box and in the clues a note informing <br/>
letterboxers of the gathering and the group.  We did this with the <br/>
REI letterbox for our WI gathering in March. ( <br/>
http://home.wi.rr.com/dragonlber/REI%20Letterbox.htm )  If we did <br/>
this even for one box in each state, then those letterboxers that <br/>
only check the "new" boxes list will see information about the <br/>
gathering and the group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your ideas that keep coming in!  They are very <br/>
helpful!  We still could use more workshops given by people!  <br/>
Possible ideas - mounting stamps, making hand-made log books, <br/>
planning a letterboxing vacation, etc.  And, we can ALWAYS use more <br/>
boxes for the event! ;-)<br/>

boxes will be permanent and some will be taken by their owners after <br/>
the gathering.  I hope to have more details on Thursday evening <br/>
after I place all the boxes and write the clues.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a "head start" you may be able to get the clues via an <br/>
attachment from me on Thurs night or stop by my campsite at Chain o' <br/>
Lakes (Turner Lake South #15) on Friday after 4:00 pm.<br/>

Dragon, I'm ok--emailed you last night, but you may not have <br/>
gotten it because of the attachment.  I sent a new e-mail this <br/>
morning with clues right in the email.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to make a hitchhiker called "Acorn's Wandering Keys."  <br/>
As I headed back to my car yesterday after an afternoon of hiking <br/>
around, I realized I had lost my keys.  On the way to the car, I <br/>
looked in a few of the places I had been, but no luck.  I had <br/>
visions of offering a reward to any letterboxer who found them.  <br/>
When I reached the car, there they were on the front seat.  <br/>
Apparently, they did not want to join me for a day of fending off the <br/>
rain and the mosquitoes.  This is not the first time they have <br/>
decided to stay in a place when I have decided to go.<br/>
<br/>
I know we're all going to Moraine Hills for the letterboxing, but <br/>
don't forget the wildflowers and creatures that initially attracted <br/>
us to outdoor activities.  <br/>
<br/>
In the last week and a half, I have seen numerous deer, muskrat, <br/>
possums and racoons.  Kate pointed out more toads than I ever <br/>
would have seen on my own.  My favorite siting was a fox, the first <br/>
I've seen in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
As far as birds, the birding's been great.  I'm no expert, but I've <br/>
sited cranes, great blue herons, turkey vultures, red tailed <br/>
hawks, jays, chickadees, bluebirds, black birds.  I spent a good <br/>
15 minutes watching a family of sandhill cranes--mama, papa <br/>
and baby--foraging from a distance of 30 feet (before the <br/>
mosquitoes drove me away).<br/>
<br/>
There are irises, spiderwort, nightshade, buttercups, and <br/>
waterlilies among many other blooming plants right now.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing you all on Saturday.<br/>

Well, if I don't show back up at the site, and searching reveals nothing, rest assured that I'll be happily lost, birding away.  Even warblers, those pesky little birds that flit from branch to branch so quickly, are sometimes easier for me to find than boxes.  *grin*<br/>
