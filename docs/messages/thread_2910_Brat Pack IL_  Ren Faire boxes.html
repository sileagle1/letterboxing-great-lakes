KissmeKate gave us some tips on being annoying to make people go <br/>
away ;P and on how to pick things up without looking like an <br/>
oddball. Allthough, the Faire is not a place where many are there to <br/>
judge Im sure. LOL<br/>
<br/>
We are ALSO lucky in that we letterbox with a 2 year old. Lets us <br/>
sit at the trailside and dig through bags without looking like we <br/>
are up to something. We can also look like we are searching for <br/>
something we dropped... all kinds of fun 2 year old related excuses <br/>
for milling around the same spot, or moving to a different one. <br/>
<br/>
When hes with, no one looks twice! (And hes always with! Watch for <br/>
us walking - or riding - with a red blue and yellow bike <br/>
trailer/stroller. LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday at the Faire, when the rain was coming down - the handy <br/>
umbrella worked wonders on hiding in plain site! Another bonus to <br/>
rainy-day boxing!<br/>
