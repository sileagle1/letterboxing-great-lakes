The cars were rusting, and the bird poop all over it was gross (I'm currently taking a little break right now from revising mycology lectures, and I can't help but think "Cryptococcosis!!" whenever I see pigeon poop.).  Like that other "sculpture" they used to have in Cermak Plaza with all the junk welded together.  <br/>
<br/>
I have nothing against modern definitions of art, and I'm just as sentimental as the next person (sometimes WAY too sentimental for my own good!).  Quite honestly, I'm disappointed that the landmark for the long-gone letterbox is gone, (I remember when it was one of the handful in this area, and alas MIA before I started in '04), but I won't miss the Spindle itself.<br/>

Hey, Acorn<br/>
Thanks for the heads-up.<br/>
I remember well searching (and finding!) that cool location.<br/>
It was my first greater Chi box.<br/>
*I* thought it was pretty neat -- bird poop notwithstanding.<br/>

Where is YooperAnn these days, anyway?  We remember meeting her at the very first Great Lakes Gathering... and she was among the early finders of several of our Upper Peninsula boxes.   Looks like her box at Sugarloaf is still OK after 5+ years...<br/>

  I think you're right. See this post on the big list: <br/>
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/19777<br/>
<br/>
  Where is YooperAnn these days, anyway? We remember meeting her at the very first Great Lakes Gathering... and she was among the early finders of several of our Upper Peninsula boxes. Looks like her box at Sugarloaf is still OK after 5+ years...<br/>
<br/>
  Guess it's time for a re-watching of the "Wayne's World" movie, in homage to the car sculpture.... (Yes, I have the box set with the sequel, too...)<br/>

  Sad to hear that odd curiosity is gone. Wasn't the "Cars on a Stick" box Yooper Ann's box though? I seem to recall a story she told about replacing it a few times and her son carving the stamp or something like that.<br/>

  Some of you old(er) timers may remember Crappie Fisher Girl's "Cars on a Stick." Looks like <br/>
  we'll never have the opportunity to revive that letterbox 8-( They demolished "The Spindle" <br/>
  last Friday night.<br/>
<br/>
  Here's the link to the story: http://www.chicagot ribune.com/ news/local/ chi-<br/>
  spindle_both_ 04may04,0, 874034.story? track=rss<br/>
<br/>
  If the link doesn't work, it's a May 4th story in the Chicago Tribune, "Curious pay respects to <br/>
  felled 'Spindle'"<br/>
