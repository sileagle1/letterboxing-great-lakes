<br>
I sometimes accidentally find geocaches when I'm out boxing, so I created an account on the www.geocaching.com website so I could log them in. I haven't ventured further into finding caches on purpose, because 1) I don't have a gps, and 2) I like the thrill of being able to figure out the clues of letterboxing.<br>
<br>
I just discovered that some geocachers plant "letterboxing" caches, or hybrid caches. They use typical letterboxing style clues instead of gps coordinates. If you are a premium member at the geocaching website, you can search JUST for those types of boxes. But even if you are not a premium member, and search using just the free search, you can still see the letterboxing caches.<br>
<br>
To see if there are any of this type in your area, go to the geocaching website and type in the zip or city that you want to search for. When the results come up, the list can be very long. I find it more helpful to click on the link in the shaded blue box that says "search for caches using google maps". When the map comes up, the boxes will be shown on a map and you can zoom out or move the map around to get more results. The listing of caches is in the bottom right corner of the screen. If you scroll through that listing, any boxes that have a blue envelope icon next to it are the letterboxing type caches. Even if there are hundred of caches showing up on the map, too crowded on the map to see all the icons, the listing will list them all so you can scroll through.<br>
<br>
I was able to find a couple in my area, and they are in locations that I would be boxing at anyway, so I can add them to my list to find.<br>
