However, I DID post clues today for a box that I planted last weekend.  The box was created by Kilroy (letterboxers in Florida) and was one of the items in my "prize box" from the BINGO game last year.  I saved the box to plant until this winter, when we could really use some of that "Florida Sunshine"!  If you want to check out the clues, you can find them here:<br>

You'll be dreaming of Florida in order to solve the clue...<br>

Thanks for the fun.  Hopefully we'll have time this summer to do some WI <br>
boxing!<br>
