<br/>
Process Boxing is a system in which each member of the letterboxing party copmletes their task in the same way at each box location in order to be as streamlined as possible.  Some of our tasks included:<br/>
Clue reading, box retrieving, holding the umbrella, announcing the inclusion of a logbook, holding the shared black inkpad, announcing, "clear!" when we were done.<br/>
<br/>
Our logbooks stayed dry, we found 21 before lunch and even made it back in time to be included in the last couple of photos!<br/>
<br/>
You guys ROCK!<br/>
