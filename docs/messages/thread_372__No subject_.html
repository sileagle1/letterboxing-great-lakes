Subject: Calling all Rockford, Illinois Area Letterboxers<br/>
Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
I'm just stared letterboxing this summer and I really enjoy it. I've noticed<br/>
a surge of boxes placed in the Greater Rockford Area. I was wondering if any<br/>
boxers in the Greater Rockford area would like to start a Letterboxing Club?<br/>
We could meet once a month, or once every few months, perhaps at Barnes &amp;<br/>
Nobels or Borders. I thought it would be a great way to meet other letter<br/>
boxers in the area and trade stamps, stories, and tips.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is intrested, please e-mail me off list at coyotetrix@yahoo.com<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought =)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Laughing Coyote<br/>
Cherry Valley, IL<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks!  I started a new job last August and this resulted in my  <br/>
being very busy.  As a result, I didn't do any boxing for a long  <br/>
while.  Recently, though, my schedule has gotten a little more  <br/>
manageable so I have tried to get back into boxing.  Unfortunately,  <br/>
my husband and I have had a run of bad luck -- three times in a row  <br/>
we've failed to find a box and had to go home empty-handed.  :(<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the main point of this post is to make a couple of  <br/>
announcements.  First, at long last, my original box, "Say Yes to  <br/>
Michigan" has been replanted.  I'm sure everyone had given up on it,  <br/>
but today we found a new spot for it in downtown Lansing and are  <br/>
crossing our fingers that it won't go missing for a third time.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I have placed a box at Central Michigan University in Mt.  <br/>
Pleasant to commemorate my job there.  It's called "The Owl of  <br/>
Athena."  My stamp carving skills are improving and I'm rather proud  <br/>
of it (though it doesn't compare to the elaborate stamps that I have  <br/>
seen in other people's boxes!).<br/>
<br/>
Both boxes are listed on LbNA.  Hope you like them!<br/>

Hand crafted are special because they are hand crafted, and the maker put a lot of time into the design and carving.  But store bought have good things too.  Mostly I like them because they stamp fully the first time.  We have come across hand crafted stamps that have no support, like a wood back, and they don't stamp the whole image.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for all your kind thoughts and memories of Dad.  Mom and I went to the cemetery today (ironically, he's buried in the same cemetery where the first letterbox he ever found, Cemetery Stroll #1, is located).  I left a stone with my 2007 sig stamp for him.  We then visited "his" wolves at the zoo, and the polar bears, where we enjoyed watching Emily and Joseph Cottontails "triplet" brother, Hudson, at play.<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet Dad is having fun being surrogate grandpa to Joseph!<br/>

Seoul, South Korea<br/>
<br/>
Good morning favorable competitors and losers by destiny.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Kim Lee Park and I would like to thank you for inviting us to humiliate you on the field of Olympic battle. We are looking forward to meeting you happy athletes and pushing your noses in the snow. In the spirit of favorable manners and friendship, I have amiable things to say to welcome each of you to the familyof6 glorious freezing event.<br/>
<br/>
To Australia, we like your Paul Hogan and upside down architecture.<br/>
<br/>
To England, we find your Big Ben very loud and are amused by the humorous hats worn by your palace guard whose chin straps never fit.<br/>
<br/>
To Switzerland, we are looking forward to placing our massive winnings in your famous banks and drinking your cocoa.<br/>
<br/>
To Sweden, we saw video of your inebriated chef. We saw him make drink of beer and vegetables. To make more palatable, we suggest to bury it in a pot for several months.<br/>
<br/>
To U.S.A. we thank you for putting fence through the middle of our country. We also admire your funny comedian people like Bugs Bunny, Pauly Shore, and Rush Limbaugh.<br/>
<br/>
To India, I am sorry, but we know your name is not "Raymond".<br/>
<br/>
To Greece, we admire the foods of palatable quality that you are famous for, like spinach and olive lubricant.<br/>
<br/>
To Iceland, we are looking forward to see your olympic uniforms that make you all look like swans.<br/>
<br/>
To the Netherlands, your freedoms are facinating to us, but in Olympics, please do not bring any needles or prostitutes.<br/>
<br/>
To Austria, we love your amusing animals with pockets like kangaroo and wombat and find amazing your habit of eating beermaking waste on toast.<br/>
<br/>
To Finland, we very much like your majestic reindeer. Most of the time on barbecue.<br/>
<br/>
To Denmark, your dogs are very large. Also would like on barbecue.<br/>
<br/>
To New Zealand, kiwi fruit we find to go well with reindeer and dog.<br/>
<br/>
To the Bahamas, we offer our congratulations in finding fame and majesty in bad Beach Boys song.<br/>
<br/>
To Japan, our brothers in the sea. Please do not kill all our dolphins. Also, could you please tell us the correct way to get the time from 12:00 on our DVD players?<br/>
<br/>
To Jamaica, your bobsled team is honorable. Please accept our gracious gift of instructor in proper hair hygiene.<br/>
<br/>
To Guatemala, yes, you are here, too.<br/>
<br/>
To Germany, we admire your beer and oompahs, but sauerkraut could use some spicyness and fish juice.<br/>
<br/>
To Italy, we promise, we will have rest of money in two days. We very much are accustomed to kneecaps.<br/>
<br/>
And to Canada, land of moose and hockey pucks, we offer our condolences that Rushis not a proficient enough rock group to enter Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<br/>
<br/>
Again, we offer our welcomes and looking forward to seeing you all stand humblybeneath us ondais of glory.<br/>

Yes Mr. 6 you are a big big snob :)  Ok not really, actually I felt the same way you did, so I must be a snob too!...WAY too much going on in the shelters!  I tried just to find the boxes that were listed as traditionals, but on the table SOMEWHERE, do the exchanges I needed to do (which weren't very many), and I STILL spent like 3 hrs in the shelter.  All I wanted to be doing was getting out and boxing!  Meanwhile the Mr. was bored out of his mind!!! (This also happened at another event, so we ended up splitting up, i stay in and get exchanges, etc. and Mr. goes out in the wild to find boxes....he's not the social type).<br/>
<br/>
 I think a small amount of table tops is ok for those that just want to sit and be social, but I would rather the hikes, but maybe not too many boxes that I wouldn't be able to get them all in a day or two.  I think location is a biggy too....I would rather be in one spot and box box box rather than have to drive around a city.  Makes it a bit easier to meet with other boxers and tag-a-long.  Not so easy when the backseat of your car is full of carseats!  As a team, we really just enjoy the boxing aspect of it, it is so wonderful to see the variations of talent!  The more and more boxes I find here in the midwest I realize that the great lakes area has a wealth of talent, and I can't wait to find more!!<br/>

Indoor events are definitely different than outdoor ones.  Indoor are probably better described as "letterboxER gatherings" than "letterboxING gatherings".  Many of the winter gatherings are just meant as doldrum-breakers, waiting for the good weather to return.  <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I myself prefer to refer to postals and LTC's (took me a long time to break from using "ATC's"...I still don't like the phrase) as mail art.<br/>

Yep, we have a little bean roasting! ;)  We expect her (yes, it's a <br/>
girl) arrival around the end of October/early November.  We'd actually <br/>
just found out about the little bean two or three days before the Winter <br/>
Olympics event, and considering how much I've/she's grown since then, I <br/>
certainly can't imagine trekking through the knee-deep snow to get the <br/>
silver metal at this point! :P<br/>

You were not alone on that thought.  It was too overwhelming for me.  I won't speak for anyone else, but I think others agreed and wanted to find traditional boxes.  At your winter event though, I was glad to have those because the snow was too much for me.  It also didn't seem as overwhelming.  <br/>
