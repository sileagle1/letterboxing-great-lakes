                    <div class="plaintext-content">Reading posts and conversations last night caused me to think...(ok, thinking isn't my strong suite, but..), maybe the other side of the debate needs to speak up. Here I go!<br>
<br>
I was enthused about LBCon from the very first mention. Biased speaker, here, please take note!<br>
<br>
A lot of comment has been made about drawing attention to ourselves by holding the Con. I find that hard to substantiate. By using a site where groups frequently gather to hold bizarre ceremonies (anybody NOT notice the t-shirt on the statue? or the papers taped to the sidewalk? or the 'wedding' notices in the dining hall?), we were simply another group.  I talked to a dozen locals and/or staff while on campus. Not one asked about what we were doing.  Most asked why I was on campus. Simple answer? I was getting together with my hiking buddies from around the country. They liked that and moved on to asking about my hometown or my gear.<br>
<br>
We had newbies. Oh, yes, and stunning newbies they were, some of them. Truly personalities that made an impact on my mind. HOWEVER..and here's the grand part...because they were at Con, we were able to redirect some of the more remarkable notions.  It was great to sit at the exchange tables and hear a dozen attendees all make similar comments to the newbies, reinforcing each other.  I think the newcomers got a crash course in stealth and box qualities. Wouldn't that be something if we could do that for EVERY newbie? Yeah, I know, dream on. But still!<br>
<br>
Did the St. Louis area have a surge in finders? Probably, but most of us were so busy with the campus boxes, there simply wasn't time to go roaming. I say most. I'm well aware there were traveling packs of exceptions. One particular group of 14... ;>   The campus boxes, including the night hike boxes, gave sufficient variety in clues that nearly all the subgroups had representation.  The one downside I found was we needed more boxes. No, I wouldn't have gotten them all if we'd had more. On the other hand, more would have spread out the crowd a bit.  I found the ratio of hunters:hunting locations to be a bit dense and spent a lot of time lurking back 100ft with a book while I waited for the crowd to clear. On the third hand, I got to talk to a lot of boxers who came upon me as I was stamping in and that was a BLAST.<br>
<br>
I have more thoughts, but this post is already too long :)<br>

 <br>
If you are referring to the pack of 14 I was with, while we did ALL carve  <br>
and hide a stamp (_http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=121150_ <br>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=121150) )  together. We did <br>
*not* find any boxes other than those specifically placed out  at the campus <br>
for us.<br>
 <br>
There was a box very near our dining location that we passed up.<br>
 <br>
So let me reaffirm everyone that we did not jeopardize any traditional  box <br>
off campus by slack or slink boxing.<br>
