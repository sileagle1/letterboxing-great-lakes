Okay, so she is my daughter and I think she is the grandest, but she <br/>
and I will be hosting a mini-gathering for exchanges (she has already <br/>
carved an event stamp).  <br/>
<br/>
This gathering will take place at the location of the "Is it time for <br/>
Tea?" letterbox.  Now, if you are unable to solve the location, email <br/>
me off-list and I will help you.<br/>
<br/>
I have reserved 8 places for "Tea and Sweets" at 3:15pm.  In the last <br/>
year, many more letterboxes have arrived in Lucas County, so if the <br/>
weather is fine, come early and look for some boxes.  Aunt Phoebe's <br/>
purse will be added as a bonus box to the current Aunt Phoebe's <br/>
Letterbox.  Details to follow.<br/>

becasue we did a mini-gathering with Warrior Woman and it was so much <br/>

Lots of fun!<br/>
