The library will allow us to bring food in for the event, so if there is something that someone REALLY desperately wants to bring to share that would be ok.  However, we did sort of plan this around meal times...it's late enough for people to catch lunch before hand and ends early enough that most people could go home for dinner if they don't want to go out to eat afterwards.<br/>

&gt;Hey, forgot to ask on earlier post &amp; since this is my <br/>
&gt;first "Gathering", are we needing food?  If so, since we're meeting <br/>
&gt;at the library are we just doing finger food type items?<br/>
