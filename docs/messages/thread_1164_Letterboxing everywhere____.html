Deedle & I decided to have a tailgate picnic in his<br>
pickup truck at the one nature reserve lake around<br>
here.  After we were done eating, we decided to<br>
explore the one trail around the lake, and of course,<br>
as we're walking, we start doing the "Hey, if we were<br>
to place a letterbox here, we could say to look for<br>
this in the clues..." and before we knew it, we had<br>
complete clues to plant a new box...now we just need<br>
to create the box to put there :)<br>
<br>
And then, last night we were in Dick's Sporting Goods.<br>
 Don't know if any of you are familiar with the "Life<br>
is Good" t-shirts (they have a simple picture on the<br>
front, usually involving the creator's stick figure<br>
Jake, and then a short line of text under the graphic,<br>
usually the phrase "life is good.").  They were on<br>
sale, so I started to flip through them, and found one<br>
with hiking boots for the graphic, and the phrase "Not<br>
all who wander are lost" on it.  I giddily ran over to<br>
Deedle - "Wouldn't this be a perfect Letterboxing<br>
shirt?"  Needless to say, I'm wearing it today....<br>
<br>
In 2 weeks we go letterboxing over-board; we're headed<br>
to Southern Ohio and the Chillicothe area to find a<br>
slew of boxes planted out that way.  Thanks to those<br>
who personally emailed us with tips for our trip!<br>
