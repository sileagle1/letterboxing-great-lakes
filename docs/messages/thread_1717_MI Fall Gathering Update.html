pages with attendees and Clue Stamps.  If you are planning to attend <br/>
the MI Fall Gathering at Yankee Springs SP on Oct. 22 and aren't on <br/>
the list, please drop me an e-mail so I can include you.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some really neat ideas for the Clue Exchange Game and <br/>
I'm looking forward to seeing some of these stamps (The Stinky Cheese <br/>
Man?).  If you want to play the Clue Exchange Game at the gathering, <br/>
or just want to contribute a stamp for the game, please see this page <br/>
for further details.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/events/051022_game.asp<br/>
<br/>
Also, we are still looking for more letterboxes to plant at Yankee <br/>
Springs SP in time for the gathering.  We encourage you to head over <br/>
there within the next couple of months to plant a box or two, or if <br/>
you can't make it to the park but would like to contribute a <br/>
letterbox, we will plant it for you.  See the Gathering web page for <br/>
more details on this. <br/>
<br/>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/events/051022_main.asp<br/>
<br/>
I have received some great suggestions for the workshop and will be <br/>
putting up a poll within the next few days to see what people are <br/>
interested in.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to try and get some information up on the web page about <br/>
possible lodging if you are coming from far away and would like to <br/>
stay over.  I did have a question about camping and thought I would <br/>
mention that the Yankee Springs State Park campground is open at the <br/>
time of the gathering.  You probably don't need a reservation, but can <br/>
make one at the park's web site if you would like.<br/>
