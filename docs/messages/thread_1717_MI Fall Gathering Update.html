                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've finally gotten through my e-mail and have updated the Gathering <br>
pages with attendees and Clue Stamps.  If you are planning to attend <br>
the MI Fall Gathering at Yankee Springs SP on Oct. 22 and aren't on <br>
the list, please drop me an e-mail so I can include you.<br>
<br>
There have been some really neat ideas for the Clue Exchange Game and <br>
I'm looking forward to seeing some of these stamps (The Stinky Cheese <br>
Man?).  If you want to play the Clue Exchange Game at the gathering, <br>
or just want to contribute a stamp for the game, please see this page <br>
for further details.<br>
<br>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/events/051022_game.asp<br>
<br>
Also, we are still looking for more letterboxes to plant at Yankee <br>
Springs SP in time for the gathering.  We encourage you to head over <br>
there within the next couple of months to plant a box or two, or if <br>
you can't make it to the park but would like to contribute a <br>
letterbox, we will plant it for you.  See the Gathering web page for <br>
more details on this. <br>
<br>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/events/051022_main.asp<br>
<br>
I have received some great suggestions for the workshop and will be <br>
putting up a poll within the next few days to see what people are <br>
interested in.<br>
<br>
I am going to try and get some information up on the web page about <br>
possible lodging if you are coming from far away and would like to <br>
stay over.  I did have a question about camping and thought I would <br>
mention that the Yankee Springs State Park campground is open at the <br>
time of the gathering.  You probably don't need a reservation, but can <br>
make one at the park's web site if you would like.<br>

If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail either Azobox or <br>
myself.  Looking forward to seeing everyone at the Gathering!<br>
