Hey Ginny!<br>
<br>
Are you going to be in the Mackinac Island area over the 4th of the July<br>
weekend? If so, maybe we can meet up to do an exchange....<br>

Wisconsin Hiker-- wish I was but I will just arrive in Kalamazoo by train<br>
then-- dang maybe then I could learn more about this -- I am really excited<br>
and<br>
interested-- I will be in St. Ignace July 5th-- leaving on the 7th-- then<br>
Back on Mac Island July 20 - 23 and July 34-27-- I will be on Bois Blanc<br>
July<br>
9-16th-- renting a cabin there-- in between time I am going to Bay City MI<br>
to<br>
see the tall ships, and Big Bay MI to stay at a lighthouse B & B. Let me<br>
know if we can connect up on any of those dates-- I could always take the<br>
ferry<br>
over to Mac on July 6th--<br>
