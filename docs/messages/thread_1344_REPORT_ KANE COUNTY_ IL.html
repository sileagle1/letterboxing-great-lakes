What can I say?  A fun time was not had by all on this search.  :-)  But<br>
seeing the Windmill was impressive.<br>
<br>
It was more than a bit of a physical challenge.  This isn't a box for the<br>
physically un-adept or the physically klutzy.  Didn't have to use it, but<br>
was sort of glad I had the first aid kit in my backpack "just in case". :-)<br>
And I'm not too sure if anyone too terribly overweight would be able to take<br>
this trek either.  But a searcher finds out pretty early into the trek just<br>
what they're in for.  Ancient had to turn back.  No way would Ancient be<br>
able to "duck thru the hole in the concrete" and then "walk the creekbed."<br>
I didn't "duck thru the hole" either tho.  I decided to do a commando<br>
up-an'-over the concrete wall rather than a "duck thru".  Of course, then I<br>
found out that the ground on the side I was coming *from* was a little<br>
higher than the ground on the side I was going *to*.  Not a pleasant<br>
experience when that happens -- oops! :-)<br>
<br>
But what I needed in my backpack more than anything was blood!  Good<br>
old-fashioned blood.  I had thought I'd sprayed down with Deep Woods Off<br>
fairly good this morning, but the mosquitoes thought otherwise.  I think I<br>
lost half my blood on this trek. I more than needed a transfusion or two by<br>
the time I got back to the truck.<br>
<br>
When folks go to buy land in a rural area and ask the real estate agent what<br>
the land is like before they drive out to look at it, the answer often is<br>
"Oh, you know. A little high land. A little low land. Just like all the land<br>
'round 'ere."  Well, this little piece of woods is part of Kane County's "a<br>
little low land."  Lot of muck and swampy type areas.  And tons of skeeters<br>
calling it home.  The clues were a little confusing, but the box was there.<br>
<br>
So I rejoined Ancient back close to the parking lot to where our "creepy<br>
green guy" was sitting in his car.  When we first showed up, there was a guy<br>
in a dark green sedan sitting in the parking lot.  We parked nearby (about 4<br>
spaces away from him) and when we got out of the truck, he started his car,<br>
hit the accelerator, and disappeared out of the parking lot and down Rte 31.<br>
When we got back to the parking lot after I'd found the box, he was back<br>
again, parked in the same spot that he'd been in originally.  Then he<br>
started his sedan and disappeared again.  So we pulled out of the parking<br>
lot about 10 minutes later and drove into the parking lot across the road to<br>
get a look at the Fox River at that point, and there he was!  Again, he<br>
started his car, hit the accelerator, and pulled out right away.  He must've<br>
thought we were stalking him!  Poor guy.  We were going to invite him to<br>
lunch with us at Sweet Tomatoes, but he flew out of the parking lot too<br>
fast.<br>
<br>
2.  Oak Hill Cemetery -- also placed by "Susan and the girls" a little<br>
further north in the Geneva area.<br>
<br>
This was a whole lot less physically challenging, but a lot more mentally<br>
frustrating for us.  Tho it probably shouldn't have been.  Everything was<br>
great right up until the last clue.  We just couldn't find the box.  We did,<br>
however, find a shovel.  Finding a shovel in a woods that's right next door<br>
to a cemetery is a little. bit. creepy. So we left to come back and try<br>
another day.  We were just brain-dead with the last clue and couldn't find<br>
the box.<br>
<br>
3.  WERDHERKARWE -- Secrets at the Waterfall<br>
<br>
Two boxes here, "Da Fox" and "Da Bandit."  Both really nicely carved<br>
stamps -- we loved 'em!!!  Placed by Kim of Nuts4Mice.  Longish but very<br>
nice hike.  The waterfall was sooooo cute.  Frankly, I'm predicting that<br>
these boxes aren't going to last long, altho I sure hope they do.  To us,<br>
the carvings were well worth the hike.  But on the first box, I've got a<br>
feeling a social trail is going to develop and lead folks right to the box,<br>
and the second box is sooo open to sight from people biking at you from<br>
around corners in either direction.  We had to be sooo careful not to get<br>
caught.  But if anyone in the area hasn't found these boxes (they've only<br>
been out there since May 8th), these hand carved stamps are worth finding,<br>
in our humble opinions.<br>
