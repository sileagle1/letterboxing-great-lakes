OK, I'll be right over!  I know it'a a little late, but I'm sure you won't mind a visitor, since you really want someone to find your pickle.  I love looking at ornaments.  I bet you have some unique ones, as I do.  This year, I have a very special s'mores angel ornament.   <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I have 2 pickles on my tree, so you have two chances to find a lucky pickle at my house.  <br/>

That's interesting.  We have the BEST luck with stamps that have NO backing and the worst luck with wood backing on hand-carved stamps.  (Store-bought stamps seem to stamp well, even with wood backing, but we much prefer to find a hand-carved stamp.)  We have found several store-bought images of leaves, flowers and animals - many exactly the same that we have found in other boxes.  The most disappointing are when the image has nothing to do with the box title or the location.<br/>

We send our condolences on this sad anniversary. We never had the chance to  <br/>
meet Boxer, but we appreciate his zeal and love of life. Not to mention his <br/>
love  of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to finding your tribute series to him next month.<br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

Thanks for all your kind thoughts and memories of Dad. Mom and I went to the<br/>
cemetery today (ironically, he's buried in the same cemetery where the first<br/>
letterbox he ever found, Cemetery Stroll #1, is located). I left a stone<br/>
with my 2007 sig stamp for him. We then visited "his" wolves at the zoo, and<br/>
the polar bears, where we enjoyed watching Emily and Joseph Cottontails<br/>
"triplet" brother, Hudson, at play.<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet Dad is having fun being surrogate grandpa to Joseph!<br/>

more like SCRAPBOOKING or a form of CARVING ARTS.  Both of which are<br/>
excellent creative hobbies, but are not letterboxing in my opinion.<br/>

So, I went to this event recently and it was pretty much nothing more than a<br/>
rubber stamping in of table toppers. I wasn't much interested in sitting<br/>
there all day stamping in (even though the stamps were pretty good). So,<br/>
does this make me a letterboxing snob? (LOL) It was more fun to sit at the<br/>
beach with my family. However, don't get me wrong, it was still fun, just<br/>
not what I had expected. <br/>

Are you talking about an event that was specifically for letterboxers, as in a gathering of letterboxers, or are you talking about an event held at, say, someplace like Archiver's, that was geared towards rubber stamping but not letterboxing specifically? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it was a letterboxing gathering, didn't they have boxes hidden with clues available or was it just a meet-up of boxers?  <br/>

We started boxing the last week of November 2006 -- my first gathering was  <br/>
Feb 2007 (SILO). I was SO overwhelmed with exchanges/cooties/event  <br/>
stamps/personal travelers that I didn't have much fun at all. Not to mention  every <br/>
time I looked over at Skeeter (age not-quite-five at the time) she was  <br/>
just sitting there by herself. I didn't have any time with her and just didn't  <br/>
enjoy the <br/>
near-heart-attack-at-all-the-stamps-to-be-collected-must-not-miss-one  atmosphere. <br/>
<br/>
Shortly thereafter I decided that I would no longer do ANY cooties (I just  <br/>
give them to the kids to pass onto the next), PTs or event stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I get the main event stamp, saying I was there, then I don't do any. I much <br/>
 prefer to meet people and visit and make memories doing that. The Event <br/>
Stamps  that remain as permanent plants I will go back and get someday.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I've been to 16 gatherings and am just a gathering or two from  <br/>
meeting my 400th boxer I have found this to be a breath of fresh air. As I've  <br/>
already met 60-80% of the people there I only have a few new people to <br/>
exchange  with and visit with old friends, play with my kids and just lay back <br/>
and enjoy  the day. This past SILO was one of my favorite events yet -- I had <br/>
a blast with  my daughter and with those in attendance. <br/>
<br/>
Even if someone offers me a PT, I kindly turn them down . . . its like  <br/>
offering an alcoholic a sip of beer -- if I get just one I will become that  <br/>

<br/>
However at outdoor events w/trails, we DO go out w/various people to hunt<br/>
down the boxes - we can socialize while we are walking!  It is nice when the<br/>
boxes are able to be in place for at least the entire weekend or preferably<br/>
even longer.  That means we can leave many of the boxes to hunt down at our<br/>
leisure after the party is over.<br/>

Welcome to the hobby!<br/>
A PT is a stamp that a boxer carries with them on the trail or to an event.  The only way to get it is to know what you need to do to get it.  Usually in the clue it will tell you that you need to ask them a question, give them an answer to a question, or sometimes just ask for it.  Usually they are stamps that are meaningful to the boxer and help you get to know them just a little bit better...but not always :)<br/>
Happy Boxing<br/>

to admit that I do prefer the HOT weather rather than the snowy weather, but<br/>
that is probably because I'm from da Bahamas.  I think this summer has been<br/>
fantastic (although I could skip the mosquitoes ).<br/>

Unlike Bahama Mama and MM, Gunhild and Igor are looking forward to cooler temps...even a few flakes in the air would be welcome over living in this terrarium of heat, humidity and MOSQUITOES.  (Fam of Many..don't even think about equating the word "flakes" to us personally!)<br/>
Ahh, the "good old days" of trouncing in foot deep snow looking for boxes!  Now, that was a GOOD TIME!  Six months ago eh?  Seems so much longer!  We're wondering if  "Letterboxing years"  are like "dog years" where each year equals something akin to seven.....think about it, letterboxing was an infant in 1998 and now is fully grown up in 12 years "real time".  We could be considered old boxers (in more ways than one) by starting on this little journey in 2002...(that makes Spring Chick ancient...) And what about a simple game of BINGO..talk about a time warp!  We tell you, "letterboxing time" is just not NORMAL!  Now pardon us, as we must go and spend hours/days figuring out some clues, planning out our routes for the next adventure...all of which our non-boxing friends think is a total waste of TIME!  What do they know!<br/>

I planned.  At the time it was met with yays from one camp and contempt from the <br/>

about it ahead of time, I usually ask them to please hide it and write up clues, <br/>
even if it is just in a bush outside the shelter.<br/>
<br/>
I've been to events where there are a couple dozen boxes out on the table, boxes <br/>
that have nothing at all to do with the theme of the event or are not any kind <br/>
of special series or traveling series and there are some people who enjoy <br/>
sitting inside stamping these boxes all day.  While the special series are nice <br/>
once in a while (Boch's Circus, etc.), it's not really letterboxing and I would <br/>
rather have my events be about getting out on the trail to find boxes and/or <br/>
socializing with other letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
I've participated in a few music-related postal rings on AQ this past winter.  <br/>
While they are fun in their own way, I by no means consider it letterboxing and <br/>
it bugs me when it is referred to in that way.<br/>

If that makes a person a letterboxing snob, so be it...  you're in good company!<br/>

STAMPS!  :-) We would, of course, make sure we could get as many of the <br/>
actual boxes at the event before finishing the table top boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Then, after a few gatherings, we realized that we missed all the <br/>
possible exchanges!  DOTH!  So, we started to put exchanges above table <br/>
toppers.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we tend to ignore many of the table-top boxes unless we've done all <br/>
the traditional letterboxes, got as many exchanges as we can, and have <br/>
some extra time.<br/>
<br/>
I think table top boxes are nice, and they have their place in a well <br/>
balanced letterboxing diet.  In addition, they seem to offer a way to <br/>
distract the younger crowd who can't do as much hiking, the older crowd <br/>
or the 'lazy' crowd (please don't take offense at that, I'm proud to <br/>
count myself in that camp from time to time) who chose not to do so much <br/>
hiking.  In addition, I like some of the recent gatherings that are <br/>
purely table-toppers since there isn't any hiding what the gathering <br/>
will be.  I wouldn't call you a snob, I would just mark you down as <br/>
knowing what you like.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Olympics...yea...seemed like AGES ago!  Oh man, that was FUN, <br/>

&gt; Amen!  Several years ago I began requesting "no table boxes" at the events that <br/>
&gt; I planned.  At the time it was met with yays from one camp and contempt from the <br/>
&gt; other and inevitably people still bring a table box now and then.  If I know <br/>
&gt; about it ahead of time, I usually ask them to please hide it and write up clues, <br/>
&gt; even if it is just in a bush outside the shelter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been to events where there are a couple dozen boxes out on the table, boxes <br/>
&gt; that have nothing at all to do with the theme of the event or are not any kind <br/>
&gt; of special series or traveling series and there are some people who enjoy <br/>
&gt; sitting inside stamping these boxes all day.  While the special series are nice <br/>
&gt; once in a while (Boch's Circus, etc.), it's not really letterboxing and I would <br/>
&gt; rather have my events be about getting out on the trail to find boxes and/or <br/>
&gt; socializing with other letterboxers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've participated in a few music-related postal rings on AQ this past winter.  <br/>
&gt; While they are fun in their own way, I by no means consider it letterboxing and <br/>
&gt; it bugs me when it is referred to in that way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If that makes a person a letterboxing snob, so be it...  you're in good company!<br/>

&gt; So, I went to this event recently and it was pretty much nothing more than a <br/>
&gt; rubber stamping in of table toppers. I wasn't much interested in sitting there <br/>
&gt; all day stamping in (even though the stamps were pretty good). So, does this <br/>
&gt; make me a letterboxing snob? (LOL) It was more fun to sit at the beach with my <br/>
&gt; family. However, don't get me wrong, it was still fun, just not what I had <br/>
&gt; expected. <br/>
