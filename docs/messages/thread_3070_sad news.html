We are so very sorry to hear about your Dad's fatal heart attack this <br>
morning.  Please know that we will be praying for you and your family <br>
in the days and weeks ahead.<br>
<br>
I remember meeting him at the winter mini-meet at the PAW. It was such <br>
a treat to see his willingness to get involved with the likes of us <br>
crazy boxers! ...And to whisper in his ear the answer to his personal <br>
traveller evoking the kid-like grin on his face as he exchanged his <br>
stamp that revealed a little part of his unique personality.  <br>
<br>
We rejoice that you were given an extra bit of shared, quality time <br>
with your Dad in these last months as a result of letterboxing...for <br>
that we all can be grateful.  He will be missed.  Our condolences to <br>
you on the loss of a great Dad, to Papillion, for a wonderful <br>
grandfather and to your Mom for loosing her loving husband and best <br>
friend.<br>

We are so sorry to hear your sad news--our thoughts and prayers are <br>
with you and your family.  As others have said, I am glad you were <br>
able to spend time with your dad while letterboxing--that was a real <br>
blessing.  He may have come late to letterboxing, but it sounds like <br>
he really enjoyed it.  In fact, we just got an email from him on <br>
Friday--telling us about one of our missing boxes.  <br>

at this time.  <br>

Your dad showed us that no matter how old or young you<br>
are, take what life has to offer and expand your<br>
opportunities.   <br>
<br>
I am sure in spirit, he will be walking with you and<br>
being your guardian angel along the trails. <br>

Since I don't regulary check email over the weekend I<br>
just read this now.  Even though Jeff & I haven't had<br>
a chance to meet you in person yet, just from reading<br>
all your posts over the years, receiving postal<br>

everyone else has said, now you do have a letterboxing<br>

those wonderful trail memories to share so that your<br>

We never know what to say in this situation.  We met your father on a <br>
couple of occasions and enjoyed talking with him.  He always seemed <br>
really happy to be at the different letterboxing events.  Our thoughts <br>
and prayers are with you and your family.<br>

My sincere condolences and heart felt loss go out to you and your <br>
family.  I have chatted with your father at the past GLG and at the <br>
PAW.  He was so excited about his Egyptian series he was thinking about <br>
and that he had started carving.  Its sad to see someone so vibrant to <br>
our community pass on.  But just remember, he will be watching you from <br>
above, and perhaps help you on seveal occasions to find that elusive <br>
box when you need it most.  Stay strong, you have a wonderful support <br>
group here, although I am sure you already knew that one.  <br>

Atomic Beans...especially Atom...<br>
We are so sorry for your loss and will be praying for you and your family.  We just lost our <br>
(Tiptoe's) 97 y/o grandmother in July and understand the huge void created when the <br>
patriarch (or matriarch) of the family is no longer there.  It really is a blessing to have had <br>
them in our lives for so long where they had the time and opportunity to really impact our <br>
lives to great depths by seeing us well into adulthood.  <br>
<br>
We were so looking forward to seeing you at the gathering.  Know that you both will be <br>
missed, but in our thoughts and prayers!<br>

Your grandpa sounds like he was a wonderful man.  What a blessing <br>
that he had such a loving family as well.  And that you have so many <br>
nice memories to share.  <br>
