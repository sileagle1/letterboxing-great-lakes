 <br>
It was a wonderful afternoon and sunset sail that they experienced aboard Bindlestiff. The guys even "pushed" her past her max theorietical hull speed. Life in the fast lane on our sailboat is 8 knots. LOL!<br>
 <br>
They more than fufilled their portion of the exchange yesterday, but giving us an absolutely fantastic time flying over northern Lower Mich but allowed us to borrow their car to go on a reprovisioning trip as well. <br>
 <br>
While we had a car and were somewhat in the area (snicker .... like 2 hours away) we made a run over to see if we could find the elusive Interlochen Nature Trail letterbox.<br>
 <br>
Wooo-hooo!  Happy to report we found it on our first attempt!  Geez oh pizza ... this guy doesn't get much traffic.  Last visitor were several months ago.  We gave the old stump some additional bark type coverage while we were there.  The exterior plastic bag has some chewing evidence, but the box is in great shape otherwise.<br>
 <br>
In addition to the boxes we've already placed during this trip, we've gotten a few more planted.  Since I think we'll be land based most of today, I hope to have the clues for all of them posted by late tonight. Just gotta work around that pesky doing-things-with-the-people-who-let-you-stay-in-their-home stuff. LOL!<br>
 <br>
Enjoy!<br>
