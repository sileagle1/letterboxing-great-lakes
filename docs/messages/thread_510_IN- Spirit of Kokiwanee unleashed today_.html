                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I decided not to go to Indy, but to complete the<br/>
stamps for my Kokiwanee series. You see, I was a<br/>
counselor at Camp Kokiwanee its second-to-last summer,<br/>
1995 and have been wanting to do a tribute. Even<br/>
though it's no longer a camp, it's still a beautiful<br/>
place to hike, picnic, etc. I planted 5 boxes and<br/>
there *might* be a hitchhiker as well. <br/>
<br/>
Spring Chick: Glad to hear you are now able to box in<br/>
your hometown! I'm trying to plant more in my area as<br/>
well in the hopes that "If I plant them, they will<br/>
come". <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had a happy and safe weekend!<br/>
