Thank you Wisconsin Hiker.  I'll be the first to admit that I might miss some little detail by reading emails in the middle of the night; or morning depending on how you look at it.  But that's the only time that the house is completely quiet and I can do creative things without interruption.  <br>
<br>
When I received his email, I knew that the package would not arrive at his work address by 9/18, so I replied to him and decided to sit tight and waited for the different address.  <br>
<br>
If I don't hear from The Dragon, I'll attempt to contact SnowCat through AQ. <br>
<br>
Tonight, I'm building fairy houses.  ???  I'll tell you more about them at the gathering.  <br>

  OK, I found it. Apparently he only sent it out via AQ, instead of posting<br>
  to this group. Here is what it said:<br>
<br>
  Event: WI Letterboxing 10th Anniversary Gathering<br>
<br>
  In case you did not see the post on the GL site, please ship boxes to the<br>
  following address so they arrive by 9/18. If you will be shipping them to<br>
  arrive later, I will have a different address to ship them to soon.<br>

  No, he DID send a message saying not to send to him any more and that he<br>
  would have a new address to use soon. I'll see if I can find the email...<br>

  This is what happens when I'm up too late reading and writing emails at<br>
  2:00, 3:00, 4:00 am. Maybe I just read The Dragon's email incorrectly. I'll<br>
  mail it in the morning to that Jackson, WI address.<br>
  See you at the gathering.<br>

  I thought the previous email said TO send the boxes to his work??? Anyway<br>
  my box was sent out last Monday to (IIRC) an address in Jackson, WI. I<br>
  didn't receive a second email . . .<br>

  The Dragon sent out an email not to mail letterboxes to his previously<br>
  posted work address because he won't receive them in time. But I don't<br>
  have the new mailing address. Hoping that The Dragon or someone else<br>
  can provide me with the new mailing information. See everyone at the<br>
  10th WI Gathering!<br>
