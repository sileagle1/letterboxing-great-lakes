------------------------- <br>
<br>
Due to lack of time, I decided to skip the clues [here are the clues; http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/?gBoxId=214018]<br>
<br>
(I deleted out a paragraph of spoilers)..... then to Shawn and Daniel (headstone).<br>
<br>
as I was getting the letters I needed for the clue, a car pulled up and stopped. I got the letters and started walking when a man gets out and asks, "find what you need?"<br>
<br>
I didn't know if he was a letterboxer or not, so I asked him, "what do you mean?" He answered to the effect of whether I found the information I needed or not.<br>
<br>
Still not sure he was a boxer or not, I said that I did -- just names and dates. He then said, "That's my wife, and the stone in front of her is my daughter-in-law. They died within 6 months of each other."<br>
<br>
OH MY GOSH!!<br>
<br>
I gave my condolences and told how sorry I was for his loss. He noticed the wreaths were knocked over and he went over and picked them up -- to be honest, two thoughts ran through my head #1) how do I get away from this guy without it being any weirder than it is already. And #2 how thankful I was that I didn't say I was a friend or family member of one of the them -- that surely would've not gone well for me.<br>
<br>
I finally made my exit and walked toward my van... I drove to the other side of the cemetery until the man left. I went back in pursuit of the next stone . . . . Either way, I found the box... and as I was stamping in ANOTHER car pulled in to the same headstone for Shawn and Daniel that the man had been at. It must have been the anniversary of death or a birth date or something.<br>
<br>
Glad I got the box though with limited clues.<br>
