<br/>
We had a great time chatting and exchanging tonight. We were delighted <br/>
to see an unexpected visitor - Azobox from MI!  I think there were 21 <br/>
of us passing books around, a few special stamps, talk of carving <br/>
techniques, boxing adventures and misadventures, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
In other words, your typical "what happens when boxers get <br/>
together"!!  I think some of the waitstaff were a bit mystified by <br/>
what was going on, but I don't think anyone asked any questions.<br/>
<br/>
Well, better get some sleep before the BIG event tomorrow!<br/>
