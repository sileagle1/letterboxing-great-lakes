Are you still up to helping carve the stamps. I'm thinking it will be somewhere in the area of 25-30 stamps total and am thinking maybe we should do them in duplicate so if one does go missing it could be replaced immediately. I already know the first 7-8 stamp images or types of images I'm looking for.<br>

Still trying to locate Nick's bag with the other clue sheets will send them as soon as I find it. My dad's going into Northwestern for Heart Surgery on Wed. so it might be a while longer.<br>
