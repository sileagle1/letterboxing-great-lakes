I got the F100 stamp!<br>
It only took a year in wait!<br>
I got the F100 stamp!<br>
But the stamp is really great!<br>
<br>
I won't have it for long,<br>
as I need to send it on its way,<br>
but if in the F100+ club you belong,<br>
you can stamp it too on Friday!<br>
<br>
Meet me in the "hall",<br>
where one can eat some food,<br>
near Rocky's at Bayshore Mall,<br>
6:00 - 7:30 pm if you're in the mood!<br>
<br>
I'd say park on the west by Applebee's,<br>
for the east is in the dark,<br>
with building projects as they please,<br>
and no real place to park.<br>
<br>
Then by Applebee's you enter,<br>
and the trip is short,<br>
walk east through the center,<br>
to the middle of the food court.<br>
<br>
There you'll see a Dragon,<br>
with a pony tail,<br>
probably with a flagon,<br>
but probably not full of ale.<br>
<br>
I hope you can make it,<br>
and let me know if you will come,<br>
for I don't just want to sit,<br>
so email me at tkuehl@wi.rr.com.<br>
<br>
Dragon<br>
(Yes, THIS Friday - 1/14.  Sorry for the short notice but I just got<br>
it in the mail today, and it needs to move on quickly!)<br>
