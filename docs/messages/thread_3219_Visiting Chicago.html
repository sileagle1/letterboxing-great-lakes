seminar on November 7-9.  I thought I might utilize the train from <br>
O'Hare to downtown and box a little, assuming there is something I can <br>
find on foot.  Could anyone recommend a particular box to find?  Also, <br>
I'm staying in Naperville/Warrenville, if you have any suggestions for <br>
that area.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there -- I have not looked for any boxes within the city limits as of yet [am moving back <br>
there shortly and want to "save" them for then -- meanwhile I look for suburban boxes]. <br>
But there certainly are a lot of interesting ones listed!<br>
<br>
If there was a way for you to get to the Elgin area via el I would suggest you look for the <br>
Cottontails' Masterpieces series. But there really isn't. Naperville is about 40 miles from <br>
the Loop.<br>
<br>
Have a great time in Chicago and I hope you have good weather.<br>
