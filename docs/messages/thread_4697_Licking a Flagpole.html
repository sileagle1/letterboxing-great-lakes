&gt; It's been below zero the whole weekend, but might climb up to plus 5 <br/>
&gt; later today.  As a result, I decided to hunker down the whole time and <br/>
&gt; try to cleanup my computer room. It has been overrun with books and <br/>
&gt; TONS of letterboxing stuff for quite a while.  I made a dent <br/>
&gt; yesterday, but still have lots to do today.  In between the work I've <br/>
&gt; carved 2 stamps.<br/>

&gt; What have the rest of you been up to?  I assume it's been pretty cold <br/>
&gt; almost everyone in the Great Lakes region...<br/>
