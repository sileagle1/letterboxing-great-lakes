Has anyone ever thought about sharing the hobby of letterboxing?   <br/>
Our town (Streator, IL) has a local hobby council that meets on a <br/>
monthly basis and is a group of people with different hobbies.    <br/>
Every 3rd weekend in April, the hobby council puts on a hobby show at <br/>
our local armory. This year will be the 56th show. It is considered <br/>
the only Hobby Show in America  I was contacted today by one of the <br/>
members to see if the group would want to participate and show the <br/>
hobby of letterboxing.   There is no fee to display and the event is <br/>
open to the public.  The only rule is that if you setup, you can't <br/>
tear down your display until the closing night of the show which is <br/>
Saturday.  I told them I would find out and let them know next week <br/>
if people are interested.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of the exhibits that are displayed in the show are:<br/>
<br/>
John Deer Tractors<br/>
Model Cars<br/>
GI Joes<br/>
Tea Cups<br/>
Coins<br/>
Stamps<br/>
Quilts<br/>
Model Airplanes<br/>
Amatuer Radio Operators<br/>
Dinosaurs<br/>
John Wayne Items<br/>
Water Color Painting<br/>
A model 3 Ring Circus<br/>
Trains<br/>
Civil War Re-enactment<br/>
Barbie Dolls<br/>
Coin Banks<br/>
Xena Princess Warrior Items<br/>
Eagles<br/>
A Custom Chopper Bike<br/>
Baseball Cards<br/>
A Cane Chair Maker<br/>
WW II Collection<br/>
Lego's<br/>
...and many more, overall there is usually about 70-100 displays each <br/>
year.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in participating in this let me know.  I was <br/>
thinking about maybe posting some letterbox history, sample clues, <br/>
and showing off stamp carving.  <br/>
<br/>
Who knows? Maybe there will even by a special event stamp for those <br/>
who make it down.  <br/>
