these boxes be planted for??<br/>

Spring Chick &amp; Old Shoe sure made the annual West MI Fall Gathering one to remember.  <br/>

are still walking heel-to -heel just for the "heel" of it!  <br/>

We actually found 18 letterboxes on Saturday!...Hmm, lets see...that is about 16 more than <br/>
we found last year!  Before any of you think that we finally "got it," be reminded that <br/>
Grandvilla and Mobius Klein graciously agreed to lead us throughout the park for the <br/>
afternoon - after all, they did help hide some of the boxes!  We even nabbed two more <br/>
from last year.  Leaving 4,678 combined boxes to find in that park when we return!  Just <br/>
kidding!  Only like 4,676... We also once again failed to find our own box hidden in there!  <br/>
Spring Chick and Mobius Klein assured us it was still there.  <br/>

The 5-box carousel series at Pine Bend park will stay in place as<br/>
permanent boxes (although I may move one or two to different hiding<br/>
spots).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">No problem!  The fall gathering is traditionally a very laid back affair -- come and go as meets your needs... the schedule for the day is *very* loose -- early morning socializing, sig stamp exchanges...  followed by letterboxing.  The only thing that is pretty "on schedule" is the potluck, just so people know when to be back at the shelter for food.<br/>
<br/>
The clues will be available in the files section of this list the night before the gathering.  Printed clues will also be available at the shelter at the event.<br/>
