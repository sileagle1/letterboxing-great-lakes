Oh, the first Boxacon was so much fun and I'm an even bigger fantasy fan, so I'm definitely sad to have to miss this event. :( Somehow I just don't think going to an event 1 week after the scheduled due date of baby bean #2 is very feasible though... and especially knowing what the hiking trails at Lampham are like! ;) :P Well, hopefully most of the boxes will stay in the park after the event, and we can look forward to a big hiking day there in the spring!<br/>

it. How do you plan so many and such wonderful events all the time! You're<br/>
killin' us out here, not being able to make it to any of the local WI<br/>
events! The sci-fi boxacon of 2010 was our first event and it was AMAZING!<br/>
I have no doubt that the 2012 Boxacon will be just as good and we soo wish<br/>
we could come!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though... how DO you do it? LK and I are planning our very first<br/>
event for next October. It will also be our wedding! So... any tips and<br/>
tricks that might help us out?<br/>
<br/>
How soon should we post on AQ? What kind of considerations should we<br/>
prepare for? What do we need to know in order to be a success? How soon<br/>
should we ask people to send boxes for planting?<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts, advise, or direction would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
We miss you all and wish you the best. Hope to see you at the 2012 great<br/>
lakes event in Madison. :) And, of course, you all are invited to our<br/>
wedding/event "Love and Letterboxing". It's going to be October 5th, 2013<br/>
in New Hampshire.<br/>
<br/>
All our best for the new spring lbxg season!<br/>

Thanks for boxing with me last weekend! I had a great time. I still laugh<br/>
when I think about how we stumbled upon 2 boxes while looking for Recipes!<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
There are SO many boxes down there! I was looking at all the ones that IDT<br/>
has planted. Someday we should plan a weekend 'event' there and spend Sat<br/>
and Sunday just getting all her boxes! A lot of them are blue diamonds too.<br/>
