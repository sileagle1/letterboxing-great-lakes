                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I know you asked for "not a chain" but Beef-a-Roo is a Rockford<br>
institution. Bill likes the burgers; I'm a fan of the grilled turkey<br>
sandwich.  Lots of fresh salads.  Each restaurant has a different<br>
theme; they're on the web.  Friendly people, and they even come around<br>
with mints and ask how your meal was.  Great place for a quick,<br>
satisfying lunch.  I usually go to the one at 6593 Lexus Drive, but<br>
there are plenty throughout Rockford/Loves Park/Roscoe.<br>
<br>
In the same neighborhood, but a lot more upscale, is Five Forks<br>
Market.  This is a bistro-style restaurant with lots of light, tasty<br>
fare"mostly sandwiches, flatbread pizzas, salads and tapas.  Sometimes<br>
we ask them to pack a picnic and take it over to Rock Cut SP. They are<br>
at 6565 Lexus Drive.  Oh, and check out the market for a nice bottle<br>
of wine.  When Bill wants to treat me, he gets a jar of lavender honey<br>
there.<br>
<br>
For Sunday brunch, we always like Thunder Bay Grille at 7652 East<br>
State which offers a buffet.  Lots of variety for all appetites at a<br>
reasonable price.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for fancy/romantic, I love Cliffbreakers.  If you go<br>
to dinner early, you can snatch one of the tables overlooking the Rock<br>
River. 700 West Riverside Boulevard.  They also have a Comfort Suites<br>
Hotel there, but it's not like the usual Comfort Suites.  These rooms<br>
are furnished with antiques. My sister and brother-in-law enjoyed<br>
spending an anniversary there a few years ago.<br>
<br>
Rockford doesn't seem to be a big ethnic restaurant town, but I can<br>
warn you to stay away from any Happy Wok restaurant.  Locals<br>
Shutterfly or RaqsEnigma will probably have better information on<br>
out-of-the way ethnic restaurants.  If so, I hope they share here.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

<br>
Nunzio's (5800 N. 2nd St. in Loves Park) is an Italian restaurant known for<br>
its pizza but we LOVE it for the Steak Sinatra.  Our favorite Mexican places<br>
are Dos Reales and Don Pablo's (both on East State Street).  Thai Hut on<br>
Sandy Hollow has great Thai food (although the area is a little rundown).  I<br>
especially like their chicken pad thai.  All of these are casual-dress<br>
types.  Thai Hut doesn't have a liquor license, much to my husband's dismay<br>
(he likes beer heheheh).<br>
<br>
Bet you're planning on coming to this area for "On the Waterfront"????<br>

  Sam's is another Italian favorite.<br>
  The Riverside location is the most convenient coming from the tollway.<br>

950 Halsted Rd (that's 61103 zip if you need it) behind a Walgreens. <br>
It's a little hole-in-the-wall Italian place, but the pizza there is <br>
amazingly good. It is also VERY well priced. We go there and get a <br>
basket of fries and a large pizza for around $10. They don't serve <br>
alcohol but really, the food is so delicious, you won't want anything <br>
but water. If you happen to go there, let us know...we might have to be <br>
FORCED to meet you there!<br>
<br>
My favorite is Italian, so I could rattle off a lot of places, but <br>
nothing beats Giuseppis. :)<br>
