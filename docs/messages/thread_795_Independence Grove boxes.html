We visited Pleasant Valley today, and made a serious attempt at The<br>
Flower.<br>
<br>
Pleasant Valley is still missing the stamp, and the log book is a<br>
sorry bunch of damp newsprint, and The Flower is MIA, as far as I can<br>
tell.  I've attempted contacting the placer, Babybird's Dad, but<br>
haven't gotten any response.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know if these boxes are still being maintained, and if<br>
not, are they up for adoption?<br>
