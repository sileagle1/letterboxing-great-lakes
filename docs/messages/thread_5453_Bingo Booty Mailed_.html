So those of you who are newer, don't worry if you only have General terms!<br/>

I am happy with my selection of words this year... last year I had only 1<br/>
box (my own) I could pick and a small handful of exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
This year I have 5 letterboxes, 9 exchanges and 2 gatherings to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
My "O" column is especially heavy with 1 box, 4 exchanges and 1 gathering to<br/>
choose from.... I had to make a hard decision on which one I would not<br/>
choose.<br/>
<br/>
My "G" column is the loneliest with only Martini Man to keep me company, the<br/>
rest had to be general terms.<br/>
