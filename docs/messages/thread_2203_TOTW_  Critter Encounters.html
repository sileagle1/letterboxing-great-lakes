<br/>
On one of my first letterboxing adventures, I was hiking alone to the <br/>
top of a mountain in New Jersey when I met up with three hikers <br/>
coming quickly down the trail. They told me that they had just seen a <br/>
bear off the trail. We discussed the sighting, and since the bear was <br/>
a hundred yards or so off the trail, I decided to continue up the <br/>
mountain, on full-alert, singing and making all sorts of noise so <br/>
that the bear wouldn't be surprised when I got into his neighborhood. <br/>
Of course, I was walking quite briskly up the slope, jumping every <br/>
time a chipmunk dove into the leaves as I passed by, and finally I <br/>
had to kneel down on a rock by the side of the trail and take a <br/>
breather. Then I noticed something on the other side of the path -- <br/>
it was a rattlesnake making his way down the trail! I froze in place <br/>
until he got well past me, and then continued on my way up the <br/>
mountain. I was still hiking at a good pace, and then I encountered a <br/>
fat black rat snake also coming down the trail right where I was <br/>
about to step. Again, I froze in place, thinking hard about whether <br/>
or not my snake identification skills were up to snuff. I continued <br/>
up the mountain once again, and as I neared the summit, a large <br/>
commotion in the woods off to my left got my attention -- it was a <br/>
flock of wild turkeys scrambling at my appearance. Finally, I arrived <br/>
at the summit, only to find a large buck waiting for me.<br/>
<br/>
I figured that I had wanted to get out and enjoy nature, so I <br/>
certainly got my fill on that hike!<br/>

Hmmm, 'plummeting' does carry the connotation of having had previous<br/>
good luck. We have suffered no disaapointment for several weeks since<br/>
our luck has been pretty consistent.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> We sure hear you regarding the plummeting Bingo!...lots of empty <br/>
spots on our card too....We'd like to change our "Azodate" wager to <br/>
sometime in December....It seems like at least 150 items have been <br/>
called since we were last able to cross off a call!<br/>
<br/>
As for the weirdest, strangest etc. critters found in letterboxes, <br/>
Tonto on several occasions has found critter skeletons next to or near <br/>
boxes.  Now, this doesn't spook him, but it does seem odd to have <br/>
repeatedly found them...cat skulls to be exact..completely cleaned <br/>
skulls - not skeletons.  Not to freak all of you out, but Tiptoe has a <br/>
fascination with skulls (blame it on her artistic bent or the fact <br/>
that she is just plain weird...)and has a small but cherished <br/>
collection of skulls. She was thrilled when the first cat skull was <br/>
discovered and ecstatic with the second..they now enjoy a place of <br/>
honor next to her prized horse and beaver skeletons!  Our adult son <br/>
calls it, "Mom's shelf of death"....She prefers to call it her science <br/>
corner...whatever!  <br/>
We've also found a deer skeleton next to a box, but Tonto refused to <br/>
take home a "too ripe skull"....<br/>
Tonto is thankful that Tiptoe isn't into collecting scat...another <br/>
critter thing often found near boxes!<br/>

Yup, I;ve got one.<br/>
This is reiteration of a message I shared with Doodle n Deedle quite<br/>
awhile back.<br/>
This is the story of my very first letterbox<br/>
placement.  Some background I do NOT like snakes.<br/>
Hmmm, let me repeat, I DO NOT care at all for the very<br/>
IDEA of snakes. It is deeply within me to avoid the<br/>
presence of the slithery creatures.<br/>
So I'm off to plant my first letterbox oh, about<br/>
three and a half years ago (but I remember it as though it were<br/>
yesterday and Artistamp will agree that the story has<br/>
not changed over the years).<br/>
I found the PERFECT place. A short sidepath, down to<br/>
the water's edge, a fallen tree with a large open,<br/>
decayed knothole. Yes, I thought, this is IT. So I<br/>
reached in to slightly enlarge the hole and then<br/>
NEARLY TOUCHING my hand, out crawled a snake. It must<br/>
have been six feet long!!.okay maybe six inchesbut<br/>
it scared the heck out of me. I ran away like a baby.<br/>
But then I thought, holdit,  it WAS the perfect place<br/>
and the snake was probably just on his way somewhere<br/>
else to bask in the sunshine. So (what was I<br/>
thinking?!) I went back. I looked into the hole and,<br/>
lo and behold, no snake. Cool. So I gently settled the<br/>
box into its new home, AND THE SNAKE CAME BACK OUT!!<br/>
I may be a bit slow on the uptake, but that settled it<br/>
for me. I don't even walk down that little path<br/>
anymore and my first box was put elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I also had an interesting encounter with a deer while placing a box.<br/>
That's another story.<br/>

most 'boxers see, too. Thus far, LOTS of slugs on the boxes <br/>
(ewwwww....) and several white-tailed deer very close to trails in <br/>
parks. <br/>
<br/>
Tiptoe and Tonto ~ where are you boxing that you are running across <br/>
all these cat skulls??? I'm pleased to say we haven't seen that... I <br/>
would probably have a hard time looking for the box if there was a <br/>
skull nearby! LOL<br/>

I am lucky I tend to box with an eagle eyed eight year old boy - or I would have stepped <br/>
right on a snake that was slithering across the path while we were hunting words in the <br/>
woods... YIKES!<br/>

I think the coolest thing we've ever seen was a beaver in the river in IL - hmmm, what box <br/>

As for the weirdest, strangest etc. critters found in letterboxes, Tonto on several occasions has found critter skeletons next to or near boxes.  Now, this doesn't spook him, but it does seem odd to have <br/>
repeatedly found them...cat skulls to be exact..completely cleaned skulls - not skeletons.  Not to freak all of you out, but Tiptoe has a fascination with skulls (blame it on her artistic bent or the fact that she is just plain weird...)and has a small but cherished collection of skulls. She was thrilled when the first cat skull was discovered and ecstatic with the second..they now enjoy a place of honor next to her prized horse and beaver skeletons!  Our adult son <br/>
calls it, "Mom's shelf of death"....She prefers to call it her science corner...whatever!  <br/>
We've also found a deer skeleton next to a box, but Tonto refused to take home a "too ripe skull"....<br/>
Tonto is thankful that Tiptoe isn't into collecting scat...another critter thing often found near boxes!<br/>

On the drive to the parking area, we saw a flock of wild turkeys so close to the road that I thought we might hit one if they decided to be stupid and come our way and several deer.  Then, walking the trail the boxes were on in the opposite direction of the clue (I had recieved a report that the third or fourth box was missing, so I started there...all boxes it turned out were in place that day)  Walking down the trail towards the "A" box, I saw a large hole in a tree.  I thought to myself, "wow, if that weren't in plain view of the trail and not quite so far off the ground, it would be a great place to hide a letterbox."  As I was pondering this, part of the hole moved!  Looking closer, I realized that inside this rather largish hole was a sleeping momma racoon....and her baby!  So cute!  The dog didn't notice at all and momma never woke up while I was standing there watching, but the little one was all over the place.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, great topic!  A couple of years back I had a little run in with a mink down near Lake Michigan.  There are several places along the lake where piled large rock boulders have been used to create jetties.  I was walking out on this pier to take a photo for a box I had planted in the area and along comes this little mink.  These things are beautiful, but can be vicious, and there he stood, between me and the shore, watching every move that I made, looking as though he had no intentions of letting me go back the way I had come.  Apparently he lived somewhere down in the rocks and he was either not too happy, or a little too curious as I passed by.  Now let me say that I am not the only person who walks this way -- their is clearly a path worn from fishermen who head out to the end of the pier every day.  The difference is, they head out to the end, they do not stop halfway, I imagine very near the vicinity of the mink's abode.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a complete baby when it comes to animals (well, okay snakes), but having never had a run-in with a mink before and having few escape options that didn't include jumping into Lake Michigan fully dressed with camera in hand, panic was not far from mind.  But I composed myself and took my photos, thinking if I just ignored him, he would go away.  No, he actually inched closer.  At this point, I decided that since these fishermen do this every day, the best bet was to walk further out on the pier (away from the territory protected by the mink).  He followed me a few steps and then retreated back down into the rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I am out at the end of the pier in Lake Michigan, backpack, camera...  no fishing pole.  I looked sorely out of place and felt somewhat foolish for having let a stupid little animal chase me out to the end of the jetty.  You can bet I was shaking as I walked back to shore...  okay, I cheated.  I waited until a group of fishermen headed back and I followed them.<br/>
<br/>
But not one to miss a letterboxing opportunity, the story of the mink has now been preserved in a letterbox clue -- the Mystery Mink.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, reading these posts about snakes, I just remembered another one...  this is an excerpt from a post I made after returning home from Florida last January.<br/>
<br/>
I was down in FL for a few days, in the panhandle, Panama <br/>
City Beach Area.  Before I went I checked for boxes because <br/>
I knew I would have a day to explore and do a little boxing.  <br/>
There were 6 boxes in the surrounding counties, 4 of which <br/>
indicated they had been washed away by the hurricanes and <br/>
not yet replaced.  I headed down with clues to the remaining <br/>
2 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
On Monday, I headed out in shorts and Birkenstocks (not <br/>
my usual letterboxing garb, but hey, it was sunny and 77 <br/>
degrees there -- a record high for this time of year -- it was <br/>
freezing rain and very cold where I had come from).<br/>
<br/>
<snip... #1="" -="" box="" critter="" not="" related=""><br/>
<br/>
Off to box #2...  This one was inside a ritzy, glitzy resort.  <br/>
I tell the guard I am there to visit the Village and he gives <br/>
me a pass, no questions asked.  I drive around the golf <br/>
course and into the Village, parking near the footbridge to <br/>
this tropical-paradisey island.  Very cool.  I follow the clues <br/>
around the island and eventually come out at the bay...  turn <br/>
left and there ahead is the swing I am looking for.  Oops, <br/>
there laying in the sand under the swing is pair of sleeping <br/>
bodies, half intertwined with one another, half intertwined <br/>
with a sleeping bag, half naked -- and sleeping, or at least <br/>
pretending to be sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
<snip... *sleeping*="" -="" critter="" not="" of="" people="" related="" story=""><br/>
<br/>
After about an hour and a half (yes I waited this long for a<br/>
silly letterbox -- good thing I had a book in my pack), they <br/>
arose, dressed, wadded up the sleeping bag and left.  I <br/>
made my way back to the swing...  there was the pine tree <br/>
and the little bush thingie next to it.  Supposedly the box <br/>
should be under this bush/tree thing in some native grass <br/>
and pine cones.  Don't see any pine cones, just a lot of <br/>
poison ivy and some briars.  Carefully stepping over the <br/>
briars and around the poison ivy (remember... shorts and <br/>
sandals), I looked under every nearby tree.  Then kind of <br/>
behind one of them, I see a pile of grass and a couple of <br/>
pine cones...  Hmm, maybe the box lies within.  So, I begin <br/>
clearing away the grass and what do I find hiding there?  <br/>
One very large copper-colored snake who did not appear <br/>
to be happy I had upset his world.  Back through the briars <br/>
and poison ivy I went, this time with less care than on the <br/>
way in...  and I'll be, but that darn snake followed me!  So, <br/>
up onto the swing goes me, my backpack and my scraped <br/>
legs.  Once I decided he wasn't coming any closer, I left.  <br/>
No box.  I did however bring home a souvenir -- little red <br/>
poison ivy bumps all over my feet and ankles.<br/>

<br/>
I just started letterboxing last summer.  Now, I grew up in a fairly <br/>
small town, so I know that you shouldn't put your hand under a rock w/o <br/>
looking 1st, but I was excited about my new hobby.  I was in <br/>
a "Japanese garden" type park, and a box was supposed to be under a <br/>
rock near a pool.  I reached under the rock, and felt something soft, <br/>
but not wet.  I thought "well, maybe this box is actally a bag," and <br/>
pulled it out.  Imagine my surprise (and his ;^) when I pulled out a <br/>
toad!  I'm very proud of myself ... I didn't scream OR throw the toad.  <br/>
The toad didn't seem particularly upset.  When I set him down, he <br/>
looked at me for a moment, and hopped back under his rock :-)<br/>
<br/>
I remember someone suggesting a "T" in my count for # of toads <br/>
found ;^) Hee, hee.<br/>

Other critter moments were when Manic Mechanic and I were out placing <br/>
and checking up on some of my Blackhawk Springs boxes. We were riding <br/>
our mountain bikes on the bike path and I ran over a garter snake. I <br/>
freaked out because I thought I killed it, but when I went over to <br/>
see if it was alright, it tried to bite me! So then, a month or so <br/>
later, I'm riding along with him on a dirt trail and I <br/>
said, "Remember when I ran over that snake?" and I ran over another <br/>
one! That one was fine when I checked it. Right before fall, we were <br/>
walking our bikes down one of the trails and I actually stopped <br/>
before running over yet another one. So I guess those of you afraid <br/>
of snakes should steer clear of Blackhawk Springs in Rockford, IL. <br/>

encounter?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
We had a critter encounter just this past week.  MoneyMan and I went <br/>
out to retrieve the boxes from the "Christmas Around the World <br/>
Series".  As we approached the location for Box #2, we noticed a big <br/>
furry lump, which proved to be an opposum.  Now, this possum was <br/>
lying about 1 foot away from where the box was hidden (although <br/>
there was a section of tree root between it and the hiding spot).  <br/>
The possum wasn't moving, so we weren't sure if it was <br/>
sleeping/hibernating or playing dead or really dead.  We really <br/>
didn't want to make another trip to come back and get the box, so we <br/>
decided to go for it.  I kept an eye on the possum while my husband <br/>
went and got the box.  Now the story would have been REALLY <br/>
interesting if the possum had charged my husband, but, fortunately, <br/>
that didn't happen.  The possum didn't make a move.  I wanted to <br/>
throw a snowball at it as we were leaving (to see if it was alive), <br/>
but MoneyMan wouldn't let me.  <br/>
<br/>
I really do need these critter stories to take my mind off Bingo, <br/>
since we're on Day 10 without a hit now :(<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is a series nearby that Kimono Girl and I have searched for several <br/>
times now.  On one of our attempts, we noticed a large groundhog<br/>
strolling casually alongside the bike trail.  Honestly, I'm used to<br/>
groundhogs being somewhat bold around people, so the fact that it didn't<br/>
scamper off into the woods at the sight of KG and I didn't bother me that <br/>
much.  I was, however, disturbed by its' utter disregard of the two dogs<br/>
straining their leashes.  Two dogs and two people really ought to drive<br/>
most wildlife away, in my opinion.  It was also strange that it was just<br/>
strolling alongside the bikepath, but after a few minutes speculation,<br/>
Kimono Girl and I lost ourselves in the quest for the leaning oak tree.<br/>
Five or six leaning oaks and approximately 2 miles later, having given up <br/>
on that particular box, we were in search of a fallen log when Claire<br/>
gave me a look, shrugged out of her backpack and took off.  Yes, we were<br/>
once again near the bold, bold groundhog.  In fact, he was strolling<br/>
alongside a fallen log (although not the one we needed).  The very odd<br/>
and scary thing is that he was not at all frightened of us.  Even when<br/>
Claire tried to pick him up, all he did was squeak - fortunately, he was<br/>
too large to fit in Claire's mouth, though she tried several times.  That <br/>
is just not normal behavior in a groundhog, I think.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't gone back to get the rest of that series.  I'm wondering what<br/>
the average lifespan of a groundhog is and when it will be safe to<br/>
attempt those boxes again.<br/>

Me too!  It was the name combined with "shrugged out of her backpack", <br/>
that set the scene.  But then I had to do a fast "rewind" when I got to <br/>
the part with the groundhog in her mouth!!!  OK, reread thinking DOG <br/>

with a groundhog in her mouth is very disturbing.  Hmm, and I was just<br/>
telling my students how important it is to be able to communicate<br/>
clearly, regardless of your major - guess I didn't do so well at that<br/>
myself, here.<br/>
<br/>
Claire wears a cute little Kelty backpack from REI, called the Kelty<br/>
Chuckwagon, in which she carries her own logbook and stamp, first aid kit <br/>
and dog treats. Very convenient for me.   Her leash attaches to it, which <br/>
is unfortunate sometimes as she can play Houdini and be free to chase<br/>
groundhogs and other things.<br/>
