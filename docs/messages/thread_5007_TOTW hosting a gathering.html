planting. My first gathering I had a total of 24 boxes. I thought this <br>
was too little, but everyone only found 8 boxes that day. I guess I <br>
wore them out with the clues I had. I was a little disappointed that <br>
they didn't find more, but the weather was kinda crapy that day too.<br>
<br>
The Creepy Crawl was a different format of a gathering but it seems <br>
like the 8 boxes worked out. It took everyone about 3-4 hours to do, <br>
and after being in the rain and cold I think most people were done with <br>
box finding. (Funny how it always seems to rain at my events)<br>
