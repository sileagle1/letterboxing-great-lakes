how well the clues are done!) Least visited? It ties with the Lord's<br>
Finger the and Meshimenconing Boxes. (These boxes are very close and<br>
worth the trip!)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmm...I'm having a hard time thinking of what my most visited box would be.  Maybe Aina's series, although Lance's Fish Tank has seen a lot more traffic this year than I had expected.  Most of mine don't see a lot of heavy traffic, largely because we only have so many letterboxers in the area and we're kind of isolated from the northern part of the state where most IL letterboxers live.  Also, I like to have a bit of a hike to my boxes...my favorite hikes also include rough terrain (well, rough by central IL standards anyway).  <br>
<br>
The least visited would have to be my most recent plant, Alligator August.  I have gotten two reports on this box (one just this week...I'm so glad the rain didn't raise the river enough to carry away my box as it is planted right on the riverbank!).  It's a temporary box planted only for the month of August and I will be pulling it next week after Labor Day (probably Tuesday).   Of course I would plant a box only for the hottest, muggiest month of the year!  And when it hasn't been miserably hot it's been raining.  I wouldn't be surprised if the only two entries in the logbook were from the people who sent me reports.  I haven't decided what to do with it after this month.  I may retire it permanently or maybe alter the image slightly and replant it somewhere else.<br>
