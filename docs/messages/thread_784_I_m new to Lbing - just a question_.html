Is www.letterboxing.org the only place people put their clues for <br/>
their boxes? Or should I say - is that where you all place your <br/>
clues? I've only found 1 box :) and that web site is where I went to <br/>
find where boxes are in my area. <br/>

It isn't the ONLY place, though it probably is the most common.  There are also word of mouth clues and clues that you find in other boxes.  For example, I have a series of 5 boxes placed in one park, but only the clues to the first box are posted on the letterboxing.org website.  The clues to the other 4 boxes are in the box that comes before it on the trail.  I'm sure there are other ways of passing along clues too.<br/>

Check out the files section of this group (menu just to the left in <br/>
the green section). Some members post not-so-public clues here.<br/>

I know that AtlasQuest also has a letterbox clues database, but it also seems that people who post their clues there also post them on letterboxing.org (that's what Deedle &amp; I did - OK, I did - with our so far only plant).  What we do is "host" our clues on our geocities website, and then just post a link in the letterbox clues databases.  This way if we need to change something, we only change it once.  And as others have posted, there are some clues posted in our yahoo groups files, there are also word of mouth clues floating around, clues hidden in other letterboxes....  Do a google search &amp; see what you can find.<br/>
