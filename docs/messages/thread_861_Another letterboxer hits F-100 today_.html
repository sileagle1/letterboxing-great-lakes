I'm actually at F-101 today.  My first find was April 16th of this year,<br>
and most have been found in Indiana - a state that currently lists about<br>
150 boxes.  My farthest find was "Don't Mess with Texas" in July, but I<br>
also have some from Ohio.  Big thanks to the faraway finders of My Dora<br>
series, Connecticut?  Since the hobby is just growing fast here now, I<br>
have had the privilege of many First Finders.<br>

Congratulations, speedsquare!!!<br>

I hit F100 this weekend too -- at Acorn's great Fool's Errand #17: The Star -- and it does <br>
feel kind of nice to see the triple digits at long last.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congrats Speedsquare and Pico! I'm pretty dang close<br>
to 100 myself....only eight more to go! I'll be out<br>
this weekend for sure to get there before the snow<br>
flies (although, i'm kind of looking forward to<br>
letterboxing in the snow!)<br>
<br>
Saturday we went to the Grand Rapids area and did the<br>
Turkey Day series in Grandville. Beautiful stamps<br>
along a really beautiful trail. Even better that it's<br>
near turkey day! Also did the Fate of Easter series<br>
that was too fun. Bill sure is one ugly bunny...but he<br>
kinda grows on you! <br>
