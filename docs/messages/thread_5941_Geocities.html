Yes, I know Geocities is closing.  The problem is that they have everyone on hold until "later in the summer" when they will give us info on how to convert over to Yahoo webhosting.  Personally I wish they would just get us the informaton rather that making us wait and wait.  Once I have time, I will probably just move my site over and not wait anymore.  Ryan probably sent out his email too early and should have waited until Geocities actually comes out with their solution.<br>

It's the first one I've found that easily accepts your own files and doesn't make you use one of their templates.  It works very much like geocities does/did.  I would not recommend them if you want to use one of their templates, they are terrible and difficult to work with.<br>

I'm rather webpage-challenged as my son has helped me set up my site.  I was wondering if anyone had checked Weebly, as I really don't know what to look for and someone had suggested that one to me.  Anyone?<br>
