Workshop at the GL Gathering next month and get a rough idea of how <br/>
many folks are planning to sit in on the workshop.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a $1 charge per person to cover materials.  You will <br/>
need to bring with you your own carving instrument(s).  I have a few <br/>
extra Exacto knives in case somebody forgets or shows up last <br/>
minute, etc. but not enough for the whole group and I do not have <br/>
extra Speedball carving tools.  If you like to carve with magnifiers <br/>
or a mat, please feel free to bring that with you also.  I would <br/>
assume everyone will have with them an inkpad in their letterboxing <br/>
bag, but just in case I will mention that you will want to have an <br/>
inkpad with you to do test stamps of your image.  I will supply the <br/>
carving material, images, transfer medium and a multi-page printed <br/>
tutorial that you will be able to take home with you.  If you have a <br/>
specific image you would like to work on, feel free to bring that <br/>
with you -- the size of the carving blocks is 2" x 2".  The image <br/>
should be printed with a toner-based ink so that you will be able to <br/>
transfer it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for posting carving tips -- I will be including <br/>
these in the handout.  I would also like to include a page or two of <br/>
carved images and would prefer they are not all my carvings.  If you <br/>
have a carving (or a couple) that you would be willing to let me <br/>
include, please send me a clear scanned image via private e-mail.  <br/>
The handout will be B/W so keep that in mind when choosing an image.<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning to attend the workshop, please send me an e-mail <br/>
offlist.  This is not an official count and you can opt in or out <br/>
later,  but I do need to know an approximate count so I can have <br/>
enough supplies with me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
