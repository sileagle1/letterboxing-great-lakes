                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is now official, Peabody and I have established a new tradition of going over the river(s), through the woods and to a letterbox we go on Thanksgiving Day.  It accidentally started three years ago when I checked AQ and noticed at the top of the new box listed for Delafield - conveniently on the way home from my mother's.   The box was Lock, Shock and Barrel's Great American Pin-up Series: Rita - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!  I only truly appreciated it's greatness after I watched Shawshank Redemption.  Today we found the Karate Kid (Thanks, Packer Backers!) - and last year it was the Purple Petunias mystery boxes. <br/>

Hope y'all had Happy Trails today - whether they were to LB's, Grandma's or elsewhere! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found several boxes in Nashville, TN today while enjoying temperatures in upper 60s and low 70s!  We saw Merlin &amp; Ardea and CMoon logged into some of the boxes we found.  Yesterday we saw the Waltzing Pigs logged into a box in Indianapolis.  Of course it was a cemetery box!  We had hoped to hike more yesterday, but it was very rainy so we ended up doing a lot of boxes in Crown Hill Cemetery instead.  Today in TN however was GREAT and we were out on the trails.  Five years ago we were boxing in Texas on Thanksgiving and saw some turkeys on the trail.  Today we saw 15+ turkeys on the trail on Thanksgiving day (and then planted one). Two more full days of boxing down here before we face the aggravation of traffic on I-65 again when we head home on Sunday...<br/>
<br/>
We also hope you all had a great Thanksgiving and are getting those Bingo cards ready!<br/>
