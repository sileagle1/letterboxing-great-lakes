                    <div class="plaintext-content">As many of you already know, the GR Public Museum is hosting a<br>
letterboxing event on February 2.  One of the things going on that day<br>
will be a stamp-carving room -- this is the area I am working to<br>
coordinate.  I am envisioning that this area will be open all day and<br>
people can wander in and out and try their hand at carving if they<br>
wish.  I would also like to try and run 2 structured carving workshops<br>
-- one in the morning and one in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
I am looking for help in the following areas:<br>
<br>
* Instructor -- Anyone who would be interested in leading one of the<br>
carving workshops.  I would be willing to do one of the workshops if<br>
necessary, but really would prefer not to do both of them.  You do not<br>
have to be an *expert* carver to do this, just able to show other<br>
people how to go through the carving process.<br>
* Anyone who could work a 1-2 hour shift in the carving room, just to<br>
be available to answer questions and assist people who are giving it a<br>
go on their own.<br>
* Anyone who could work a 1-2 hour shift in the kids' carving area<br>
(intention is to make foam stamps).<br>
<br>
Also is anyone aware of a carving video/DVD in existence?  I have a<br>
written tutorial, which is great for a workshop set-up, but thought it<br>
would be nice to have a video running during the non-workshop hours.<br>
<br>
The museum will be supplying the carving products.  They are also<br>
providing free museum admission, parking and lunch to everyone<br>
involved with working the event.  So you could help out in the carving<br>
area for a couple of hours and then spend the rest of the day at the<br>
museum and get the letterboxes that will be planted there all free of<br>
charge!<br>
<br>
If you are interested in helping out in this area, please contact me<br>
offlist.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

   <br>
  I am relatively new to carving (only one stamp so far) but I am good at new things and teaching.  I've been a 4-H club leader for 8 years now, and we've tried all sorts of things.<br>
   <br>
  Anyhoo, what I am saying is that I could teach one of the workshops if there is an outline.  I would probably prefer the afternoon one so that I can see the morning class.<br>
   <br>
  If you don't need me to teach I can at least help out.  This sounds like fun and is only a few hours away for me!  I live in Ypsilanti, but have wanted to come to the museum for awhile now - what a great excuse!<br>
   <br>
  Thanks,<br>

I was thinking the same thing, perhaps the Great Lakes region can do a  group <br>
project instructing on how to carve with both a gouge blade and an exacto  <br>
blade, as well as how to make logbooks, etc.<br>
 <br>
Put on YouTube with key words like, "how to carve" or "how to make a  <br>
logbook" unless we want to include "letterboxing" in the keywords for more  publicity <br>
. . . but only those looking specifically for them would ever find  them.<br>
