I do not know if I posted this box yet, but it has been awhile and no<br/>
one has found it! : ( . I am reposting this in hopes that some one<br/>
will try for it. It is fast once you get through the clues (which you<br/>
should probably do at home). Tis box is located around the Cham- Urba<br/>
ice rink, hope it is found soon ; ). cheers to you all and happy hunting.<br/>
 Clue's for Ode to Skating<br/>
<br/>
Intro: The clues following may seem intimidating, they are actually<br/>
quite easy, may I recommend a few web sights:<br/>
<br/>
 http://www.google.co.uk/<br/>
<br/>
BTW read ALL of the clues, for there may be clues in the clues. Have<br/>
fun!!!<br/>
<br/>
1. For a righty if you are about to do an axle jump, what is your<br/>
take-off direction and edge?<br/>
<br/>
2. How many revs are in a double axle?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. In order, what are the ISI basic skating levels?<br/>
<br/>
4. Who competed in the men's Figure Skating event in the 2006 Olympics<br/>
who had also studied at the U of I?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5. Who came in 6th in the Women's figure Skating event in the 2006<br/>
Olympics?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Take the number of letters in each answer (with the exception of #2<br/>
which is a number) and alter them as follows:<br/>
<br/>
#1- divide by 2 for the number of words in the answer<br/>
#2- is already a number just round up for the difficulty<br/>
#3- divided by 3 (the number of sessions it took me to complete all<br/>
the basic levels)<br/>
#4- subtract 7 for his final placing in the 2006 Olympics<br/>
#5- add 16 for the age she was when competing at the Olympics in 2006<br/>
<br/>
 Now take all of the numbers and add them together<br/>
<br/>
 Now divide that number by the number of questions asked (5) and round up<br/>
<br/>
 Now go to the north east corner of the Ice Arena in Champaign-Urbana<br/>
and divide your number by 2, count that number of doors from the<br/>
corner heading south. Walk up the steps towards that door and look in<br/>
the bush north of you.<br/>
<br/>
 Now go skating (there are calendars inside that give you open skate<br/>
times)<br/>
<br/>
Have much fun and don't break a leg (you need both for skating) <br/>
