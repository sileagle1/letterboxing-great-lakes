I'm very excited this morning because a friend of mine just told me she's going to be able to use a very large work-related letterboxing project as part of her M.A. as well. And I'm the one who introduced her to letterboxing, maybe 2 months back!! She was intrigued at the educational possibilities because she travels around the country for the university she works for, putting on seminars for children to introduce them to entymology. Then she talked to her advisor and her advisor said she could use the work project for her M.A. project as well. How about that? Sometimes strange and interesting things happen along the letterboxing chain!!<br>
