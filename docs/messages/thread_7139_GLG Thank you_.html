Papa and Lunagirl for their time and effort planning this event.<br>
Without the direction of our fearless leader :)<br>
we would have been lost.  All of their hard work<br>
paid off.  We have a newfound appreciation the work involved in hosting an event.<br>
<br>
We're sad we had to miss the Saturday night festivities.<br>
We had a great time, meeting new boxers and talking to old friends.<br>
Seeing our LB'ing family grow with new members and new babies is wonderful to watch.<br>
<br>
We went back on Sunday to get a few more boxes and the weather was perfect!  <br>
<br>
We can't wait for next years event.<br>
Our babysitter has been put on notice, LOL!<br>

Yes, a huge thanks to Luna Girl, Papa, Spartan Fans, and the rest of the MI<br>
crew on the great event. We had a great time catching up with our boxing<br>
friends, showing off our new teammate (she was a slave-driver and was sad<br>

and a big apology to everyone for messing up a few of the clues in the big rush to get everything done on time.  :(<br>
