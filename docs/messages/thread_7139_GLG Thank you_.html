Without the direction of our fearless leader :)<br/>
we would have been lost.  All of their hard work<br/>
paid off.  We have a newfound appreciation the work involved in hosting an event.<br/>
<br/>
We're sad we had to miss the Saturday night festivities.<br/>
We had a great time, meeting new boxers and talking to old friends.<br/>
Seeing our LB'ing family grow with new members and new babies is wonderful to watch.<br/>
<br/>
We went back on Sunday to get a few more boxes and the weather was perfect!  <br/>
<br/>
We can't wait for next years event.<br/>
Our babysitter has been put on notice, LOL!<br/>

Yes, a huge thanks to Luna Girl, Papa, Spartan Fans, and the rest of the MI<br/>
crew on the great event. We had a great time catching up with our boxing<br/>
friends, showing off our new teammate (she was a slave-driver and was sad<br/>
