                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I realize that it is May, not April, but the following Team Rabbit <br/>
boxes have some (slight) status changes that some of you may be <br/>
interested in that may not be reflected on LBNA:<br/>
<br/>
Cygnus X-1: Now available again as a single-box find - same ol' stamp, <br/>
same ol' hiding place, some new clues.<br/>
<br/>
A Jedi's Training: Contrary to a status report I received a few days <br/>
ago, it is alive and well - the clues were tweaked slightly in April to <br/>
reflect the change of the trails.<br/>
<br/>
Year of the Rabbit: Brand new Mystery - already received word that it <br/>
has been found (at least once), so the clues do work.<br/>
<br/>
The Fifth Voyage of Columbus: Hibernated for over a year before being <br/>
found earlier this Spring - clues tweaked and confirmed.<br/>
<br/>
Rainy-Day Rabbit: Thanks to BaliGrl, the Rabbit was rescued when her <br/>
home was being turned into a tree fort - she has found a new home, so <br/>
brand new clues, same ol' stamp - 5 years in July!<br/>
<br/>
The Eye: Brand new stamp, brand new location (well, mostly new), brand <br/>
new clues, same ol' horror...<br/>
<br/>
Brown Rabbit<br/>
==:+<br/>
<br/>
...and thanks to everyone that contacts the placers of boxes they find <br/>
(or attempt to find)...<br/>
