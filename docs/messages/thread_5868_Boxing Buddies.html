Depends on the buddy.  AQBuddy is a stuffed animal.  He travels.  Think of him as the ultimate hitchhiker, in many ways.<br/>
<br/>
AQBuddy gets to go where I never will.  Usually, the hosting boxer sends their buddy to me, rather like a student exchange.  My sig stamp will, unfortunately, never make it out to the areas AQBuddy hits with his host, but his sig stamp does.<br/>
<br/>
You'd never dream of objecting to a hitchhiker stamp hitting the pages of a logbook.  Ok, so I'd have to agree four in one go is a bit excessive. Somebody is sure into playing dorm mom!<br/>
