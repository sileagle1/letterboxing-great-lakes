and down for joy::) and we were trying to work out details on where to <br>
stay over Saturday night so we can have another wonderful day of <br>
letterboxing fun (lol) on Sunday. I saw some say that they are staying <br>
at the Holiday Inn Express and others are going to the Best Western. I <br>
must be doing something wrong, because I'm not finding these online. <br>
Could anyone send me the addresses of the hotels and (privately if you <br>
would like) about how much you are planning on spending on a room. We <br>
are both on a bit of a budget, so we're hoping to keep the costs down <br>
to a minimum. If you have any other suggestions (aside from camping), <br>
please let me know. :) Thanks in advance!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You may also want to check lodging in Pewaukee, Waukesha or Brookfield.<br>
Brookfield would be the furthest away from the park, but it still only 12-15<br>
miles away (we live in Brookfield).<br>
<br>
You could go really inexpensive, such as a Motel 6 for ~$55/night to much<br>
more expensive options.  I just did some quick checking and it seems a fair<br>
number of hotels are sold out that night (I'm sure they can't ALL be<br>
letterboxers!!)<br>
