I voted to keep the date close to the original (Memorial Day) weekend.<br>
Now, it just so happens that I've been able to attend each of the events over the past years, so those June dates have worked for me.<br>
As Atom118 notes, there are many variables. <br>
So let's control for *one* of them -- the date -- and leave it where it's been.<br>
<br>
The prospective hosts will at least know the parameters within which they're working and can either move their proposals forward if the date works, or if they can't manage the task on that date, offer to help someone else who CAN do it.<br>
There are active letterboxers in the region who can not even attend an event in the late spring. Likewise, there are boxers who can't attend summer events.<br>
<br>
It's never going to be a perfect fit for everyone.<br>
<br>
That said, I am admittedly a traditionalist when it comes to letterboxing. And the proximity to the end of May/first of June has been the tradition for the Annual Great Lakes Gathering.<br>

<br>
We like the current date, so our "let the host decide" vote has more to do with recognizing that flexibility may help more folks offer to host, book a great park, make it easier for far flung folks with school commitments to attend some of them, etc.  We prefer a date in the first part of the range since, as speedsquare mentioned, weather tends to be muggier toward the end - even though we know that nothing is for certain with weather in our region.  We like gatherings regardless of the date. <br>
