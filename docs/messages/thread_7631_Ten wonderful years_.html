We forgot to post yesterday, but February 3, 2003 was the date for finding<br>
our first letterbox! We discovered letterboxing in September 2002, but<br>
didn't actually go out and see if this crazy notion of hiding stamps in<br>

But, we can say, ten years later, that the places we've seen and the people<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congrats on 10 years, Tiptoe and Tonto! We completely overlooked our 10 year letterboxing anniversary on January 17, the date we found the Wehr Nature Center Box.<br>
<br>
And don't feel bad, Tiptoe. John still makes fun of the slack-jawed look of surprise that was on my face when we finally found that first box. (I think a part of me was skeptical that those silly little clues would actually lead us to something.) But you're completely right—the places we've seen, the memories we've made and the people we've met (including the two of you!) have made this odd little hobby one of our greatest treasures. <br>
<br>
Congrats again!<br>

We forgot to post yesterday, but February 3, 2003 was the date for finding our first letterbox!  We discovered letterboxing in September 2002, but didn't actually go out and see if this crazy notion of hiding stamps in tupperware was the real deal until 5 months later.  We snagged our first box while visiting relatives in DC and on a whim stopped near the AT to find the South Mountain Trinity boxes by Apple Dumpling Gang in Burkittsville, MD.<br>
Finding the first box of that Trinity, the "War Correspondence" box, rendered a tear in Tiptoe's eye...of which Tonto still makes fun!<br>
But, we can say, ten years later, that the places we've seen and the people we've met have made that whim one of the best we've ever acted on!<br>
Thank you so much to all who have given us so much enjoyment!<br>
Tiptoe & Tonto<br>
