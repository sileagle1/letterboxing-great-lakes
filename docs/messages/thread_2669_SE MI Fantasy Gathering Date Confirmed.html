this gathering!! Thank you all for accommodating my move! It looks <br/>
like only 9 of you will be attending if you could e-mail me to confirm <br/>
that you will be there that would be great. Any others interested in <br/>
attending please let me know by August 28th if you are coming. The # <br/>
of people attending will effect the game we play (I may have to create <br/>
more boxes) and food ordered. Also if any of you have a pop-up shelter <br/>
they could bring please let me know. Also any of you who are carving <br/>
for this event I have extended the due date to Aug. 1st. <br/>
Thanks  <br/>
