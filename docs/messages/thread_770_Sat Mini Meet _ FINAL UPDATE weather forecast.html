Hey everyone: <br>
<br>
Looking forward to our mini meet, but the latest weather forecast <br>
looks MORE than a little dicey now. (sigh) So plan on bringing a <br>
jacket .... and an umbrella! <br>
<br>
No sense in wasting a perfectly good event stamp! LOL ... besides <br>
mini-meet participants are going to be the first to get the clues to <br>
the 3 Celestial Celtic series boxes I've placed, PLUS an ever-<br>
changing WOM box that will be in place for the time Team Bindlestiff <br>
are land-dwellers!<br>
<br>
There is no change in the start time of 11am, we're still going to <br>
be meeting at the Cherokee Restaurant.  From then on it's going to <br>
be all 'playing-it-as-we-go' from though.<br>
<br>
Here is the info for the meeting place: <br>
<br>
Cherokee Restaurant<br>
1971 W Sherman Blvd<br>
Muskegon, MI 49441<br>
Phone: (231) 759-7006 <br>
<br>
By going to the following link, and clicking on the left hand menu <br>
bar, you can get driving directions and/or print out a map: <br>

<br>
Back at the house, I am planning on having the banquet tables set up <br>
for some logbook work (cutting paper, binding, etc) and some stamp <br>
mounting.  So even if it rains too much to get out and box, we'll <br>
have something to do! If you have some stamp carving planned, bring <br>
your supplies ... we can always add that to the activities. (I may <br>
work on some more stamps for my "The Fate of Childhood" series)<br>
<br>
Also, if we end up back at the house sooner than our previously <br>
planned ending time of 6-7pm, we can keep an eye on the weather and <br>
maybe make some quick dashes out, for the boxes that are most nearby.<br>
<br>
Bindle Bum has called off the campfire ... no dry firewood for one <br>
thing! However, I have cooked up a huge pot of my world famous ABC <br>
soup. There's plenty of coffee and hot-cocoa mix in the cupboard <br>
too. Anyone who wants to bring disposable cups or bowls, just sound <br>
out ... no dishwasher in this house we're renting. (grin)<br>
<br>
Again, in case anyone gets lost, wants to join us along the way or <br>
you should send an email ASAP. In private email, I've given my cell <br>
phone number to those who have confirmed or expressed interest in <br>
coming to the event; I'm not willing to post in online though. (grin)<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
