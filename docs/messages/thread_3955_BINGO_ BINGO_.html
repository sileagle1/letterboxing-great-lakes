                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was under the impression that the last person to pick a date wins up <br>
until the next person picks a new date.  So Martini Man would win since <br>
a winning Bingo was called between 4/10-4/13.  I apparently would have <br>
only had one day to win: 4/14, since Scoutdogs said she picked Sunday.<br>
<br>
So the lesson for everyone else is that if you did horribly at Bingo <br>
this year (I seem to recall Wisconsin Hiker saying something about <br>
coming in almost dead last last year), you just might have better luck <br>
next year! :)<br>

You're right about that!  Last year I did terrible, but this year both Martini Man and I were "ahead of the curve" for quite a while.  We were definitely more hopeful this year, but each time I only needed "ONE more" for one of the earlier Bingo configurations, someone else would get their Bingo first.  When I saw the word this morning, I knew it was one I needed, but it took a minute or two for me to realize it was the LAST one I needed.<br>
Thanks to SpringChick (& Azobox) for providing this entertainment throughout the winter!  It's funny how much we look forward to finding out what the word is each day.  I wonder if our region is setting a record for the "Slowest Bingo Game Ever"?  In this day & age of "instant gratification" and "short attention spans" it's interesting that a game that lasts months still holds our attention so much.<br>

With the sounds of what many others just posted they have left (for a  <br>
full-card bingo,) I'm afraid I have no hope of winning: I've got 5  <br>
still to go.<br>

I've really enjoyed playing BINGO this winter.  <br>

Now.....shake up those words and let's keep playing.  <br>
