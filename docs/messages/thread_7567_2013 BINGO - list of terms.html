 WiHi, I see a box called "Abraham Lincoln (IL)" in the O column.  An AQ<br>
 search shows two boxes by that name in or near Springfield.  One is by<br>
 Snakes on a Plane and one is by Topcollector.  Which is the right one?<br>
<br>
Also, two different boxes, both by Shorty, called "Egyptians".  One in <br>
Robinson Park and one in Princeton.<br>

Same with the Egyptians - if you have found at least ONE of the boxes in<br>
either series, you can use it as a term.<br>

I never abbreviate my trail name, but others often do.  However I do<br>
sometimes abbreviate OTHER people's trail names when talking about them.<br>
