                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you to everyone who's sent us your warmest wishes and suggestions for our trip.  To those of you who have expressed interest in meeting up for an exchange, the best suggestion I can make is for you to email us _off list_ with a phone number we could reach you at if/when we make it to your neck of the woods (doodle_n_deedle @ yahoo.com).  If you have a Verizon cell phone, that would be esp. cool 'cause my cell's a Verizon.<br>
 <br>
If you do email us a contact number and never hear from us, please don't be offended.  Even though I've spent hours pouring over my maps of Michigan with highlighter and pen to figure out where all these boxes are located, we're still playing a lot of our trip by ear.  Esp. since I'm just getting over a cold and Deedle announced he's starting to feel a little lethargic (_always_ when you're planning a vacation, huh?).  And we also realized that despite the ambitious search schedule for Sunday, we'll be lucky if we actually find 1/3 of those, because oh wait, we're going to a wedding the night before where a lot of my old college buddies will be present, do we really think we're going to be moving before Noon on Sunday.... :)<br>
 <br>
That's all for now.  <br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
