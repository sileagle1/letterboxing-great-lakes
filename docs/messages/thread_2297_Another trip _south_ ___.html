                    <div class="plaintext-content">We decided to head south to Illinois today to hunt a few of the boxes <br>
we ran out of time for last weekend.<br>
<br>
Started out at "Trolley Days" and said Hi! to a few fast bikers on <br>
the trail.  All was well with the box.<br>
<br>
Next we headed over to find "It has class" (found) and "Valerie's <br>
Victory Box" (not found). A good walk in the park though, even on a <br>
fairly dreary day.  We did see a bunch of robins! Then on to the <br>
new "Catch a falling star" box which had a LOT of visitors yesterday.<br>
<br>
Then a nice walk looking for "Squirreling Around" which we extended <br>
by walking over to "Art in the Park".  Very interesting sculptures!  <br>
Our favorite was the face on the big boulder made by an artist from <br>
Iceland. We were disappointed we didn't run into River Rat who had <br>
also signed in to the logbook today.  As Martini Man said, "Rats! no <br>
exchange..."  We also enjoyed seeing so many kids having fun in the <br>
farm area on our way back to the car AND we saw our first real <br>
flowers of the year growing on the side of the Mercker cabin.  A real <br>
sign of spring!<br>
<br>
Next a tricky retrieval for "Viva La Mexico" where we stamped in in <br>
the car.  Too bad we couldn't stay for margaritas, but with a long <br>
drive home, we figured it wouldn't be a good idea...<br>
<br>
Then another nice long walk in search of "What a Scream!", noting the <br>
budding trees along our walk.  We found the box and lo and behold - a <br>
HITCHHIKER!<br>
<br>
Last we were on the hunt for Sternennacht.  As has already been <br>
noted, box #2 seems to be missing.  We believe its home is now the <br>
burned and charred base of a tree. We'll have to make a return trip <br>
when the blue box is available again...<br>
<br>
Thanks again to all of you who hide boxes!!!<br>

P.S.  We hope the "Symbols of the Big Ten" series is replanted - we'd <br>
love to hunt them down on some future trip to Illinois!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wish I would have met you guys and the trail also.  I got an early start yesterday on my way back home to Freeport.  I am kicking myself for not having all the clues for "What a Scream" I would have liked to get a hitchhicker,  Nature Nerd and I went up to Glenview on Saturday and and found quite a few boxes and also went to Grosse Point Light, what a great view of Lake Michigan.  We were spotted by a few bikers who knew what we were doing, I believe they were Honor Guard.  Too bad they didn't have their stuff with them, no exchange but good conversation.  I can't wait till this Saturday.  This is when Nature Nerd, Hiker Babe and I are going to go Easter boxing.  I hope for good weather and hopefully some exchanges.  <br>
