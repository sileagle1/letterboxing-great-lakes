realized, right before we were ready to walk out the door, that we <br>
did not know where our Letterboxing bag was!  And, of course, the <br>
nice, new digital camera was in it!  The last solid place I could <br>
remember having it was at the Milwaukee zoo a week ago Saturday, just <br>
before we were ready to leave, but I know we made a final stop at the <br>
carousel....of course, it was not in their lost and found.  My <br>
daughter says she remembers bringing it into the house, but it <br>
certainly is not anywhere to be  found.<br>
<br>
So, we went long enough to at least get the clues and bought a nice <br>
new notebooks from WI Hiker and Martini Man and got the Gathering's <br>
main event stamp.<br>
<br>
We were very sad that we did not participate in the fun, but Mr. <br>
CatHerder was rather disheartened at the loss of the camera (and thus <br>
not in any mood to go letterboxing, etc.) and me, well, I was sad <br>
about the camera and the logbook!<br>
<br>
Anyway, it looked like everyone was having a spectacular time!<br>

I actually asked the children if the bag was stuffed somewhere <br>
because they were using it to "play" Letterboxing, LOL!  No bites on <br>
that one - my 7 yr old looked at me like I was crazy!  However, I got <br>
no response from the 5 year old....so perhaps there is a chance!<br>
