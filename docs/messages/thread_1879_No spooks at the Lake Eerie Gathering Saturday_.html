up by the afternoon.  Weathermen, however, lie.  The<br>
rain just got worse!  But, despite the weather, it was<br>
another great gathering.  Polly/Bibliophile,<br>
Patty/QuiltsNBees & Fran/Cinniboxer did an amazing<br>
job.  Each attendee had a hand-made log book - the<br>
time it must have taken to make each of those!  There<br>
was bottled water with special "Lake Eerie Gathering"<br>
labels, and a goody bag for everyone that any<br>
letterboxer would have appreciated.  As we were told<br>
when we first arrived at the pavilion, "Keep your eyes<br>
open, there are clues everywhere" - including on the<br>
back of our name tags!<br>
<br>
We showed up just as exchanges were beginning.  As<br>
always, it was great meeting people and being able to<br>
say, "Oh, so you're So-and-So."  And finding out how<br>
people got their trailnames and how they got<br>
interested in letterboxing is always fun, too. <br>
Exchanging led up to lunch and our guest speaker<br>
(whose name I don't remember!) but she spoke about<br>
ghosts and energies and things of that nature.  Then<br>
the boxing began.  It was amusing playing "leap frog"<br>
with SunFleur & her husband (whose trailname of course<br>
I can't remember and I'm here at work so I don't have<br>
his stamp image with me to check) from Dearborn, MI<br>
while looking for the boxes.<br>
<br>
We had about 4 or 5 more boxes to go when the rain<br>
decided to make life very difficult for us.  We<br>
decided to call it a day and headed back to the<br>
pavilion for hot cider & s'mores.  We also got a few<br>
more exchanges with some other later arrivals.  I<br>
think this will be our new strategy for gatherings -<br>
get exchanges and event stamps later in the day, when<br>
people are back at the pavilion but just don't want to<br>
leave yet :)<br>
<br>
I know that Polly's on this list, so a great big THANK<br>
YOU for such an amazing day.  Even with the rain, it<br>
was a hauntingly good time.<br>
