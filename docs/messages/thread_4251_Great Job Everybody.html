When my husband and I went out to collect some of the boxes we had <br/>
planted for the event, he made a comment about how well hidden they <br/>
were. The first group we picked up was the Berma Shave series. He <br/>
didn't think they had been found at all because they were exactly like <br/>
we left them. When we got back to the car we looked in the logbook of <br/>
one of the boxes and saw that tons of people had stamped in. We were <br/>
in shock. <br/>
Then today I went out and picked up the last several boxes to be sent <br/>
back to the carver. Again they were expertly rehidden. <br/>
<br/>
So, thanks for being such a great group of letterboxers!<br/>
