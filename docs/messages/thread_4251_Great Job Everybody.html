<br>
When my husband and I went out to collect some of the boxes we had <br>
planted for the event, he made a comment about how well hidden they <br>
were. The first group we picked up was the Berma Shave series. He <br>
didn't think they had been found at all because they were exactly like <br>
we left them. When we got back to the car we looked in the logbook of <br>
one of the boxes and saw that tons of people had stamped in. We were <br>
in shock. <br>
Then today I went out and picked up the last several boxes to be sent <br>
back to the carver. Again they were expertly rehidden. <br>
<br>
So, thanks for being such a great group of letterboxers!<br>
