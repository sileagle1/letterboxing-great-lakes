                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is interesting that you say this about checking your letterboxing <br>
stuff.  My sister and her two girls were out from CT at the end of <br>
June/beginning of July and they checked their boxing stuff.  The <br>
airline "lost" it, and then gave them the run around for 4 days while <br>
they waited for it to dry out.  When it was returned my sisters <br>
logbook was still damp and now a little mildewey, not to mention that <br>
most of their images were ruined!  I guesss you can say, "Lesson <br>
learned"<br>

  We've taken compasses through in our carry-on luggage lots of times, not<br>
  even thinking about it. Is there a concern it would ruin the compass? It<br>
  doesn't seemed to have damaged ours....<br>
