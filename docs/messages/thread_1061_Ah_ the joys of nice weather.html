                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today was drop-dead gorgeous!  And, I just happened to be in Sullivan for the weekend...so I've started planting my fish series at Camp Camfield.  It felt really good to get out and do some letterboxing for once.  Lance's Fish Tank boxes 1-3 are in place and clues are posted.  Right now all my weekends through June seem to be busy but hopefully I'll be able to sneak away before then to have the rest of the series planted.  My plan is to have all 11 stamps in place for all those late spring/summer vacationers.<br/>
