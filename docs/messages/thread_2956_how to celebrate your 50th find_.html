with our 2nd hitchhiker, I did a quick count, it was our 50th find!!<br/>
It was also our 6th wedding anniversary.  I guess now we have to make <br/>
it official and start planting letterboxes.  We'll have to find <br/>
some better carving materials.  <br/>
Our 16 month old really enjoys putting the boxes into the baggies, or <br/>
baggies into the boxes whatever the case may be.<br/>
