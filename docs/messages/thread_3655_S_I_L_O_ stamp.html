How many people are going to come dressed in red from head to toe, dressed on the outside and underneath too?  The staff at the SILO will be rolling on the floor laughing if 44+ people all come in at one time decked out in red.  <br>
<br>
Fungus Woman and I just had this nice simple idea about having a wintertime letterbox gathering.  Who started all this Chinese merriment and wildness?  Come on....fess up....you know who you are.  And now we're all getting pulled into this silliness too....and loving every minute of it. <br>

Can't wait to see all my RED friends at the SILO.  If you spill some spaghetti or pizza sauce on your clothes, it won't hardly matter.  LOL!<br>

Fungus Woman and Beetle would like to know the answer to this question from people planning to come to the S.I.L.O event.  <br>
Q.  How much red are people willing to wear?  <br>
<br>
I mean, really, how much red is too much...or maybe there's no limit.  Just wondering how far some people will go.   Tee Hee!!!  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, we may not have to answer too many questions from other patrons.  Our group has reserved the upstairs seating at the Silo.  The building was designed to resemble a barn with a silo structure as part of the entrance way, but it never was a barn.  So, we'll be hidden away from all the other patrons, but that's not to say that they won't be wondering - who are all those people dressed in red and what are they so happy about?  They'll may be talking and they may think we're all drunk; but we're just letterboxers!  That says it all!   My family stopped at Silo for dinner the other night and we realized something that made me start laughing.  The paper placemats on the table are...you guessed it....RED!  <br>
<br>
When Fungus Woman and I discussed the planning of this 'little' winter letterboxing event, we knew that we might only have a a couple dozen people who would be free to attend due to weather and travel conditions.  We thought this location was a bit more centrally located between Chicago/Indiana letterboxers and the folks up north in Wisconsin.  It's easy to get there too; just off the highway or toll way.  But it looks like a lot of people will be free to attend that day.  Maybe I should check to see if there is a capacity limit at the restaurant.  If so, the fun will just spill out into the parking lot!  <br>
<br>
I have to inventory my closet for red clothes.  I may have to 'create' a special red look for this event.  <br>
<br>
Fungus Woman carved the event stamp and mailed it to me.   It arrived at my house today.  Another great stamp created by the master carver herself!  But there are two very special stamps that will be available to those who attend this event.  I'm excited!  <br>

See you in a couple weeks!<br>

But it has been my experience that many people are just going through the motions of living and not engaged in the art of having fun.  Life can become very routine and boring sometimes.  Therefore, you need the right mindset and you need to make just a little effort to enable some fun time memories.<br>

ROTFL!!!!  I wonder if we can make it on the front page of the newpapers....Everyone in red, fingers covered in ink,  I think the docs are going to have to create a STAMP ANON group for us all.   "Hi, my name is Big Brat, and I'm a stampoholic.  I can't go 24 hours without stamping, the smell of rubber while I'm carving, or having ink all over my hands."<br>

Do I dare contact the local newspaper?  The Lake Forester (serving Lake Bluff and Lake Forest) usually covers the society and charitable events attended by all the special people.  (give me a break!)  Somehow I'm not sure if they will understand our little group.  The  Waukegan News Sun or another one of the Pioneer Press newspapers might come to the Silo.  <br>

  One of my favorite store-bought stamps says "Certified Rubber Addict" in the middle, with a circle of words around it saying "In some cultures what I do is considered normal." I'll have to bring it along.<br>

  And my 16 year old daughter thought my previous letterboxing escapades were weird. If she only knew what they've degradated to....<br>

  That sounds like an awesome plan!!! But I think besides the workers thinking we're from a looney bin, they would probably think we started drinking a little early that day!! =) OK...now we gotta figure how many dragons we need to make so everyone can join the fun.

There is no 12 step program for letterboxers. We just keep encouraging each other. There's not hope for us. <br>

One of my favorite store-bought stamps says "Certified Rubber Addict" in the middle, with a circle of words around it saying "In some cultures what I do is considered normal." I'll have to bring it along.<br>
<br>
And my 16 year old daughter thought my previous letterboxing escapades were weird. If she only knew what they've degradated to....<br>

ROTFL!!!! I wonder if we can make it on the front page of the newpapers....Everyone in red, fingers covered in ink, I think the docs are going to have to create a STAMP ANON group for us all. "Hi, my name is Big Brat, and I'm a stampoholic. I can't go 24 hours without stamping, the smell of rubber while I'm carving, or having ink all over my hands."<br>
