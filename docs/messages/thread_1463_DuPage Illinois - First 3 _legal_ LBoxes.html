This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I filled out the applications and faxed them.  I think you can email them also. <br/>
The applications are in the files section under "Geocaching Regulations" on this site. <br/>
(Where ever it says geocaching just substitute letterboxing in your own head). There are <br/>
no fees. If the woman at the listed phone number says that there is a fee just correct her <br/>
or ask for Dave.<br/>
If you need any advice along the way let me knw, I've been working with them since <br/>
November through the development of the program. <br/>
