Harvest Gathering last weekend.  Our plans got thrown a bit off kilter <br>
with some unanticipated weather/events earlier in the week and were we <br>
having so much fun exploring Door County and doing the letterboxes <br>
there that we decided to stick with the vacation plans and get to some <br>
of the areas there that we had not gotten to as that was our last day <br>
in WI.<br>
<br>
Sounds like it was a great, well-planned gathering -- lots of fun, <br>
lots of boxes and lots of new people!<br>
<br>

<br>
P.S. Will send individual box reports to owners of boxes we found <br>
while in WI and Upper MI.<br>
