just give a huge thanks to everyone who worked so hard before the<br/>
event to create great boxes, to hide them in devilishly creative ways,<br/>
and to those who provided enlightening and interesting workshops.<br/>
We were pleased to have many new faces among us for this event,<br/>
including several from afar.<br/>
Of course we also thank the Famous Boch's Touring Circus for their<br/>
performance under the direction of the Traveling Ringmaster, Marco<br/>
Peperini.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great day with great letterboxing weather. Thanks again to<br/>
all who made it possible.<br/>

P.S. Early comments suggest that there may be a Dartmoor bug infecting<br/>
some members of the Great Lakes Letterbox community.<br/>
