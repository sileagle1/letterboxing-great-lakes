mean no insult to your response) I was reading on the big list when I<br>
started boxing myself that made me such a crusader in the way I teach girls<br>
about boxing.  Yes, indeed, we preach a GS leaves a place better than she<br>
found it, and I pound it into their newbie boxer heads that they are to do<br>
the same with letterboxes!!  I can't speak for Michigan area GS, but I must<br>
say those here in Illinois who I've dealt with are very responsible.  I'm<br>
sure those who have learned from leaders taught by Beetle are also just as<br>
responsible.<br>

BirdWoman, CMoon is right, the award is only at the Teen level (an Interest<br>
Project, not a badge), but your girls can work on it as a bridging activity<br>
once they're ready to move up out of Juniors!<br>

If anyone is involved with the Girl Scouts, we would ask you to stress <br>
<br>
the importance of rehiding a letterbox after it has been found.  We <br>
<br>
have recently found several letterboxes basically out in the open, and <br>
<br>
the last stamp-ins were from Girl Scouts.  The Scouts have a slogan <br>
<br>
where they always leave a place in better condition than when they <br>
<br>
found it.  Apply that to letterboxing.  Always hide a letterbox better <br>
<br>
than when you found it.  Or at least just as good.  Is this part of a <br>
