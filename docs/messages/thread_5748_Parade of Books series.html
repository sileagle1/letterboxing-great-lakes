                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought I would post this up if anyone had printed out clues earlier and was going to hit this series in the nice weather this weekend.  I checked on the Call of the Wild box near the end of the series today.  I found all the baggies and the stamp.  They were piled up neatly where the box should have been.  The logbook and the box itself were missing.  I will replant this very soon.  Perhaps someone needed the box and the notebook portion of the logbook, in these economic times, who knows.  I'm glad they left the stamp and that I was out there shortly after it all happened so I could retrieve it for the replacement box.  <br>

That would be one incredibly dextrous racoon, to open the baggies, take out the inner baggies, take the logbook out of one of those and leave  undamaged baggies behind.  It is an interesting picture of the racoon though!<br>
