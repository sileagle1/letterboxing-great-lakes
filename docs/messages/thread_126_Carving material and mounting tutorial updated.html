Bindle Babe, what material are your stamps made of?<br>
<br>
Almost all my stamps are on Speedball Speedycut; the "cuts like <br>
butter" stuff, John. The Speedycut is easy to cut on, but it is true <br>
that it can be crumbly; especially if your carving nib is even <br>
slightly dull.<br>
<br>
The other drawback to the Speedcut material is that it is less <br>
durable than rubber-type carving materials.  That's why I mount all <br>
my stamps.<br>
<br>
I just updated the carving tutorial at Picture Trail.  If anyone <br>
wants to take a look this is the link:<br>

Uh-oh ... was that more than 2 posts in an hour?  I couldn't stand <br>
it if a kitten were sacrificed because of me. <br>
