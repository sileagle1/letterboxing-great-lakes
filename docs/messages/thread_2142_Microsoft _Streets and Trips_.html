Subject: [LbGLK] Microsoft "Streets and Trips"<br/>
<br/>
When we were at the Haunted Harvest Gathering this fall, Wisconsin Hiker and<br/>
Martini Man had their laptop out with a copy of Microsoft "Streets and<br/>
Trips", which is kind of like your own personal Mapquest with memory and the<br/>
ability to plot many locations, not just one.  I didn't think I would ever<br/>
use anything like that, but I was wrong!  When I was digging through our<br/>
computer disks, I discovered that we already had the program from when we<br/>

==================================<br/>
<br/>
Hey, glad to hear you like it!  We found out about MS Streets &amp; Trips from<br/>
LightinBug, a letterboxer in Pennsylvania.  We've been using it since April<br/>
and it has been EXTREMELY useful.  We use it all the time and make maps for<br/>
each area or state we will be visiting.  It is much quicker and more<br/>
flexible than an on-line mapping tool.  We use the basic pushpin symbol to<br/>
mark boxes we haven't found yet, then change the symbol to a little flag<br/>
once we have found the box.  Unfortunately we sometimes just change the<br/>
pushpin color to show we looked for it but didn't find it.  We've also found<br/>
the software useful in locating hotels near boxes we want to look for when<br/>
we are traveling. We usually print overview maps that show all the boxes to<br/>
hunt for as labeled pushpins, then detailed maps of the area near each box.<br/>
The one thing we're trying to remember to do is also print a map showing in<br/>
enough detail how to get from one box to another.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, we used MS S&amp;T today. We printed an overview map of the<br/>
area north of Milwaukee that had labeled pushpins for several boxes we<br/>
hadn't looked for yet - all MATHMAN boxes!  Off we went, and we're happy to<br/>
report that we found Mathman 8, 11, 14 and 18.  We're pretty sure we were at<br/>
the right spot for Mathman 2, but unfortunately did not find a box.<br/>
<br/>
These were our first boxes of 2006 and Martini Man also got his first BINGO<br/>
word yesterday.  I haven't crossed off one single thing on MY Bingo list<br/>
yet.  Maybe I should have guessed a May date if everyone is off to as slow a<br/>
start as I am....  I didn't see a word posted for today yet though, and I<br/>
figured today was going to be my lucky day - maybe it will be!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a great idea!  I remember a while back we had a<br/>
discussion on the list about how people keep track of<br/>
letterboxing clue locations, and there was lots of<br/>
talk of maps and pushpins and highlighting (which is<br/>
what we were doing, too), but doh, we have this<br/>
program!  My life has suddenly become so much simpler!<br/>
 I'll never need to take 7 days to plan a letterboxing<br/>
trip again!<br/>
<br/>
Now, of course, I want to start inputting the<br/>
locations for all the boxes we haven't found yet,<br/>
which is kind of hard since alas, I'm at work for the<br/>
next 8 hours....<br/>
