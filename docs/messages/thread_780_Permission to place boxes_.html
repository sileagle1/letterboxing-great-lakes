                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello,<br>
<br>
We are new to this group, but have done a little letterboxing for a year<br>
now.  We learned about Letterboxing on a homeschooling talklist and<br>
jumped right in last Fall.  We came up with a trail name and carved a<br>
personal family stamp over the Winter, but haven't done any more<br>
letterboxing until this Fall.  We have enjoyed many new places to hike<br>
and just this weekend went to Pike Lake to visit the Weapons of Math<br>
Instruction.<br>
<br>
We have even planted 4 letterboxes ourselves this Fall.  But, while out<br>
at one park to place a box, we stumbled across a geocache that had a<br>
very definite "volunteer trail" leading to it.  Finding that cache<br>
caused me to wonder just how many geocaches are out there in Dane<br>
County, WI since there are very few Letterboxes here.  I guess I was<br>
wondering about the likelihood that geocachers would stumble across our<br>
letterboxes.  So, I did a little searching to get a general idea where<br>
some of the local geocaches might be located.  In my research, it seems<br>
Madison is asking a $10 annual fee to place a box in any Madison City<br>
park?  Do other cities do this?  I researched more and found that the<br>
geocache community is in talks with the DNR to write a policy about<br>
placing geocache boxes.  Basically, they are wanting all placers of<br>
boxes to get permission first, leave it there maybe only a year and<br>
watch for "volunteer trails" developing and move the box at least once<br>
in that year.<br>
<br>
I guess I wanted to ask more experienced letterboxes about all of this.<br>
We have hunted boxes in State Parks, county parks and City parks.  Is<br>
everyone getting permission from local authorities?<br>
<br>
I guess at this point, I'm feeling a little frustrated that possibly<br>
what should be fun looses some of the fun because of authorities<br>
regulating the "game".  I understand the etiquette about not planting<br>
boxes in sensitive areas etc. and I understand the positive press that<br>
both letterboxing and geocaching has received and has been great in<br>
getting more people out into the wild to enjoy it.  I expect that most<br>
parks are there for public enjoyment and park officials like to see<br>
families out on a hike?  So how are we balancing the "game"  or hobby<br>
with the law?  Is this why people are going with microboxes?  Urban<br>
boxes?  Library boxes?  Personal travelers?  Virtual Letterboxes?<br>
Hitchhikers?<br>
<br>
I realize I could have asked this question on the new boxers talklist,<br>
but I was hoping for some answers from the experienced WI letterboxers.<br>
Others who have answers are welcome to respond too!<br>
<br>
Anyone have any encouragement for us?  Were we wrong to place boxes in a<br>
WI State Park without permission?  Should we pull our boxes and then<br>
seek permission to replace?  We are a busy family who enjoys a great<br>
hike, but the possible red tape of this hobby will destroy it for us.<br>
Is it true Minn. has outlawed Geocaching in their State parks?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As someone who has been contemplating hiding a box myself, that's a great question.  I've often wondered if people had to gain permission first.  I'm sure that to have the one in the Starved Rock State Park permission was almost a must because it was inside the lodge.  However, I was thinking outside the lodge was fair game.  Also, some have clues like, ask the person at the counter for the box like in Come Grumnpy, Leave Happy in IL the owners were willing participants.  I hope this gets answered not just for WI, but for IL and probably everywhere else as well. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I cannot speak to the policies in WI -- hopefully somebody from that area<br>
who may have knowledge of the regulations will respond -- but I can tell you<br>
what has transpired in MI over the past year.  As of June 2004, the Michigan<br>
DNR adopted a "pay to place" policy in State Parks for geocaches (and<br>
presumably also for letterboxes -- although the policy does not specifically<br>
name letterboxes, they have been traditionally treated in the same manner as<br>
geocaches).  There is a steep fee -- I think is it like $25 to place a<br>
cache/box in a State Park.  That being said...  There are parks that have<br>
taken a lenient stance on this and kind of looked the other way...  How long<br>
that will last, who knows, but I can't help wondering where on earth the MI<br>
State Parks are going to get the funding to pay somebody to look for<br>
geocaches and letterboxes that might be placed in their park.  In most<br>
cases, it isn't creating a problem and doesn't seem like it would be worth<br>
their resources to deal with it, especially with their budgets being cut.<br>
<br>
Asking permission?  That is a matter of personal preference -- there are<br>
some letterboxers who always ask permission to place a box; there are others<br>
who never ask and then there are those who go even further and disregard<br>
policies against letterboxes (i.e. National Parks).  I personally have never<br>
asked permisison, although I do have several boxes in a State Park locally<br>
that the park staff are aware of.  My feeling is that if you ask, you are<br>
putting somebody on the park staff in the position of HAVING to make a<br>
decision -- often times it is easier for somebody to say "no" to something<br>
they don't understand or are unsure of than to take the time to learn about<br>
it or risk making a bad decision and having to answer to the powers that be.<br>
I like to think of the practice of not asking as one of peaceful<br>
co-existence and I think some of the parks feel the same way.  If they were<br>
asked and were forced to say either "yes" or "no" they would probably say<br>
"no" just because there is a chance that it could have a negative impact,<br>
etc...  but if they are not asked, they may know about it, but are willing<br>
to just turn the other way.  If you don't ask, you have to be prepared to<br>
have your box confiscated in the event that it was somewhere off-limits and<br>
it is found.<br>
<br>
In short...  there is no right answer.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I believe this is mentioned somewhere in the FAQs or getting started section or somewhere on the letterboxing site.  Anyway, ideally, you should check to be sure that it is legal to place your letterbox where you want to place it.  That way, no one will get in trouble if they get caught with it.  Now, whether this means that you have to ask every time you want to place a new box or if you can place additional boxes at an already established location at will is still unclear to me.  My personal policy is, if there is a precident (ie, there are lots of letterboxes placed in IN state parks already) I generally assume it's ok...although I think an effort should still be made to check out the rules anyway (yes, there are lots of letterboxes in IN state parks, but maybe that just means there are lots of people breaking the rules...since I haven't planted a box in IN I haven't checked it out so I don't know for sure).  <br>
<br>
That said, I will admit that I do not have permission for any of my boxes that are currently in place.  The series at Homer Lake I did attempt to ask permission from the park ranger.  Unfortunately, when I have stopped by to ask, the person I need to talk to is not there.  I left a name and number and asked him to call me back and he never did.  But the person I left my info with, when asked if it was legal to place boxes, only told me that they didn't believe anyone else had used the park for that purpose....nothing about whether or not she knew/thought it was illegal.  And, there is another park in the same district that already had boxes (although I suspect the placer of that series didn't ask first).  So there was a precident.  And I would hope that the rangers would have gotten back to me promptly if I had asked to do something illegal.<br>
My other box is a different story.  I have numbers, supposedly of people who manage the land, but have not actually been able to contact anyone.  I am still trying to get a hold of them because I'm not sure if the letterbox is legal OR if dogs are legal (since the park has info regarding bikes and horses, but not a word about dogs).  This is part of the reason I haven't placed my Fish Tank series there yet...if I'm gonna plant 12 boxes at one location I really want to know for sure that it isn't illegal!<br>
<br>
I hope that I haven't confused you any more.  I will be interested to hear what some of the truely experienced boxers have to say on this subject.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, that is all news to me!  I know MI was working on some restrictive policies, but hadn't heard anything about WI.  We've followed the theory that if it is a public place, we can leave a box hidden somewhere.  To avoid having our clues discovered by people just doing a Google search on a park, we started to avoid mentioning the name of a park directly in our clues.  (I once got an email asking how to rent a pavilion, just because my LB clues popped up near the top of the list when Googling a local park name!)  However the location is still easily recognizable in the clues and/or we provide directions (unless it is a mystery box)  See "Get the Lead Out", "Door County Tradition" and "Norwegian Woods", all in State recreational areas.<br>
<br>
I think more states should use Connecticut as their example.  I've heard that they actively encourage letterboxing in state forests, etc - have even given away walking sticks if you find "x" number of boxes!<br>

I did kind of wonder why there were so few letterboxes in Madtown since it is such a great place with wonderful parks...the fee and the involvement with the DNR does kind of take the thrill of the hunt out of it...$10 is not too much I guess, but it seems business-like and that is not the point of the "game"...I am frustrated too.  Maybe more experienced boxers can give us some feedback on this issue.  I'd love to plant and hunt in Dane County. MadCats<br>

<br>
We are new to this group, but have done a little letterboxing for a year<br>
now.  We learned about Letterboxing on a homeschooling talklist and<br>
jumped right in last Fall.  We came up with a trail name and carved a<br>
personal family stamp over the Winter, but haven't done any more<br>
letterboxing until this Fall.  We have enjoyed many new places to hike<br>
and just this weekend went to Pike Lake to visit the Weapons of Math<br>
Instruction.<br>
<br>
We have even planted 4 letterboxes ourselves this Fall.  But, while out<br>
at one park to place a box, we stumbled across a geocache that had a<br>
very definite "volunteer trail" leading to it.  Finding that cache<br>
caused me to wonder just how many geocaches are out there in Dane<br>
County, WI since there are very few Letterboxes here.  I guess I was<br>
wondering about the likelihood that geocachers would stumble across our<br>
letterboxes.  So, I did a little searching to get a general idea where<br>
some of the local geocaches might be located.  In my research, it seems<br>
Madison is asking a $10 annual fee to place a box in any Madison City<br>
park?  Do other cities do this?  I researched more and found that the<br>
geocache community is in talks with the DNR to write a policy about<br>
placing geocache boxes.  Basically, they are wanting all placers of<br>
boxes to get permission first, leave it there maybe only a year and<br>
watch for "volunteer trails" developing and move the box at least once<br>
in that year.<br>
<br>
I guess I wanted to ask more experienced letterboxes about all of this.<br>
We have hunted boxes in State Parks, county parks and City parks.  Is<br>
everyone getting permission from local authorities?<br>
<br>
I guess at this point, I'm feeling a little frustrated that possibly<br>
what should be fun looses some of the fun because of authorities<br>
regulating the "game".  I understand the etiquette about not planting<br>
boxes in sensitive areas etc. and I understand the positive press that<br>
both letterboxing and geocaching has received and has been great in<br>
getting more people out into the wild to enjoy it.  I expect that most<br>
parks are there for public enjoyment and park officials like to see<br>
families out on a hike?  So how are we balancing the "game"  or hobby<br>
with the law?  Is this why people are going with microboxes?  Urban<br>
boxes?  Library boxes?  Personal travelers?  Virtual Letterboxes?<br>
Hitchhikers?<br>
<br>
I realize I could have asked this question on the new boxers talklist,<br>
but I was hoping for some answers from the experienced WI letterboxers.<br>
Others who have answers are welcome to respond too!<br>
<br>
Anyone have any encouragement for us?  Were we wrong to place boxes in a<br>
WI State Park without permission?  Should we pull our boxes and then<br>
seek permission to replace?  We are a busy family who enjoys a great<br>
hike, but the possible red tape of this hobby will destroy it for us.<br>
Is it true Minn. has outlawed Geocaching in their State parks?<br>

Currently no specific mention of letterboxing.  Looks like another reason to avoid publicity of letterboxing.  Keep it quiet and under the radar screen and perhaps we can avoid regulation.<br>

Well said, Papeseed ... and I concure. <br>
<br>
I have only asked permission for one of my boxes. That one is on <br>
private property and has a "story" behind why it is placed in that <br>
particular location.  Those clues are not published, you have to <br>
find the matching box first, then email me for the clues.<br>
<br>
I have boxes in (MI) State Parks which I have never asked permission <br>
for.  Bindle Bum and I disagree with the new Use Permit Policy so <br>
much that we wouldn't dream of allowing them to even "come up on the <br>
radar screen" (quote from Bindle Bum, former military man)by <br>
mentioning them to the Ranger Staff.  I have those boxes listed, but <br>
the clues include a link that takes you off the main site. So, as <br>
SpringChick mentions about the the budget cuts and all; I'm making <br>
it as difficult as possible, and as time consuming as possible for <br>
State Employees to track down if I even have boxes in the State <br>
Parks and counting on the annoyance factor to keep them unaware of <br>
the presence of my boxes.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, we support our State Parks and admire the <br>
difficult job of balancing that the Ranger Staff has to do. If you <br>
look, you will find a State Park annual use sticker in the front <br>
window of both of our vehicles, not just one of them.<br>
<br>
We are also "bad cats" and have at least one box placed within the <br>
jurisdiciton of the National Park Service.  So I guess we'll be sent <br>
to the litterbox if our box is discovered by the NPS Rangers. <br>
However, we disagree the NPS Land Use Policy most strenously. Let's <br>
see.... no geocaches or letterboxes because it will disturb the <br>
natural enviroment too much; but building out-houses, campgrounds, <br>
boat launch ramps, roads and snowmobile trails is OK. Yeah, right. <br>
It's not all about the money, is it? Uh-hun, sure.<br>
<br>
Stepping down off my soap box now.<br>

Wow, now I don't feel quite so guilty about not having actually attained permission to place my boxes (I did at least give it a try...albeit not a very hard one).  Quite frankly, I can't say that I really disagree with this statement either.<br>

Who knows?  Maybe it's time for everyone to practice a little more discretion, secrecy, and good old fashioned civil disobedience.  This isn't an organized sport- let good sense and a healthy dose of mischievousness lead the way.  And, in the words of my aging hippie father- "Damn the Man!"<br>

I also subscribe to the "forgiveness rather than permission" stance, <br>
however, I did have a really good experience asking for permission <br>
not long ago.  I've already mentioned it here, but to recap:  We <br>
wanted to plant a series in a WI county park and, at the prodding of <br>
my husband, called the county headquarters for permission.  The <br>
director was very interested in the hobby after I described it and <br>
gave me blanket permission to plant in any of our county's parks.  I <br>
sent him the clues as well so he could see how harmless the hobby <br>
was.  He, in turn, sent a memo to all his park employees with a <br>
glowing tribute to a hobby that would encourage hiking and the number <br>
of park visitors...  he also attached the clues to the memo.  It must <br>
have been effective because those logbooks are full of thumbprint <br>
stamps, signatures and commercial stamps from families that have <br>
tried the hobby.  <br>
<br>
Given that response, I feel pretty comfortable placing without asking <br>
first in most cases.<br>
