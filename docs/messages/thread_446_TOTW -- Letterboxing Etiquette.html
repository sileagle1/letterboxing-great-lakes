                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, so I will get the ball rolling on this one...  A few things <br/>
that immediately come to mind:<br/>
<br/>
-  Replacing and rehiding boxes better than when you found them and <br/>
treating each box you visit as if it were your own.  'Nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
-  It is considerate to check for other boxes in the area/park <br/>
before posting clues to your box to be certain your clues do not <br/>
give away part of somebody else's mystery clues and your box is not <br/>
located directly on top of the other one.<br/>
<br/>
-  It is a good idea to search the LbNA clue site and the HH list <br/>
for duplicate box names before naming a box...  It is not such a  <br/>
big deal with regular boxes that have the same name, especially if <br/>
they are in different areas, but it does get very confusing when HH <br/>
have the same name, as people tend to report that they found <xyz> <br/>
HH, not even realizing there are more than one.<br/>
<br/>
-  Letterboxing and eating -- critters are very sensitive to the <br/>
slightest smell of food, and food oils from your hands transfer very <br/>
easily to letterbox contents, making the box a target for a hungry <br/>
critter after you leave.<br/>
<br/>
-  The underlying philosophy of HitchHikers and Cuckoo Clues is to <br/>
move them on as quickly as possible.  If you find one and do not <br/>
think you will be boxing for a while, it is okay to take a stamp <br/>
image, count the find and leave the HH for the next person rather <br/>
than keeping it at the bottom of your pack for 6 months.<br/>
<br/>
-  It is important to be environmentally conscious both when hunting <br/>
AND planting letterboxes... I recently visited a box that was about <br/>
8 feet up the side of a very steep embankment in the woods.  There <br/>
were many small plants growing between the trail and the hiding spot <br/>
and there was no way to scale the side of the hill to reach the box <br/>
without considerable backsliding and uprooting of plants.  This also <br/>
is true of some parks that may be habitat for spring wildflowers and <br/>
show no sign of them in other seasons.  This is why it is important <br/>
to check on your boxes periodically to assess the impact to the area <br/>
in different conditions and seasons.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's always a good idea to take a look around before you take your <br/>
final steps to a box's resting place. If there are others around, I <br/>
like to make up some likely excuse as to why I'm rustling around in <br/>
the bushes, such as Jo and Tuck have run off into the bushes and I <br/>
need to go after them...<br/>
<br/>
One thing I think is really a nice thing to do is not something done <br/>
while letterboxing itself but, when posting on the letterboxing <br/>
groups. I find this especially important on the national group but, <br/>
as we add more and more members to this group, I think it's a nice <br/>
idea to get in the habit of when posting something about a specific <br/>
letterbox (especially new ones or box reports) to include the two <br/>
digit state abbreviation for the box's location, in the subject line <br/>
of the posting. <br/>
<br/>
What this does for me is; I'm from Minnesota, if I see something with <br/>
MN in the subject line, I might be more likely to open it than if I <br/>
see something with MI. I do hope to eventualy get to MI to hunt down <br/>
boxes there and I'd probably go back to some of those postings at <br/>
that time. If I see something with IL in the subject line, I make <br/>
note of it for when I'm visiting my brother in Chicago. You get the <br/>
idea... <br/>
<br/>
By the way, I hardly ever take the time to read the postings on the <br/>
national site any more (too much about what's going on, on the <br/>
coasts, and not enough about what's happening in the Midwest/Great <br/>
Lakes area). I'm so glad SpringChick decided to start this group!<br/>

&gt; Hey Deb, are you talking about one of my boxes? If so, would you<br/>
&gt; mind telling me which one. I have placed several boxes in the early<br/>
&gt; spring that I have not had time to go back and check on since then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enjoy!<br/>
