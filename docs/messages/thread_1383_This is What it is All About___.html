                    <div class="plaintext-content">I loved reading SpringChick's blog post about her<br/>
recent letterboxing experience.  I know that people's<br/>
thoughts about hiding and/or searching for letterboxes<br/>
in cemeteries can be varied, but really what it comes<br/>
down to is the same as hiding/searching for boxes in<br/>
any location - being respectful to the land and your<br/>
surroundings.  In college I referred to myself as a<br/>
"cemetery walker."  I went to a smaller college in a<br/>
more rural part of Ohio, and the cemetery was just on<br/>
the outskirts of town.  Often times I'd take walks<br/>
there, either with another friend or alone.  When I<br/>
was upset it gave me a calm, serene place to just be. <br/>
Other times, esp. when walking with my one friend, we<br/>
liked to read all those old tombstones, admire the<br/>
artwork of some of the monuments, and wonder about the<br/>
histories of all these now departed people.  Many<br/>
people are surprised to learn that cemeteries used to<br/>
be treated akin to public parks.  People would bring a<br/>
picnic lunch with them and spend the afternoon at<br/>
their departed loved one's grave.  I've noticed a<br/>
trend back towards this behavior recently, which I<br/>
think is nice.  I think it's so sad when I pass an<br/>
old, apparently forgotten about cemetery that you can<br/>
tell isn't tended to any longer.  <br/>
<br/>
I also like to think that my family properly instilled<br/>
in me respect for cemeteries (which probably also led<br/>
to my liking to walk around old, rural cemeteries). <br/>
Often on Sunday's we'd go on a ride with my<br/>
grandparents to the cemetery where some of my<br/>
relatives were buried.  We had our specified route to<br/>
drive through the cemetery and stop at everyone's<br/>
graves.  We'd bring a bucket full of flowers, divy-ing<br/>
them up between all the graves.  We'd also bring my<br/>
grandfather's box of gardening tools to trim the grass<br/>
so that it wouldn't grow over the stones, etc.  And<br/>
teaching by example really works.  Deedle's and my<br/>
grandparents are now all passed on and buried in the<br/>
same cemetery.  We visited their graves on Memorial<br/>
Day weekend, and commented how we needed to come back<br/>
with gardening tools to keep the grass from growing<br/>
onto the stones....(although, we won't bring a<br/>
weedwacker like we saw someone else using that day).<br/>
<br/>
Doodle's rules (from her grandfather and mother) for<br/>
being in a cemetery (whether letterboxing or just<br/>
visiting):<br/>
<br/>
- Never play your car stereo inside the gates<br/>
- Don't run (even if there's a really wonderful hill<br/>
right next to your great-grandfather's grave that's<br/>
just asking for little kids to run up and down it)<br/>
- Don't step on the grave stones<br/>
<br/>

Interesting that you mention this.  At one of the cemeteries on our route we saw this.  There was an entire family who had set up their lawn chair and picnic at one of the graves.  Fortunately it wasn't near where I needed to be because they looked like they were planning to stay for a while.  It was really neat to see.<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing in cemeteries has never seemed odd or creepy to me.  Of course, the fact that the sledding hill in my hometown is smack dab in the middle of the largest cemetary in the county probably has something to do with that.  It also helps that my family, while having a lot of respect for cemetaries and graves (I have one relative, HS age, who spends a lot of her free time finding and preserving old country cemeteries) has never treated them like a forbidden place.  Personally, I like to think that most of the deceased enjoy having visitors who aren't totally depressed.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing in cemeteries has never seemed odd or creepy to me.  Of course, the fact that the sledding hill in my hometown is smack dab in the middle of the largest cemetary in the county probably has something to do with that.  It also helps that my family, while having a lot of respect for cemetaries and graves (I have one relative, HS age, who spends a lot of her free time finding and preserving old country cemeteries) has never treated them like a forbidden place.  Personally, I like to think that most of the deceased enjoy having visitors who aren't totally depressed.<br/>
