                    <div class="plaintext-content">The second place Bingo Booty consisted of a package of 4 Ink Dots, 1 <br/>
Lock &amp; Lock letterbox container, 2 nice logbooks including pens, 1 <br/>
large 4 x 6 block of Mastercarve, 1 Hand Warmer 6-Pack, 1 keychain <br/>
flashlight, and 1 very nice leather-bound sketch pad (page size 8 x <br/>
6).  Very nice booty indeed.  Thank you SpringChick.<br/>
<br/>
The side wager game, hosted by azobox, also had a prize (which, as far <br/>
as I know, was provided entirely by azobox, thank you very much).  It <br/>
consisted of 1 very nice locking letterbox container, a mosquito head <br/>
net (very useful), and a small backpacking first aid kit.  These items <br/>
were well thought out.  Thank you azobox.  <br/>
