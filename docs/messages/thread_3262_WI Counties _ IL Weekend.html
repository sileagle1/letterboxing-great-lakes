                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, since Dragon has now posted the clues to the FOUR boxes he hid <br>
recently to fill in the "foot" of the boot, WI now officially has <br>
boxes in 61 counties, with only 11 to go.  You can see an updated map <br>
here:<br>

<br>
If you can plant something in one of these counties in the near <br>
future, please let me know at:  kotlarek@wi.rr.com  It will be hard <br>
to beat the MI mob, but let's give it a good try.  All help is <br>
appreciated!<br>
<br>
Those crafty Woverines have been hard at work planting in MI while <br>
Martini Man & I were gallivanting about finding boxes in Illinois.  <br>
<br>
We had much better weather today and were very happy that we were <br>
able to find all 11 boxes in the Big Ten series (but I still don't <br>
know why they call it Big TEN if there are 11 teams???  I guess I <br>
could Google it for more info.  Martini Man told me they added one <br>
along the way, but I don't know why).  We enjoyed many IL Forest <br>
Preserves (the supply of Forest Preserves seems ENDLESS in Northern <br>
IL) while hunting these down.  Also found some very nice P. Granola <br>
boxes, and the excellent "Untitled" box, and the historic Quilt #2 in <br>
the Waltzing Pigs' series.  On the way home we stopped to check on my <br>
Sweet Prairieland box because I had heard a Girl Scout troop visited <br>
recently.  It turns out the box had been rehidden well and they only <br>
used 2 pages in the logbook.  While in the area, we also found the <br>
other Jelly Belly related box placed by Cinemaboxers.  We were able <br>
to find a total of 16 boxes today AND we found THREE Hitchhikers - <br>
woo hoo, what a great day to be outside "hunting" with lots of woods, <br>
rivers & lakes as scenery!  <br>
<br>
I guess now we'd better start planning a "planting trip" to try to <br>
catch up with MI...<br>
<br>
Thanks to all of you who have planted boxes for us to enjoy!<br>
