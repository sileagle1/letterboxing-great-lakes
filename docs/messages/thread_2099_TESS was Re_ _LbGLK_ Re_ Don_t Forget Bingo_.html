I should have done something with limestone, or bedrock.  Flintstones,<br/>
meet the Flintstones ...<br/>
<br/>
I'm not that organized!  I still have some "holiday" cards to get out<br/>
during the season.  As long as they arrive by January 6th, I will be<br/>
happy.  I am working more hours this month and next, so I squeeze in<br/>
letterboxing duties whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
OT - is anyone having trouble finding "regular items" in the stores now? <br/>
Imagine this ... living in Indy and I could not find a decent COLTS<br/>
sweatshirt and cap at the mall tonight.  I'm looking for a BLUE<br/>
Adult-size, with decent graphics.  Okay, maybe I'm a little picky, but I<br/>
don't think a grey sweatshirt will suffice.  I went to Dick's, Sears,<br/>
Lids, and all the finer department stores.  I'll check out the Colts store<br/>
at Circle Center tomorrow.  I'll be paying a premium, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
My new year's resolution will be to visit Michigan to pick up at least a<br/>
dozen boxes this year.  This is the only resolution that has a chance of<br/>
being fulfilled.<br/>
