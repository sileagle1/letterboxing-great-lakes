                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Firecracker" the wayward, yet faithful, horse of Chicago Slim has<br/>
apparently fallen prey to rustlers. During a review of Slim's various<br/>
and scattered holdings today, it was discovered that Firecracker was<br/>
indeed missing.<br/>
Alas, the corral where he was last seen was empty.<br/>
<br/>
Artistamp and azobox called for Firecracker again and again, and they<br/>
 searched high and low, but it was to no avail.<br/>
<br/>
Although he was one of a kind, the miracles of cloning (already<br/>
demonstrated by the Breakfast Elves) will prevail, and a new improved<br/>
Firecracker will find his way to a place not far from his predessor's<br/>
disappearance.<br/>
<br/>
The timeframe for the appearance of Firecreracker2 is TBA.<br/>
Stay tuned.<br/>
P.S. Slim is very upset....but he rolled over and is resting again.<br/>
