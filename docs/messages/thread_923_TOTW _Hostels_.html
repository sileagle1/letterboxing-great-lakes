I was out today to check on two of my boxes before they are under snow.  Hoosier Poet is <br/>
doing quite well!  I could see the hostel exposed and so I had to recover it with more <br/>
leaves and sticks.  I think the weather disturbed it more than letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
I promised some pictures ... couldn't retrieve them as fast as I might ... so I took my new <br/>
digital camera with me and I have some good shots for the PHOTO files to the left.  Give <br/>
me a couple of moments to figure it out and let me know what you think, especially those <br/>
of you considering creating one.  I will say I wish I had used better paper stock on the <br/>
pages as the ink will show through if any moisture is present.  Otherwise I am pretty <br/>
happy with the present condition of the box.  There are FIVE hitchhikers inside and I am <br/>
considering asking anyone to take them away when they visit.  It seems like asking for an <br/>
even exchange does not help the hitchhikers circulate as much as they should.  I'll update <br/>
the clues when I decide what to do next.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make the pictures as small as possible before download.  I still have to read the <br/>
instruction book I have.<br/>
