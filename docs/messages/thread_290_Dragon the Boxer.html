(ref. the new pics of Team Taco and Dragon)<br>
(For tune, visit http://www.alookatjoxer.com/joxsong.html )<br>
<br>
He roams through the countryside; <br>
Always with a box to hide. <br>
With Team Taco as his sidekicks <br>
Fighting with their pointy sticks, <br>
Righting wrongs and singing songs, <br>
Hiding boxes all day long <br>
He's Dragon . . . he's Dragon the Boxer! <br>
<br>
or <br>
<br>
Ohhhh . . . <br>
He's Dragon the Boxer, <br>
He's really lost 'er. <br>
Everybody likes him <br>
Because he has a funny grin. <br>
<br>
Dragon the Boxer, <br>
He's really lost 'er. <br>
Everyone admires him. <br>
He's so handsome it's a sin. <br>
If you're in jeopardy <br>
Don't call the cavalry. <br>
Use your trigonometry, <br>
(Although there's some Geometry!) <br>
He's every man's trusty, <br>
He's every woman's fantasy, <br>
Plus he's goo-ood company. <br>
He's Dragon... <br>
I'm Dragon the Boxer! <br>
