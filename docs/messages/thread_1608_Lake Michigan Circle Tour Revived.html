                    <div class="plaintext-content">After considerable thought (and a little arm-twisting) I've decided <br>
to resurrect the Lake Michigan Circle Tour project -- with a few <br>
modifications from the original proposal. I'm working on details and <br>
will post them within the next week or two.<br>
<br>
To get you thinking (in case you weren't around when this was last <br>
discussed or if you can't quite remember what it was all about)...<br>
<br>
There is an official driving route around Lake Michigan through MI, <br>
IN, IL and WI.  See this site for info:<br>
<br>
http://www.great-lakes.net/tourism/circletour/michigan/.<br>
<br>
The goal of this project is to identify existing letterboxes and <br>
place new letterboxes that are located within a short distance of <br>
the official tour route and put together a listing of these boxes.<br>
<br>
<br>
A few guidelines:<br>
<br>
-  This is an open-ended project -- it will be an ongoing thing with <br>
boxes being added and removed as necessary.<br>
-  Boxes can be existing or newly placed for this series.<br>
-  Boxes do not need to meet any specific theme.<br>
-  Planters must be diligent about the status of their circle tour <br>
boxes and be willing to follow-up on missing or damaged box reports <br>
in order to keep the list as accurate as possible and the boxes in <br>
good condition.<br>
-  Boxes should be within 10 miles off any exit from the official <br>
Lake Michigan Circle Tour route.<br>
-  Boxes will be organized by "leg" of the route -- I am working on <br>
these divisions.  There will also be a "mystery box" category for <br>
boxes that meet the "within 10 miles of exit" criteria but do not <br>
specify exactly where they are located.<br>
-  With the exception of the mystery category boxes, clues for <br>
included letterboxes must specify point of exit from the tour route, <br>
distance from point of exit to park/location and an approximate box <br>
retrieval distance or time.<br>
-  Included boxes must be listed on at least one public site, such <br>
as letterboxing.org or AtlasQuest.  It is okay to just list the box <br>
and then link to clues that are on your own web site as long as your <br>
web site does not require membership to access clues.<br>
<br>
**I am also considering a sublist of "by request only" clues that <br>
meet the criteria but are not publicly accessible.  This will depend <br>
on interest.**<br>
<br>
Watch for further details and instructions on how to get your boxes <br>
included in the tour listing.<br>

<br>
http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/other/lmct.html<br>
<br>
and here for Michigan:<br>
<br>
http://www.wmta.org/cgi-local/linkhost.cgi?www.michiganhighways.org/other/lmct.html<br>
<br>
<br>
I haven't found anything quite so detailed for IL or IN, but there is much less mileage in those<br>
states and not as many road switches so I think it is pretty clear where the route goes.<br>
<br>
I have set up a database on this group that breaks the entire route into 13 main legs and 6 spurs.<br>
This database is informational only.  I will be setting up another database to enter boxes into -- but<br>
they will each need to be assigned to one of the legs in this informational table.<br>
<br>
It gets a little uncertain around some of the bigger cities -- which leg of the route a box gets assigned <br>
to.  I tried to provide a junction of main highways as the point of division.  Hopefully that helps.<br>
<br>
More details forthcoming...<br>

keeping some of our clues in a yahoo group is cause for an exclusion<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although the Letterboxing 'Round the Lake project is originating here <br>
at the LbGLK group, one does not need to be a member of this group to <br>
access information regarding the project, submit boxes, view the list <br>
of boxes or obtain the clues to letterboxes included.<br>
<br>
While joining Yahoo! groups and creating user accounts at web sites <br>
may seem second nature to you and me, there are many people who for <br>
whatever reason are not comfortable joining online groups or web <br>
sites.  It has always been the policy of letterboxing.org to provide <br>
letterbox clues without requiring a person to create a user account <br>
at the web site.  Although a person must create an account to list <br>
their letterbox clues, the clues posted at letterboxing.org are <br>
accessible to the general Internet public regardless of membership <br>
status (with the exception of clues linked to a membership-required <br>
web site or Yahoo! group).  Likewise at AtlasQuest -- clues listed at <br>
this site are accessible to any person using the Internet without <br>
having to join the site or create a user account.<br>
<br>
While I certainly support various and alternate methods of clue <br>
delivery and protection, including WOM, limited access and membership <br>
only (free or otherwise), I feel that for a project of this nature, <br>
where there is a high degree of potential for non-letterboxing folks <br>
to want to "give it a try," clues should be readily available to the <br>
general public without requiring an individual to join a site or set <br>
up a user account.<br>
<br>
That being said, I am willing to entertain alternate ideas, perhaps <br>
some kind of a graphic indicator to show which clues require a <br>
website/group membership to access them.  Would this be an acceptable <br>
compromise to you?<br>
