I expect some of you can relate to misplacing notes for clues and having delays in listing clues.  I don't actually remember which box was actually my 100th plant out in the wild, so I picked a special one for the 100th. I'm hoping to get caught up soon with listing clues for boxes already planted, especially ones with stamps donated to our area.  And I'm hoping to soon finish planting the bounty from the winter carving season, including some rest area boxes for I-43.  <br>

Happy Trails!<br>
