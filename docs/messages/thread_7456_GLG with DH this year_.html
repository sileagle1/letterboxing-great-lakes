                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just made reservations at the HIExpress in Verona.  DH won't camp, but he is coming.  We have been accumulating rewards points for years and now I put them to good use.  The going rate was around $120/night with taxes.  Looks like we are getting 2 nights for $60!  Our savings will be put in our gas tank.<br>
<br>
Just so everyone knows -- I will be bringing my special letterbox with clues, Snickers.  I will have to make 8x11 color copies and I hope 50 are enough.  I am waiting to hear from VBP or ArchaeoFrog as to how to identify this box.  It is currently listed as a traditional box, but it does travel with me from time to time.  I could create an Event box and attach it to the event so folks don't overlook it.  It will be an event-only stamp, but if you need extra time to solve it, I do send out the image on LTC cards to those who take the time to solve it (I owe LunagirlandPAPA).<br>
<br>
If you want a head-start on solving it, I can send a Word doc to an addy that accepts attachments.  Just let me know.<br>
