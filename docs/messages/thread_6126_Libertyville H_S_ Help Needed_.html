                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Dad is in town this week and I went out to pick him up in Lake Bluff last night. I left home at about 7:30pm and found boxes in Elgin, Arlington Heights, Glencoe, Highland Park, Ravinia, Lake Bluff &amp; Gurnee. Most of the boxes I found after midnight and had to quit at 4:00AM when my spotlight went dead!!<br/>
<br/>
I called it a night (er, morning?) and turned into bed at about 4:30am and couldn't fall asleep -- kept thinking of all the boxes I had found (nearly a dozen total) and of the boxes to be had the next day.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly I had to be back home by 2:30pm to pick the girls up from school (or else Becki would have to walk a mile and a half to get them). This meant that we had to leave Lake Bluff by 10:30 :-(<br/>
<br/>
After breakfast we didn't have much time so I nabbed one more box and went to replace the stamp/logbook to my Libertyville High School series.<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten reports over the past several months that people had been finding the box.... only it was empty -- no stamp and no logbook. I just got a report two weeks ago saying that they had found the box, but it was empty.<br/>
<br/>
I recarved the stamp and got a logbook and stopped by and to my shagrin (sp) I couldn't find the box :-(<br/>
<br/>
Time wasn't on my side and so I just left the logbook and stamp in a single ziplock out in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
If someone in/near or going to L-ville PLEASE get a box for my stamp/log? Also, if you could take another baggie and double bag the items that would be awesome!!<br/>
<br/>
They aren't huge, an altoid tin would work or small tupperware. I did move the location a bit and now its in a small nook next to the barkless stump -- and not the fallen tree. Covered well with bark and leaves.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any help. Thanks,<br/>

P.S. got back home at 2:25 to pick the kids up from school -- wow, that was a close one.<br/>

Thanks, I am pretty tired now!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I only found Drive-bys so every 20 minutes I would jump out and stamp in re-energizing myself for the next box. I didn't mention that I attempted 7 more to no avail in Arlington Heights.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're right though, when I get the opportunity I go nuts!!<br/>

You are NUTS! Must be all that pent up LB energy that has to take a<br/>
backseat to family responsibilities. so when you can cut loose you REALLY go<br/>
crazy! Glad to hear you made it back OK on very little sleep.<br/>
