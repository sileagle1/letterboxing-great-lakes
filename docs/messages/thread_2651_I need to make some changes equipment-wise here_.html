Punxsygal and I were back out at Lapham Peak yesterday and I kept <br/>

it is by the last box we did.  I've emptied my backpack twice looking <br/>
for it.  That goes along with the compass that I lost last fall.  This <br/>

  I just went through my pockets and bag.  No compass.  Wouldn't have <br/>
been suprised to find it as I'm the dept. klepto, always walking off <br/>
with someone else's pen.  Isn't letterboxing fun--you get to go out <br/>
and get up close and personal with nature--scatches on your arms, <br/>
branches in your hair, burrs on your sweater, bug bites, lost <br/>
earrings, torn jeans, broken nails, mud on you shoes, bruised knees, <br/>
butt muscles burning from Gutbuster Hill (shoulda been called <br/>
Buttbuster Hill)?  Hmmmm, maybe that poolside lounger with a <br/>
margarita isn't such a bad idea.<br/>
