In 2006, I hid a letterbox entitled Three Eyed Ax Murderer. Now in 2012, a woman's dead body was found on Sunday not far from the location of my letterbox. The body was found approximately 20 yards 'off the trail.' People frequently jog, bike, and walk their dogs along this wooden stretch, but why was she 20 yards off the trail? This police story is giving me the willies! I have updated that letterbox and asked people to avoid the area which is now a police investigation site. Who do I contact for information about the Letterboxer's Bail Fund should I need to do some explaining? <br>

A homeless man set fire to himself near one of my boxes.  It gave me the creeps a little when I next went to do maintenance on that box.  I didn't have the interesting tie-in to the box name, though.  Very weird!<br>

Doesn't appear it was the three-eyed ax murderer dude after all. <br>

No new details about the dead woman found near the three eyed ax murderer letterbox. My daughter knew this woman; a frequent visitor to the LB Library. The police haven't found my letterbox so it's still safe, I hope. But this story is a good reminder to never go letterboxing alone.  Always go with a buddy.   <br>
