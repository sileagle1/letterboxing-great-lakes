planning a second Special Indoor Letterboxing Outing (S.I.L.O.) at <br/>
the Silo Restaurant in Lake Bluff, Illinois.  Tonight, I asked the <br/>
manager for a reservation for Sat. February 16 and she said that <br/>
would be fine.  She asked what type of group, so I started to try to <br/>
explain to her that we were 'hikers' from Northern IL and SE WI <br/>
and....she suddenly blurted out - "You mean like letterboxing?"  <br/>
ROFLOL!  Sandy, the manager of the SILO is a letterboxer!  Well, <br/>
needless to say, we must have left a huge impression on the staff <br/>
last year, because the manager told me she heard all about our group <br/>
from the staff for weeks after we left.  Hmmm...I guess all those <br/>
red clothes left an impression. She's gone out letterboxing too.  <br/>
<br/>
So, mark your calendars.  Saturday, February 16, 2008 from 11 am to <br/>
4 pm.  There is a cure for winter cabin fever.  Fungus Woman will be <br/>
handling all the high tech postings and she will be posting the <br/>
information on AQ and LbNA soon. Beetle will handle the reservation, <br/>
decorations, and entertaining details for the afternoon.      <br/>
<br/>
So, what will the theme be this year?  Well, WI Hiker already <br/>
guessed when we gave a tiny little clue a few months ago.  The event <br/>
will be held in February.  No, we're not celebrating Chinese New <br/>
Years again.  This time, the theme has a little bit to do with <br/>
Valentines Day, but not love and kisses.  <br/>
<br/>
The theme will be: SILO II - "Crime Doesn't Pay-The St. Valentines <br/>
Day Massacre."   Think about those days back in the 1920s.  Everyone <br/>
is invited to dress up in a disguise and come as cops and robbers, <br/>
crooks, outlaws, mobsters, flappers, prisoners, underworld figures, <br/>
FBI agents, etc.  Think back to those days of crime, prohibition, <br/>
bootlegging, the roaring 20s, etc.  Now that should give you plenty <br/>
of ideas for creating indoor stamps!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Insider information has it that Al Capone will stop by for the group <br/>
photo. It will be a roaring good time!   <br/>

More information to follow soon. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea, as of right now we wont be able to make it :-(?? I have my fingers crossed on Live &amp; Breathe but that looks as if it wont happen either.... money money money.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Beetle (and all), be on the look out for our new sig. stamp... yes, I carved a new one. Sticking with Hart x6 though. Sooner or later I will upload it to my profile on AQ.<br/>
