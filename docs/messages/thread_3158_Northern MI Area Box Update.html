checking up on letterboxes and finding a couple of new ones.<br/>
<br/>
The Grand Traverse lighthouse box was reported missing and it is <br/>
indeed missing AGAIN.  The Old Mission lighthouse box was reported <br/>
by a couple of recent finders to be wet and when we went to give it <br/>
some TLC, we found the contents scattered.  It was very strange as <br/>
the little pile of debris and sticks that covered the ground indent <br/>
where the box should have been hiding, was undisturbed.  We were <br/>
able to recover most of the pieces, although the rubber part of the <br/>
stamp was separated from the wood block and nowhere to be found. It <br/>
appears that a HH had been left in the box, but there was no <br/>
logbook, only a little stamp. As the HH was not stamped into the <br/>
logbook, I am not sure that is even what it is or who left it and <br/>
really have no way of knowing how to contact the owner.  If you left <br/>
a HH in this box recently, please contact me -- it is a store-bought <br/>
stamp, foam backed, the image of a little gremlin type creature. <br/>
<br/>
All of the other boxes we checked on were in good shape and well-<br/>
hidden.  A couple we were unable to check on because of time <br/>
limitations and very busy areas.  Seems like half the state of MI <br/>
was up there enjoying the gorgeous fall weekend.<br/>

Hmm! Don't you remember the Twilight Zone episode that had the <br/>
gremlin tampering with airplane? Sounds like you've had an encounter <br/>
with a letterbox gremlin, and so close to Halloween, too, Scary!<br/>
