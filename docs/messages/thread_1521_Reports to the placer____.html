<br>
I don't think you can disable it.  Some people like to keep track of <br>
counts of their boxes using LBNA so I think you can always make a <br>
notation about whether you've found or attempted a box.  The <br>
advantages of this feature to me personally are:<br>
<br>
1.  We can change the settings within LBNA to only display the boxes <br>
we haven't found yet, thereby generating a shorter list of boxes to <br>
consider.<br>
<br>
2.  A lot of people rarely, if ever, sent me messages via "Contact <br>
the Placer", so at least with the status change I know that the box <br>
is still there.  If someone just changes status to "Found" I'm <br>
assuming that the box is OK.<br>
<br>
3.  I like seeing info about when a box was last checked/found and <br>
have included it in the bocy of all my clues.  I would update the <br>
date whenever I got an email that someone had found the box.  By <br>
allowing the automatic display of the last status update, that <br>
information is a bit more current, since it shows info from people <br>
that perhaps would never send me an email.  (However keep in mind <br>
that there is nothing that guarantees that people are actually <br>
putting in accurate information.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, like Azobox & SpringChick, I also prefer to get more <br>
info via an email message about the status of my boxes.  Thanks to <br>
those that do this!<br>

This was a nice reminder to contact the placer.  One of the features I like<br>
at Atlasquest, (even tho I don't use it as often,) is the  "First aid<br>
needed"  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I know I have been slowly entering my earlier finds now that LbNA will track<br>
them, partly because it  will then "hide" them when I am looking at which<br>
boxes I might be able to  hunt.   I confess, I don't always remember the<br>
name of each individual box now that I have been doing this for a couple of<br>
years.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
So, why might you want to keep people from entering status reports?  Is it<br>
because of the inconvenience of getting so many  emails from earlier finds<br>
right now?  I can understand that. Would be interested in any other reason<br>
as well-I learn  so much form these discussions<br>

<br>
<br>
It is my personal opinion that publicly viewable status reports do not belong on a website whose purpose is to provide a clearinghouse of clues.  Rather it is my feeling that a status report is more appropriately a private exchange of information between box seeker and box planter.  All too often clues are inadvertently given away when people disclose their trail and others come along and follow their footsteps.  And then there is the accuracy of the status report themselves.  Over the past 3 years I have received countless "can't find your box, it must be missing" e-mails.  More often than not, the box was safely in the hiding spot.  Giving seekers the ability to log a status of "attempted" on a letterbox can discourage future seekers from looking for the box.  Many people would rather spend a Saturday afternoon seeking out a half-dozen boxes that have been recently confirmed active than taking a chance on a box that was not findable by previous seekers (even though the box may be safe and sound).<br>
<br>
There are some letterboxers who display box status in their clues; there are others who choose not to display box status at all.  There are some boxers who will give you the last known status if you contact them; there are other highly respected boxers who choose not to answer any questions regarding status, feeling that detracts from the underlying philosophy of the game.  Traditionally public status disclosure and logging have not been a part of the game and there are alternatives for those who wish a more generous level of disclosure -- AtlasQuest, personal web sites and status information provided within individual box clues.  There should not be a need to water down the integrity of the original LbNA clue site by adding it there.<br>
<br>
That being said, I know that I and a smallish group of staunchy old curmudgeons are in the minority on this and I can accept that the added functionality of status reporting on LbNA is a feature welcomed by many, many people.  As such, I can agree to disagree, especially since Choi has made it possible to disable the public display of status logs if a planter so desires.<br>
<br>
However, my primary beef with the status logging is not that it exists, rather that it seems to have inadvertently become a substitute for contact the placer messages or private e-mails to planters about box finds and/or status.  These individual contacts were very useful tools -- not only did they provide specific information as a means of helping a planter keep tabs on their boxes, but also they were a communication between two letterboxers -- sometimes only a stone's throw away from each other, other times clear from the other side of the country, and as such, they facilitated correspondence and community.<br>

definitely think twice about it now as my attempts in no way reflected the<br>
