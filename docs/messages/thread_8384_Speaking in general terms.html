Of the five boxes/people I was able to use, only ONE has been called. And I thought that one for sure, the "Washington Island Series," would be golden for me since it's so remote and not likely to have been found by many others. Rats.<br>

Well, at least I did have enough sense to put the Boston Terrorists in the center square (though my straight line BINGO only happened last week, anyway). <br>
