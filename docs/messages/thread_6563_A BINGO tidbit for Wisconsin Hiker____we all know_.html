&gt;Well hopefully the winner will be someone who has played EVERY year <br/>
&gt;(4 years!), but is still waiting for a win. If my notes are <br/>
&gt;accurate, that would include:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BNL BaliGirl<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm definitely winless! But, I don't think I qualify for your <br/>
luck-wishes. Pretty sure I didn't play the first year.  I think I was <br/>
on the board, watching, but I don't think I participated in the game.<br/>
<br/>
I think the only way I can win this year is if SC does call a wild <br/>
card word tomorrow and it matches mine, as well as tomorrows word <br/>
matching mine.<br/>
<br/>
But, I'd be willing to bet that tomorrow will bring a post that <br/>
declares at least the first, if not all 3, of the full card winners.<br/>
