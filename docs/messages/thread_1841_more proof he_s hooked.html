                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think I mentioned to you guys earlier how my parents were planning<br/>
to go down to TX to visit my aunt in Lufkin, and how Dad was looking<br/>
up clues for boxes to find there.  Up until last night, I was unable<br/>
to convince them, but finally they decided to postpone it - for a week<br/>
(<sigh!> parents!.  It's a start.)  When I went out boxing with him<br/>
today, he said "Oh, I hope those boxes in Lufkin don't get damaged by<br/>
the storm!"  Oh, yeah, he's hooked.  Probably more worried about the<br/>
boxes than his sister-in-law.<br/>
