involved.  We went out this past HOT Sunday with 2 friends, one a boxer and<br>
one not.  The non-boxer has said for a while that she didn't have any<br>
interest in boxing but wouldn't mind going along for the walk and the<br>
company.  Well the non-boxer found one of the boxes that the other 3 of us<br>
had already spent a while searching for, and she found it quickly!  We told<br>
her this made her a "natural" boxer and she should really get a stamp and<br>
book.  A few days later she told me she had decided to make a signature<br>
stamp, but didn't really want to have a logbook and collect the box images.<br>
I told her that was fine (lure them in  s l o w l y ....).  We have several<br>
other friends who have said they "wouldn't mind going along....", so we'll<br>
probably get a few more converted by the end of the year.<br>

Since this is the only weekend that the musical group Tourdion will be<br>
playing, and they are my favorite group, you will more than likely find me<br>
sitting listening to them play and singing along  :-)<br>
I made a Howling Coyote album, and uploaded some photos of us at faire so<br>
you know who to look for.  I will for sure be wearing all black on<br>
Saturday.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
