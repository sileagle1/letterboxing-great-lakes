<br/>
This is BrownRabbit here... My wife (who goes by GrayRabbit) and I <br/>
would like to thank you, SpringChick, and all of you who have made <br/>
the last year so fun and memorable for us.  We've been 'boxing since <br/>
last May (I believe a week AFTER the last gathering), and have had so <br/>
many adventures.  After reading about the hobby in the Freep, <br/>
GrayRabbit surprised me with an anniversary-trip to the Traverse City <br/>
area. Now every trip or vacation we take has some 'boxing elements to <br/>
it ("gotta catch 'em all").  <br/>
<br/>
It's as if we know some of you, just from past logs you've made that <br/>
we've found.  We feel part of a family, and we can grow together.  <br/>
Our part of the state (metro Detroit) has a LOT of growing to do yet. <br/>
We're newbies.  Slowly, but surely... <br/>
<br/>
We'll have to keep our travels short for a while, however, due to an <br/>
addition to Team Rabbit: our daughter was born on March 23!  We're <br/>
sure she'll like 'boxing (I'm currently working on her stamp)!  La <br/>
Famiglia Gonzalez! Delirium! We need some more family-friendly hunts <br/>
out here!  (We're working on some too). In the meantime, our hunts <br/>
will be virtual...<br/>
<br/>
Once again, pleased to meet you all. Thank you, SpringChick, for the <br/>
invitation!<br/>

<br/>
p.s. Tim the Dragon: Yes, we WERE excited to see the Easter series.  <br/>
A very rabbity series, indeed! <br/>

clever stamp in so many of my West Michigan boxes and just this <br/>
weekend down at Van Buren State Park.  Funny how you feel like you <br/>
know people just from following their letterboxing path and <br/>
exchanging e-mails.  Hope we will be able to meet at this year's <br/>
gathering.<br/>
