We have our family Christmas tomorrow so I'm really busy with last <br/>

As for posting a list of what is in the booty -- I am inclined to <br/>
preserve the element of surprise, but how does everyone else feel <br/>
about it?  Either way, I will post a list of the goodies in the prize <br/>
package(s) once they have been won and sent out.<br/>

Good luck to all!<br/>

bootie in advance.  LOL ... the little stinker was the BEST gift<br/>
unwraper and rewraper I've ever seen... wouldn't even tear the<br/>
Christmas paper when she undid the scotch tape!<br/>
<br/>
Of course she comes by it naturally (uh-hum... from her Fathers' side,<br/>
yea, that's it... her Fathers' side!) LOL<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a care either way, but how about a middle of the road<br/>
suggestion?  Perhaps ~sometimes~ when the daily Bingo number is<br/>
announced, the message *might* include one of the bootie items?<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year, everyone!  Don't forget to go out the back door at<br/>
midnight (taking all the bad luck and misfortunes of the old year with<br/>
you) and come back in the front door (bringing in all the good luck<br/>
and fortune of the new year)<br/>

Sail On!<br/>
