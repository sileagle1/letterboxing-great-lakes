I guess the world didn't end today (at least not yet), so you might as well get those BINGO cards filled out after all!<br>

Cards are due in 10 days (via email or US Mail) and booty is due by JAN 26 (given to me at Dead of Winter event or mailed to me or given to me if you have plans to see me somewhere else before JAN 26).<br>
