                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I had intended to move my Tuscola Co box over to Gladwin <br>
today.  But when I retrieved it, I realized I had things in the <br>
journal that made it mandatory that it stay in Tuscola.   I didn't <br>
have any supplies with me to change or replace the journal.  Soooo, I <br>
moved it to a new location in the county.  I didn't have anything <br>
else on hand to plant in Gladwin and I won't be able to do so any time soon.<br>
<br>
So, TrailTroll or anyone else that's interested, Gladwin needs your <br>
help so we can beat Wisconsin to the full line! LOL<br>
<br>
Sorry I couldn't take care of this one for us!  But, as an incentive <br>
to visit the thumb, there are two boxes there now  (and more than 30 <br>
feet apart, to boot!)<br>
