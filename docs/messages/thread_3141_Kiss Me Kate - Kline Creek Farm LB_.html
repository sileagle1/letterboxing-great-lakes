The solution to finding that box is easy....just bushwack the entire area along the back of service road!

Sorry that I don't have an old clue sheet for a Kline Creek Farm Letterbox.  I started with all the boxes in Lake County and I've only recently branched out to other Chicagoland area counties.  <br/>
<br/>
I know you will find that box.  It takes some real investigating.  Start calling the farm and find out who found the box.  You'll track it down.  <br/>

  Does anyone remember a box placed at Kline Creek Farm in DuPage <br/>
  County, Illinois? I think I saw clues for it when we starting boxing <br/>
  a couple of years ago, but I can't find any information for it.<br/>
<br/>
  Strangely enough, the staff at Kline Creek Farm remembers that one of <br/>
  their volunteers brought "something like that" back to the farmhouse <br/>
  to show everyone and then put it back. But the woman we spoke to <br/>
  didn't go with them, so she only knows it's somewhere near the back of <br/>
  the service road.<br/>
<br/>
  I'm hoping to get more information from here or from the farm to go <br/>
  looking for it. I'm willing to adopt it if I find it and no one else <br/>
  wants to claim it.<br/>

I checked the old letterboxing web page and letterboxing basement.  I <br/>
didn't see it on either of those sites.  I thought it was worth a <br/>
shot.    <br/>
