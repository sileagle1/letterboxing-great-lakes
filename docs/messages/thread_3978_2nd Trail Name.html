Ditto on that one, though we had discussed the number of kids we wanted  <br>
before we got married and settled on "3 or 4" <br>
 <br>
God knew we would probably have stopped at #3 so He through in the 4th for  <br>
free (we had twins) Thus our trail name Hart x6 -- ours are ages 15 months (the <br>
 twins), 3 years and soon to be 5 years.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too chuckled when I read "Whattheheckwerewethinking"!  My husband and <br>
I had 3 sons in 4 years and had intended on having 5 children <br>
originally.  It was important to me that they be born close together for <br>
their "bonding"!  Yeah, then once I realized that if I was holding the <br>
hand of one son in one hand, and the hand of one more son in my other <br>
hand---there would always be one more able to run free with the biggest <br>
smile on his face!  That's when that came to a halt.<br>
<br>
FungusWoman's FunGal 2nd choice also gave me a big smile!  Somehow that <br>
should be on the plates of something RED!!!  :)  What is that saying???  <br>
Live long enough to embarrass your children?? ;)<br>
<br>
Okay, Tiptoe and Tonto, this topic has hung over me all week long and <br>
was every bit as difficult as choosing a first trailname?!  I have a <br>
couple alternates, perhaps.  One I almost chose is AT~bound.  I have now <br>
chalked off my list several things I didn't do when I was younger.  <br>
Hiking the AT is still on that list.  Grandma Gatewood, here from Ohio <br>
was the first female to thru-hike the AT at the age of 63.  She used the <br>
beautiful Hocking Hills as her training ground and then after her <br>
husband passed away, she only told her family she was going hiking?!?!  <br>
Once news spread that a grandmother was solo-hiking the trail, Reader's <br>
Digest began tracking her....and it was then, that she decided she had <br>
better call home to someone and let them know how big of a hike she was <br>
on?!  Anyway, she is my inspiration and ya gotta name it to claim <br>
it---but I haven't exactly put it out there to that extent just yet. <br>
<br>
Another name I would consider, now that I have been letterboxing for a <br>
few years and have had my share of challenges, is "Stumped in the woods" <br>
for those moments where I am in the middle of nowhere, clues in hand, <br>
reading out loud (with no one around, of course) turning and looking, <br>
rechecking my compass--and my dog wondering WHY I am tangling his leash <br>
around my legs?!<br>
<br>
Last, would simply be Plastic~addict!  No explanation needed with that <br>
one.  :)<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll just make a letterbox with each of these names?!<br>
<br>
Whew, assignment turned in late, but complete!<br>

so we weren't to "busy" then either LOL {{{blushing}}}<br>
