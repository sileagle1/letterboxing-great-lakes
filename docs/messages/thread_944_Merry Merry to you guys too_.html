                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, Pippin and I will be at GS camp over MLK weekend in January, so we<br/>
hope to introduce the girls to our camp boxes.  Well, I hope to...she's the<br/>
Chief Cook for the weekend, and I'm her Bottle Washer and assistant, so I<br/>
hope she springs me long enough between meals to do so!<br/>
<br/>
Now all of you who think the weather is too cold for boxing...you're all<br/>
welcome to check out the Metra Rail boxes along the Burlington Northern line<br/>
[shameless plug]!!  And while you're at it, why not scout out some sites and<br/>
place some yourself?  There's plenty of stops for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Postals are another option to those of you going thorough withdrawal, though<br/>
the wait for most of them are not good for those needing that instant<br/>
gratification of searching when the spirit moves you.<br/>
<br/>
Less than 90 days until Spring!!!  (-:<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas!<br/>
