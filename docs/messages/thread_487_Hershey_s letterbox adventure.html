                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a great day down in LaSalle county today.  While Mr. <br>
FungusWoman (actually Michelle and I started referring to him between <br>
ourselves as "Squidward") was not to be swayed to join our fold, <br>
Hershey had a blast.  She truly lived up to her new name "Muddy Paws <br>
the Dirty Dog".  <br>
<br>
We were able to eek out one new find, Starved Rock Lodge #5.  We <br>
visited all four of our own boxes (we knew how long it would take us <br>
to find them, so we were able to convince him to stop).  FOOW2 is <br>
indeed alive and well, for those of you who were unable to find it.  <br>
I've added an additional clue (look in the Files section).<br>
<br>
Muddy Paws hid her first box today.  Its clues are in the files <br>
section.  I've also posted clues to FOOW5 (my 10th LbNA place (more if <br>
you count my camp boxes).  I hope to have it placed Friday morning.  I <br>
didn't get a chance to yesterday as I'd hoped.<br>
<br>
Don't know if we're going to make it to the Wisconsin State Fair <br>
tomorrow.  Mr. FW's brother is coming in from out of town, and we may <br>
go see the Tall Ships in Kenosha.  After today's comment of "If I'd <br>
known you were going to want to go letterboxing all day (well, <br>
duh!!!), I wouldn't have gone (now he tells me!)", I don't think I'd <br>
better suggest any Wisconsin boxes!  I guess I can't complain <br>
though...he doesn't make me go fishing with him!<br>

"If you place them, they will come."<br>
<br>
PS:  Papillon released a hitchhiker, Hugs and Kisses, today.  Won't <br>
say where, but you can probably narrow it down to one of five boxes!<br>
