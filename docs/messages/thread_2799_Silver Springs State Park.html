 There was a box posted at one time at Silver Springs, placed by the Grey Family as I recall.  I found it long ago.  Since it's no longer listed, my guess would be that it is gone.  I can look through my "archives" and see if I still have a hard copy of the clues.  If I do, I'll send them to you and you can see if by any chance it's still there.  Give me a couple days, and if I forget, remind me offlist.<br>

 Does anyone know if there are boxes in the Silver Springs State Park<br>
 near Yorkville, IL?  If so, where would I find the clues?  We're very<br>
 new at this and I'm still feeling my way around.<br>
