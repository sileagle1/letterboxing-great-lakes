                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, so the twins passed their 5th birthday back in January and I still never made their trailnames "official" by announcing them.<br>
<br>
I never thought this would be so hard. But with the older girls, I wanted their trailnames to be nicknames I use for them and hold a more sentimental meaning for me.<br>
<br>
I had thought of calling Maddie "Skipper" and Will "Champ", but neither nickname comes naturally for me to say. I still call Katie "Skeeter" and Alex "Bug-a-Boo" and interchange their trailname with thier real name in every day conversation.<br>
<br>
Sometime ago the girls asked if they could be called "The Wonder Twins" after some show. Skeeter has been inundating me with different Trailname idea's . . . but in the end it came down to what my little pet-name is for them.<br>
<br>
So, their official trailnames are; The Wonder Twins: Mad-Mad & Bud-Bud. Not really original, but meaningful to me.<br>
<br>
So, on behalf of Mad Mad & Bud Bud this is hx6 signing out.<br>
