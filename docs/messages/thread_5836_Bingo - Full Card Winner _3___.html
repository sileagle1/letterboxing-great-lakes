Congratulations Jill, and to all of this year's winners!  The final winners list is in the Files section of the group.  Prizes will be mailed within the next week or so.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who played and made the winter pass with amusement. And now, the weather is telling us it is time to put away the Bingo daubers and get outside on the trail!<br>
