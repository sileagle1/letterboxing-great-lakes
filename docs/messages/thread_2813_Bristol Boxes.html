                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think that having more boxes and a gathering and all at the faire <br/>
is a great idea, however, please keep in mind that it is a privately <br/>
operated business and proper permissions are needed before anything <br/>
is done.  Although I have never had a problem with getting permission <br/>
and they enjoy having us do the boxes each year, I do HAVE to make a <br/>
formal request each year and provide detailed information about where <br/>
the boxes are and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that if you wish to plant any more boxes at Britol <br/>
and/or have a gathering there that maybe Kate could talk to Sue (the <br/>
Bristol manager) about it as I am too far away right now.  I'm sure <br/>
that as long as the boxes are placed so they don't interfere with the <br/>
activities of the faire, and the proper channels are gone through, <br/>
they will be allowed.  I also would think that the faire may work a <br/>
special deal for letterboxers coming for a gathering.  If you intend <br/>
to make yourself into a letterperson, I don't think you would need <br/>
any prior permission for that, unless you work at the faire in a role <br/>
and it might interfere with your role.<br/>
<br/>
Glad everyone is having fun with the boxes again this year!  Let's <br/>
keep the Bristol management happy with us!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
