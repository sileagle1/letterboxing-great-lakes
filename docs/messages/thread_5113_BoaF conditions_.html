Woods Forest Preserve.  I am not concerned about the river, but I AM <br/>
wondering if the little creek is up enough to be over the stepping stones <br/>
for crossing.  I'll check that out tonight.<br/>
<br/>
I have finally learned my lesson NOT to plant letterboxes too close to the <br/>
Kishwaukee River because it does flood sometimes up to 12' above normal. <br/>
However, almost all of MacQueen, Potawatomie, and Kishwaukee Game &amp; Fish are <br/>
high enough not to worry about - it's only the lower sections along the <br/>
river that might be iffy.<br/>
<br/>
As a note - IF on the day of the event the creek is high enough that the <br/>
stepping stones are under water, Potawatomie can still be accessed by a <br/>
short drive, rather than walking the connecting trail.<br/>

Let me know if there are any other questions :)<br/>
