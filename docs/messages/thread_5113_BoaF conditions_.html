                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was just there last night, and will be back again tonight (hiding event <br>
boxes).  The Kishwaukee River is up a little, but isn't out of its banks as <br>
of last night.  Tonight I will concentrate on the adjoining Potawatomie <br>
Woods Forest Preserve.  I am not concerned about the river, but I AM <br>
wondering if the little creek is up enough to be over the stepping stones <br>
for crossing.  I'll check that out tonight.<br>
<br>
I have finally learned my lesson NOT to plant letterboxes too close to the <br>
Kishwaukee River because it does flood sometimes up to 12' above normal. <br>
However, almost all of MacQueen, Potawatomie, and Kishwaukee Game & Fish are <br>
high enough not to worry about - it's only the lower sections along the <br>
river that might be iffy.<br>
<br>
As a note - IF on the day of the event the creek is high enough that the <br>
stepping stones are under water, Potawatomie can still be accessed by a <br>
short drive, rather than walking the connecting trail.<br>
<br>
Let me know if there are any other questions :)<br>
