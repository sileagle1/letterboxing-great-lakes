There were a couple of little rain drops that fell at the fair, but not enough to dampen the spirits.

I am surprised that it didn't pour while we were there. I haven't had the  <br/>
best faire luck the past few years. When Laughing Coyote and I went to work at  <br/>
one in South Dakota, it rained, though rain isn't the word for the constant  <br/>
downpour we lived through, the entire weekend. Last year, while letterboxing at <br/>
 Bristol, the tornado sirens went off, followed by a downpour. I was blamed <br/>
for  having a renfaire rain curse. Then when it started to sprinkle this <br/>
year...you  get the pattern. ;) Hope you can make it back again!<br/>

No word on Eric Grainger (letterperson), so you'll just have to try <br/>
and see if he's around.<br/>

Just a reminder for anyone who would like a boxing companion at Faire, <br/>
just let me know as I'll be there every day!<br/>
