bringing the kids along to the Gathering on June 2. I have made a <br>
series of boxes, 24 so far, "Just For Kids". I plan to hide them for <br>
the kids to find. It's going to be like an Easter Egg hunt. There will <br>
be no clues and they won't be too hard to find so the little ones can <br>
find them too. A few will be left on a table for them to stamp while <br>
you are stamping in the event stamps. I will have some washable ink <br>
pads and some hand wipes for them to clean up.  All I ask of you is to <br>
make them a little logbook to stamp into or at least help them make <br>
one. I have numbered them all as well as named them to make it easier <br>
for you to find them when you go to log them on AQ. <br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to meeting as many of you as I can. See you in <br>
June.  <br>
<br>
