horrid people!  We actually found out about Letterboxing through word <br>

were using was one I had on hand for about 10 years!  So, we used <br>
that.  My husband has recently carved our replacement stamp, only to <br>
realize for what he wanted to do with it, he needed the pink stuff <br>
and a smaller tool, LOL!  So, we will eventually get it switched <br>
over, but it has taken me the better part of the year to get him <br>
interested in letterboxing instead of being just drug along for <br>
security reasons, LOL!<br>
<br>
But, I have to agree - using a paperpunch is a bit odd.....  I mean, <br>
how did they stamp into their logbooks if they carried no stamping <br>
materials with them??  Chew the shape of the stamp into the <br>
paper???  The visual is killing me, LOL!<br>

I think where the dissention comes in is the lack of personal stamp with the note (particularly punching holes in the pages of somebody's log book) and when a group or family of several people each *sign* (not stamp) their name on a separate page in the book -- particularly when the book is small.  It's really cool that your 3-yr. old can write his name, but I don't really need to know that or care to find it in my letterbox log book -- carve or buy the kid a stamp so they can participate in letterboxing in the way it is traditionally done.  The personal rubber stamp (hand-carved or store-bought) is a pretty fundamental part of the letterboxing equation.<br>
<br>
I realize there are always going to be exceptions -- casual finders, somebody forgot their stamp, etc. but those are not who we are talking about.<br>

Maybe they forgot their stamps and Mama Paperpuncher is into <br>
scrapbooking and had her supplies in the trunk from attending a recent <br>
crop??? Or maybe no stamp pad?? Just out of curiousity, what would have <br>
been the appropriate way to "stamp in" if you have no stamp or stamp <br>
pad with you?<br>

I don't think we'd ever look for a letterbox unless we had our stamp, <br>
ink and our logbooks with us.<br>
<br>
I think that people who find it accidently are the ones who most often <br>
sign into a book with just their name and a comment, or very new boxers <br>
who go out for the first time to see what it is like and to see if they <br>
could find a box.  From what I've seen, they usually use a pen or <br>
pencil to write something.<br>

One of the favorite boxes we've found so far as far as<br>

I love to read through log books and check out the creative stamps.  It is part of the fun of finding the letterbox.<br>
I think its a neat idea for someone to leave a punch too, as long as they write something along with it, and if there is a family of punchers, go ahead and do it on the same page as to not waste all the pages.    <br>
I admit to being a person that uses 1 stamp that is a favorite of mine and its commercially bought, my son does so too, because we don't have the talent to do our own sig stamp by hand should we be left out of the fun of letterboxing?  Or just not be able to put our stamp in the log? <br>
If it were my logbook, and of course it is not, I'd like to have as many people as possible put their stamp/punchie in, and leave comments as well.  Isn't that the fun part of making  a letterbox?<br>

I absolutely love when people leave personal notes in my logbooks! I <br>
enjoy hearing what they think of the location, the stamps, and WHEN <br>
they visited! We used to just stamp in - now I think I will leave a <br>
little blurb since I enjoy it so much. <br>
<br>
Does that really bother anyone if its done with respect re: room, and <br>
the size of the logbook?<br>

The thing that attracted me to letterboxing was its hidden,<br>
secretive  nature.  It almost makes me feel like a secret<br>
agent or something like that!  As a result, I carved a<br>
somewhat cryptic stamp, and I almost always just sign my<br>
initials.  This reinforces the feeling that I am doing <br>
something covert and secretive.  I'm sorry if it's<br>
disappointing to people.  It's just my personal style.  :)<br>

I certainly don't think of people with store-bought stamps as "horrid"!<br>
I do find it rather disappointing when a logbook contains as many<br>
of those as hand-carved stamps, which unfortunately seems to be the<br>
case sometimes.  It's not hard to carve a stamp, really it isn't.  I thought<br>
I wouldn't be able to do it because I'm not usually good with that kind<br>
of thing, but I managed.  No one expects a stamp to be perfect and I'm<br>
much happier to see a simple, square, crudely-carved, negative-image <br>
personal stamp than the fanciest store-bought stamp!<br>
<br>
You wouldn't even have to do any carving to make a unique stamp.<br>
There is an article on letterboxing.info about making stamps out of<br>
fun foam cut with scissors, which sounds like a good idea.  (I have seen<br>
commercial stamps for use in decorating walls that are made from foam,<br>
so it makes sense.)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I use a store-bought stamp for my signature stamp.  However, it is <br>
not a very common stamp - it hasn't been made in about 15 years.  I <br>
found it on eBay.  I am not going to replace it with a carved stamp <br>
because I really like it.  And since it isn't a stamp that you can <br>
just go into any store and buy, I think it is unique enough to use.<br>
<br>
After reading everyone posts about how much they enjoy reading the <br>
notes in the log books, I will make a point in the future to write a <br>
little bit more when I find a box.  Although, sometimes that can be a <br>
little bit hard if you are trying to hurry up so that someone doesn't <br>
see what you are doing.<br>
