It was time for some quarterly "box maintenance" this month.  Some were easy<br>
to do since we accompanied potentially new converts as they found their<br>
first boxes (some that we had hid).  Of these two, both were in fine shape,<br>
but one was totally exposed sitting NEXT to the tree it was supposed to be<br>
inside.  We rehid it.  Within the week my nephew & his fianc reported that<br>
another box of ours was open and contents scattered.  They managed to find<br>
everything, cleaned and dried the stamp and box and returned to its spot.<br>
The logbook was quite wet and damaged, so they took it with them to return<br>
to us.  We went back within the week to put a new logbook in the box.  When<br>
we checked on another of our boxes, we found it was cracked, open and<br>
scattered.  Once again all the pieces were nearby and luckily the logbook<br>
was only slightly damp in a corner.  We brought this one home to repair and<br>
then returned everything with double-bagging.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story?<br>
1.  I highly encourage everyone to do some periodic box maintenance.  If you<br>
catch a problem early enough you can probably resolve it before the entire<br>
box is lost.<br>
2.  Double-bagging logbooks is our new standard.<br>
3.  We really appreciate an email from a finder to let us know the status of<br>
a box.  If it is in good shape then we know we don't need to spend time<br>
checking on it.  If it's not, then we can address the problem ASAP.<br>
<br>
<br>
Observation #2<br>
The TIME article has spurred the interest of at least some people in<br>
Wisconsin.  I received an email from someone to let us know they had read<br>
the article in TIME and then found the box we planted in Madison recently.<br>
They were the first finders.  We engaged in an email correspondence and I<br>
tried to give him some additional tips and places to look for more info on<br>
LB (including what to do with hitchhikers).  They (family with 2 kids)<br>
sounded liked they were already hooked and they were making plans to look<br>
for more in their area.<br>
<br>
<br>
Observation #3<br>
We're planning an LB trip to Illinois next weekend and it was interesting to<br>
see that one of their state parks actively promotes letterboxing:<br>
http://www.starvedrocklodge.com/lbox.html  This is quite different than the<br>
attitude of some other state and national parks.  We're hoping that the<br>
Starved Rock boxes are actually in place and haven't disappeared due to the<br>
publicity (or due to the tornado in April).  We'll let you know next week...<br>

I received an email from a geocacher (groundhog02).  He used the "Contact<br>
the Placer" feature to let me know he could see the box I planted at the GL<br>
Gathering last month from the trail (Playing Possum).  He asked if it should<br>
be better hid and offered to go back that same day to cover it better if I<br>
wanted him to.  Of course I took him up on his offer and gave him many<br>
thanks!<br>

Moral of this story:<br>
Some geocachers are wonderful!<br>
