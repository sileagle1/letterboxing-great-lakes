Any other boxers going to be at the event?<br/>

Any of the boxes in Waukesha in town instead of in the outlying county parks?<br/>

I think I might have to look into the magnifying lamp Wisconsin Hiker <br/>

Thanks for making my day!<br/>

we box while the parks aren't horribly busy.  Today, we'll most likely<br/>

There are a few boxes in town, but they take a little pre-trip work to<br/>
find out where.<br/>
