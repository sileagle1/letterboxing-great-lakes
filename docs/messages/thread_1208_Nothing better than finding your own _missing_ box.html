<br>
We had received an update on our Circus Tent box in<br>
our Greatest Show on Earth Series.  It sounded like<br>
the letterboxer had the correct place but couldn't<br>
find the box.  We were finally able to get over there<br>
today and check for sure.  When we first looked, we<br>
were confused.  Seemed right, but seemed wrong.  We<br>
searched around.  Then I saw that the downed tree had<br>
been moved a foot or two down the hill.  We then<br>
figured that the tree hadn't been pushed but flipped. <br>
When we checked the branch that would have been in the<br>
air(but was now cracked on the ground) we found the<br>
box intact inside the branch.  It hadn't been found<br>
since December.  So anyone missing the Circus Tent<br>
letterbox in the series can check the updated clues<br>
and complete the first five in The Greatest Show on<br>
Earth.<br>
