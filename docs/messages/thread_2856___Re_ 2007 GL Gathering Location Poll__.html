&gt; Of the states that have not previously hosted, there have been two <br/>
&gt; volunteers for hosting the 2007 GL Gathering to be held on <br/>
Saturday, <br/>
&gt; June 2, 2007.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have created a poll for group members to choose between these <br/>
two <br/>
&gt; locations.  To access the poll, go to the group online and click <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; *polls* in the left-hand navigation menu.  Each group member may <br/>
&gt; vote one time.  You can change your vote at any time before the <br/>
poll <br/>
&gt; closes on August 31, 2006.  At the end of the month, the location <br/>
&gt; that receives the most votes will be chosen as the host location.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A huge thanks goes to both of the letterboxers who have stepped <br/>
&gt; forward and volunteered to host the gathering.  This is a big <br/>
&gt; undertaking, but surely a rewarding one.  I know I am not alone <br/>
when <br/>
&gt; I say that past gathering hosts are more than happy to answer <br/>
&gt; questions as you plan the event.  We have been fortunate to have <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; several outstanding events over the past few years and it is <br/>
&gt; certainly something we look forward to each June.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck to Minnesota and Ohio!<br/>
