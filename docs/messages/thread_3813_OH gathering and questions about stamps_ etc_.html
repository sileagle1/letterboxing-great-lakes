Welcome  and hope to meet you at a gathering, perhaps in Ohio on June  2?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not sure I did talk to hubby about if we get really into this we could go  <br/>
meet others who do it in OH on June 2nd, but am trying not to push it on him as  <br/>
I am hoping this will be something we can do together for many years to come <br/>
and  don't want him to sour on it this soon.  We will see how St. Pat's Day  <br/>
weekend trip goes and by the end of that he and I will either be hooked for <br/>
life  (I hope) or totally turned off on it.<br/>
<br/>
I looked at all the wonderful stamps Scutdogs had posted on his web site  and <br/>
now have another question.  How do folks get the colors on the  stamps.  Many <br/>
look as though they may have been stamped in black ink and  then colored in <br/>
with pencil or markers, others have obviously been stamped using  a <br/>
multi-colored stamp pad, or I have read about using markers to color the  stamps then <br/>
stamping them but it seems time would be limited and this way might  not allow <br/>
time to use many colors and get the colors on neatly before the ink  would dry <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
For example the Farm Yard or LBNA Maps carved by Scoutdogs are very  <br/>
colorful.  Do you stamp them like that or color them in after the fact  maybe just for <br/>
the scans to add to the website to enhance the wonderful  details?<br/>
<br/>
Also if I draw something on paper first what is the best way to transfer it  <br/>
to the carving medium?  I used heavy pencil on the front of the design then  <br/>
turned it over and rubbed hard to get it on the stamp backwards for carving so  <br/>
it would come out right again when it was stamped and that works well enough <br/>
but  is there maybe a better way?<br/>
<br/>
Do you just carry all your stamping stuff in a backpack on the trail or a  <br/>
messenger bag maybe?<br/>
<br/>
What sorts of things do you use for boxes?  The one we found so far  was a <br/>
small square rubbermaid type container covered entirely in black duct tape  with <br/>
a bit of camo tape on it too.  Is that really necessary or can it just  be a <br/>
plain untaped container?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I have so many questions but want to learn as much as I can so I can  <br/>
avoid making mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the warm welcome everyone and the suggestions.<br/>

<br/>
As for the coloring, I'd say 99% of my stamps are line images that I stamp in black.  The color is then added with colored pencils later.  <br/>
<br/>
To use markers to color in a stamp, directly on the stamp:<br/>
you can use as many colors as you like and it's OK if they dry before you're ready to stamp.  because just prior to pressing the stamp to paper, you re-wet the ink by exhaling slowly on the stamp.  You want the moisture from your breath to moisten the ink, but don't exhale to hard or the air flow created dries the ink faster than the moisture can work :-)  If you have a super fine mister (atomizer) you can use that too.<br/>
<br/>
When I looked for letterboxes, I only carried a fanny pack with paper to stamp on, my black ink pad (I know, I'm not very creative), a compass, a few paper towels and baggies and some clean-up bags (because I usually had a dog with me.)  I also added a small flashlight after too many times of "just-one-more-itis" that had me searching or leaving a trail in the dark. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Vanman, please don't use alcohol wipes on rubber, alcohol can degrade rubber or cause it to get sticky.  A wet paper towel in a baggies is all you really need.  Save the alcohol pads for first aid :-)<br/>
<br/>
As for letterbox containers, most of mine were microboxes so I used a lot of film canisters and pill bottles.  I LOVE the cloth camo tape used for gun stocks and bows (found in sporting goods stores that carry those things.)  The cloth hides the box much better than the plastic camo tape and certainly better than no covering.  A little bit of plastic sticking out from under a rock or pile of sticks can stick out like a sore thumb and invite the curious to investigate further.  When I used the cloth tape, I accidentally dropped a pill bottle letterbox in the leaves and even though it was right in front of me, I had a hard time finding it!  I have found some of my boxes completely uncovered and exposed when doing maintenance checks, but they were still in place because that tape doesn't stand out.  After awhile it picks up a bit of dirt too, which helps it blend in even more.  Can you place boxes without the tape?  Sure!  But I think the box is safer with some type of camouflage.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's been a LOT of discussion about camo tape since the nonsense in<br/>
Boston. The concern is that average Joe Blow stumbling across a<br/>
'mysterious' package that has clearly been wrapped for disguise will<br/>
over react and yell for the bomb squad. Some locations that allow<br/>
boxes have already stated they must be clear, so that contents may be<br/>
identified without opening the box.<br/>
<br/>
I personally have switched to doing partial camo. I'm wrapping camo<br/>
around the sides in a compromise, leaving the top and bottom of the<br/>
container clear.  Being an urban boxer, I'd really rather avoid public<br/>
panics :)<br/>
