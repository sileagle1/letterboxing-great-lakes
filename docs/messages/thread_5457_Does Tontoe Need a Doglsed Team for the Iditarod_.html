                    <div class="plaintext-content">First off, Kemosabe is the trail name of our faithful four-legged letterboxing companion who <br>
wasn't going to accompany us on the Iditarod for fear that we might hook him up to a <br>
harness and "Mush" him.  But after reading the posts, he may have to come along to protect <br>
Tonto from any murderous schemes along the trail.  (We are grateful that Doglvrs have no <br>
such plans!)  Secondly, Kemosabe, seeing that Tonto's trail name was spelled "TontoE", he is <br>
concerned that a frostbite plot might endanger his master and he should come along to keep <br>
his tootsies warm!  <br>
