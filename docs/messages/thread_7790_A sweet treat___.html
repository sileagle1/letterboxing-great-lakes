<br>
Just an fyi because we know some of you have bought honey from us in the past and because we only see everyone once or twice a year, we're bringing some Sweet Beesus Honey along with us for anyone who may have run out or wants to stock up. (Yes, yes...for those who don't know, when we're not finding boxes, were raising honeybees. One hobby just wasn't enough.) :)  <br>
<br>
See you soon!<br>
