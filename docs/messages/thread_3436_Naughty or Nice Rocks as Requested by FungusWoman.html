about your rocks!! Very cool!<br>

<br>
The Naughty or Nice rocks are perishable, currently.   Santa kept us<br>
too busy to work on weatherproofing.  We were lucky to have them ready<br>
for the gathering.<br>
<br>
The rocks are high tech papier-mache.  Celluclay + water + spray paint<br>
with a stone texture = rock.   <br>
<br>
Mix the Celluclay with water to a bread dough consistency.  Roll it<br>
out.  Wrap the container of your choice with plastic wrap.  Shape the<br>
Celluclay around the container in the rock formation of your choice. <br>
Tuck wads of plastic wrap between the container and the Celluclay and<br>
let it dry overnight rock side up.  <br>
<br>
The next day, remove the wads and the container, and stretch the<br>
cavity a bit since it will shrink as it dries.  Bake the rock in a 200<br>
degree oven for a couple of hours, with the rock hole side up, on a<br>
cookie sheet.  Alternate hole side up and hole side down as needed. <br>
If you do some of the baking in the evening, you can turn off the<br>
oven, leaving the rock in it, at bedtime so the residual heat<br>
continues to dry the rock.  If you bake in several shifts, press on<br>
the inner walls to limit the amount of shrinkage.<br>
<br>
Once the rock is dry, trim the inner walls as needed so the container<br>
fits.  Then, cover the outside with a spray paint that has a stone<br>
texture.  The paint is available in several colors.  We used all red<br>
on Nice and a red base with a lighter topcoat on Naughty.  Our rocks<br>
survived their snowy day, but you'd want to experiment with<br>
weatherproofing options for a permanent placement.<br>
<br>
For those of you who didn't have an opportunity to find Naughty or<br>
Nice, you can glimpse Naughty in some of the St. Nick Gathering photos<br>
taken by FungusWoman and Wisconsin Hiker.<br>
