"Historical House" lb.  I think we found the right spot, but couldn't<br>
find the box at all.  Has anybody found this one?  LBNA doesn't list<br>
anyone, but not everyone logs in.  I also haven't heard from the<br>
placer.  It's a great spot and it would be unfortunate to lose it<br>
barely before it started.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found "Historical House" on May 15, three days after it was <br>
placed (we were the first finders).  To be honest, I was <br>
concerned about its safety.  When we found it, there were some <br>
teenagers sort of skulking around, and we found some beer <br>
cans and other signs that people like to "hang out" at that spot.  <br>
The box was actually right out in plain sight, although I'm sure <br>
the placers hadn't left it that way, so I think it might have already <br>
been disturbed.  We tried to hide it as well as possible (covering <br>
with leaves and such), but the spot wasn't really very secure.  I <br>
wouldn't be surprised if it is missing already (which would be <br>
sad because it has a great stamp).<br>
<br>
I see on LbNA that the placers checked on and found the box a <br>
few days after my visit (May 18), so it lasted at least until then.<br>
