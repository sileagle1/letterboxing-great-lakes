                    <div class="plaintext-content">After putting our letterboxing on the back burner for a few months busy<br>
with school and what not, we just really had this song in our heads this<br>
weekend....."On the first day of Christmas.....", thanks to the<br>
CignaCats.  We jumped in the car and headed to Brookfield, but also did<br>
a quick check to see what else was in the area. I made a mental note of<br>
a few nearby boxes, but our focus was going to be the 12 Days of<br>
Christmas.  We enjoyed the easy jaunt around the lake.  Met lots of<br>
dogs, runners, a few dogs, walkers, some dogs, in-line skaters, and more<br>
dogs!  Two out of the three kids even found a dog pile to step in!  Part<br>
way through the clue sheet, we were instructed to "wave to the fox".<br>
Fox? What fox?  We didn't see a fox or anything that looked like a fox.<br>
We decided we were missing something that wasn't necessary to our hunt<br>
and moved on.  After finishing up, I began to think about the mental<br>
notes I made about the other boxes in the<br>
area......think.......think.......aha!  Some of us are slow, but two<br>
trips around the lake was worth it.  We caught the best sunset and we<br>
would have missed it if it weren't for the second trip around the lake.<br>
It was a cotton candy sky and Blue Thunder thought it looked like a<br>
rainbow of sorts.  On the way back to the car, he stopped and said<br>
"wait, I just like to watch the sky to see the clouds move" and then<br>
commented about the tire tracks in the clouds.  The colors were<br>
gorgeous.  Don't know what it is about letterboxing, but it has been a<br>
few months since we've been out on the hunt, and I think it has been<br>
about that long since I've noticed the sunset too.  It was good to be<br>
out on the hike again.  That indoor track at the athletic club just<br>
doesn't seem to measure up to a letterbox hike!  We picked up a<br>
hitchhiker along our way (thanks Cat Herders), so I guess that will be<br>
an incentive to not wait another 2 months before we get out there again.<br>
<br>
We did make a trip up to REI before heading back home again.  Not sure<br>
we would have found that box except perchance, we brought Little Green<br>
Monkey with us (as we always do) and being the monkey he is, he was<br>
crawling and somersaulting all over the floor as only the 5 under crowd<br>
can do without really drawing too much attention to themselves.  The<br>
rest of us were trying to look discreetly, while "browsing" the store.<br>
The clues were easy to decipher, but the hiding spot was not easy to<br>
find.  Thanks to Little Green Monkey we found it in short order and none<br>
too soon as the store was closing just as we finished stamping in.<br>
Green Monkey thought it was quite a novelty to find a letterbox in a<br>
store, so when we stopped at Half Price Books before heading back out of<br>
town, he thought we were looking for another letterbox.  Sadly, he found<br>
none there.<br>
<br>
All in all, we had a great day.  We listened to Les Miserables Radio<br>
Theatre on tape for the drive over, had two great walks around the lake,<br>
saw a gorgeous sunset, picked up a hitchhiker, were successful at REI<br>
and finished the day out with the conclusion of Les Miserables.  This<br>
one goes in the books as a great day!  Lots of memories to keep.  Thanks<br>
again, fellow letteboxers!<br>

LOL - I did not see a Fox to wave at either!!  We missed the dog piles <br>
though!  Did you see the guy hanging out at the Beach House with his radio, <br>
roller blades and imaginary friend??  Man, it takes all types, although, I <br>
had not seen one of those in a while (A McDonald's in Downtown Atlanta in <br>
1992 if I remember right)!<br>
<br>
I was ticked that I forgot to look for the one other box out there, but oh <br>
well, we just got our County park sticker in the mail last week, so we will <br>
be covered as we letterbox around this summer.<br>
<br>
BTW - was the Les Mis tape from the library system??  Sounds <br>
interesting!  We listen to fun things like that even as we run errands <br>
(Have covered many a story that way!<br>

Only 2 more weeks until we pull them for the season.  We too were <br>
out boxing this weekend, although we didn't get as many boxes as we <br>
had hoped for since Mrs. CignaCat is now 8 months pregnant and just <br>
walking up the stairs can be a workout!<br>
<br>
As far as the fox goes, that was a little shout out to Wisconsin <br>
Hiker and Martini Man, who have a "fox" box hidden in the park.  <br>
It's in a pretty excellent hiding spot, so we recommend it for <br>
anyone that has not had the opportunity to find it yet!<br>
<br>
We hope everyone enjoyed the warm weekend weather.  happy boxing!<br>

<br>
With all the attention that sly one has got recently, I REALLY wish I <br>
would have carved a new stamp.  It was one of our first boxes we hid <br>
and I ordered a custom stamp for it.  However the box contents were <br>
scattered about at some point in time and everything got soaked and the <br>
stamp is warped.  At this point in time I'd feel competent enough to <br>
carve the image myself.<br>
<br>
Oh well, someday!<br>
