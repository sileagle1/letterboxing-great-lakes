I loved those boxes also... Hoping you make it over to the Lake Michigan<br>
shore at some point -- I have a hunch you will love the lakeshore boxes<br>
there ;-) One of the most prolific displays of trillium (and many other<br>
spring wildflowers) I have seen while letterboxing has been at Markin Glen<br>
Park in Kalamazoo (home of 'Mark in the Park' LB). If you have not been to<br>
that one, you must go... One of my absolute favorite walks in the park.<br>

especially delightful because of the way you happen upon them in the woods<br>
or a grassy meadow, etc.  It is like a surprise, as if nature put them there<br>
just for those whose souls choose to wander where most people never roam.  I<br>
love them in their own right just for the beauty, but also flowers are my<br>
favorite subject for photography.<br>
