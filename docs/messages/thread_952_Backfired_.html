My husband, bless his heart, gave me a GPS unit for Christmas <br>
thinking it would help me in my letterboxing searches.  When I told <br>
him that there is a whole other hobby similar to letterboxing that <br>
makes use of GPS units, his eyes bugged out and he said, "Another <br>
hobby!  You don't need ANOTHER hobby!"  After a good laugh, I told <br>
him I had no intention of adding geocaching to my list of pasttimes, <br>
but I AM interested in finding some geocaches that I know are hidden <br>
around here... just to see how they do it.  I've never run into any <br>
while letterboxing like some of you have mentioned.<br>

I was the same way, had no interest in geocaching<br>
until one of my friends tagged along with me finding<br>
boxes, then asked me to go with them on a geocache<br>
hunt.  Well, now it has turned into a bi-weekly<br>
ritual.  LB one week and GC the other.   Hope you have<br>
fun.<br>
