  The authorities of the home of FOOW3 have found the box and confiscated<br/>
it.  They are refusing to allow me to keep it there.  So now I have to go<br/>
looking for another spot to hide it.   I'll let you know when I find one.<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, they gave it back to me.  I just happened to stop by to check on who<br/>
came to visit it lately, when I noticed it was missing.  I saw a guy reading<br/>
a magazine nearby and almost started stalking him, thinking he was waiting<br/>
for me to leave to replace it.  In the meantime, I came to my senses and<br/>
went over to where Papillon was standing and told her it wasn't there.<br/>
Without going into too many details here, I discovered what I related below.<br/>
I just can't figure out how they actually found it.  As you know I've been<br/>
monitoring my clues by requesting people ask me for them.  I did get a<br/>
request for FOOW3 &amp; 5 on Monday.  I wonder if that was actually a "spy"!?<br/>
The hiding place was too obscure without knowledge of the clues...they<br/>
wouldn't have just randomly stumbled across it.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don't want to go into details here, but there is a lesson to be<br/>
learned.  There was a person looking for the box...that person feels badly<br/>
about the situation, but I am not blaming him/her (and I am saying this<br/>
publicly!).  The topic of searching for a letterbox did come up...an<br/>
employee of the establishment had read Time, so was familiar with the<br/>
concept, and actually was excited that there was a box on-site.  But the<br/>
lesson is, don't volunteer more info than needed.  Stealth and secrecy!  Lie<br/>
like a lion...never mind what Mom taught you about being an honest person!<br/>
Say you lost a pen, a contact lens, whatever....<br/>
<br/>
And again...you know who you are, we spoke privately.  Do not feel bad...I<br/>
hold no ill feelings...it's only a game!  #3's gonna rise again!<br/>
