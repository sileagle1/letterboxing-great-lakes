My opinion has always been that the main event stamp is for those that attend the event and should be retired -- meant only for those who actually attend. <br>
<br>
YES, I know there are others who feel differently, and that's fine. This is an area where there is no real rule.<br>
<br>
However, for *my* event stamps, they're retired after the gathering.<br>
<br>
I've been debating on including the main event stamp from GLG 2010 in the "Memories of GLG 2010" box.<br>
<br>
Typically, it would be retired and spend the rest of its days in my closet.<br>
<br>
So, the question is, should I or should I not include it in the box of stamps?<br>

Please, don't recomend me cut off the date, or alter the stamp in anyway -- yes, I thought of it & no, I couldn't bring myself to do it.<br>

The way we look at the event stamps is similar to the way we look at a limited edition piece of art.  So many copies and that's that!...Same idea as creating something and then throwing away the mold after a limited number are made.  This of course makes the value go up with the less copies.  Attending an event one is rewarded with the event stamp...original art...to be collected just as we collect stamps out in the field...they are earned.<br>
We vote it should find a nice place in that closet of yours...that way long after you are gone...your great-grandchildren can show up on Antique Roadshow and claim that they have the "original" GLG 2010 event stamp...carved by their very own great grand pappy!  Or, they could just throw it into the coffin as our children will do with ALL of our logbooks, stamps etc. exclaiming, "Good riddance!"....to the stamps of course...not us...we think!<br>
Just our two cents...<br>

Maybe you will find a worthy purpose for it some day.  I used a portion of the image from the event stamp I carved for "Wandering in Wonderland" for an Alice in Wonderland-themed LTC, but never sent it out to any other event.<br>

second thought to leaving it in the closet, except for the GLG 2010 Event Box FW <br>

My opinion has always been that the main event stamp is for those that attend the event and should be retired -- meant only for those who actually attend. <br>
<br>
YES, I know there are others who feel differently, and that's fine. This is an area where there is no real rule.<br>
<br>
However, for *my* event stamps, they're retired after the gathering.<br>
<br>
I've been debating on including the main event stamp from GLG 2010 in the "Memories of GLG 2010" box.<br>
<br>
Typically, it would be retired and spend the rest of its days in my closet.<br>
<br>
So, the question is, should I or should I not include it in the box of stamps?<br>
<br>
Please, don't recomend me cut off the date, or alter the stamp in anyway -- yes, I thought of it & no, I couldn't bring myself to do it.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
