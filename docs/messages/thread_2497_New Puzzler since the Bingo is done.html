<br>
I got started on the Da Vinci Code puzzlers <br>
http://flash.sonypictures.com/movies/davincicodequest/<br>
<br>
None are as much of a brain twister as some of the letterboxes I'm <br>
working on (spring chicks, TJMI, Mapsurfers) - but it is fun especially <br>
the geography puzzles to move the pieces around.  <br>
<br>
I only had three left on the Bingo - but hadn't gotten a answer in over <br>
3 weeks.<br>
<br>
Have a great spring.<br>
