                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've created a new stamp based on the design of the original Great <br>
Lakes Gathering Event Stamp (the same design that is on the home page <br>
here and the patches) to be used as a traveling event stamp.  This <br>
stamp will make it's debut at the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering and after <br>
that will be available for events in the Great Lakes region.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in the stamp for your 2006 event, please let me <br>
know or you can also make your request at the LBNA_EventBoxes Yahoo! <br>
group.<br>
