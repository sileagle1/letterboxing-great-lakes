                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am traveling to Flint, Michigan this weekend.  Camplady is going to be tied up at a baby shower, but I have four hours to kill with my 8 month old daughter, and I just finished her stamp.  We are looking for boxes around the Flint/Montrose area.  I have seen a couple on AQ, but didn't know if there were any others out there?<br>
<br>
If you could help for some really good ones, we would appreciate it.<br>

There's not a lot in that area, but check on LBNA.  There are some in <br>
Mt. Morris & Burton.  I haven't found any of them so I'm not sure if <br>
they're good ones.<br>
<br>
If you want to travel a little farther, there are a bunch up in <br>
Saginaw, Frankenmuth, Bay City area.  Search by Saginaw or Bay <br>
Counties.  It seems in this area more boxes are listed on LbNA than <br>
AW, so try there.  Looks like Windrose has several up in that <br>
area.  I haven't found any of the ones close to where you are, but <br>
the one I did find make me think these would be worth a trip.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of great boxes in Oakland County which may not be <br>
that far of a drive for you.  Holly & Davison are pretty <br>
close.  Auburn Hills, Rochester, Rochester Hills, Pontiac and <br>
Clarkston would be pretty quick access off I-75.  Chief Pontiac is a <br>
good one, pretty quick.  Letterbox of Piglet has fun clues and it's <br>
in a great place .  If you can figure it out, the Michigan Hitchhiker <br>
Hostel is a good one (longish hike).  I haven't really found any of <br>
the others in that area so I can't give any other recommendations.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kanga in Davison is very close, and it's in a nice park.  There are <br>
others in Davison, but I haven't found them yet.  An Aussie Pirate's <br>
Treasure in Burton is also close - not quite as nice an area, but <br>
it's a cute box.  And ABC:Fish is in Flint proper - not a long walk, <br>
but a very interesting placement!  Be sure to check LBNA and <br>
Atlasquest to get a complete list.  Good luck!<br>
