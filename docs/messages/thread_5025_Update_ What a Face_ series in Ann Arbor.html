were doing some box maintenance today on our What a Face! series and <br/>
Box 5 is missing. Box 6's location has changed slightly, and Box 4 is <br/>
hard to reach at the moment due to a closed trail. We have noted all <br/>
the changes in the clues on LBNA. We'll be replacing Box 5 once we get <br/>
the appropriate body parts carved again!<br/>
