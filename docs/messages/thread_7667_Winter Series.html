better than one' would be removed.<br/>
<br/>
Since there is still snow on the ground, we will leave it out a bit<br/>
longer.  Assuming the snow is gone by then, we will leave the series out<br/>
until March 30th.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>

in our area today and to celebrate we headed out with Tiptoe &amp; Tonto to hunt for the Atomic Beans winter series.  We're happy to report that we found all of the excellent (and amusing) carvings planted along a very nice snow-covered trail.  Since the boxes are all hanging, we had no trouble finding them.</p><p><br/></p><p>Hopefully a few more of you will be able to get out to find these fun boxes now that the "polar vortex" has departed.</p><p><br/></p><p>Wisconsin Hiker</p><p><br/></p><p>P.S.  We're looking forward to see many of our letterboxing friends at the Dead of Winter event in 2 weeks.  If you are bringing your Bingo fee and Booty to the event, please put some sort of Post-it or label on your booty so I can keep track of who has submitted their contributions to the game.  If you are NOT coming to the event, please try to get your $ and booty mailed to me in the coming week.  Thanks!</p></body></html>
