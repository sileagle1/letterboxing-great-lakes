A review of how it works:<br/>
<br/>
There are 34 players/teams playing Bingo!  Entry is officially <br/>
closed -- if you are in the players database at the group, you are <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning today, every day I will draw out one of the <br/>
items/terms/etc. from the master list of 150 items.  Between 9:00 <br/>
a.m. and 10:00 a.m. EST I will post the chosen item to the group.  <br/>
If that item is on your personal 30-item Bingo list, cross it off -- <br/>
1 down, 29 to go!<br/>
<br/>
Once all 30 items on your list have been called out, you have to <br/>
notify me within 3 days of your last item being called out.  I will <br/>
verify my copy of your list with the list of things that have been <br/>
called out.  If two or more people finish up their list on the same <br/>
day, there will be a tie-breaker to determine the winner.<br/>
<br/>
I have divied up the booty a little so there are also 2nd and 3rd <br/>
prizes -- but the first prize is definitely the grand-daddy of <br/>
booties and anyone would be thrilled to win all of these cool LB <br/>
things!<br/>
<br/>
If you miss a day, there will be a record of all the items that have <br/>
been called out in a database at the group.<br/>
<br/>
Questions?  Please post to the list or e-mail me.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck everyone!<br/>
