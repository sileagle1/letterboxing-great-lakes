REALLY hard and carved "Princess Natural." <br/>
<br/>
She is VERY naked and the next two boxes in the series contain dresses<br/>
that two Fairies have left as gifts for her.<br/>
<br/>
I always wanted an "anotomically correct" paper doll, now I have one<br/>
in a rubber stamp sorta way!<br/>
<br/>
I hear though that some mischief making Fairies have entered the woods<br/>
and are plotting some very unusual outfits for the poor Princess.<br/>
<br/>
Let us pray for her dignity and virtue.<br/>
