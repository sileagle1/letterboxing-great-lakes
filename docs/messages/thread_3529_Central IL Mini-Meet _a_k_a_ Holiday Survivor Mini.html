                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, possible change of venue for the Holiday Survivor Mini-Meet.  We<br>
found out today that Lincoln Square Mall has a $25 application fee and<br>
requires groups to carry their own insurance for the event.  And<br>
judging by the response we've gotten, we just might have enough people<br>
that we won't be able to just blend in as a random group of people.  <br>
<br>
So we are looking at the auditorium of the Public Library right next<br>
door to Lincoln Square.  Which will be free and also allow us to bring<br>
in food (something we probably can't do at LS and still remain<br>
anonymous).  However, this location isn't without it's own faults.  We<br>
are planning a raffle of prizes (a few people have already expressed<br>
an interest in donating prizes), the proceeds of which we plan to<br>
donate to the letterboxing.org website since they have had such an<br>
increase in their costs and don't charge us for the service they<br>
provide.  The problem comes in that as part of being a free resource,<br>
the library won't allow us to do any fundraising or money collecting<br>
on-site, but they will allow us to raffle off the prizes at the<br>
library, just as long as no money changes hands while there.  So we<br>
would have to figure a process for selling tickets to the raffle, but<br>
not break this rule.  The other possible issue is that the event would<br>
have to be open to the public, so anyone could literally come in off<br>
the street and come into the auditorium.  This means non-letterboxers<br>
could come in and discover what we are doing, and not everyone in our<br>
area would respect the boxes hidden in town if they knew they were<br>
there.  In fact, quite a few would go out with the express purpose of<br>
destroying the boxes.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately this is kinda last minute here (this room just opened<br>
back up a few days ago for 1/21/07 due to a cancellation) so I plan on<br>
reserving it tomorrow first thing, but I would also like to get any<br>
input I can on this, feelings or thoughts.  One of the other things we<br>
need is a rough headcount, the room can hold up to 80, but if there<br>
are too few people at the event, they reserve the right to move us to<br>
a much smaller room (capacity of 14) or cancel our meeting.  I'm going<br>
to post this event over at AtlasQuest (www.atlasquest.com) and would<br>
like everyon planning on coming to sign up and let us know how many<br>
are coming in your party.  Also, anyone wanting any more info about<br>
the raffle is free to email me at lcoil79@insightbb.com since Kimono<br>
Girl has given me the task of arranging it.  Thanks for your help and<br>
insights.<br>

Well, the simple solution is of course too simple. We're all online<br>
ppl, right?  You have an email address. WE have email addresses. Why<br>
not sell to us through PayPal? Check the master list as we come<br>
through the door and hand us <n> tickets. No cash, no change to be<br>
made, no breaking the library rules.<br>
<br>
Just an idea!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had thought of that, but had 2 things brought up to me that would be<br>
possible problems.  The first is that not everyone likes sending money<br>
through PayPal.  The second is that PayPal charges a fee for receiving<br>
money.  To receive money for a single ticket, I would have to take out<br>
almost $.35 to cover the fees, and I want as much as possible to go to<br>
the site as possible.<br>
