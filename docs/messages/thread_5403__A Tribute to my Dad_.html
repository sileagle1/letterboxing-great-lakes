 <br>
Today is my Dad's 60th birthday. <br>
 <br>
I got the Tribute to my Dad box back last week in the mail. Nearly 200  <br>
people signed and stamped into the logbook. It traveled coast to coast to coast  <br>
and attended 8 events!!<br>
 <br>
I was going to mail it to my Dad, however, since grandpa passed away we  will <br>
be having a memorial service for grandpa will be in Lake County, IL on Nov.  <br>
23rd.<br>
 <br>
Since I will be seeing my Dad in person in a couple of weeks, I've decided  <br>
to wait and give it to Dad in person.<br>
 <br>
Thank you all who stamped in and wrote kind words to my Dad and other  <br>
Vietnam Vets.<br>
 <br>
I also want to take a moment and thank all Vets out there and the families  <br>
of those who have served or are currently serving our country. Our family <br>
thanks  you, you are our heros!!<br>
