This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

as under-inked spots).  If you are using a dye-based pad, store it level and<br/>
upside down so the ink stays near the surface.  Also keep it cool - avoid<br/>
hot areas.  Some people refrigerate their dye-based pads in hot weather.  I<br/>
do not believe it is necessary to store pigment based upside down, but I<br/>
don't know for sure.  Does anyone out there know?<br/>
