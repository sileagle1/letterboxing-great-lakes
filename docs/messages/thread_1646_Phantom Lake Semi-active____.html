                    <div class="plaintext-content">After checking on our Phantom Lake box, I made the following note in the<br/>
clues......<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: 7/26/05  We are making this box semi-active for awhile.  After two<br/>
reports of poison ivy near this box, we decided to take a look for<br/>
ourselves.  To our shock, we found the trails nearly grown over,<br/>
requiring some major bush whacking.  We planted this box in the early<br/>
spring, but now in the middle of summer the paths that the clues lead<br/>
you on are almost nonexistent.  Not wanting to lead my 7 year old<br/>
through the overgrown path, we back tracked to another path to get to<br/>
the box from another direction.  We found that path with a huge newly<br/>
fallen tree over it which would require climbing to get through, as well<br/>
as more bush whacking.  We never did reach the box to verify the<br/>
location of the poison ivy.  Because we want all of our boxes to be<br/>
"family friendly" and this box no longer fits our criteria, we are<br/>
choosing to notify you that this box may be more trouble than it is<br/>
worth.  Of course if you are adventuresome and willing to deal with the<br/>
poison ivy, the bush whacking and the now hard to follow clues then by<br/>
all means search for this box.  In the mean time, we are going to wait<br/>
until Fall before we try to access this box again.  We figure if we are<br/>
unwilling to go to the box location ourselves, we want to give fair<br/>
warning to anyone wanting to hunt for this box.  You've been warned....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was disappointing for us, but a I guess a lesson learned in just<br/>
how much things can change in an area from one season to another.  My<br/>
son was just in awe over how much things had changed.  And we thought<br/>
this was going to be one of our quick and easy boxes to check on because<br/>
it is so close to home.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes indeed, we have also been amazed at the difference in seasons at some of<br/>
our box locations.  I did check the date your box was placed while we were<br/>
on the trail and realized that things would have been much different then.<br/>
We've discovered that checking the month a box was placed gives us a good<br/>
indication of how much variation in conditions there might be from when we<br/>
are searching.  We hid a bunch of boxes in January, so I suspect things are<br/>
VERY different now (I know a certain woodpile that houses one of our boxes<br/>
is virtually obscured from view by vegetation now - requires much more<br/>
diligent searching).  A good tactic might be to look for boxes in the same<br/>
season they were placed, to have better luck recognizing landmarks<br/>
mentioned.  Of course a lot of snow could even mess this up...<br/>
