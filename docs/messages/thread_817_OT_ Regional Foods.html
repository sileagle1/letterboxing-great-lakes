(it's IGA-ish because it's small like an IGA, but not<br>
even cool enough to be an IGA) grocery has them in the<br>
freezer...AND THEY ARE YUMMY. By sight, they are<br>
foul...a greyish custard on crust...but it's heaven in<br>
the mouth. <br>
<br>
I think another Indiana thing is the breaded pork<br>
tenderloin sandwich (which is usually just called a<br>
tenderloin). It's basically a pork fritter, breaded,<br>
fried and slapped on a bun with pickles, cabbage, and<br>
some electric yellow mustard-like sauce called "Wally<br>
Sauce". I'm not a fan...but it seems that people eat a<br>
lot of them around here. Every dumpster diner has them<br>
prominantly on the menu. <br>
<br>
Older Hoosiers refer to lunch as dinner and the last<br>
meal of the day as supper. They also refer to US<br>
highways that became four lanes 30 years ago (such as<br>
US 30 and US 31) as "the bypass" even today.  <br>
<br>
Isn't it amazing that in a 5-7 state area there is<br>
such variation in food, vocab, traditions? <br>
<br>
--Armadillo Jo, who stays off the bypass and takes<br>
"Old 30" to work every day. <br>
