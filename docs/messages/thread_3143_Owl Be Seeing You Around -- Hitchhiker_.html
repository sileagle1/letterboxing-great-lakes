seems he's had a very busy year.  He took flight from Logan OH wherewe <br>
left him November 5 2005 and ended up in Westfield Indiana September <br>
24, 2006.  He stopped in to visit the "Farm".  He likes it there so <br>
much he's decided to take up a permanent roost there to help the farmer <br>
control mice and snakes!!!! <br>
