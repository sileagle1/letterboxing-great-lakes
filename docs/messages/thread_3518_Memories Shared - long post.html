Last night the Doglvrs family made their way downtown to join the procession <br/>
of mourners for our 38th president.  Amongst various forms of protest from <br/>
Daddys Girl and the skull we parked and made our way to the end of the <br/>
line that snaked its way around the corner of the Amway Grand Hotel.  It <br/>
was 6:00 pm<br/>
<br/>
Why stand in this long line if we dont even get to see him?<br/>
--We need to do this honey, its our patriotic duty.  No different than <br/>
standing at a parade when the flag passes by, or standing and clapping when <br/>
Veterans go by, or standing and singing during our National Anthem, putting <br/>
your hand over your heart.<br/>
But its cold out here.<br/>
--I know buddy, but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
The line began to move along and a half hour later we are inside the main <br/>
activity room of the De Vos Center.  The folks we are in line with are <br/>
considerate, friendly and respectful.  We even noticed some old friends just <br/>
near the door.<br/>
<br/>
As we zigzagged through the huge hall we glimpse PowerPoint presentations of <br/>
President Ford  as a young boy, playing football at UofM, graduating from <br/>
Yale, holding his baby daughter, with his lovely family on the lawn of the <br/>
White House.  Murmurs from the throng of mournersmemories of President <br/>
Ford in the White House, his beliefs, what the papers are saying.  One <br/>
television screen shows former President Bush speaking at the funeral in <br/>
Washington D.C.  Mrs. Betty Ford sits surrounded by her familya wife <br/>
mourning before the world.<br/>
<br/>
Upon reaching the last zag an officer hollers  If you dont want to sign <br/>
the book, you can pass by on the left!  Mr. and I look at each other <br/>
knowingly  we look at the folks in front and behind us  were all signing <br/>
the book<br/>
The book is actually four, watched over by two young Army men  we are <br/>
please to stand beside our children as they sign their own names in the <br/>
memorial books of a hometown hero come home to rest.<br/>
<br/>
We proceed outside again some three hours after going in  the fresh air is <br/>
rejuvenating to everyone and the kids are being silly with the boy behind <br/>
us.  The breeze off the Grand River is pretty cold while standing on the <br/>
bridge amidst news crews from everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
As we approach the Gerald R. Ford museum, we instruct our children to remove <br/>
hats, and to be quiet when we get inside.  Everyone around us is doing the <br/>
same.  Television cameras on huge boom stands pan the long line of mourners <br/>
bathed in super bright lights.  Mr. turns to me and says Honey, people are <br/>
lined up all the way to the end of the other bridge over there &amp; then the <br/>
line folds back on its self.<br/>
Wow  its too much to comprehend at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Once in the door we remove our hats and mittens passing by the first of <br/>
3maybe moresecret service men and the first camera.  Inside the second <br/>
door the silence is nearly overwhelming.  The mourners leaving have blank <br/>
facessome are crying softly.<br/>
<br/>
Passing by a second camera and security man we glimpse the flag covered <br/>
casket surrounded by stoic representatives of each of our faithful armed <br/>
forces.  We all walk quietly passed our stars and stripes covered President, <br/>
marveling at how straight the back is of the Marine at the end.  Daddys <br/>
Girl makes eye contact with me after noticing the woman in a National Guard <br/>
uniform at the back corner.  I am instantly filly with pride that she now <br/>
gets it  why weve come.<br/>
<br/>
As we leave the inner room  we each shake hands with Steven Ford  as I <br/>
hold his hand I say our condolences and this man who has lost his father <br/>
and has been through ceremony after ceremony with more to come says to me <br/>
thank you for standing in that line.<br/>
<br/>
Again I saywow.<br/>
<br/>
We set off on the long walk back to the car, stopping first to see the <br/>
mementos left at the sign by regular people just like us.  And then  I am <br/>
surprised that seeing something Ive always thought was kind of hokey  has <br/>
moved me to tearshand written notes, obviously from children, Goodbye <br/>
President Ford.  Honesty is still the best policy., professionally made <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for such a moving message, Mrs. DogLvrs. I can't add anything<br/>
more to what you've already said, except to say that my family did<br/>
this also... with the twin 4 month old grand-girls and 2yr old<br/>
grandson in tow. <br/>
<br/>
The wait time did seem to drag, but by Grace Above, all three kids<br/>
were content and well behaved the entire time.  <br/>
<br/>
All of the military presence brought to mind our own family member,<br/>
"Timmy" to us, who is a Corpl in the Marines just home from Iraq, and<br/>
if plans proceed to increase US presence in the Mideast, may have to<br/>
return soon. These thoughts lead us to consider all the other members<br/>
of our family who have served in the Military ... my Grandfather<br/>
fought in the Pacific theater during WW2, my father-in-law was in the<br/>
Army and upon discharge worked in the shipyards of Camden and Philly<br/>
(where he picked up the asbestos exposure which would eventually kill<br/>
him) we have 3 generations of "tankers" ... my uncle, my husband, and<br/>
my nephew. All of this led to further memories...<br/>
<br/>
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, my son (father of all my grandkids)<br/>
was 13 and my daughter was 9 years old. During our waiting time to the<br/>
Viewing, they both commented on their memories and perceptions of the<br/>
time we, as a family, watched that historic moment on television.<br/>
Though none of my grandkids will remember ~this~ event, in Grand<br/>
Rapids, our family will be able to keep it as a joint memory.<br/>

&gt; procession of mourners for our 38th president........  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;In the car and buckled up I look at the clock  10:15 pm.  I turn <br/>
&gt; to my family and ask "Are you glad we came?"<br/>
&gt; All three of them answer  "Yes, I'm very glad."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wow.<br/>

We've received permission from Mrs. Doglvrs to place her post on our blog in the next few days. <br/>
You'll also see a picture of the memorial folder that was given to them with the post as well.<br/>

Just want to add my thanks to Mrs. D for sharing this well-written <br/>
and moving post. And I'm glad that the old-fashioned values of <br/>
patriotism and respect won over the clan!<br/>
