Nutshell - My two Matthiessen boxes are replaced - Dog in the Water: <br>
Hershey's Hike (AKA "the Jurrasic Park hike") and Lil Bit of Flutter.  <br>
Flutter now consists of two boxes (for reasons given in the clues, <br>
which I won't repeat here), and DITW's clues have been modified due to <br>
a slightly different hiding place.  See the files section (Clues and <br>
more clues >> FungusWoman boxes.<br>
<br>
Papillon, Hershey, and I had a great day. (Yes, Papillon went boxing <br>
with me!!)  The water level is very low, but Hersh still managed to <br>
find some and live up to her trail name of Muddy Paws the Dirty Dog.  <br>
At almost eight years old (her birthday is the 19th), she's a little <br>
slower on all those stairs, and slept all the way home, but she still <br>
enjoyed herself, and recommends that all other GLK dogs (and owners) <br>
go find her box!<br>
