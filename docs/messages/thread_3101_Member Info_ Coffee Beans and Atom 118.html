                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
Atom 118 and I live in Chicago, and we are science geeks who work in a <br>
lab at the University of Chicago where we met about 3.5 years ago.  We <br>
started boxing in January 2006 after Atom's sister Fermont told us about <br>
it.  She was coming to Chicago to visit the next weekend, so we knew we <br>
had to fit some letterboxing into our weekend activities.  But first, we <br>
needed some signature stamps.  Atom and I wanted to take advantage of <br>
our geeky creative sides, so we made our our first sig stamps by carving <br>
our images out of bars of soap and pouring polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), <br>
a polymer substrate we use frequently at work, onto the soap and then <br>
pulling out the PDMS mold once the polymer had cured into place.  It <br>
sounds pretty good in theory, but didn't work quite as well as planned.  <br>
My first stamp fell apart after the first weekend, but my replacement <br>
lasted a couple of months.  Atom's also lasted a couple of months, but <br>
then we decided that we could handle the carving and bought some <br>
MasterCarve and Speedyball cutters, and the rest is history.<br>
<br>
Our first letterboxing trip with Fermont took us to Lincoln Park to <br>
check out three boxes there.  The clues were very clever, but <br>
unfortunately the boxes had gone missing (not surprising since, as many <br>
of you know, Lincoln Park is a very popular place to visit!).  We didn't <br>
give up however and drove a bit west to find our first box, "Down by the <br>
Lazy River," just after it got dark.  After finding just one box out of <br>
four, we were hooked. :)   We did manage to go three for three the next <br>
day though, and we were stoked for our new hobby... even enough to brave <br>
one incredibly cold Wisconsin day about a month later to box in <br>
Menomonee Falls with Fermont in about 10 degree weather and 4 inches of <br>
snow!<br>
<br>
Anyway, the aspect that really got me excited about letterboxing was <br>
figuring out the clues and then finding the hidden treasure out in <br>
public places -- I've always been a sucker for treasure hunts.  But as <br>
we got more into it, we also really like having the excuse to find new <br>
places to explore and go hiking.  We've done a majority of our boxing in <br>
the Chicagoland area, but since Atom's family lives in SE Wisconsin and <br>
mine lives in SW Michigan, we've done a lot of boxing there as well.  <br>
Since we're big science geeks, we're also pretty into data analysis <br>
(yes, go ahead and laugh), so we have some pretty thorough spreadsheets <br>
and graphs detailing our letterboxing adventures.  So at the risk of <br>
sounding too obsessed with stats, we are currently sitting at F312 (17 <br>
are HH), P50 (17 are HH), and X58.  Our average number of boxes <br>
found/month is 36.125, with an average HH finds/month of 2.  The <br>
majority of our exchanges are from the Great Lakes Gathering this past <br>
June, where we had a blast and really enjoyed meeting a lot of you.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for making this a great hobby!<br>
