  Wow!  We were hoping that we'd generate some interest and discussion <br/>
  about our new series, but this isn't what we'd had in mind.  We're <br/>
  sorry that people are having trouble with the file, we can't figure <br/>
  out what the problem is.  We used the "Arial" font, which is a <br/>
  standard Microsoft font.  Lots of other boxers have said that they had <br/>
  no problems getting it open.  We're at a loss.  We hope that the new <br/>
  file is working for those of you who can't get the original open.  <br/>
  Again, may we remind you all that the clues will be on LbNA and <br/>
  Atlasquest on Wednesday morning (acutally, probably late Tuesday <br/>
  night).  We hope that you have a chance to come on out to our neck of <br/>
  the woods to find some eggs and have a good time in a neat little park.<br/>
