                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, everyone!  I just wanted to publicize the updating of my <br>
Masquerade clue story website.  I've made some changes to reflect <br>
the recent rennovations of the park and I've also eliminated the <br>
dreaded riddle to the first box in the series (aka the "Butt Box").  <br>
In its place is another riddle, one that eliminates the merest <br>
mention of mathematics.  I have 2 degrees in English.  Don't ask me <br>
why I put math in my clues.  Truth told, I actually hate math.  <br>
Hmmmm.  Anyway, I'd like to thank Acorn and Dragon for being our <br>
hapless guinea pigs in the creation of these clues.  If it weren't <br>
for their input, those silly boxes wouldn't have a prayer of being <br>
found.<br>
