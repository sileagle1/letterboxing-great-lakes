                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tiptoe, the real question is...what kind of cheese ARE YOU that you're<br>
standing alone? (I'm guessing Limburger...or something else like<br>
that). Anyhow, can I still play your bingo game, because....<br>
<br>
..."the farmer takes the wife, the farmer takes the wife. HI HO the<br>
dairy-O the farmer takes the wife"(unless she is cutting the Limburger<br>
cheese, that is).<br>
<br>
SO... Fof6 went 20 full days w/out a word, but alas, poor Tiptoe (dear<br>
friend who has resorted to TV bingo) is now 0 for 21. SC, can you<br>
honestly live with yourself after knowing this information??? I ask<br>
you, is this compassion????<br>
<br>
We all know the downward spiral that Tiptoe will be entering into if<br>
there isn't a bingo intervention soon. First, it's TV bingo, before<br>
you know it, she'll grow old, adopt 162 cats, yell at the kids on her<br>
lawn, and resort to eating cat food out of the can while watching a 90<br>
year old Alex Trebeck tell the players on Jeopardy that there stupid!<br>
(Which, we all know he does off camera anyhow!). Again, I say, we<br>
CAN'T let poor Tiptoe decline like this. Save her and give her a word.<br>
<br>
I also suggest we all work our collective voodoo magic for Tiptoe. So,<br>
everyone, at precisely 5:58 am tomorrow morning (EST), jab a pin into<br>
your own voodoo dolls to influence SC to get Oldshoe to pull out her<br>
word.<br>
<br>
All hail Tiptoe...Queen of the Empty Board!<br>
<br>
-Father of FamilyofMany (aka Fof6) LOL :)<br>
