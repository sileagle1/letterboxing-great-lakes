<br/>
Personally, if it is on public grounds, I don't ask.  If it is on<br/>
private grounds, I definately ask.  Either way, I also take into<br/>
consideration the "leave no trace" and environmetal concerns of the<br/>
area I'm planting a box in, so if an issue does come up, I have that<br/>
backing me.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as far as I can tell, this state does not have any regulations<br/>
re: letterboxing or geocaching in the state parks (yet) and I don't<br/>
even want it to be on their radar screen.  That is why if I plant a<br/>
box in a state park here, I go to great lengths to make it so they<br/>
cannot find them via an internet search.  I've gotten the impression<br/>
from other letterboxers in this state they basically feel the same<br/>
way.  Am I right?  Let me know!<br/>

<br/>
I would have to agree with Tim... private land, there is no question <br/>
that permission should be asked and you should also note that in the <br/>
clues -- that this is private property and permission has been <br/>
received for letterboxing.  Sometimes people can be hesitant to <br/>
tread onto private property looking for a box if they are not aware <br/>
of the circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
As for public land... I have always been on the feeling that it is <br/>
better to ask forgiveness than permission.  I view letterboxing as <br/>
an acceptable use of public lands and therefore do not feel the need <br/>
to ask permission before planting a box.  Many time the folks in <br/>
charge of these places are not aware of what letterboxing is and <br/>
rather than take the time to learn about it, they feel it is easier <br/>
to just say "no" than risk setting a precedent for allowing <br/>
something they are not familiar with.  In many cases asking <br/>
permission, actually forces them to make a policy -- which may not <br/>
always be in our favor.  Whereas, just going about our business, <br/>
taking care to be environmentally conscious, nobody is getting hurt, <br/>
and most of these public lands remain without a specific policy one <br/>
way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
Now...  the situation gets sticky when the public lands have <br/>
specific policies.  National Parks have a policy against letterboxes <br/>
and geocaches.  State Parks in some areas have policies requiring <br/>
permission and/or placement fees.  In these situations, you need to <br/>
use your judgment.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, discretion is a key factor.  As Tim pointed out -- if <br/>
we stay low enough below the radar, we can just peacefully co-exist.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My first reaction was to go into lots of pros and cons. Then I saw <br/>
that our colleague SringChick had outlined in good detail most of the <br/>
arguments that have bounced around the letterboxing world.<br/>
I would only add that there is a more radical (?) element who suggest <br/>
that since WE are the public, that "public" land should be open to <br/>
OUR use, including National Parks.<br/>
And so those folks feel that with a caveat of "leave no trace" and <br/>
embracing a practice of environmental concern, letterboxing should be <br/>
an acceptable activity in the parks (policies to the contrary <br/>
notwithstanding).<br/>
There seems little argument about private land.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I find myself in SpringChick's camp on this one.<br/>
I have encountered park rangers who are happy to have letterboxes <br/>
in "their" parks, and who encourage letterboxing as another way to <br/>
get people outdoors and into nature.<br/>
On the other hand, as SpringChick reports, there are those, who if <br/>
asked, will default to a negative, fearful of creating policy or <br/>
precedent.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that enforcement of existing policies varies a great deal <br/>
even within a park system.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously this is where the placement of some boxes where the clues <br/>
have limited distribution comes into play.<br/>
And as the Dragon alludes, the description of places becomes more <br/>
obscure.<br/>
