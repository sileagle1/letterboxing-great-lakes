but I am still recovering from the weekend! How WI Hiker and Martini <br>
Man ever pulled off such a great gathering is beyond me. Thank you <br>
guys for putting so much effort into this great event! <br>
<br>
It was so fun to finally meet everyone whose stamps I have seen on <br>
the trail or in emails. What a great group of people too! I didn't <br>
meet anyone during the weekend who wasn't a kind, enthusiastic <br>
letterboxer. If you are a newbie reading this, do not hesitate to go <br>
to a gathering, you could learn more in one day than you could in a <br>
year of solo letterboxing.<br>
<br>
I didn't really live up to my name this weekend. I took just under <br>
50 pictures because I was so focused on meeting everyone and getting <br>
all those wonderful letterboxes (still didn't quite get them all<br>
man, there were a lot!). I have posted a few of the photos in the <br>
2006 GL Gathering file (click the photo link to the left) and the <br>
rest I have posted on my Photobucket page which can be found here: <br>

20Gathering%202006/<br>
Be sure to check out the photo of Jigsaw getting his 100th find and <br>
Raqs Enigma waltzing with a very drunken man outside our hotel <br>
Saturday night...lol. :)<br>
<br>
I'd like to thank everyone for getting my letterboxing spirits back <br>
up. After losing nearly all my boxes to the WFP people last summer, <br>
I was a little anti-letterboxing for a while. Now I can't wait to <br>
get back out there! I even have ideas for a few new series of boxes. <br>
So come all ye to Rockford! Hopefully we can start replacing all the <br>
lost boxes and start building up the area some more.<br>
<br>
A huge public thank you must go out to Speedsquare for taking Raqs <br>
Enigma and I in for the night on Saturday. She had a hotel room all <br>
to herself, but she volunteered to let us stay with her that night <br>
and split the cost of the room. This saved us from searching for a <br>
room, which I heard were pretty scarce in the area. <br>
<br>
A few favorite memories and moments:<br>
<br>
* Finding not only Acorn's White Rabbit #1 box Sunday morning, but <br>
also WI Hiker and Martini Man behind the same tree, waiting to see <br>
if we could find the box for ourselveslol.<br>
<br>
* Secret Agent Mr. E running into the woods to retrieve Alice in <br>
Weatherland for us while we were recovering on the "treasure" bench. <br>
For that, he has now earned the title of my favorite letterboxer. :)<br>
<br>
* Actually making it up the Gut Busterwhich I didn't think was as <br>
bad as it soundedthough we did stop halfway up to stamp into a <br>
hitchhiker, figuring that it was a better time than any to get it <br>
out of the way. ;)<br>
<br>
* Having lots of people come up to me and (many times) yelling one <br>
of my favorite phrases from the SoT series in order to get my <br>
personal traveler. To parents with children who may have picked up <br>
this phraseI greatly apologizelol. <br>
<br>
* Searching for Humpty Dumpty in the same spot for over 20 minutes <br>
while others started to catch up with us, and then watching <br>
Lightchaser casually walk into the woods and find it like it was the <br>
easiest task in the world. We did get a good photo (see photo <br>
section) at the spot and we got to continue on our journey with some <br>
really great letterboxers.<br>
<br>
* Laughing harder than any other part of the day while Jigsaw went <br>
over his idea for TFA at Marty's.<br>
<br>
* (everyone will be able to relate to this one) Feeling famous for a <br>
few minutes when a person would come up and sayso you're <br>
Shutterfly? I've always wanted to meet you! Who doesn't feel even <br>
the slightest bit special when one of the kids would say, "Mom/Dad<br>
that's [insert your trail name here]!"<br>
<br>
* Getting to meet so many wonderful people and find a bunch of great <br>
boxes.<br>
<br>
And before I end this, I have to ask if anyone else found the clue <br>
to the "treasure" on the bench near Alice in Weatherland. We were <br>
told about it by Papeseed and Triclops when we met up, but when we <br>
found the box we didn't see any other familiar stamps. After <br>
stamping in to the box and leaving, Raqs Enigma and I decided that <br>
due to the clue placement, we should have boycotted the box <br>
completely, but at that moment we were on such a letterboxing high <br>
that we would have stamped into anything. And as Raqs <br>
said, "hindsight is always 20/20." I do have to wonder what others <br>
will think of the hobby when they see the bench and find the <br>
letterbox. I almost want to go as far as saying that someone should <br>
remove the box (and maybe get some sand paper to erase the message) <br>
lest we get a bad reputation as letterboxers for defacing public <br>
property.<br>
<br>
Well, to end the message on a good note, I can't wait for the next <br>
gathering! I hope I will get to meet some of those I missed at this <br>
one on the trail or elsewhere. :) I had a blast and I can't thank <br>
Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man enough for putting together such a <br>
great event and being such great hosts.<br>

Shutterfly (who could still use 24 hours of sleep)<br>
