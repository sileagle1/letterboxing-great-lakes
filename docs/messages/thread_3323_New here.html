                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!  I am new to the group....have been lurking for a little bit <br>
to get the feel of the group.  Well, since I just went to the database <br>
and entered my name for a patch, I figured that I better introduce <br>
myself.  My trail name is Sunny.  My 3 daughters and I just started <br>
letterboxing this past summer...well, actually in October.  I first <br>
read about LB in my Family Fun magazine and I thought that it would be <br>
something relatively cheap for all of us to do together.  It has been <br>
FUN!  We've only found 3 boxes together, but my oldest daughter and I <br>
went on a class trip to Mackinac Island and introduced her class to LB <br>
and found 2 on the island (there are 13 total there).  AND, last week, <br>
we found our first hitchiker!!  It was the "smile" hitchhiker if <br>
anyone is interested in knowing that info.<br>
How does the LB go in the snow?  I'm wondering what winter will bring <br>
and if it will dampen our chances of getting out and finding more <br>
boxes.<br>
Oh, we are in Michigan, btw.  Near Iron Mountain.<br>

Journal about a month ago, and my family is excited. My wife and I <br>
have four children (ages 8, 6, 5 & 2, two boys, two girls). Any <br>
advice? We're planting two boxes over Christmas break.<br>
