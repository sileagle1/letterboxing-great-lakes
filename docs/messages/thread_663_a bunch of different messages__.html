                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fall is my favorite time of year, being an October baby and also an October<br>
bride.  This being my first fall to box, I will be continuing my pre-boxing<br>
tradition of taking my GS to camp (how else did I discover all those cool<br>
places to hide my LaSalle county boxes?), my favorite fall location.<br>
<br>
My first boxing experience was late winter, March '04, when I visited<br>
DebRock's Bass Ponds boxes near Bloomington, MN.  No snow, so landmarks were<br>
visible, boxes were not frozen solid, footsteps were not an issue, and the<br>
starkness of the greyed landscape very surreal and, as others have said,<br>
serene.  I don't know if I'd make a concerted effort to go boxing in the<br>
snow (for all the very good reasons previously mentioned), but if<br>
opportunity provided me a box within reach of where I was, I certainly would<br>
take it.<br>
