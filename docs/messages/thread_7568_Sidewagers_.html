I'll use the same set of rules that Atom118 used the last 2 years, which were pretty close to what Wisconsin Hiker had before that, and I can't really remember what Azobox had before her... but anyway, just check the files section and read the Sidewagers 2013.pdf file if you are unfamiliar with this game.<br>
<br>
Basically, this is a side bet on what day the first player will complete a full card BINGO.  You do not need to be part of the BINGO game to play.  Your guess must be submitted before January 1, 2013.<br>

PLEASE PUT 'SIDEWAGER' in the subject line, and send your guess to me at    tj_mich -at- ameritech -dot- net<br>
<br>
I'll reply (probably not right away) to confirm your email and let you know your date.<br>
<br>
As of now, the game is OPEN.<br>

GOOD LUCK!<br>

History of Sidewager game:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Azobox created the secondary diversion in 2006 and hosted again in 2007 &<br>
2008.  I (Wisconsin Hiker) hosted in 2009, then BNLBaliGrl took a turn in<br>
2010, followed by Atom118 in 2011 & 2012.  <br>
