get serious about GLG 2015.  Right now, we have about six stamps in <br>
hand, although the database has ~2 dozen.    Even at 25 stamps, we are a <br>
bit short of where we had hoped to be.  So, if you haven't had a chance <br>
yet, please carve a stamp to contribute to the event! We'd like to have <br>
these at the start of May.<br>
<br>
As we roll into May, we'll start posting more of the actual event <br>
details.  We have maps to post and suggestions for parking. Yea, we <br>
slightly underestimated the parking right at the shelters (and hadn't <br>
realized that the numbers posted on the parks website included the <br>
parking in the attached unpaved/grass lot) so we will be asking you to <br>
try and park at one of the other nearby shelters and carpooling/hiking <br>
the last leg to the shelters...<br>
<br>
Enough about that right now.  For the moment, we NEED A FEW MORE <br>
STAMPS!  :-)  We will be at the "Just One More Level...Video Games" <br>
event next weekend, and we'll be happy to take your stamps there.<br>
<br>
Good luck finishing your BINGO cards and wish for some slightly warmer <br>
weather!<br>

<br>
I hope more people step up to carve something.  We all enjoy finding the boxes, but in order to have something to FIND, people need to CARVE.  Don't be intimidated that it has to be "the best stamp ever", just come up with something that is at least loosely related to the theme (Rituals and/or Luck) and GO FOR IT!  Contributing to all aspects of this hobby is important.<br>
<br>
Who knows, maybe carving something will cause the BINGO gods to smile upon you!<br>
