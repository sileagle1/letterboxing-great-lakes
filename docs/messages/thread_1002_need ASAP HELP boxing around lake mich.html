the captian of team bindlestiff has proposed a MAJOR change in our<br>
trip for this weekend because some of our team have never been to the<br>
UP, he's putting on his road trip captian hat (oh boy) since i'm in<br>
charge of the boxing part i'm struggling to catch up the new plans and<br>
could use some help from all of you.<br>
<br>
here's what he is suggesting for the new trip plan:<br>
tonight (wed) after work - head to chicago (4 hrs drive) and stay<br>
overnight somewhere<br>
thurs - do the sailboat show at navy pier, meet moms art friend and<br>
her family then leave for milwaukee.(2 hrs drive) stay overnight in<br>
milwaukee.<br>
fri - drive to the menominee area (3 hrs drive) and stay overnight<br>
sat - drive all the way across the UP (5 hrs drive) and stay in mackinaw<br>
sun - reach traverse city (2.5 hrs drive)and visit with our family <br>
<br>
there are some long drive times in there so i'm looking for<br>
suggestions for quick boxes that we could do and it would also be nice<br>
to get in some exchanges as we go zooming through this new plan if<br>
thats possible. mom carved a new personal traveler for bindle bum -<br>
just ask who his favorite president was to get it. plus we've got 4<br>
boxes we were hoping to place during the trip, but i think we're going<br>
to run out of time.<br>
<br>
thanks for the help! back to the letterboxing dot org site for me.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!! Sounds like a LOT of driving, especially for winter.  Hopefully the weather will cooperate.<br>
<br>
If I knew where in Milwaukee you'd be staying I could help identify some of the quicker boxes near your lodging.  Martini Man & I might also be able to meet you somewhere for an exchange Thursday night, depending on where in Milwaukee you are.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's also a new box in Mackinaw City called "MI CA-T"... It's a box carved by<br>
a Californian and placed by a Michiganian... our own Munchkin Stamper!  This is<br>
also a quick stop.  The box was active as of about two weeks ago (and it was<br>
COLD that day!!!)<br>
