the captian of team bindlestiff has proposed a MAJOR change in our<br/>
trip for this weekend because some of our team have never been to the<br/>
UP, he's putting on his road trip captian hat (oh boy) since i'm in<br/>
charge of the boxing part i'm struggling to catch up the new plans and<br/>
could use some help from all of you.<br/>
<br/>
here's what he is suggesting for the new trip plan:<br/>
tonight (wed) after work - head to chicago (4 hrs drive) and stay<br/>
overnight somewhere<br/>
thurs - do the sailboat show at navy pier, meet moms art friend and<br/>
her family then leave for milwaukee.(2 hrs drive) stay overnight in<br/>
milwaukee.<br/>
fri - drive to the menominee area (3 hrs drive) and stay overnight<br/>
sat - drive all the way across the UP (5 hrs drive) and stay in mackinaw<br/>
sun - reach traverse city (2.5 hrs drive)and visit with our family <br/>
<br/>
there are some long drive times in there so i'm looking for<br/>
suggestions for quick boxes that we could do and it would also be nice<br/>
to get in some exchanges as we go zooming through this new plan if<br/>
thats possible. mom carved a new personal traveler for bindle bum -<br/>
just ask who his favorite president was to get it. plus we've got 4<br/>
boxes we were hoping to place during the trip, but i think we're going<br/>
to run out of time.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the help! back to the letterboxing dot org site for me.<br/>

<br/>
If I knew where in Milwaukee you'd be staying I could help identify some of the quicker boxes near your lodging.  Martini Man &amp; I might also be able to meet you somewhere for an exchange Thursday night, depending on where in Milwaukee you are.<br/>
