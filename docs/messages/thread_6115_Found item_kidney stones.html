Dearest Sunnysideup, We just might have to carve a special stamp for all your effort! We are very appreciative of all your work!<br/>
 BTW... Tonto had one of his kidney stones "blasted" today and he is doing well...he will have to have the other stone in the left kidney "blasted in a few weeks...Tiptoe had to buy a quick pair of "reading" glasses at the hospital gift shop to read the only thing in the waiting room - a copy of Field &amp; Stream to pass the time.  She can now tell you anything you want to know about hunting deer and elk!  The similarity to Letterboxing is astounding.  Think stealth, strategy, weather challenges, bloodied shins, mud, bugs, missed opportunity....and addiction!  Maybe she'd be better at that than hunting boxes...<br/>

&gt; Tiptoe and others - Just wanted to let you know I contacted the park people about the glasses.  Here's the reply:<br/>

&gt; Sorry to hear your friend lost her glasses.  I checked with the park and we have not currently found a pair.  Sometimes these things take a while to show up.  If they are turned in, we will contact you at this e-mail address.  If you would like to periodically check with Minooka Park directly, you can do so by calling them at (262) 896-8006.  Good luck!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; Sincerely,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, no.  They are still out there somewhere!  Maybe we could list them as a WOM and anyone who finds them gets a special "Lost &amp; Found" Stamp!<br/>

Tonto's problem puts my teensy one in perspective.  Apparently, it is possible to be just a teensy bit too persisent when it comes to letterboxing - I am now limping when wearing shoes due to a strained Achilles tendon.  Not sure if my boot was to blame, or just being out on the trails too much - if such a thing is possible.  I sure hope things get better soon (doubtful) - I hear the weather is supposed to be great this weekend!  <br/>

 I've passed about 35-40 stones over the last 8 years. I've had one blasted <br/>
and  one where they "went up after it" -- I MUCH prefer the blasting -- <br/>
actually I  MUCH MUCH prefer passing them on my own (with a few Vicodins thrown <br/>
in for good  measure).<br/>
<br/>
Tonto, I feel your pain brother! Hang in there and drink lots of water, who <br/>
 knows, perhaps the stone will pass on its own. And YES, I've passed stones <br/>
(3 to  be exact) larger than the diamond on Becki's wedding ring :-/<br/>

So, either those are tiny diamonds--or a whole lotta pain.  ;~)<br/>
