Hey Keith,<br>
<br>
In my opinion, I think you should replace it.  I thought it was in an awesome spot!  Great history of not only Ottawa, but our State is learned while looking for that box.  I was the 1st finder and even though I live in Ottawa, it's one of my favorite boxes.<br>
<br>
Just my .02!<br>

<br>
Today while in Ottawa at a breakfast get-together, I stopped by and checked<br>
on A Step Above the Rest.....it had been found and destroyed. It's hiding<br>
space was turned over, the contents of the box were gone, and the lid to the<br>
box was about 30 yards up the trail. I have temporarily pulled and am<br>
debating whether or not to replace it. Thanks to all who had stamped in the<br>
now lost logbook.<br>
