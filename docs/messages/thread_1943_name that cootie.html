he is definitely from the mountain strain.  as hillbilly as they come, with hayseed and double barrel accessories.<br>
i need to know his name and who unleashed the varmint.  i would hate to go through life with an undocumented cootie infection.<br>
thanks,<br>

That's the Hillbilly cootie.  We caught him while we were in Portland <br>
and carried him back.  The original creator of the varmint is Camp Fire <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, AJ ... I sure hope you find out what kind of cootie infected you! <br>
<br>
Because if you don't ... well, you remember when six weeks of<br>
anti-rabies injections had to be given into the abdomen, don't you? <br>
(((( shiver ))) Well, now they've advanced so those injections are<br>
routinely given in the arm.<br>
<br>
However, letterboxing anti-cootie injections haven't advanced that far<br>
yet.  (OH NO!! -- don't say it ...) <br>
<br>
Yep, it's true... still in the belly. Six weeks. ((( double shiver ))<br>
<br>
I'd hate to see you have to get letterbox anti-cootie injections in<br>
such a tender area, just because you couldn't name that cootie.<br>
<br>
(Sort of sounds like a Lemony Snicket box in the making doesn't it?)<br>
<br>
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

I, too, caught a cootie at the Haunted Harvest gathering.  But it sounds like a different strain than what you got.  Mine was called "What's the bright idea?"  I passed it on to an unsuspecting man with an open tote bag just after admiring his dog.  So the cootie you got wasn't from me (at least not directly from me).  <br>
<br>
Speaking of the HH Gathering, I neglected to write down the carver of the altoid tin collection of stamps.  But I do remember someone admiring the completed image in our logbook and saying, "WHAT A GREAT STAMP!"  I can't remember who that was now...Bindle Babe?  Or was that a different stamp? Arggg!  There was so much great stuff going on that day, it's all a blur!  --Papeseed<br>
