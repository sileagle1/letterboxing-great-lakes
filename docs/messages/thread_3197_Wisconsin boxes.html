I guess we'd better hurry and try to find your local box!<br>
<br>
We're sorry to hear that it seems that several boxes in the region are now<br>
missing.  We've been planting boxes for 3 years and have only lost 2 so far<br>
(that we know of) out of 74 placed.  Like some of the rest of you, when the<br>
first one was missing, I went back twice just to see if maybe it "had been<br>
returned".  No such luck, so I eventually replaced it.  I have to admit it<br>
was NOT a good hiding spot or box (BRIGHT purple!?!?).  However another box<br>
was missing when I checked on it, but I went to double-check after the snow<br>
was gone and, miracle of miracles, someone had placed it back in the hollow<br>
log (they noted that it had been laying out in the open).  Martini Man has<br>
recently lost a box, but I think we should maybe go back to see if it has<br>
been returned (we've been lucky before....)  Other boxes that we planted<br>
have been reported as possibly missing but either other boxers have<br>
subsequently found them and/or they are in the proper spot when we go to<br>
check on them ourselves.  So yes, the moral of the story is that just<br>
because someone THINKS a box is missing, it isn't necessarily so.<br>
<br>
We had two other boxes strewn about by what were probably humans.  Luckily<br>
the next letterboxers on the hunt for them managed to round up the pieces<br>
and the boxes were replaced with new logbooks (and one in a slightly<br>
different location).  We've had NUMEROUS other boxes opened or gnawed on by<br>
animals.  Luckily all of these continued on OK, because the next boxers put<br>
things back together and/or contacted us about needing any replacement<br>
items.  Only one stamp has some toothmarks, but we haven't had to replace<br>
any stamps or logbooks on the animal boxes.  Boxes themselves are another<br>
story - interesting how much they like that blue Rubbermaid rubber or other<br>
plastic....<br>
<br>
As others have said, we figure that when we put a box out, we may never see<br>
it again.  However we have the image in our logbook and on an index card<br>
that we keep in a special album just for our planted boxes. That is our<br>
"souvenir".  We don't feel compelled to replace our boxes anymore, we may or<br>
may not.  If we don't, we just figure it was a "limited edition" box and<br>
have no desire for anyone else to try to duplicate a replacement box.  Of<br>
course we hope that a number of people were able to add it to their own<br>
logbooks.  We delete our clues so the area appears "open" for new<br>
placements.<br>
<br>
Hoping for the best for ALL of the region's boxes over the winter, which<br>
seems to be arriving WAY TOO early this year!<br>

We may be crowing too soon. I have reports that both of my Grant<br>
County boxes may be missing. It seems that Channel Cat may have been<br>
cleared for firewood. I am holding out hope for Bald Eagle Days, as<br>
