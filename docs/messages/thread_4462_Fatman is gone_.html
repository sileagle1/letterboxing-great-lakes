                    <div class="plaintext-content">I never thought I'd say this, but it's getting easier, emotionally, to loose a letterbox.  It's never pleasant, but 'all things must pass' and that holds true for letterboxes too.  They can always be replaced.  But when the area is cleared of ALL natural growth, it's a bit difficult to replace a box.  So, I'm in the process of creating all new letterboxes.  I've placed several new boxes within the past month.  <br/>
The Lake Bluff Furnace Death Mystery is a series of three boxes, and the written clue probably holds a record for longest written clue.  But a good story!  Then, I placed Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend.  And just a couple days ago, I placed Polly Wanna Cracker.  I have another series of 2 boxes to place as soon as I have a day off.  See you at the Lb Wedding!<br/>

I found him on a day of letterboxing with my granddaughter and we had a great time together in Lake County that day ... she found him, BTW.<br/>

night before the SILO gathering.<br/>

There was much snow on the ground and they had just plowed leaving a pile  of <br/>
snow about 12 foot high.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I scaled it like a sherpa and found the box . . . in my tennis  shoes.<br/>

Beetle, thanks for the memories . . .<br/>
