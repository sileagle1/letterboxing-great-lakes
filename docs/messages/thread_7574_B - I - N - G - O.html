Where are all the regular players hiding? Are you all out finding a few of the boxes on the Word List before you fill out your cards? Or are you waiting to fill them out as a post-holiday activity?<br>

.         In order to put a letterbox on your BINGO card, you must have<br>
either found the box or planted the box.<br>

When the words are called, beginning JAN 1, you can cross it off your card<br>
if you have included it in one of the squares.<br>

I have a beginers question. In order for one to mark off a word that is<br>
called, we have to have found that box?<br>

We were hoping to be able to find one or two of the letterboxes to put on our cards before we mailed ours out. (however,not looking promising :-s) But, be looking for our cards and Bingo booty sometime between Christmas and New Year's.<br>

And thanks for organizing the game this year!! :-)<br>
