Any of YOUR boxes count at long as YOU actually do the maintenance of it <br/>
(second hand reports don't count). It doesn't matter if they are in the <br/>
region or not.<br/>

&gt; It has been awhile since I think there has been an official 'Box<br/>
&gt; Maintenance' month. For those of you who have started letterboxing more<br/>
&gt; recently, Dragon (and later Springchick) organized efforts for everyone<br/>
&gt; to go do maintenance on their boxes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The idea is that everyone should go out and check their clues and boxes<br/>
&gt; to make sure that they are still accurate and in good shape. Do your<br/>
&gt; part to end 'Attempted Finds!'<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As an incentive, I started a database 'Box Maintenance 2012' where you<br/>
&gt; can list any box that you have recently maintained. For each box you<br/>
&gt; maintain, you get one entry into a drawing that I will do at the 'Beat<br/>
&gt; the Winter Blues' gathering (or on April 28th). The winner will get a<br/>
&gt; great, letterboxing related, prize!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To qualify a box:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1) You (or a member of your 'team') must be the person to visit a box<br/>
&gt; that you own.<br/>
&gt; 2) You must physically check that the clue is accurate, the stamp and<br/>
&gt; logbook are intact and in good shape, and that the box container is<br/>
&gt; intact. If any part is incomplete, you need to fix it by April 27th to<br/>
&gt; be counted.<br/>
&gt; 3) You must do maintenance between February 1 and April 27th.<br/>
&gt; 4) Boxes planted after November 2012 are ineligible.<br/>
&gt; 5) Like most letterboxing finds, finds are recorded on the honor system<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go find YOUR boxes!<br/>
