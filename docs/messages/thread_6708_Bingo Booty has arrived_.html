Thanks for everything, Spring Chick!  But, we do want to know which one of us is supposed to wear the "personal protection devil key ring"????<br>

What a great birthday gift! The mailman brought not only good wishes for yet<br>
another birthday today, but also my Bingo Booty Box! So, henceforth this day<br>
will be known as "Happy Booty Birthday"! Thanks for everything, Spring<br>
Chick! But, we do want to know which one of us is supposed to wear the<br>
"personal protection devil key ring"????<br>
