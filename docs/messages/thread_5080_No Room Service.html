<br>
I got the stamped images from the SILO2 and I thought the Room <br>
Service box was heading my way at the same time.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I've forgotten about it until now, 1:30 am the <br>
morning we are to leave . . . and I don't have it.<br>
<br>
Sorry guys, I hope not to many of you were planing on making it out <br>
to our hotel . . . which btw I think has changed (I can't remember) <br>
we are staying in Hudson, WI if anyone does want to swing by.<br>
<br>
Here's my cell phone if anyone wants to give me a ring over the <br>
weekend 309 737 9622.<br>
<br>
And, if any of you are heading home via Pepin, Wisconsin there will <br>
be a new box inside The Pickle Factory as of Sunday after lunch, just <br>
go up to the hostest and say, "I'm a Cucumber" -- this box, along <br>
with 7 others shall be hidden over the course of the next several <br>
days.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to Sat. <br>
<br>
Safe Travels,<br>

<br>
P.S. If for some odd reason I'm not allowed to leave a box in The <br>
Pickle Factory and you go up to someone and say, "I'm a Cucumber," my <br>
sincerest appologies for making you feel silly for nothing :-D<br>
<br>
P.P.S. my much anticipated "1892 Froelich Tractor" stamp will finally <br>
be placed tomorrow if anyone is heading through Froelich, Iowa. It <br>
will be an in door stamp and you just have to ask for it.<br>

I was going down the list of event stamps and read the clues with my name all over them for the Room Service and I paniced as I never got the stamp.<br>
<br>
Its in good hands, I'm so happy.<br>

We actually have this stamp; Funguswoman sent it to us. We were hoping <br>
to post a clue tonight, but we were waiting to hear back from the hotel <br>
manager. We haven't heard from him/her yet, so we're going to try <br>
calling again. Final information will be posted on this tomorrow.<br>
