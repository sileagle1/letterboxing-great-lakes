&gt; We have not been winter boxing but I've been thinking about it (not <br/>
&gt; today of course, -16/-40 windchill).  What is some of the advise they <br/>
&gt; gave? or does anyone have any tip/hints?<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few we've gleaned from winter hiking websites and some blended with our own <br/>
letterboxing experiences.  I'm sure that there are plenty of additional tips...So letterboxers <br/>
keep this topic going.  It looks like we are going to have to adapt to winter letterboxing for <br/>
a long time here in the Great Lakes!<br/>
<br/>
1. When choosing , look letterboxes for clues that explicitly state the box is hidden "in" <br/>
something - a stump, a hole in a tree, a cave, etc - less chance of finding a frozen box or <br/>
damaging a box if you have to dig.  When finding a box entombed in ice, don't risk <br/>
damaging it by chipping at it and cracking the box.  As disappointed as you will feel at not <br/>
getting that tricky box, it is better than laying awake nights with the guilt of contributing <br/>
to a ruined box!<br/>
<br/>
 2. Warm socks with some wool in them - NO COTTON.  Waterproof boots!  If you XC ski <br/>
or snowshoe - bring 'em! (Just be careful when counting paces or steps!) <br/>
<br/>
3.  Bring the right gear and hike with other people.  Let someone know where you are <br/>
going and when you plan to return is a good idea any season.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Hiking is more difficult in winter than summer and often takes considerably more time. <br/>
Snow conditions underfoot, weather conditions, and navigation challenges on poorly <br/>
defined trails and above tree line can make for arduous going and take longer than <br/>
expected. Hikers need to set a turn-around time and stick to it, leaving the box if not <br/>
found to another day.  Having a trail map of an area may help to find those snow covered <br/>
trails. Be careful around lakes, ponds, streams - don't assume them to be frozen - aka <br/>
soaking wet feet!<br/>
<br/>
5. The right clothing/equipment can make or break a trip.  Knee-high nylon gaiters keep <br/>
snow out of boots.  Snow pants work well too.  Trekking poles are useful for stability in <br/>
deep snow.  Ski goggles, a Balaclava, neck warmer and face mask provide full face <br/>
protection against winter winds. For hands, fleece gloves with thin liner gloves and a <br/>
waterproof shell are standard.<br/>
Short winter days require starting out earlier in the day or use a headlamp with an LED <br/>
light and extra batteries, just in case you don't make it out of the woods before dark.  <br/>
Clothing in winter is all about layering and controlling body temperature and moisture as <br/>
conditions dictate. Only synthetics will do NO COTTON....think about wet, cold blue jeans!<br/>
<br/>
6.  Carry hand and toe warmers-they come in handy!  Put them next to your camera or <br/>
flashlight in cold weather to keep them working, too. <br/>
<br/>
7.  Also important to stay well-hydrated with drinkable (non-frozen) water throughout the <br/>
day. A Thermos of hot liquid helps ward off the afternoon chill. Plenty of high energy <br/>
snacks tucked into the outside pockets of your jacket or backpack for easy access is a <br/>
good idea, just remember to keep hands clean in order to not transfer good smelling <br/>
scents to potential box eating critters.  Also, remember that most winter activities usually <br/>
use up to twice the energy of a similar summer event. <br/>
<br/>
8.  Duct tape!  wrap some duct tape around your water bottle. It's easily accessible, you <br/>
know exactly where it is, and it doesn't take up space in your pack.  Good for patching <br/>
ANYTHING that is broken; from blisters to cracked boxes!<br/>
Happy Trails<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good recommendations from Tiptoe &amp; Tonto.  Here are a few more we can add:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Keep your ballpoint pen inside your mitten so it will be warm enough to<br/>
use!<br/>
<br/>
2.  If you want to take photos, keep your camera near your body (inside<br/>
pocket) so it is warm enough to use.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Those backpack/stool combinations are a better place to sit than the<br/>
snowy ground,<br/>
<br/>
4.  If the hike isn't too long, it might be better to take the box back to<br/>
the warm car to log in, then hike back to return the box to its proper home.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Umbrellas work well for snow in addition to rain.  If flurries start<br/>
when you are logging in, use the umbrella to protect all the various<br/>
logbooks.<br/>

Good recommendations from Tiptoe &amp; Tonto.  Here are a few more we can add:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Keep your ballpoint pen inside your mitten so it will be warm enough to use!<br/>

Or, if you're a geek like me, you bring your Space Pen along:  http://www.spacepen.com/allpens.aspx  <br/>

I have the $10 "Space-Tec" pen and in my defense, I originally bought it for my Red Cross volunteer work.  Since the number one disaster the Greater Cleveland Chapter responds to are house fires, I got tired of trying to write reports at 2 am in the cold with water dripping down all over my paperwork as I'm walking around the house and my pens wouldn't work and/or I couldn't write on the wet paper.  Then after a few times trying to write in damp logbooks, it dawned on me, "Bring my Space Pen letterboxing!!"  <br/>
