                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I found Lock &amp; Lock-type containers at the Dollar Tree in White <br/>
Bear Lake (MN).  Yippee!  They had two types, both shallow: square and <br/>
rectangular.<br/>
<br/>
I think that someone posted earlier about checking these boxes for a <br/>
good seal.  Yes, check the blue gaskets to make sure that they are <br/>
intact and continuous.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone else is finding ways to letterbox in this extremely cold <br/>
weather :)<br/>
