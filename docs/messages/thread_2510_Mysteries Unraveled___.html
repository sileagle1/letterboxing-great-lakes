                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm really excited because this weekend two of my boxes that have both <br>
given numerous people fits and both produced countless "the box is <br>
missing" reports were found, safe and sound, right where they should <br>
be -- Tulip Time Twist and Copper Country Autumn.<br>
<br>
Both are boxes that I have not personally been able to check on and I <br>
had begun to be concerned that perhaps they had actually gone <br>
missing.  Thanks to the finders, J&BBooks and Martha from the U.P. for <br>
updating me on these boxes and terrain changes, etc.  A few clues <br>
changes are in order due to slight terrain and landmark changes on <br>
both of these.<br>
<br>
Congratulations on finding these boxes!  <br>
