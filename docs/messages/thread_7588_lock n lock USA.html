I was online, looking for good deals on lock n locks, as Skootch, Tricky<br/>
Troy and I are planning a spring gathering up here in MN, much to my<br/>
horror, lock n lock USA seems to be letting go of their online<br/>
e-commerce site!  (*insert mounting panic here*)<br/>
<br/>
I have always appreciated the heads-up on sales and places to get boxing<br/>
containers on the cheap, as we're going to make a ton of boxes up for<br/>
this event and we're perennially broke.  Other sources, ideas et al<br/>
would be fabulous!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much in advance!<br/>
