Alack and alas, though we searched for the infant placed under a flat-topped rock by <br/>

discover a writing quill possibly left by another knight.  We left the quill where we <br/>

Wisconsin Hiker is correct; I return to service on Monday.<br/>

For those of you who are really into this, you know that that means <br/>
that the Flying Coconuts HH is now available, albeit far from many <br/>
of you.  However, we are trying to help a number of you out with <br/>
this!  Since Armadillo Jo is unable to make it to the gathering, <br/>
Speedsquare has graciously consented to pick up the Coconuts HH on <br/>
her way to the gathering and to place it in the grail box closest to <br/>
the gathering site.  That way a number of you will be able to get <br/>
it. In order for this to work,<br/>
<br/>
1) If you live near the Castle Aaaargh box, go ahead and get the <br/>
box, but please leave the HH for Speedsquare to pick up.<br/>
<br/>
2) If you are going to the gathering, plan to get to the closest <br/>
grail box to the gathering site some time that weekend so you can <br/>
get the HH.  (Hint: Troy)  If you do, please leave the HH in that <br/>
box until the Monday after the gathering.  From then on the HH is <br/>
free to travel.  I'd be great if it flew south to IL!<br/>
