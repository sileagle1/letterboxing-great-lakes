yet - or the internet.  Special today for LbGLK members only - here's the<br>
message from Boxer-in-TRAINing describing where he hid the Dixie letterbox I<br>
carved.  Remember, no logbook or anything but a naked magnetic stamp.<br>
<br>
Who will be the first finder?  Silly me, I didn't think to make up a FF<br>
certificate before they left, or I would mail it to you.  But if you'd like,<br>
I can make up something!<br>

I placed the box @ Dixie. I had to place it inside.......Exit 145 off of<br>
I-55....Park car etc!!<br>
Walk to main entrance front of building.<br>
Enter double doors into vestibule containing newspaper vending machines and<br>
various free give away literature, real estate, cars, motels, etc! Look for<br>
the white machine selling Chicago Tribune...<br>
Face machine, drop your keys, or whatever, bend down and reach between the<br>
machine (lower left side towards the rear) and the wall. About 3 inch<br>
clearance between machine & wall. Lot of foot traffic. After you get the<br>
stamp you can walk thru double doors into the store.  You can stamp in the<br>
washroom or outside or in your car....Replace stamp.....etc!!!.......any??<br>
drop me a line or call.<br>
