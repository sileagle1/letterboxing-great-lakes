For anyone who might be squeemish in touching the little devils---if you <br/>
use a credit card (or your Blockbuster membership tag?!) just run the <br/>
edge of the card down the length of the body starting at the top or <br/>
where they have bitten in and after 4 or 5 swipes, they will back out <br/>
also.  I have already removed easily 20 ticks (with a new Frontline <br/>
collar also) and all have come out easily and in tact. <br/>
<br/>
This method is doctor-endorsed for humans also.  The one additional bit <br/>
of information that I would counter on the video is NOT to wait.  It is <br/>
my understanding that Lyme disease is transfered within the first 24 <br/>
hours and so you do not want to purposefully wait a day before <br/>
removing.  The great thing is the credit card method (and it looks like <br/>
this other method too) is incredibly easy to do---even on the trail so <br/>
it's not the big ordeal it used to be.  =D<br/>

Thanks tiptoe and tonto!  I will give this a whirl next time! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">NEVER wait to remove an imbedded tick! If I remember correctly, ALL of the tick born diseases are transferred in the first 24-36 hours. If you wait then there is a chance that you or your dog could catch something, but if you get the tick (and don't leave any mouth parts behind) out within the first 24 hours you should be safe.<br/>
<br/>
A few tips for dog owners using frontline that we went over at work when our frontline rep did our spring parasite talk, make sure that you apply the frontline directly to the dog's skin and not just the fur. Especially on dogs with thick fur and/or a double coat. You want to see pink (or whatever color your dog's skin is) before you squeeze or it will be less effective. Also, while frontline is good for fleas for longer than 30 days, it really needs to be reapplied every 4 weeks for tick control. If the ticks are particularly bad in your area, it can safely be reapplied every 3 weeks. Another thing to keep in mind that I didn't know until our frontline rep came by the clinic this spring is that frontline can sometimes take up to 45 days before it is fully effective against ticks...so start it at least a month earlier than you think you have to in the spring because that first application may not be very effective against ticks.<br/>

We would never wait to remove a tick...we missed that part of the video???...we just took the twirling technique and went to town...<br/>

you clicked on the arrow of "What Next" at the bottom:<br/>

[More information<br/>
The only troubles I have had with this technique, is when you catch the <br/>
tick early in it's attaching process. It makes it harder to actually get <br/>
the body of the tick to move around and you feel like you're just <br/>
rubbing the tick. If it won't come off, I will usually wait another day <br/>
instead of risking leaving part of the tick behind in my dog.]<br/>
<br/>
There were more comments----but this is the part I was referring to. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for this great information!  I've already passed it on to <br/>
several people!!  =D<br/>

That being said, just a reminder that it's the tiny little deer ticks (= hard to see), not the honkin' big wood ticks that carry Lyme...but any risk of any tick-borne disease is a good thing to avoid.<br/>
