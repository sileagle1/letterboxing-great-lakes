What a system!  Here I had all the labels all ready with confirmation labels<br>
all filled out...I even listed the tracking numbers so no one would have to<br>
report them!  That's what I get for being efficient.  Anyway, here's the<br>
upcoming list.  Whenever it arrives we'll have to figure out who to send it<br>
to.<br>
<br>
(CCing this to the group so you guys know what's going on.  The Posse will<br>
be sending it to Armadillo Jo.  Hopefully the labels will show up eventually<br>
and the two packages can be united.)<br>

  Still  nothing.. did a stamp exchange with Lucky Charms and Roller Jim<br>
yesterday...<br>
  Give me the next address and I will send it on! Then when the envelope<br>
shows up I will mail it on too<br>

    Hmmm...I sent the labels in a big padded envelope quite a while ago,<br>
first class but not priority or tracked.  Was it Monday?  I've lost track of<br>
days, but I think that was it.  Hopefully it will arrive today.  If not, let<br>
me know and I'll email you the next name.  We may need to then forward the<br>
address labels if/when they arrive.  Sorry about the confusion!<br>
