                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent Friday afternoon going after this "local" box... we had saved <br>
it so that when B's parents visited from South Carolina, they could see <br>
what this "letterboxing madness" that has overcome their son and <br>
daughter-in-law was all about! So, despite some late afternoon <br>
thunderstorms, we set out for a lovely (if slightly damp and buggy) <br>
walk in the Arb. The clues were wonderful and really gave us a tour of <br>
the park. And best of all, they offered an alternative way back once we <br>
had found the box. We really appreciated this, as B's parents (and <br>
maybe B, too!) were not looking forward to climbing all those stairs <br>
back out of the park! The stamp and walk were great, and B's parents <br>
were suitably impressed. Even if you are a local or townie and know the <br>
Arb pretty well, I highly recommend this box. :-)<br>
