SInce I don't much enjoy puzzles -- probably because I'm terrible at<br/>
them --I'm not sure I even know what you mean by a word-search puzzle<g>!<br/>
<br/>
BUT, folks around here know that as a runup to the Cereal City Circus<br/>
Mystery Gathering I used a number of anagrams (in fact, I used an<br/>
anagram of the word "anagram" at one point).<br/>
Anyway, the following link might be useful:<br/>

LOL Ok, azobox, so you know anagrams, but not word search puzzles?  I <br/>
think you need to have a word with someone about that! <g><br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the link, I'll look around there.<br/>
<br/>
I found exactly what I wanted here: <br/>
http://puzzlemaker.school.discovery.com/WordSearchWithMessageSetupForm.html<br/>
This works great!  You use whatever word list you want, tell them <br/>
what you want your hidden message to be and they create the puzzle for you.<br/>
<br/>
My only major problem is that I do not know how to get the puzzle to <br/>
appear as a grid on LBNA or AQ. :(  So, my clue looks ridiculous when <br/>
people view it.  I uploaded the doc file to this yahoo group and the <br/>
letterbox-usa group for people to refer to, but that's annoying.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I can take a picture of the printout and upload that to <br/>
AQ as a photo clue.  I'll have to give that a try!<br/>
<br/>
Almost wishing I'd never planted a box in Tuscola. <sigh><br/>
