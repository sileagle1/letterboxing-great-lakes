I added this "adsense" feature where you hypothetically get paid for <br>
click throughs if people check them out.  The ads are supposed to <br>
pertain to the content on your site.  I have a series of boxes titled <br>
"Til Death Do We Part" which are all placed in cemeteries.  Any <br>
guesses what the ads are?  LOL<br>
<br>
I have estate planning, a "when will you die, take our quiz" thing, <br>
creating a living will and something about probate.  Sheesh.  That's <br>
nice!   Glad to be an uplifting source of letterboxing info for my area!<br>
