I did have a concern about one of the letterboxes though.  'Using Your Little Grey Cells' is listed in column 'O'.  That was a box that I planted in 2006 (and the only box I've ever planted).  It went missing the same year, and is retired on AQ and archived on LbNA.  The concern I have is that the Bingo FAQs say: <br>
"The letterboxes are chosen randomly from the pool of currently active letterboxes planted and listed at either <br>
letterboxing.org or Atlasquest during the period from November 2010 - October 2011"<br>
According to that, 'Using Your Little Grey Cells' doesn't qualify. <br>
<br>
And yes, I did make sure that I was looking at the correct word list and that my box was the only one with that name. :)<br>

Brown Rabbit has never had his own personal stamp.....we only have our collective Team Rabbit stamp that we use for everything letterboxing. And since we only do letterboxing stuff/events as a team, if you have the Team Rabbit stamp in your book you have exchanged with Brown Rabbit. :-) <br>
<br>
Thank you to Familyof6 for once again taking the time to put together and organize the BINGO game! We are so excited and can't to start playing!! :-) <br>
