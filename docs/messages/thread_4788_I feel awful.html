Granted its subtitle is "Crime Does Not Pay", but my enthusiasm for the<br>
SILO2 event has been dampened by Thursday's "St. Valentine's Day<br>
massacre" at NIU.  I've carved a simple little memorial stamp, and would<br>
like to propose a moment of silence Saturday at noon.  I hope all of you<br>
in the group, wherever you are, can join us at the SILO in spirit as we<br>
think of those affected by that horrible event.<br>

  As a mother of a college student, this really hits home.<br>
  Erin's school had a student with a gun last year.  <br>
  Fortunately there were no injuries.  <br>
  Our local paper carried the story of a youg lady who <br>
  skipped that class for the first time to come home <br>
  for a valentines day date.  she normally sat front row center. <br>
  One time you'd be happy to have your child skip a class.<br>

If you or anyone else would like to receive the NIU Memorial box, I've <br>
converted it to a postal.  It's a tiny little stamp, and the log isn't <br>
very big either (though I'll have to add more pages now).  It's listed <br>
on AQ.  Sign up using the tracker.  Each person can contact the next <br>
person on the list for their address.<br>
