entire block of PZ Kut awaiting my leisure.  I plan to put out a series of<br/>
boxes at a local nature preserve based on invasive plant species in Ohio;<br/>
the images are even printed out and sitting in my end table next to the<br/>
sofa, awaiting good lighting (which I got for Christmas) for carving.  I was<br/>
beginning to plan a series based on the strange creatures of Roald Dahl, but<br/>
might just watch Willy Wonka again and contribute to PPP's exchange<br/>
instead.  Or maybe both.  And I told myself that I would design and carve a<br/>
team stamp for me and the dogs before the GL Gathering.  The problem with<br/>
that is deciding on a team name;  I have several ideas but everytime I think<br/>
I'm close to choosing one, I come up with more ideas.  My current favorite<br/>
is to be team YUCK - for YUki, Claire, and Katy - spelled out in insects (I<br/>
am an entomologist, after all).<br/>
<br/>
I also have some Rankin and Bass Christmas characters to be planted<br/>
somewhere.  Sadly, I don't even remember how many of them I actually<br/>
carved!  Snowmiser is in Illinois somewhere, because I couldn't even find my<br/>
own box when I went to pull him.  I know for certain Heatmiser, Rudolph, and<br/>
Nestor are in the file cabinet, but I don't remember if I ever carved that<br/>
Bumble or not.  Sad, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
If only letterboxing were a valid career instead of just a hobby.  <sigh><br/>

PS One of my New Year's Resolutions is to find a box a week until I have all<br/>
the local boxes in my logbook.  The joys of living somewhere new!<br/>

&gt;   I have 12 lock n lock boxes and six stamps. I just need to make some<br/>
&gt; logbooks and figure out where I want to plant them. A few are to replace<br/>
&gt; some that got snatched by Muggles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Note: I have carved two new Willy Wonka images... anyone else interested in<br/>
&gt; doing a Great Lakes exchange?<br/>
