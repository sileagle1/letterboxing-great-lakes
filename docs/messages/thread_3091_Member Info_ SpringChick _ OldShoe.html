                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I am SpringChick, the female half of the SpringChick and <br>
OldShoe team, and definitely the more obsessed of the pair.  We have <br>
been letterboxing a little over 4 years now and live in Muskegon, MI <br>
with two pugs (who do letterbox on occasion).  We don't keep an <br>
accurate count of boxes, but by rough count it is about F400 P150. <br>
The count is more mine than a team count as OldShoe is not an avid <br>
letterboxer and his involvement in finds and plants is usually <br>
limited to boxes done while traveling. I often letterbox alone and <br>
actually enjoy the solitude of walking the trails by myself. In the <br>
past couple of years I have also been taking my young grandson with <br>
me, trying to instill a love of nature in him. He is just at the age <br>
(now 4) where he understand what we are doing and eagerly looks <br>
forward to the next box.<br>
<br>
Most of my letterboxes are planted in the West Michigan area, the <br>
exception being several in the Traverse City, MI area and a sizable <br>
collection of them planted in Michigan's U.P. I have planted a few <br>
here and there across the U.S. while on vacation but am slowly <br>
retiring these boxes as the areas they are in become populated with <br>
letterboxers and letterboxes. As letterboxing grows and more boxes <br>
become available, I find myself adjusting my planting style to offer <br>
more difficult and/or unique boxes, in terms of location, hike or <br>
clues. Mystery boxes are my favorites to plant and hikes of 2+ miles <br>
(mystery or non) are my favorites to find -- although I don't always <br>
have the time for them while passing through an area on vacation.<br>
<br>
When I first learned about letterboxing, it seemed tailor-made for <br>
me -- a combination of several things that interested me.  I had <br>
been an avid hiker for several years. As a teenager I spent a summer <br>
in Switzerland and did a lot of hiking in the Alps and for many <br>
years previous to learning about letterboxing I had been taking an <br>
annual "hike & write" trip to Michigan's U.P. each fall by myself.  <br>
I would hike by day, set up camp and write at night by the light of <br>
the fire. I also am an artsy kind of gal and have more rubber stamps <br>
than any person in their right mind should have, although I had <br>
never heard of carving my own stamps, much less tried doing it. I <br>
was familiar with several types of bookbinding and had been crafting <br>
handmade books as gifts for friends over the years.  The treasure <br>
hunt aspect was not new to me either. I've always liked puzzles, <br>
games and brain teasers and one year at summer camp the staff put <br>
together a treasure hunt for us and I was just thrilled.  I went <br>
home and made up a treasure hunt for my family and have continued to <br>
put together scavenger hunts/treasure hunts for our annual family <br>
camping trip each summer. As an adult I became a logic puzzle <br>
fanatic and this is one of my favorite types of letterbox clues to <br>
write. Everything about this hobby fascinated me -- the only problem <br>
was that there were no boxes in my area to look for...  and that is <br>
another whole story (which can be found in message post #8688).<br>
<br>
I am the originator and one of the moderators of this Yahoo! Group, <br>
as well as serving as a moderator at a couple of the other <br>
letterboxing related groups. I was until recently one of the LbNA <br>
web masters, but resigned because it was getting too overwhelming. I <br>
am also the originator of the annual Great Lakes Letterbox Gathering <br>
(held the first Saturday in June each year), and last year began <br>
hosting an annual fall letterboxing event in Michigan.<br>
<br>
Nice to meet you all!<br>
