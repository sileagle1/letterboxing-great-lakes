                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! We feel like we had an out-of-body experience last week!  The <br>
week after Christmas Tiptoe attended the mini-gathering at the <br>
PAW...sat next to Martini Man and Wisconsin Hiker....I think some of <br>
their hiking energy rubbed off!  Tonto had a Reading Conference in <br>
Tucsonlast week ...Tiptoe went along for some fun in the sun....and <br>
to sneak in a little letterboxing between conference meetings <br>
(Thankfully, most meetings were held in the evenings!)  We logged in <br>
more than 30 miles of hiking up and down gorgeous mountains, canyons <br>
and spectacular desert views all thanks to the terrific Arizona <br>
boxers placing a plethora of boxes!<br>
<br>
We found 19 of the attempted 20!<br>
Kristal & Ron boxes:<br>
"To the Bat Cave," "Tombstone: The Town Too Tough To Die" <br>
and "Goin'Batty II<br>
<br>
angel1551us box:<br>
"Grateful Dead"<br>
<br>
Pat & Cat boxes:<br>
Honeybee Canyon Park<br>
<br>
Desert Rat box:<br>
"Tohono Chul Park"<br>
<br>
Funhog boxes:<br>
"Flycatcher" and "Madera Canyon" - our 1st Funhog boxes YaHoooo!<br>
<br>
We can't say enough about these boxes by Azroadie:<br>
"The Thing", "Rincon Valley", "Sabino Canyon", "Bear Canyon",<br>
"Agua Caliente Hill", "Phainopepla","Sentinel Peak", "Golden Gate" <br>
(1st Finders!), "Kennedy Park", Brown Mountain"<br>
<br>
and HH..."Happy New Year 2005" found in Golden Gate (now heading <br>
back east with us to continue into 2006 somewhere out of the desert <br>
sun!)<br>
<br>
We searched for mizscarlets "Red Eagle" with no luck...<br>
<br>
We've listed all the boxers and their boxes so that we could in this <br>
forum "publicly" thank each one of them for making our trip so <br>
fabulous!<br>
The weather is perfect, scenery couldn't be more beautiful and there <br>
are boxes for just about every kind of boxer.  <br>
NOTE: This report has not been funded by the Greater Tucson Tourism <br>
Board!  It is all true testimony!  So, if the winter weather has you <br>
down...head to Tucson NOW!  We can't even imagine doing these boxes <br>
in the summer heat!<br>
<br>
The best thing we learned about the trip, you ask?<br>
We proved to ourselves that by hiking one day over 11 miles in the <br>
mountains that we can surely tackle one of Wisconsin Hikers longer 9 <br>
mile hikes that we've been putting off! <br>
It brought back memories and felt like the "Olden days" in the 70's <br>
of backpack trips to Colorado....Oh, it was a thrill.....<br>

<br>
Woo hoo!  Congratulations! We're jealous - it sounds like a GREAT trip!  AND<br>
we could certainly could use some SUNSHINE at this point in our dreary<br>
winter.  We're also VERY happy to hear that there may be a few more boxers<br>
that are willingly to do some longer walks.  In addition to the 9-mile<br>
series we have, you might also be interested in the 4-mile "Christmas<br>
Botanicals" that we placed last month.<br>
