                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello to all!  I am Autumn of Keith and Autumn.  We have been <br/>
letterboxing since May of 2006 - I read a Family Fun article about <br/>
getting your family excited about hiking (some members of our clan are <br/>
not all about nature...) and knew that it would be a great hobby for <br/>
us.  Our son, Micah, is 4 and loves going letterboxing.  We are <br/>
currently using bought stamps as our signatures, but we will be <br/>
carving and choosing actual trail names after our first log books are <br/>
full.  We also have a daughter, Charlotte, who is 18 months old.  She <br/>
is just starting to be interested in the ink and stamps, so I'm sure <br/>
in another year she will be stamping in, too.  We have found 30 <br/>
letterboxes and planted one on our recent trip to the UP of Michigan.  <br/>
We have found boxes in 4 states so far.  Our favorite find was Berry <br/>
Patch in Paradise, Michigan - anytime I get to eat pie and letterbox <br/>
at the same time, I am all about it.  We are planning on attending the <br/>
October gathering in Chillicothe, so hopefully we will meet some of <br/>
you there!<br/>
