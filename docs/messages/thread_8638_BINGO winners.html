<br>
I've added a new database called 2018 Bingo Winners where everyone can see<br>
what games remain.  Right now, the two intermediate games left are the<br>
6-pack (a grid of 2x3 or 3x2) and the plus sign.  The wildcards don't count<br>
for the intermediate games.  Then after that, its just the full card which<br>
does include wild cards.  And the first 3 full card places are winners.<br>
<br>
So, you know where you stand, here is a pie chart. Start at midnight and<br>
read to the right.  The first purple is 4 words around to the second dark<br>
red at at 13 words. The numbers listed are % of boxers with that many<br>
words.  About a quarter of you sit at 8 (with the wild card) which is the<br>
median value.<br>
