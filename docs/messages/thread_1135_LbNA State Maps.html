Along with the functionality updates to letterboxing, the state maps <br/>
are being revised.  They will be brought up to date as far as the <br/>
colored in counties (counties that have boxes) and where requested, <br/>
regional divisions will be added or modified.<br/>
<br/>
The revised Michigan map was loaded up to the site today.  The main <br/>
change is a few extra regions because the lists of boxes on a few of <br/>
the pages were getting really long.  The U.P. is now 2 regions and the <br/>
L.P. has been further split from 3 regions into 6 regions.<br/>
<br/>
I have received input for WI and IN and they are in the process of <br/>
being revised.  If anyone has suggestions for any of the other states <br/>
represented in this group, please feel free to post to the list or e-<br/>
mail me off list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
