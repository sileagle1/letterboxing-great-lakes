                    <div class="plaintext-content">We don't mind them, although there can probably be TOO much of a good <br/>
thing.  I think the original intent, as an activity to keep kids busy <br/>
and the "thumb art" aspect is good.  We didn't feel uncomfortable <br/>
slipping them into people's open pockets or bags.  We did notice that <br/>
at an indoor event in the winter that there are LOTS of opportunities <br/>
to dump the cooties.  Unlike the summer, everyone had a coat along <br/>
and they were conveniently draped over chair backs...  Both Martini <br/>
Man &amp; I zipped our coat pockets shut and didn't get any cooties that <br/>
way.  However our open packs were another story...  I generally <br/>
assume that anyone who is a letterboxer is a trustworthy sort, so <br/>
even if they did unzip something a little bit to slip something in, <br/>
it's OK with me.  I trust that no one is slipping anything OUT of my <br/>
pockets or bags!<br/>
<br/>
Cooties are not really a problem, since if you get some and don't <br/>
want them, just show up at the next gathering and give them to some <br/>
kids.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I get to so few gatherings that I would feel guilty going home with them.  Not sure when I will get to another gathering after June, so I'm hoping I don't get any at that gathering.   I did have to pick off a few from the dogs and myself during the Winter BBQ event, but I just passed them on, set them on tables or clipped them onto a young Penguin (or his stuff) who was having fun infecting the bunch :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I was so busy stamping into all the PT's and boxes at that gather that I didn't even stamp into or get the stamp of the cooties, just passed them along.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think that sealed or closed items or containers should be opened to insert a cootie.  No telling what you might find.  What if someone has a pocket closed because their medicine might fall out?  Since it's mostly kids planting them, there are things (like meds or even weapons or sharp objects) that could be found in closed containers/pockets so opening them should be discouraged.<br/>
<br/>
There will be several dogs at the June event, but not all of them are comfortable with kids or even adults invading their space, so caution should be used in attaching cooties to them as well.<br/>
<br/>
It's a fun thing that keeps the kids busy, just want to keep it that way.<br/>

What I have found is not to place expectations on myself or the gathering, rather just go with the attitude that I will have a fun time and understand that my priorities are to meet some new people and chat with old friends (your priorities may or may not be the same).  For me, this is the goal going in and if I never make it out on the trail to find any of the planted letterboxes, I don't sweat it -- perhaps I can come back another time, perhaps not.  If I don't have a chance to exchange with every person there, it is not the end of the world, there will be other gatherings and I just take pleasure in the conversations I was able to enjoy.  I have found, like you, that the less I bring with me -- in terms of event boxes, personal travelers, expectations, etc. the more relaxed I am and the more fun I have, even though I may not have done every single letterbox or met every person.<br/>

I do hope you bring your personal traveler Aladdin's Castle.As I think <br/>
FungusWoman or Beelte said about the S.I.L.O. event, people often put <br/>
more effort into their PT stamps and I think it is a joy to see the <br/>
beautiful work.  Here in Ohio, this is why everyone supported Dr. <br/>
Watson's and Van Man's decision to have another mini meet (Schoolhouse <br/>
"Cabin fever" Reliever after Hale's Angels' mini meet in Dayton.  This <br/>
way we can get a second chance to get some exchanges done before "our <br/>
out of town guests" arrive for the Columbus Cluez Gathering!  We want to <br/>
spend more time getting to know all of you who are taking the time to <br/>
travel here this June.  For example, I hope I get to exchange with you <br/>
at the Hoosier Heart event in a few weeks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Adding my two cents to "keeping your sanity at a<br/>
gathering," Deedle &amp; I enjoy going on the trails to<br/>
find boxes that were planted specifically for the<br/>
event, especially if they're "that day only" boxes. <br/>
But we also like putting faces to names of all the<br/>
boxers we've never met or may only know by email<br/>
postings or stamp images.  We spent almost the entire<br/>
morning of the Mo' Boxin' in Mowtown Gathering just<br/>
doing exchanges &amp; stamping into event boxes.  And then<br/>
there was Boch's Traveling Circus...<br/>
<br/>
What we might try this year is hitting the trails<br/>
early to find planted boxes, and then when we're<br/>
exhausted from walking spend the afternoon/evening at<br/>
the shelter gathering exchanges and doing event box<br/>
stamping.  That way the exchanging would be a little<br/>
less hectic, we'll hopefully have more time to talk<br/>
with the people we're exchanging with.  We'll see if<br/>
that's what actually transpires.  I'm also hoping that<br/>
since we're camping Friday night, we can get a lot of<br/>
exchanges that evening with the other campers.   <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We don't worry about getting cooties.  If we don't want to spend time on them at the gathering, we just take them home with us, stamp in w/our "thumb art" at home, and then take them along at the next gathering and make it one of our "first things to do" to slip them into some pockets or packs so we have dutifully passed them along.  We don't feel compelled to check throughout the day of an event to see if we have any cooties and then take the time to stamp into them.<br/>
We don't mind if you don't bring a personal traveler, since we don't actively solicit any personal travelers, nor have any personal travelers ourselves.  We simply enjoy doing a normal exchange and hopefully a bit of conversation.<br/>
Since we are usually lucky enough to stay in the area of an event for at least the weekend, we try to spend the day of the event talking with other attendees and only look for boxes that are there for only 1 day (we appreciate the event coordinators who make an effort to identify how long each box will be in place!).  We then spend the rest of our weekend/long weekend looking for the boxes.  This gives us the best of both - time to chat &amp; exchange LB stories AND time to get out on the trail.  This of course assumes that many of the boxes will be in place for at least a weekend or week.  Although we have created a few Cooties, the Cooties &amp; Personal Travelers aren't high on our personal priority list.<br/>

&gt; While I must admit to launching ONE cootie in January 2006, I have not <br/>
&gt; created another since. I am uncomfortable in receiving them at <br/>
&gt; alreadylarge gatherings with many other letterboxes to find and <br/>
&gt; exchanges to <br/>
&gt; make. I don't hate them, they just make me a little more anxious. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And while I'm thinking of the next three gatherings I plan to <br/>
&gt; attend, I am <br/>
&gt; thinking about not bringing one of personal travelers, Aladdin's <br/>
&gt; Castle(and bonus stamp). Would anyone miss it? It's not that I <br/>
&gt; don't want to <br/>
&gt; share it, I just don't know how to be less stressed at these monster <br/>
&gt; gatherings. I could leave it in my car when all the stamps start <br/>
&gt; flying. <br/>
&gt; Anyone have a solution for my anxiety? Don't even think "stay at <br/>
&gt; home" is <br/>
&gt; an option. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Heading out the door to be SUPER COOKIE today! It's my first time <br/>
&gt; and I <br/>
&gt; hope the day goes well. There's a wee bit of stress today. <br/>
