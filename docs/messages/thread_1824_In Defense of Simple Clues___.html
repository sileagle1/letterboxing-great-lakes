It's nice when the kids can read, and work out the clues on their own.  It's <br>
pretty fun to see their little faces light up when they've discovered the <br>
land mark they've been looking for.<br>
<br>
We like the tricky ones too, for adult sized brains!<br>

I am in the process of planning a couple of trips right now and while our destination locations (Shenandoah National Park, Door County, WI and Porcupine Mountains) will hold longer hikes and trickier clues, en route there and back, it is nice to have quicker leg-stretcher boxes that don't require a half day stop.  As I try to fit in everything, I am having to eliminate some of the boxes along the way that require longer hikes, even though I really had my heart set on doing them.<br>
