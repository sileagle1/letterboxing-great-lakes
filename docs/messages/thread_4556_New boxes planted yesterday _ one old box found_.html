<br/>
Due to vandalism on a couple of my planted boxes this past year, I have decided to try listing my new box, "Castle Rock", only on Atlasquest, at least for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
PW's box is her third attempt at "John Deere Plow".  The stamp has been recarved and the box has been planted in a new location.  The original location apparently was too close to the river.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I had checked on "Signs of the Zodiac:  Taurus" (Dekalb County, IL) last week and found that it was gone.  In fact, the August flood had been so powerful that it had washed away a lot of the downed logs, swept in some new debris, and deposited quite a load of sand.  I had my friend "Krait" recarve the stamp for me, assembled the replacement box, and last Friday hubby and I went back to find a new hiding spot.  While poking around in the woods, my sharp-eyed husband spotted the original box about 100 feet or so away from the first location!  So the logbook and stamp weren't lost after all and were safe and dry inside their baggies in the lock-n-lock.  The box is now back in commission, in a slightly different location, and the "Signs of the Zodiac" series is still complete.<br/>
