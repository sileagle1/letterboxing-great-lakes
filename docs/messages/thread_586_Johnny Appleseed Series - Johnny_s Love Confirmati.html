                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Dragon.  I haven't quite figured this newsgroup thing out yet.  I<br>
subscribed to the travellers, newboxers, Great Lakes and the LbNA lists. <br>
I have searched for threads, but probably not on all or the correct lists.<br>
 I promise to do better.  I also am going to digest mode!  It's a bit<br>
overwhelming.<br>
