Unfortunately, I just got an email saying that the shop keeper that has had two of the regular boxes in their shops will no longer help out.  Gibson Girl is picking up those two boxes for me and will be looking for new homes for them.  Hopefully we'll have them in place and the clues updated once again before the opening day tomorrow.  The current upload is marked July 9, 2010 (4:50 pm), and reflects that those two boxes are unavailable.  If there is an update later today, I'll change the time for the update.<br/>
