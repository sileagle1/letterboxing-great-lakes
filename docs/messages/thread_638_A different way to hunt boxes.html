                    <div class="plaintext-content">At the Great Lakes Gathering this past June there was a group that did night<br>
boxing -- waiting until after dark to do the Vampire series.  Just last<br>
night I tried to persuade OldShoe to come letterboxing in the dark with me<br>
at a cemetery box, but he wasn't seeing the fun in it.<br>
<br>
Sounds like a lot of fun, but I would think you'd have to be particularly<br>
careful of vegetation, etc. which would be more difficult to see at night.<br>
I am sure some boxes/locations are more suited to in-the-dark-boxing than<br>
others.<br>
