night I tried to persuade OldShoe to come letterboxing in the dark with me<br/>
at a cemetery box, but he wasn't seeing the fun in it.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a lot of fun, but I would think you'd have to be particularly<br/>
careful of vegetation, etc. which would be more difficult to see at night.<br/>
I am sure some boxes/locations are more suited to in-the-dark-boxing than<br/>
others.<br/>
