<br>
Please join us for a day or two or three -- whichever works for you. We<br>
promise to keep you entertained and letterboxing in some very beautiful<br>
areas including Downtown St. Thomas, Old Talbot Street, Pinafore Park<br>
and areas further afield.<br>
<br>
Tentative schedule of events:<br>
<br>
Friday<br>
7 pm: Meet & greet, getting settled, late night letterboxing<br>
<br>
Saturday<br>
10 am: Registration at Pinafore Park, swaps, goodie bags, workshops,<br>
letterboxing<br>
1 pm: Pot luck lunch, group photo, door prizes, more letterboxing<br>
7 pm: Supper and social at a local restaurant (location to be decided<br>
when we see the number of people wishing to attend)<br>
<br>
Sunday:<br>
11 am: letterboxing<br>
<br>
There will be three series of boxes planted. One will be in Pinafore<br>
Park, One will be a historic walking tour or St. Thomas, One will be for<br>
those of you who enjoy driving to picturesque locales in the area.<br>
<br>
Clue packages will be provided when your team registers.<br>
<br>
We would love some help with a few things:<br>
1. someone interested in teaching a workshop of simple stamp carving<br>
2. people interested in donating hand-carved stamps to be planted for<br>
this event.<br>
<br>
If you would like to plant letterboxes while you are visiting us, we<br>
would be absolutely thrilled.<br>
<br>
We will provide more details as plans are finalized.<br>
<br>
See you on the trail,<br>
