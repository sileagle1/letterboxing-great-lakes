Hemlock Crossings Park (MI).  Tho they still made sense to me :-), I <br/>
have revised a couple to hopefully help those having trouble with the <br/>
clues.  I know that "catching" is far more fun than just "fishing" be <br/>
it from the water of from a letterbox clue!  I have them on Atlas Quest <br/>
for now and will update Letterboxing.org when they are back in business!<br/>
