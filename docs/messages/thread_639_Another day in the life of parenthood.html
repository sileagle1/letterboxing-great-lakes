and off we went to Starved Rock!  MAN!  was it hot and humid <br>
yesterday or what????  We found one and almost another one before my <br>
youngest got SICK!  I am so bummed!  <br>
<br>
At least on our way to my husbands parents house, we did find the <br>
ones on Rt 71!  They were great!  We particularly LOVED the cluses <br>
to FIsho Out Of Water 2...(although my husband didnt "get" the last <br>
one until about 4 hours later!  haha<br>
<br>
I wanted to drop the kids off at the in-laws and keep going, but my <br>
oldest reminded me that this is a FAMILY hobby! (sigh!)  haha<br>
<br>
Hope everyone is having a great weekend!<br>
