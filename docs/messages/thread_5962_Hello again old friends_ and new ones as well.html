                    <div class="plaintext-content">After an extended hiatus I am back on the scene. I just wanted to pop my head in and say hello to you all. I've missed you, and letterboxing. I just got done deleting 1935 emails in my inbox! Unfortunately I couldn't read them all. If you had sent something to me personally and I didn't reply please don't take offense. It would have taken days to go through them all and I just wiped the slate clean. I will be checking my mail here again on a regular (daily) basis.<br>
For all you MN boxers there will be a series of 7 I will be posting very soon. keep your eyes open and start exercising. I've only planted 3 of the 7 and it's already a 6km hike. I'm guessing it will be around 7-9 miles when all is said and done. I know hikes this long aren't everyone's cup of tea, but why go to a beautiful park and not see ALL of it?<br>
During my hiatus I've had time to think about letterboxing a lot and what it means to me, what I want to do with it, and how that will affect my carves and plants etc. I've come to the conclusion that the journey to the box is just as important as the box itself. So expect some long hikes in the future.<br>
The series of 7 I had mentioned earlier are some of the first stamps I'd ever carved. I've been sitting on them for over 4 years! Why It's taken me so long I don't know, but it's time they see the light of day so to speak. I have around 20 stamps that are just collecting dust in drawers, projects started but never finished. I look forward to cleaning house and setting them free in the very near future.<br>
Once again, I miss all of you. I look forward to renewing ties with all my old boxing friends and meeting all the new people that have come to join our ranks in my absence.<br>
Happy, safe trails to you all. Talk to you soon<br>

And its been fun seeing your stamps in various boxes that FoundUnicorn and I have recently founded. We both enjoy long hikes, and so we will be excitedly looking forward to your set of 7 stamps series and the others you mentioned too. Series are always such fun!!! Again, welcome back! :) Looking forward to seeing you on the trails!<br>
