Hppy2Bmom, who should really seriously think about changing her name to The<br>
Procrastinator, finally has her bingo cards and booty boxed up and ready to<br>
be overnighted to the Family Man of Many. The addition of any "extra<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK.  I admit that we were later getting this info in last year by one day.  I think last year we were emailing Springchick on the 31st trying to get the all clear for overnight everything.  Thankfully we could email the cards and snail mail the booty.  Things have been wild and then both 'puters took a dive off the deep end.  But we are all up and running and will be emailing our cards over tonight, maybe Thursday and will be mailing the booty out tomorrow.  I know both Tat2Bob and I look forward to winning again this year.  Hope everyone had a great Christmas and hope we all have a wonderful and prosperous New Year.  <br>
