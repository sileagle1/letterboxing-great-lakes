When I heard Streator was hit hard, it made me think of our letterboxing friend Silboxer (I know he changed his trail name, but can't think of his new one) who lives in that town.  He reported on FB that he and his house are okay, and being an EMT/dispatcher, has been very busy.  Let's keep him in our thoughts.........<br/>
