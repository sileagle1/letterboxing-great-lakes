reported back that they couldn't find 3 of the 4 boxes!! Only number <br>
3 was found by both.<br>
<br>
So, today I ventured out to assess if these boxes are missing or just <br>
placed very very well.<br>
<br>
For those of you who have not found these boxes, they are located on <br>
a major creek that, with every other creek, stream and river in Iowa, <br>
has had major flooding.<br>
<br>
My heart sank as I walked the paved path back to box #1, sand and <br>
sediment were all over the place, plowed from the pavement in mounds <br>
several feet tall.<br>
<br>
I haven't been to box #1 since I planted it last July -- almost a <br>
year. Did I really remember where it was??<br>
<br>
BINGO, found it right off... right where it should be! My spirits <br>
were on their way up, perhaps they are all still there.<br>
<br>
Then, I came to where box #2 should have been . . . I have no words <br>
really, there was smelly river mud packed into the log where it was <br>
hidden, and the force of the flow of the water tore the log to <br>
pieces - glued together with this smelly river mud.<br>
<br>
I found a stick and pocked and proded. . . nothing :-(<br>
<br>
Box #3 I found on the ground, outside of its supposed hidding spot -- <br>
I returned it.<br>
<br>
Box #4 I was confident was still there (5 feet off the ground in a <br>
tree). Boy the walk was muddy muddy. The creek had washed sticks and <br>
debris all over the place. Fianally I reached the tree . . . gone!! <br>
Gone!! How could this be??? <br>
<br>
I will replace boxes 2 & 4 next month with my parents when they are <br>
here to visit.<br>
<br>
I'll keep you updated.<br>

will be reading quite a few more posts like yours in the coming weeks <br>
as people start to clean up after all the floods. <br>
Here's hoping everyone's boxes made it through our wild weather!<br>
