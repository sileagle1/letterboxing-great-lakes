Poor Spring Chick.  Everyone is attacking her.  We think it's all in fun, but what if something were to happen to her?  An unsolved mystery disappearance?  So many suspects.  Motive?  Letterboxing Bingo?  ROFLOL!  The investigators wouldn't know what to think.  The game is just beginning.  I'm hoping to win a game this year so my fingers are crossed; makes it rather difficult to type.  <br>

January is Be Kind To Spring Chick Month.  <br>
