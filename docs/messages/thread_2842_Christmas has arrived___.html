Two packages from my secret Santa were waiting for me and the family.<br/>
Inside we found: super sunblock, and after bite ointment, a straw mat for sitting on while stamping in (the mat is long enough for all of the family to have a rest), a block of Mastercarve, a set of brush markers, a cute snowman candleholder and candle, a mat stack, and a lovely ornament with a letterboxing theme. I think our secret Santa did some serious research!! We so needed some more Mastercarve and the markers are perfect. We loved the ornament and it will proudly be placed on our Christmas tree this December. Also one of the best things of all was the wrapping the presents came in. The secret Santa sewed fabric packaging for each of the presents. We will also enjoy reusing these wrappings.<br/>
I want to thank Speedsquare for setting this up. It was great fun and I am already thinking of some ideas for next year!!!<br/>
Thank you Santa!!!<br/>
B of BTTLE family <br/>
