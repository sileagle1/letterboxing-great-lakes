<br>
Just starting to get my feet wet Letterboxing in SW Ohio (Glen Helen State Park). I was able to <br>
get away a little today to get "broke-in." Aside from finding a second letterbox and being <br>
asked to photograph a couple of young guys and their girlfriends, should they decide to <br>
skinny dip, the day was pretty much uneventful.<br>
<br>
Actually I passed on the photo shoot (where was my mind at) and continued to follow the <br>
clues to the second box. Still, the third box must have been in stealth mode; unlike the eager <br>
young exhibitionists.<br>
<br>
All in all, it was a fun afternoon. Looking forward to the next go around.<br>
<br>
Enjoy<br>
