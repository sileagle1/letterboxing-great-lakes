I'm going to be in Indianapolis for an event over the weekend of April <br>
15-17, and am available on Thursday evening if anyone wanted to get <br>
together then for some socializing or cheap eats or organize a <br>

Friday if anyone wanted to tag along.<br>

Then I'll be in Milwaukee on the weekend of April 29-30. I'm booked on <br>
Friday night and all-day Saturday, but I haven't finished all my travel <br>
plans so I don't know when I'll be leaving or arriving.<br>

Spring Chick can vouch for me as being mostly normal (at least as far as <br>
letterboxers go!). Let me know if you're interested in meeting up....<br>

You mean a "PI" in a PIramid?<br>
<br>
Speaking of pyramids - to whom it concerns, I got it today.  My<br>
students were as thrilled as I was when I opened it in class 'cause I<br>
couldn't wait.<br>
