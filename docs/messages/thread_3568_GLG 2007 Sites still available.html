                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I guess I'll have to suck it up and pay for two days even though I'll only be using the site on Fri night.  Seems like a lot to pay for just one night, but if I don't get it quick, I'll be in Timbucktoo (or however that is spelled)! :-)  If anyone wants to share the site by using it on Saturday, just let me know.<br/>
<br/>
My dogs are:<br/>
Coyote: Australian Cattle Dog. Not crazy about attention/hands-on from people unless it earns him treats :-)  So he won't seek out attention from people/kids unless you are eating and then he will just go through his tricks until he finds one you can't resist "paying" him for with food :-) He may have issues with other dogs but I will do my best to keep him from barking at other "fur kids".  Usually, it's just when a new dog first arrives and once he realizes the dog is "allowed" to be in the area, he's fine.<br/>
<br/>
Bear: small beagle. Loves everyone, but is very polite about greeting.  <br/>
<br/>
Both will be on leashes and I am happy to respect any space issues people have regarding the dogs.  You can learn more about them (&amp; their brothers) on the dog's website: www.Dog-GoneHappy.itgo.com<br/>
<br/>
Even though the gather is a long way off, I'm already praying for good weather!  If there's any chance of thunder, I'll have to leave Coyote at home.  I also respectfully request NO balloons (which might pop) or anything that makes a sudden loud sound (firecrackers, etc.)  <br/>

  If you want to book a campsite by the group but all<br/>
  the sites in the "M" area are gone, there are several<br/>
  sites in the "J" area nearby. Some of those also form<br/>
  a circle ;)<br/>
