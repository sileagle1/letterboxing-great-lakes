                    <div class="plaintext-content">The pink stuff is good.  It carves nice and holds up well.  If you like the pink stuff you may also like PZKut, which is white, same thickness, very similar consistency, but a tad bit firmer -- I find detail a little easier on PZKut because it is not quite as elastic.  Some people feel the PZKut does not take ink as well, but I haven't really had a problem with that.<br/>
<br/>
I alternate between the pink stuff and PZKut for stamps that I am going to mount (i.e. regular size box) -- just whatever I have on hand.  When I am doing a smaller box and will not have room for a mounted stamp, I use the Staedler Mars Carving blocks because the extra thickness helps to keep unmounted stamps firm and easy to stamp.  I find this a bit more difficult to carve though because it is very soft and supple.<br/>

  I have carved about 10 stamps with this Speedy stuff and I love it!! I<br/>
  am getting really good results. It is soft and makes me happy!<br/>
  Is there any reason why I "should not" use this Pink stuff?  Are my<br/>
  stamps going to commit suicide after 6 months, because "Pink Stuff" is<br/>
  junk?  <br/>
  If I should be using something else, is it as easy to carve?<br/>
  Will it be a huge change from what I am use to?<br/>
