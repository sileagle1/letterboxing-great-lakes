The action is heating up!  The counties are counting down!  Wisconsin <br>
is close on our heels!  Do you have a box you want to plant but need <br>
some incentive to do so?<br>
<br>
If I've followed the threads here accurately, I believe we have 4 <br>
counties left to cover.  I also believe that if all goes well this <br>
weekend TrailTroll plans to plant boxes in the uncovered Northeastern <br>
counties (Gladwin, Oscoda & Alcona).  So, if that works out, I think <br>
there will be one lonely uncovered county by the end of the <br>
weekend.  Poor Mecosta!  Do you really want to leave it out in the <br>
cold without a box, all by itself?  How fair is that?  Come on, plan <br>
a trip to Mecosta!  Plant a box!<br>
<br>
I've decided to add a little incentive to get that last county <br>
covered.  In addition the bindle_babe's ongoing contest, I will offer <br>
up a prize to the first person to cover the last county in <br>
Michigan.  Keep in mind, that may or not be Mecosta, depending on who <br>
plants what where and when.  (nice sentence!)<br>
<br>
Remember bindle_babe's contest runs through midnight on <br>
Thanksgiving.   So, for optimum benefits, you may want to plant your <br>
box before then.<br>
<br>
I will keep this offer open until: (1) someone plants a box in the <br>
last county in Michigan OR (2) Wisconsin kicks our butt and covers <br>
all the rest of their counties before us OR (3) Midnight on December <br>
3, 2006.... whichever comes first.<br>
<br>
If the counties fill up before bindle_babe's contest ends, I'll go <br>
with whoever she shows as the first placer in the last county.  If we <br>
don't fill up the counties by Thanksgiving, you can either email me <br>
or you can post a note here with a link to your clues.<br>
<br>
So, get out there and plant a box!  Let's get the map colored in completely!<br>
<br>
GO MICHIGAN!  Get Boxin'!<br>

 ===================<br>
<br>
Don't worry too much!  I'm not aware of any plans in WI this weekend, but<br>
I'd love to hear that someone did get up to OUR northern couties so we could<br>
fill in a few more...<br>
<br>
Is anybody in the Green Bay area able to get over to Shawano county?  That<br>
should be one of the easier ones compared to the western counties.<br>

<br>
I have a group of Lansing LBs that are planning a trek to Mescota County this weekend to plant the a box. We are all fairly new but the group consists of me (bubba 6-Pack), George the Celtic Cat, and the North Side Biker Babe.<br>
<br>
We should have the planting done and clues posted by Monday.<br>
<br>
If Trail Troll is able to make her second mammoth trek this weekend, we should have Michigan completely covered by next week.<br>
