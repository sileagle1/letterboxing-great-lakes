Message: <br/>
I found a letterbox that was left open at Hawthorne Hill Nature <br/>
Center (where I work). It still had the stamp, but no ink pad and no <br/>
book. Could you please have someone stop by on Sunday, Septebmer 9 1-<br/>
4 pm (open hours) to pick up the box and make sure that it is taken <br/>
care of? I feel so bad to be holding onto it, but I worry that it <br/>
might be taken. Please contact me if you would like to pick it up <br/>
sooner. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
April<br/>

TheLastUnicorn.  I don't know them personally but if we can't contact <br/>
them I should be able to go and pick up the box.  We have already found <br/>
that series and should be able to follow the clues to replace it.  I <br/>
will drop them a line through AtlasQuest and LBNA, to see what they <br/>
want to do.  These are GREAT boxes.<br/>
