Not only that, but the little images on the upper left corner are just <br/>
SCREAMING to be turned into stamps!  Absolutely perfect - practically <br/>
pre-made for carving.  Good job, Wisconsin Hiker!<br/>
<br/>
I surely wish I could attend, but I think it's going to be a while <br/>
before I can make such a long trip strictly for lettingboxing.  I hope <br/>
you all have a marvelous time!  :-)<br/>

  Interesting website, but not very nice things said about my money sign. Some of it fits me, but I don't think most of it does. The ox description on the other hand fits me really well, perfectly almost. But since there is no ox anywhere near my birth year, I'm guessing my birthdate is correct, even if my sign isn't :-)<br/>

sounded all that good, and I didn't think it was very accurate either!  <br/>
But actually, I was born in early March so I was just a mere 2 weeks <br/>
late of being a Sheep/Goat/Ram, and I found that to be more accurate for me.<br/>
