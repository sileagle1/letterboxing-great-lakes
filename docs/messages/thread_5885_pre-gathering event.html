Just wanted to send out an invitation to those attending All Things Green who will be at the park on Friday night -- we're going to have a campfire going at our site (#240) and you're welcome to stop by to hang out, eat s'mores, and do some exchanges on Friday night from about 8:30pm-10:30pm. We listed it as an event on AQ, so you can go there to sign up so we have an estimate on how many marshmellows we'll need.<br/>

      Cool beans!  I love s'mores but Martini Man says you don't need to get any marshmallows for him.  We'll bring our own chairs, our LB gear, and maybe another snack to pass around.<br/>

<br/>
taking a nap in it - I guess I'm not the only one excited about going<br/>
<br/>
camping this weekend.<br/>

I've got some graham crackers I can donate to the cause, since Kimono Girl<br/>
<br/>
and I were already planning smores for Friday night anyway.<br/>
