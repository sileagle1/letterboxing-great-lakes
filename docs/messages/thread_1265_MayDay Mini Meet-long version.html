***IT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!****<br/>
<br/>
Ok - now the ones that met me yesterday are laughing, because they can hear me saying <br/>
it!  How cool is that??<br/>
<br/>
We had so much fun!  There were some new boxers there - <br/>
TinksDust &amp; HaveyBeaks and Team Strad-agy...so glad you guys could make it!  <br/>
We were also able to meet boxers who are new to our list - Sheheradaze &amp; Puss-in-<br/>
Boots...so glad to meet you guys!<br/>
<br/>
And veterans as well:<br/>
Armadillo Jo<br/>
BindleBabe &amp; Enders Angel<br/>
Pale Puppy Posse<br/>
Team Rabbit<br/>
The Cichlid Guy<br/>
Lipstick Chick with her bunch of newbies<br/>
<br/>
WOW!  SOOOO FUN!<br/>
<br/>
After having a great lunch ~ and exchanging stamps and a few personal travelers - we <br/>
were off.<br/>
<br/>
On the way to my HH Hostel we stoped at Little Piece of Heaven 2 - an easy quick find...I <br/>
wonder what people thought of us all pulling into that little cemetery!  Got a call from "R" <br/>
of our team, and told him to meet us all at the HH Hostel!<br/>
<br/>
We headed out to the Heartbreak Hostel - that was a hoot!  All those HH's!  Picked up The <br/>
Tree of Life - still giggling about that one!  You should have see them from far away ~ <br/>
checking every tree....and the picker bushes!  teeheehee!<br/>
<br/>
Headed back to the parking area and a couple of teams headed home...it was starting to <br/>
sprinkle, and I was getting a little nervous.....<br/>
<br/>
Headed over to Kirk Park, driving through some rain - but hey!  We're hard core boxers <br/>
here!  And then when we got there - IT WAS SUNNY!!!!  CAN YOU BELIEVE IT??<br/>
<br/>
So we hit the trail and I must say - R, S, W &amp; me....we laughed our stinkin' head off!!!!  It is <br/>
soooo funny to see other people (in a group no less) following the clues that you have <br/>
written!  Oh my gosh...I'm laughing right now just thinking of it.<br/>
I can hear Brenda of Pale Puppy Posse now..."So me a bench!  I'm not coming over there <br/>
until you can show me a bench!"  And Armadillo Jo - "I want to start at the trail head!"  So <br/>
unbelievably funny!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We were sucessful on all accounts ~ and after the trek to C.J's Loathing - we just had to <br/>
celebrate with ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
After a tasty treat at Dairy Queen - and more laughing and chatting...we called it quits!<br/>
<br/>
A great time was had by all!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for all the kind words and all the laughs!  I would do this again in a <br/>
heartbeat!!!  Except for that, I'm not a very social person......LOL - ok, who am I kidding!<br/>

<br/>
You know, if anyone saw all of us, we were actually lucky.  They probably <br/>
thought we were mourners and thought it best not to disturb <br/>
us...hehehehehehehehe.<br/>
<br/>
I have been in the cemetery near Dumpster Diva's house when we had to wait <br/>
and wait to be able to check on our box because there were people too close to <br/>
the goods and we could give ourselves away or get caught.<br/>
<br/>
You know, Angel, the bike path behind my house would make a great place to <br/>
hide a box.  We ought to walk that soon so we can find a great place so when the <br/>
weather is fabulous people can get out and find it.  How fun would it be to <br/>
hide it directly behind my house so I can watch? I can picture myself now on my <br/>
deck eating bonbons watching boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Time for me to get something done around here.  I don't want to still be <br/>
doing laundry while "24" is on tonight.  I have my priorities!<br/>

up the second set of steps for CJ's Loathing huffing and <br/>
puffing....Mrs. Doglvrs turns to me and says, "Who planted this <br/>
stinking box!" So funny! And the meltdown at the Buoys box....the <br/>
menfolk huddling around the trail map and the ladies using their keen <br/>
box-sniffing skills (and the Force) to find the Man in Black waaaaay <br/>
before those guys and their so-called map....it was priceless. I had <br/>
so much fun yesterday, going back to work was really, really hard. <br/>
June can't come soon enough I tell you! Thanks Bindle Babe for the <br/>
spiffy Cat Eyes! I'll be making use of those very soon! Okay, I've <br/>
babbled enough....lay off the caffeine Jess!<br/>
