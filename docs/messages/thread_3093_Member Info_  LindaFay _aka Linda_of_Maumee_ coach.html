                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing became my naughty hobby since July of 2004 when I <br>
introduced it to myself and 3 of my nieces.  My daughter, GretchenF, <br>
was with us, but she thought it was silly then but has 280+ finds <br>
now.  Living were I do in Northwest Ohio, I must now travel to far <br>
locations to find them.  This last weekend I was in Delaware visiting <br>
friends who now believe I need to be certified - as nuts - when then <br>
followed me around.  <br>
<br>
My daughter and I go letterboxing every chance we get and I'm getting <br>
better at carving.  My daughter, who is a master carver, is currently <br>
into her 6th month of developing a new letterboxer!!!! Yeah.  <br>
<br>
Oh, yes, I do have to work although I keep thinking if I only win the <br>
lottery, but I've heard you have to buy tickets - hmmmm.  <br>
<br>
I have three dogs, one husband, 2 adult kids and like to watch birds <br>
when not letterboxing or working.  So, why is it a naughty hobby?  <br>
Because I spend too much time trying to solve some of mapsurfers <br>
boxes and some of the other mystery boxes out there.  <br>

Thanks for the nice note you sent me in the mail. Is it what I think <br>
it is? Is it your placement?<br>
