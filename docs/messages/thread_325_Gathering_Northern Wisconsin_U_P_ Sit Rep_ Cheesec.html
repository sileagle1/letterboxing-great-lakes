<br>
Just wanted to drop a note thanking Tim and everyone else who made <br>
the gathering such a great timedespite the flocks of mosquitoes and <br>
the heat.  We can't wait for the next gathering.  <br>
We also wanted to give the rundown of our three day whirlwind trip in <br>
the U.P.  We had a great time!  Next time we will try to get more <br>
time to spend up there.  So here it is.<br>
