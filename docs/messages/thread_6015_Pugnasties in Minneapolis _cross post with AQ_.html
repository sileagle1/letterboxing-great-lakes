We are having a funiture sale at my great aunts house (she passed away last month) and I'll have a special stamp made for the event. Come check us out at the 3900 block of Sheridan Ave N. I'd love to meet folks, do some exchanging and just visit (I'm probably going to be bored out of my skull).<br>
<br>
Hope to see you there (and if you know anyone who need some REALLY nice furniture pass the word.)<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
