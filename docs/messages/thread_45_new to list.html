                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI snowin-lizard! Welcome to the group!  What part of Ohio are you <br>
from?  I have done some boxing in the Cleveland area and have a box <br>
at Marblehead lighthouse.  I would love to head down to Cincinnati <br>
for a long weekend -- there are tons of boxes there!<br>
<br>
Make yourself at home here... having found tons of boxes is not a <br>
prerequisite for fitting in here -- letterboxing is relatively young <br>
in this area and most of us have not been at this all that long.  We <br>
look forward to hearing your tales as your numbers tally up!<br>
