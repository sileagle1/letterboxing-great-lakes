Here's why you shouldn't plant a box close to home:<br/>
<br/>
I pass one of my boxes generally twice a day.  It lies on my jogging/biking path, and always give me a good excuse to slow down and take a breather.  However, I think I'm going off the deep end, since everytime I see people near the general vicinity of the box, I'm positive they're letterboxers, and I'm busy going through that dance in my head that we've all been through, the "how do I let them know that I'm a letterboxer without letting them know I'm a letterboxer?" dance.<br/>
<br/>
Most people go through this dilemma in their heads rather quickly and generally inconspicuously.  I, however, am always either 4 miles into a jog or 15 miles into a bike ride at this point, and my rational, calm mind has been knocked senseless by fatigue.  And so I stare.  Stupidly.  While breathing heavily and sweating.  I'm so suave.<br/>
<br/>
Take for instance, the poor couple with a dog I just about scared out of their wits with my panting and sweating yesterday.  I was CONVINCED they were tj_mich.  They *HAD A DOG*, didn't they?  They MUST be them!  Either they weren't, and I stalked them for nothing, or they were, but had the good sense to get away from the madwoman with the glad problem. <br/>
<br/>
Or today, the nice couple in the SUV who slooowly pulled into the park, looking around.  MUST BE LETTERBOXERS LOOKING FOR LANDMARKS!  So I slooowly jogged past them, turning my head as I went until I was almost running backwards.  *That* nice couple left the park without ever getting out of their cars....hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind, in my head I am very stealthy about all this.  It isn't until I've gotten home and showered that I realize that I was acting like a fool.<br/>
<br/>
So if you see a sweaty woman on a bike or loping along on a run, and she stops and starts breathing heavily by you, please don't take her staring as a hostile act.  She's just a little bonked.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Delirium, who has yet to see posters with her face up in the park, bearing the warning, "BEWARE OF THIS WOMAN".  <br/>
<br/>
p.s.  If that WAS you, tj_mich, I'm super sorry!  *grin* <br/>

Next time, check to see whether they are carrying a piece of paper<br/>
that are printed off clues.  If they don't have a piece of paper, they<br/>
are probably not letterboxers.  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
-or-<br/>
<br/>
Even worse!  They may be dreaded geocachers looking to place a<br/>
geocache in your perfect hiding location!<br/>
<br/>
Just some tidbits to either make you more or less delirious!<br/>

PS.  Who knows, that sweaty guy running by your letterboxes next week<br/>
might be ME!<br/>
