So, in this case, I would be willing to send a HH(s) your way as a swap just so the HHs can be out in the wild again! :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I was looking through one of my bags earlier this summer, I found a<br/>
flea that I hadn't remembered getting at the GLG last year.  Since I was<br/>
missing the GLG this year to go to a friend's wedding, I decided to take the<br/>
flea with me and release it in a box near the wedding location.  I didn't<br/>
really pay attention to who had the flea last or where it came from, but<br/>
after started stamping it into the box, I realized I was putting it in a box<br/>
that had been planted by the last finder of the flea - and then when I went<br/>
to the next box on my list, I found that the flea had been picked up from<br/>
that box.  So this flea traveled halfway across the US, spent a year in<br/>
Yuki's backpack, and then traveled right back to a stone's throw away from<br/>
it's previous location.<br/>
<br/>
So I'll pass on the offer for HHs, since I'm clearly not doing a good job<br/>
with helping them travel :)<br/>

It seems that my letterboxing adventures are few and far between and if I stumble across the bonus find of a HH, it always seems to be the last box of my day/week/month.  I have only found a small handful but I always feel like I hang onto them longer than I should. I am lucky enough to have a HH Hostel right around the corner from my house which I have visited more than a couple times to exchange.  Good for you, Doodle Bug, for fessing up to your HH hording, lol, and for getting them back out there :) <br/>
