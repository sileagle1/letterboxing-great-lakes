We haven't looked at LbGLK all week...and finally Tonto and I checked into a hotel room <br>
this evening where we finally got internet access..To our surprise there were a boatload of <br>
messages on the usually quiet LbGLK board..What great topics...thankfulness, trading card <br>
WOM's...and dancin' elfs!<br>
<br>
We are thankful for all the wonderful, creative and fun people we have met over the years <br>
via letterboxing...not to mention that we can't plan a vacation without first checking out <br>
the letterboxing opportunities that will treat us with a totally different feel of a place than <br>
the typical tourist stops!<br>
<br>
As for the dancin' elfs... "Dancing with the Stars" contestants have nothing on us!  I think <br>
Azobox has some definite talent!<br>
Tiptoe...and Tonto<br>
