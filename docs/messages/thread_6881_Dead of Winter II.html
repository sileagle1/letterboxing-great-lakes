Weather was very good - sunny, 20s and not much wind which was good for the outdoor boxes w/the subtle clues.  We also had fun looking for the clued indoor boxes.<br>

The highlight was reconnecting w/so many long-time LB friends and the opportunity to do a few new exchanges.  We were also very pleased to meet the contented Atomic "beanie baby" at her very first event.  Not even 3 months old yet, but she has plenty of boxes in her find count, jumping into the fun when she was only 2 weeks old!<br>

Thanks to gggHiker for hosting another fun event!<br>

Great day today! Had a very nice time at another laid back "Dead of Winter" <br>
