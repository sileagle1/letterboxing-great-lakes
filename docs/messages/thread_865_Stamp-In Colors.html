Rather than using a stamp pad when I stamp-in with my personal stamp <br/>
I use brush markers because it's a two-color stamp.  I'm regretting <br/>
that I designed it that way because it takes so long.  I could use <br/>
only one color, but it wouldn't look as good.  I'm not even close to <br/>
F100 yet, so I guess I'll think about that later...  (Scarlett O'Hara <br/>
moment).<br/>

&gt; I have been consistently using a rainbow purple, blue and pink ink <br/>
for my first 100 stamp-<br/>
&gt; ins.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I bought a new rainbow replacement since the colors are starting to <br/>
take on more of blue <br/>
&gt; shade.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just interested in knowing ... do most of you stick with the same <br/>
color every time?  Do you <br/>
&gt; vary it?  I was thinking I might change color schemes every 100 <br/>
letterboxes? Well, now I <br/>
&gt; guess I should say, every 101 letterboxes.<br/>

I'm with you on that one, Timbertoes.<br/>
<br/>
Making my sig stamp a 3-color design seemed<br/>
like such a good idea at the time. I can tell you<br/>
that about 5 exchanges into the last gathering,<br/>
I was beginning to rethink that. :-)<br/>
