Rather than using a stamp pad when I stamp-in with my personal stamp <br>
I use brush markers because it's a two-color stamp.  I'm regretting <br>
that I designed it that way because it takes so long.  I could use <br>
only one color, but it wouldn't look as good.  I'm not even close to <br>
F100 yet, so I guess I'll think about that later...  (Scarlett O'Hara <br>
moment).<br>

I'm with you on that one, Timbertoes.<br>
<br>
Making my sig stamp a 3-color design seemed<br>
like such a good idea at the time. I can tell you<br>
that about 5 exchanges into the last gathering,<br>
I was beginning to rethink that. :-)<br>
