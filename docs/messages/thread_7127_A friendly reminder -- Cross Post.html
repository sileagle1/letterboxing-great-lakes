                    <div class="plaintext-content">I checked on the next to last Oz box today. It had been under water for better part of the past few months with all the flooding of the Mississippi.<br/>
<br/>
With all the Oz boxes I created I had 3 ziplocks -- one for the logbook, one for the stamp and then a heavy duty freezer double sealed ziplock to place both the logbook &amp; stamp in their respective bags into.<br/>
<br/>
I was happy to see the box was still there and had not floated off -- thanks for keeping the rock ontop of it. It had a thin layer of river mud on it making it hard to find.<br/>
<br/>
I opened it up and a gush of water came out -- not unexpected.<br/>
<br/>
The logbook was in its baggy . . .  the stamp was in its baggy -- and the freezer bag was in there too -- empty.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp was still dry, but the logbook soaked through. I just spent some quality time with a hairdryer trying to get it dry again. It will survive, though only one signature stamp is still visable -- all the writing from the other finders is visible, just not their sig stamps.<br/>
<br/>
All this to say, wether it's the Oz Series or any other letterbox out there. PLEASE place everything back in the box sealed as well or better than you found it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Also a good time to remind everyone that if you leave a HH in a box, you should be sure to stamp that box image in the HH log.  We've found several HH's recently where the HH wasn't stamped into to box's log and the box stamp wasn't stamped into the HH's log.<br/>
<br/>
It's fine to ignore HH's if you don't like them, but if you DO stamp your own signature stamps in, please also make sure the appropriate box/HH stamps are also recorded.  <br/>
<br/>
A HH should have a record not only of who found the HH, but all the boxes it has visited.<br/>
