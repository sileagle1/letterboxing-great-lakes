We found the "Hamms Waldo Pub Second Street" stamp while letterboxing at Pike Lake last weekend, but there wasn't a log book with it.  I looked on the LbNA site to see if I could contact the placer, but I can't find it's listing.  Before moving it on, I wanted to see if the placer wanted me to replace the log book.<br>
<br>
Let me know.  I'll keep it safe & sound and if I don't hear anything, I'll move it on the way I found it :)<br>

letterboxing hitchhiker list; possibly someone there knows about it.  I <br>
didn't know about that list before I made a new log book and sent it and <br>
the hitchhiker along on its journeys.<br>
