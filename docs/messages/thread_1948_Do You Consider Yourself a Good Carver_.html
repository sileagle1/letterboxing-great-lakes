are good carvers and would be interested in contributing a stamp to a <br/>
Great Lakes Regional Showcase Traveling Event Box (that's a mouthful).<br/>
<br/>
Back up...  you may be aware that there is a new Yahoo! group for <br/>
Traveling Event Stamps -- people who are organizing events can go <br/>
here and requests traveling boxes for their event and letterboxers <br/>
who have made up traveling boxes can list their box here.  The group <br/>
organizer (She Who Plants) acts as the middle man between the carvers <br/>
and the event organizers to get traveling boxes out and around the <br/>
country.  As part of her effort to showcase the carving skills of <br/>
various letterboxers across the country, she is putting together <br/>
regional stamp packages done by carvers from within each of the <br/>
regional areas.  These packages will then be sent to various events <br/>
across the country.<br/>
<br/>
We have so many wonderful carvers in this group that I am not <br/>
comfortable just picking certain people, not to mention I am not <br/>
personally familiar with the carving of every person here.  There is <br/>
also the possibility that somebody who is a wonderful carver may not <br/>
be interested in participating in this project.<br/>
<br/>
So, rather than me just choosing people, I thought I would ask for <br/>
volunteers who are interested in submitting a stamp for this <br/>
project.  How good does your carving have to be?  Well, in my <br/>
opinion, every carving is a worthy carving, so as long as you are <br/>
comfortable with the fact that your stamp will be making the rounds <br/>
to various events across the country, your carving is good enough.  <br/>
She is looking for 8-12 people to participate, hopefully representing <br/>
all of the states in our region.  If there are more people than that <br/>
interested, I will ask if we can have additional, otherwise it will <br/>
need to be limited to the first 12 who respond.  I do not have <br/>
details as to theme or anything like that yet.<br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail me privately if you are interested in being part of <br/>
this project.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
