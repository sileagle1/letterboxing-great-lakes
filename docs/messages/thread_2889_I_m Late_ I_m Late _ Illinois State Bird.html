that have been sitting in our house.<br>
<br>
"I'm Late! I'm Late!!" finally has its permanent home after <br>
returning from the Great Lakes Gathering.<br>
<br>
We also planted another box called "Illinois State Bird, Cardinal".  <br>
We had listed this box on LbNA earlier with no clues as we were <br>
awaiting its return from Spokane, Washington.  This box is now happy <br>
in its new permanent home.<br>
<br>
Since LbNA is down, we've put Word Documents in the files section on <br>
this list.  (We know that not everyone can open these files, but <br>
it's the best we can do.  If your computer won't open the clue file <br>
on this site, check Atlas Quest, they'll both be listed on AQ later <br>
this evening.)<br>
<br>
We also updated our clue file on this site for "I Heart Haring" <br>
since our updated clues on LbNA can't be accessed right now.<br>
<br>
We have another box to plant tomorrow and we will also be replacing <br>
the last box for Sternennacht and the last box for Vive Montmartre.<br>
<br>
Happy Boxing,<br>
