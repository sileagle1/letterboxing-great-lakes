<br>
I use white Speedy Cut and I love it!  Admittedly the only other <br>
medium I have tried is MasterCarve... but I like Speedy Cut a lot <br>
better.  The infamous Speedy Cut "white stuff" is what they carry at <br>
my local hobby store.  I made my personal stamper (Mk II -- Mk I was <br>
made with MasterCarve and I later decided it wasn't "good enough" so I <br>
did it over) with it.  I was surprised to discover everyone hates <br>
Speedy Cut.  My suspicion is that I'm just not a good enough carver to <br>
know when I'm using bad media!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although I can't say that I love speedy cut, I don't think it's really<br>
all that bad either.  All of my larger stamps are speedy cut.  It<br>
isn't as durable as some other media (erasers) and therefore better<br>
for some applications than others.  Both of the signature stamps I've<br>
made are speedy cut and although mine, which is a negative carving, is<br>
doing ok (all those scratches and gouges it aquired before I got a tin<br>
to carry my stamps in add character!) Aina's, which is a positive<br>
carving, needs to be recarved soon as several parts of it have broken<br>
off.  Honestly, I've been really into erasers lately.  I got a bunch<br>
of cheap pink erasers from the dollar store and I am very much<br>
enamored with them.<br>
