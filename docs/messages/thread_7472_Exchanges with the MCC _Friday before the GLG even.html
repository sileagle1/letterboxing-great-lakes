I hope we can make it Friday evening, but I fear I have overestimated our ability to get everything done.  Our 25th Anniversary is next Wednesday.  No plans that day, but we may spend Thursday night in Indianapolis.  That would give us about a 2-hour jump on Friday morning.  I thought we'd go through Chicago and Milwaukee and only attempt 2 box locations; the first being on the former Zenith Electronics property (my first real job).  The second stop must be for some Triangles.  Depending on orange barrels and my math abilities, we hope to find time to visit the Duluth Trading Company too.  And now I see there are trolls there too!  Dinner at Hooterville Inn before coming into the park?<br/>
<br/>
I am already starting to pack up.  Can't wait!<br/>
