                    <div class="plaintext-content">I first heard about letterboxing on NPR, I'm pretty sure it was on the <br>
Sunday morning show.  They were talking to someone who had found a <br>
letterbox on the Mall in Washington, and I remember being shocked that <br>
something like that could be someplace that would be that security <br>
minded!  It took me quite awhile to try letterboxing because I had <br>
heard that you were supposed to have a homemade stamp, and my artistic <br>
abilities are fairly minimal.  I really wanted to try it and kept <br>
thinking about it, but was stopped for want of a stamp!  I finally <br>
found someone who made my stamp for me, and that started me off and <br>
running.  (I just searched on NPR's website and the story I heard was <br>
April 10, 2004 and I started letterboxing August of 2005.  An entire <br>
year and a half that I missed for want of a stamp!)<br>
The clues update:  I've made a couple minor changes to my clues for <br>
Channel Cat and Bald Eagle Days.  The directions to the boxes are <br>
unchanged, I corrected a typo on one of the highways to the park on <br>
Channel Cat and clarified info on Cassville on Bald Eagle Days.  There <br>
is a Town Pump restaurant that I mentioned and people had stopped at <br>
the Town Pump gas station.  They must have thought that I was out of my <br>
mind recommending the sandwiches there!  The gas station does have soft <br>
serve ice cream, so that probably added to the confusion.<br>
