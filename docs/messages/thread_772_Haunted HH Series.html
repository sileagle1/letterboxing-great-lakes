Some of you may have caught the earlier message referencing the <br>
Haunted HH Series.  I deleted the message -- let me explain...<br>
<br>
The Haunted HH Series is a series of 10 Halloween-themed HH that I <br>
have planted and/or sent to other parts of the country to be planted <br>
in boxes there.<br>
<br>
The log book of each HH contains a URL specific to that HH.  Each <br>
URL provides a clue.  Together all 10 clues will lead you to the <br>
Haunted House Letterbox, which is an unposted permanently planted <br>
letterbox.<br>
<br>
You may be thinking -- what are the chances that I'll find all 10 HH <br>
to get all 10 clues?  While this is probably unlikely, especially <br>
given the vanishing nature of HH, I would think that it would be <br>
possible to figure out the Haunted House letterbox without actually <br>
having all 10 clues, just a little more trial and error involved.<br>
<br>
While I cannot control what people do privately as far as sharing <br>
clues with one another any more than I can control group <br>
collaboration on mystery boxes, I do ask that the URL's specific to <br>
each Haunted HH not be posted to any public forum.  Also, feel free <br>
to trade HH with other boxes if they have one you are looking for.  <br>
Posting your HH finds to the letterbox travellers talklist will help <br>
people to know where these little goblins have recently been spotted.<br>
<br>
The first couple of Haunted HH were found yesterday at the Sweetest <br>
Day mini-meet and the others are on the way to their destinations.  <br>
The clues are not available at the URL's provided in the log books <br>
until October 31.  So if you were the lucky finder of one of these <br>
HH yesterday, write the URL down and move the HH along for somebody <br>
else to find.<br>

Please accept my public appology.  I have made a serious error, and <br>
I feel terrible.  The worst part it, that the rules were right in <br>
front of me, and I neglected to read ALL of them.  Again, I am <br>
terribly sorry.  It won't happen again, of that you can be sure.<br>
