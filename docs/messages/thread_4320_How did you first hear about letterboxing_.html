I saw it listed under performing arts, I believe, and I was curious as to what was "new" at the Ren Fair.  To my shock, it wasn't new!! LOL  From there, I read about it on the Letterboxing.org and AQ sites, and then, told my parents about it, and next thing we knew, we were out on the trail with 5 kids in tow at the time, looking for our 1st box!  Luckily on our first adventure out, we ran into the Wormy Wanderers, and they also showed us how to hide the box, and what to do on the trails.  We've had so much fun ever since.  I think my mom is an addict though....she has to find at least 2 or 3 a week or she goes through withdrawals.  LOL =)  <br>
