                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found some stuff at a Dollar Tree store which is working great for me (and<br/>
of course the price is right).  It is called Fix All Adhesive and is made by<br/>
the Super Glue Corporation.  It must be some sort of contact cement, because<br/>
it utilizes the same dry-first step SpringChick described.  It says use a<br/>
thin coat on each piece and let dry for 10 minutes, with maximum strength<br/>
achieved after 24 hours.  For stronger bonding they say apply a thicker coat<br/>
and let dry for 30 minutes.   (I gently take my embossing gun to it to speed<br/>
it up a little.  No, I don't inhale the fumes!!)<br/>

I've been mounting my stamps with thin basswood.  It gives it just a little<br/>
extra body without adding too much bulk or weight.  I seal the wood with<br/>
clear nail polish, just because I'm usually working on stuff in the wee<br/>
hours and it's a lot easier to just use it than deal with spraying stuff<br/>
outside.  An alternate mounting method I use utilizes this self-adhesive<br/>
cardstock I get at work.  I apply several layers and trim close.  Works<br/>
well. <br/>
