in full swing, there is bound to be more chatter at the Yahoo! list.  <br>
Just a friendly reminder to try and keep your posts on topic as related <br>
to letterboxing -- reports, clues, questions, observations, ideas, <br>
thoughts, etc. that would be of interest to the general letterboxing <br>
community.  During the winter months, we tend to relax this a little as <br>
we try to stay in contact with one another while passing the long days <br>
of winter, but once our minds turn to letterboxing again, it is <br>
appreciated if the conversation at this list follows.  Thanks!<br>
