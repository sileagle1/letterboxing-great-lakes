We were a bit disappointed that no one had stamped into the cooties <br>
in the "traditional" manner - using thumb print art (oftentimes <br>
related to your trailname).  Here's one "offical" definition of a <br>
cootie:<br>
<br>
"A small letterbox that is passed surreptitously from letterboxer to <br>
letterboxer. As created by Pandora and Camp Fire Lady, cooties <br>
originally began as an activity for kids at letterboxing gatherings, <br>
in which kids recorded their thumbprints in a cootie and secretly <br>
passed it along to another child or adult. Cooties have evolved into <br>
a very small letterbox that can be hidden in a pocket or backpack of <br>
another letterboxer, and thus travel from individual to individual."<br>
<br>
I just posted some examples of thumbprint art that show how they can <br>
be very simple, or as elaborate as you'd like.  It's fun to see the <br>
art as a change of pace from the normal sig stamps, so please <br>
consider using thumb art on any cooties that may be in your <br>
possession!<br>

Thanks for reminding us about the 'traditional' cooties.  I do recall that cootie logbooks were for inky fingers only.  But somehow, things evolved and we started carving tiny stamps for those mini-logbooks, and we got away from those cute thumb prints. Some logbooks tell you - Thumb Prints Only.  We're generally pretty good when it comes to instructions.  So now we know who started and promoted cooties at gatherings.  <br>
 <br>
I went home from SILO #3 with only two cooties:<br>
 <br>
1. TOKIDOKI #3 by Clio Mouse (all thumb prints too)<br>
2. PI by Orion At Emerson<br>
 <br>
But that's not to say that I won't find another one in my jacket lining a couple weeks from now.  Hmmm....what is that lump in my jacket?  <br>
 <br>
I have to laugh when I see cooties being tossed and flying through the air, or suddenly see them clipped and dangling from clothes.  <br>
 <br>
Warning:  Anti Cootie Spray doesn't work!  But it is sold in tasty spray flavors.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You're lucky then.  I came home with SIX cooties, having only gotten <br>
rid of one at the actual gathering (sorry WH, I stuck you with the <br>
Cheers one).  I was rather amused by someone running after another <br>
trying to give BACK a cootie.  <br>
<br>
Sunday was such a great day. Another shout out to the organizers!<br>
 A gathering with such energetic people is always a treat and I still <br>
have marker on my hands that's refusing to come off just yet. I'm <br>
just slightly vexed that I wasn't able to get to all of the boxes <br>
available, event as well as travelers.  And there are more of you <br>
that were there and I don't have exchanges for and I want them.  So <br>
be sure that I'll be doing my darndest (is that even a word) to get <br>
to more gatherings than just next year (which hopefully I'll be able <br>
to make considering there's a possibility of getting a job out in <br>
ND). As Super J and I were leaving, the SILO staff were talking about <br>
us as well as the hobby atthe welcome desk which we thought was <br>
pretty cool.  And finally, as for next year's theme, we could also do <br>
it around presidents as Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays are in <br>
February and schools get a day off of classes in honor of that.<br>
