I was in another town yesterday and I went to Hobby Lobby to get some<br>
logbook making supplies.  One of the clerks asked me if I needed help.  I<br>
said I was looking for a number of things and that I hadn't been able to<br>
find carving medium for quite a while in Indy.  She said the store was in<br>
the middle of reorganizing and she found some in a bushel basket on top of<br>
the shelves in the painting supplies area.  Who would have known?  Even<br>
though I just purchased 3 pieces of PZKut last week, I picked up on of the<br>
thick pieces of master-carve at 40% off.  They had at least one more and a<br>
couple of large pieces of pink stuff.  She said she would place another<br>
order for either as I needed it.<br>
<br>
If you want my mastercarve or want me to go and get the rest of their<br>
supply, let me know.  If the weather is nice on Saturday I will be back in<br>
that town.<br>

I did think maybe they were just out of if (when Scheherezade was busy carving up a storm), but as it has not been restocked I think it's a safe assumption that they have stopped carrying it all together.  I have not asked anyone there about it as I prefer PZKut and Staedler erasers, both of which I purchase online.<br>
