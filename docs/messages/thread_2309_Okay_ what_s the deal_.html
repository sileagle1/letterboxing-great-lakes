I was in another town yesterday and I went to Hobby Lobby to get some<br/>
logbook making supplies.  One of the clerks asked me if I needed help.  I<br/>
said I was looking for a number of things and that I hadn't been able to<br/>
find carving medium for quite a while in Indy.  She said the store was in<br/>
the middle of reorganizing and she found some in a bushel basket on top of<br/>
the shelves in the painting supplies area.  Who would have known?  Even<br/>
though I just purchased 3 pieces of PZKut last week, I picked up on of the<br/>
thick pieces of master-carve at 40% off.  They had at least one more and a<br/>
couple of large pieces of pink stuff.  She said she would place another<br/>
order for either as I needed it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want my mastercarve or want me to go and get the rest of their<br/>
supply, let me know.  If the weather is nice on Saturday I will be back in<br/>
that town.<br/>

I did think maybe they were just out of if (when Scheherezade was busy carving up a storm), but as it has not been restocked I think it's a safe assumption that they have stopped carrying it all together.  I have not asked anyone there about it as I prefer PZKut and Staedler erasers, both of which I purchase online.<br/>

&gt; I was just going to say this - plus, the Hobby<br/>
&gt; Lobby's near me have stopped <br/>
&gt; carrying it altogether (SW MI).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some Michael's to have it - in the artist<br/>
&gt; supply...by the Sharpie markers - <br/>
&gt; I teach knitting at the Holland Michaels (they don't<br/>
&gt; carry it) and NON of <br/>
&gt; the workers there know what the pink stuff is! <br/>
&gt; (dumb!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Check the Michael's in the next town...if you are<br/>
&gt; able.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, what's the deal? I went into Hobby Lobby<br/>
&gt; and Michael's today<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and could not find the carving medium anywhere.<br/>
&gt; When I asked the<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clerks about it, they said that they had never<br/>
&gt; even heard of it, nor<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; knew if they still carried it. Anyone that can<br/>
&gt; help me out on where<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this stuff would be located in these stores, can<br/>
&gt; you please help a man<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
