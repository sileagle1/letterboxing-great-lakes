<br>
I have been letter boxing since 2006.  But, I do not know much about letterboxing culture or language.  (I just love to be stealthy and feel like I got away with something.)  <br>
<br>
In 2009 I came across a non-traditional subway series in Toronto Ontario.  The stamps were not contained in a box nor a book.  These stamps had magnets attached to them and were hidden on metal objects in high traffic areas.  Are they considered microboxes? Is there a name for this kind of stamp?  <br>
<br>
Also, I do like carving stamps.  I would like to create a series similar to this in Madison, WI.  I feel like this would work in more muggle-infested areas.  However, I do know some folks get bummed out when a traditional box is not used.  I also would miss reading the logbook.  However, I think fun could be had by all.  Do you think there would be interest for these type of stamps here in Wisconsin?<br>

<br>
If there isn't any logbook at all, they are just stamps, not letterboxes.<br>
However some people might still enjoy finding them.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We personally don't like letterboxing in "high traffic areas" and prefer to<br>
find boxes in more secluded spots.  Hopefully you'll consider putting some<br>
of your carvings out on a trail sometime since we are in Madison/Middleton<br>
quite often and would love to hunt for them.<br>

I agree with archeofrog that you may have to re-plant often.  Some people like to have logbooks with each stamp, so be sure to include information in your clues that a logbook is/is not included.<br>
<br>
There are so many different ways to letterbox.  <br>
Not all letterboxes are for everyone.<br>

notebooks/stamps in hide-a-keys.  Unfortunately, they didn't last very <br>
long (oddly some of the newspaper bins we hid them in got replaced more <br>
often than we had previously noticed!).  While I was excited to plant <br>
them in the locations (given the otherwise difficulty finding an <br>
appropriate place), I'm not sure if we'd do it again unless the spot was <br>
perfect.  Even though some of these had been our boxes, and we were <br>
familiar with the area, it always felt odd to get them in such <br>
high-traffic areas.  But that's just us...I know some people really <br>
enjoy that aspect of urban boxes.<br>
