                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all --- just writing to let you know that I've pulled the 2 boxes I had in the Hudsonville Nature Center and have retired them.<br/>
<br/>
They have been in place since 2005, and since I have a totally sweet new series, I thought I'd plant them there.  (Stayed tuned for those clues)<br/>
<br/>
"They" being "K1P2" and "Teacher's Helper".<br/>
"K1P2" just couldn't be found, and when I went to find it yesterday, the trails have REALLY changed, so I deeply appologize to everyone who had such a hard time finding that box -- how lame of me.  <br/>
<br/>
"Teachers Helper", on the other hand, had a very full logbook.  On one page it said "Stamp missing" and then 2 finds later, there was a note about the neat stamp.  So, whoever it was the took the stamp and then replaced it -- THANK YOU!!!  I can't begin to tell you how many people mentioned that this was their first find.  How stinkin' cool!!!<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, thanks again... and stay tuned for the cool new series coming up in September!<br/>
