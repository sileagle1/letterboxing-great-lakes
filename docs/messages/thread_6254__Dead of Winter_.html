(As I've found to my sorrow.)  Anyone planting a box for the event should be sure to take it home with them when the event is over.<br/>

Wow, it sounds like I missed quite a bit after I left.  Gender misidentification? Alarms?  Thankfully (?) I was there to witness the chicken dance...those comments would REALLY have set me to wondering.  All this after spending a considerable amount of time convincing Sara how nice and normal letterboxers are.....good thing (I think) she was there to witness this herself.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Chris...Toni is going to return the Bakery to me at SILO so you'll have an opportunity to stamp it. (Luckily already being of the rubber persuasion it won't go stale by then...and the bread won't get moldy!)<br/>
<br/>
After I left I headed off for dinner with some HS friends who live in Rockford, but first stopped by at the Goose Barn.  Fortunately for my wallet, they were just about to close (I had phoned ahead with my replacement marker needs so they'd be ready).  There was a 30% off sale on everything in the place.  Ohhhh...that would have been dangerous!  But I did have time to nab Shutterfly's letterbox there (lots of history in that logbook, since it was placed in 2005) and exchange with Dumpster Diva.  While inking I told her and her employees about the fun we had at DoW, and also mentioned the upcoming SILO.  My suspicions are that we may have some guests from Rockford in attendance that day.  (I feel like a Letterboxing Missionary!)<br/>
<br/>
Last, thank you all, especially GGG/Toni, for a wonderful day.  After being stuck at home for the past week and a half, it was not only great to be out amongst friends, but also to be back behind the wheel and wearing my hiking boots (even if I didn't venture out to hike much beyond finding the "Hidden in Plain Sight" box!).<br/>
