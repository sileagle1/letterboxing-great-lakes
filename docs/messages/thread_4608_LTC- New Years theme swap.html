<br>
I like the idea of trading a LTC face-to-face.  Then, the 'calling cards' become a record of a personal exchange of which The REAL creators of these artsy cards, those Dartmoor folks from Ye Old Victorian times, (LOL) would certainly approve of that method.    Also, I think the idea of placing a LTC in a box as a bonus find might be a creative way to link the cards to letterboxing.  Just my 2 cents.   <br>
