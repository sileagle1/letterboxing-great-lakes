Martini Man and I were just talking about how there seemed to be very few OH<br/>
and IN people on the list.  We haven't done any boxing in OH yet, and I<br/>
think have only found 1 box in Indiana on our way to MI, but we did find<br/>
several of the boxes you placed in TX.  Great carvings!<br/>
<br/>
We also have your F100 and F500 milestone stamps in our logbooks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are right about the number of boxers in Indiana on the list.  Seems<br/>
we've lost a few good ones this past year ... I heard Trail Mail Junkie<br/>
moved to Michigan.  Armadillo Jo - busy, busy, busy???  We have some new<br/>
boxers in the state, but they are really new.  You will find a number of<br/>
Indiana and Ohio boxers at Atlas Quest.  Me, I'm just obsessed, and I<br/>
watch both groups.  Southwest Indiana is starting to get populated with<br/>
boxes, but I have yet to get down there to check them out.  Maybe when<br/>
it's cooler in the fall.<br/>
<br/>

PS - to anyone travelling across Indiana to Ohio ... Clear Lake will be<br/>
available at least until Labor Day.  It might be there through September,<br/>
but that depends on weather and how long the dock remains in the water.<br/>
