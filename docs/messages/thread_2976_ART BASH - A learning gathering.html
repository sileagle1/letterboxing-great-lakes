Hi all, <br>
 <br>
I just wanted to let you know I'm hosting an A.R.T. BASH! A <br>
gathering of artists on Sept. 23, 24 and 25. <br>
It will be held at a hotel very near the N. Ky airport near <br>
Cincinnati. <br>
 <br>
It will include classes taught by very talented instructors <br>
including:<br>
The Magic of Marbling By Pat K. Thomas<br>
It's In the Cards: Mixed Media ATCs By Nancy Curry<br>
Carving your own rubber stamps By Chris Puls (Scoutdogs)<br>
Sumi-e painting By Patricia Wiley Shafer<br>
Cigar box checkers set By Sarah Hodsdon<br>
DEMO- Ruffled Plastic Jewelry By Wanda Hentges<br>
The Amazing Wizard By Cindy Cade<br>
 <br>
It will also include lots of socialization time to learn from each <br>
other and share/enjoy each other's art. All levels of artists are <br>
welcome! People new to the creating addition are encouraged to come <br>
learn! Due to the size of the room, this event will be limited to <br>
only 20 people. All the forms you need as well as lots <br>
of additional info can be found at this link:<br>

new things, meet new friends and develop your skills!<br>

Martini Man and I were just talking about how there seemed to be very few OH<br>
and IN people on the list.  We haven't done any boxing in OH yet, and I<br>
think have only found 1 box in Indiana on our way to MI, but we did find<br>
several of the boxes you placed in TX.  Great carvings!<br>
<br>
We also have your F100 and F500 milestone stamps in our logbooks.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are right about the number of boxers in Indiana on the list.  Seems<br>
we've lost a few good ones this past year ... I heard Trail Mail Junkie<br>
moved to Michigan.  Armadillo Jo - busy, busy, busy???  We have some new<br>
boxers in the state, but they are really new.  You will find a number of<br>
Indiana and Ohio boxers at Atlas Quest.  Me, I'm just obsessed, and I<br>
watch both groups.  Southwest Indiana is starting to get populated with<br>
boxes, but I have yet to get down there to check them out.  Maybe when<br>
it's cooler in the fall.<br>

PS - to anyone travelling across Indiana to Ohio ... Clear Lake will be<br>
available at least until Labor Day.  It might be there through September,<br>
but that depends on weather and how long the dock remains in the water.<br>
