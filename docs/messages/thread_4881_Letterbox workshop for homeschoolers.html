                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have again been asked to host a workshop on Letterboxing for the<br>
WPA's homeschooling conference May 3rd. Last year was the first year I<br>
hosted this workshop and to my surprise over 70 people attended to<br>
learn more about Letterboxing. I wasn't expecting this many people,<br>
and I had wished I would have planted more boxes that day. We had only<br>
planted 12 temporary boxes for the duration of the conference. <br>
<br>
This year I'd like to go bigger and better by planting permanent boxes<br>
in the Oshkosh area, but I don't know if I should plant boxes I won't<br>
be able to tend to more than once a year. <br>
<br>
What is the ethical thing to do here? How often do you check up on<br>
your boxes? Maybe I'm just a Letterbox mom who has trouble letting my<br>
babies go! :) <br>
<br>
Most Letterboxers I know will give TLC to boxes they find in need of<br>
repair so I'm leaning towards going ahead with the permanent plant. <br>
<br>
(Also if anyone wants to donate boxes, I will plant them for you in<br>
the Oshkosh area this April.)<br>
<br>
Thanks for any feedback you can offer me!<br>
