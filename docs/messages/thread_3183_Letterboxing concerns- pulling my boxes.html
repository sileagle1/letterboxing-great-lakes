                    <div class="plaintext-content">Because my schedule has not allowed me to do the maintenance on my boxes <br>
that they require and because they have been out since 2003 (the ones that <br>
haven't gone missing) and because of all the new, careless letterboxers out <br>
and about... I have been pulling my boxes as I get the chance.<br>
<br>
As much as I enjoyed finding boxes in the wild, my knees have gotten to the <br>
point that I just can't do it without hurting the day of the hike and for a <br>
day or two afterwards. :-(<br>
<br>
All of mine have been drive ups or short hikes with easy clues, because <br>
that's what I like to find and what my knees could handle, but that leaves <br>
them vulnerable to the "one find wonders" as someone called them.<br>
<br>
I have already pulled all the Franklin Co. Park boxes (which aren't <br>
available during the winter anyway) and most of the Miami Whitewater boxes. <br>
I'll be getting the rest really soon before it gets too cold, since that <br>
makes it even harder for me to get out and about.<br>
<br>
I'll be pulling Metamora and Harrison boxes next.  Good news for those that <br>
still want to find my boxes is that I can't get to TX and MI any time soon, <br>
so those will be out for some time (if they don't go missing) unless someone <br>
is willing to pick them up and send them to me.<br>
<br>
I'm still involved in letterboxing through postal boxing and I enjoy using <br>
my stamps to create art that I send out to other stamp artists in swaps and <br>
at random through several different stamp related groups like the Carving <br>
Consortium and Artsist of the Round Table.  So my stamps get used and <br>
enjoyed, just in a different way.  I'll also still be willing to send stamps <br>
to be placed for gatherings if I have time to carve.<br>
<br>
I have enjoyed meeting so many great people, seeing such beautiful and <br>
interesting places and enjoying the solitude of walking in the woods by <br>
myself.  I will miss that very much, but will still attend gatherings when I <br>
can and I'll have a few event boxes floating around.  I thank everyone that <br>
has hidden a box for me to find, hosted a gathering or sent me an email <br>
(about any topic.)  Letterboxing has brought a lot of joy to my life and I <br>
look forward to continuing that through postals.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to give everyone a heads up if you notice many of my boxes going <br>
into retirement.  If there are still some out that you are just dying to <br>
find, let me know if you can get to them quick and I'll put off retrieving <br>
them till you find them.<br>
