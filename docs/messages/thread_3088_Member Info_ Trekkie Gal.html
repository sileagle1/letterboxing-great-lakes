                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, I'm Trekkie Gal.  I heard about letterboxing from my co-worker, <br/>
Well Heeled, about a year and a half or so ago.  At the time, it <br/>
seemed like an interesting concept, but not something I was planning <br/>
on starting.  Since I am single and have no children, I didn't <br/>
really want to go tromping around the woods by myself.  Then in <br/>
June, Well Heeled told me about virtual letterboxing.  I immediately <br/>
like the concept because it involved trivia and sitting at my <br/>
computer, two things which I enjoy.  I signed up on Atlas Quest and <br/>
did about 25 virtuals in 2 days.  <br/>
<br/>
After a few weeks, Well Heeled took me to a park near our office to <br/>
find my first traditional box.  After that I got a little more <br/>
interested in the actual letterboxes, but I still didn't think I <br/>
would be any good at carving.  I have ZERO creative ability.  <br/>
Finally I did buy some carving materials and tools and used an <br/>
acetone transfer for the image.  It came out ok, and was <br/>
surprisingly easy to do.  Since then, I have planted 1 traditional <br/>
box and a hitchhiker, made a personal traveller, and am involved in <br/>
7 postal rings (my favorite aspect of letterboxing thus far).  I <br/>
have also found several more traditional boxes - a couple in urban <br/>
locations and a couple by tromping around in the woods...by <br/>
myself. :)<br/>
