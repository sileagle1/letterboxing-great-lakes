                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I didn't get out to find any boxes today.  Nor did I check on the box I thought I was going to check on (I wanted to make sure that Coal Miner's Daughter is still in place, since there's a good chance the recent weather has changed the trail significantly and/or washed the box down the ravine and into the pond).  But I did check on my Hands Off! box and I was glad I did.  Because part of the trail that the clues lead you down is on a flood plain and the river is way over it's banks I had to use an alternate route (and have updated the clues on LbNA...if anyone wants to find the box using this alternate route they will need to email me).  But what really surprised me was evidence of flooding around the box itself.  I doubt the area was under much water, but it's on a hill and it's obvious that water ran down that hill and over my box.  The box itself was full of water...but thankfully the last finder securely resealed the bags (even if she didn't double bag the<br>
 logbook) and the contents were only a tad damp.  I was very pleased.<br>
<br>
The dogs and I were a muddy mess by the time we were done!  It took two rounds of shampoo and I still didn't manage to get all the mud out of their fur!  Clearly, they enjoyed themselves immensely.  I on the other hand was wishing I had worn my winter boots.  It wasn't cold, but my winter boots are the only shoes I own that are really water proof and I HATE damp socks!  I can hardly wait for dryer weather (or maybe another freeze...like tomorrow's expected high of 12).<br>

I'm keeping my fingers crossed that you'll be able to use your hair dryer to save that damp logbook.  It's happened to me.  After I dried the pages, they curled a bit, so I used a dry iron to flatten the pages.  Some of the inked images washed away but the ink pen signatures remained.  I kept all the pages anyway.   <br>
<br>
All of this icy rain and heavy snow has me thinking about all the letterboxes that area hidden out there.  One night, the Chicago area had dangerous winds of 60 miles per hour +, and all I could think about were the boxes possibly being blown away.  There is no doubt that the first signs of Spring will mark the beginning of major box maintenance.  This extreme weather also has me reflecting on the importance of carefully finding a good hiding spot for my letterboxes, always.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The log book really wasn't that damp.  It's still useable, you can just feel a touch of moisture when you pick it up.  I went ahead and left it in the box.  I'll have to pull it later this spring because the location should be due for a burn this spring and I'll dry it out really well then.  That box doesn't see much traffic anyway and it's unlikely anyone will find it before I pull it for the spring burn.<br>
