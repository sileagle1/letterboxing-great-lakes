                    <div class="plaintext-content">I replaced the container for "Sweet Prairieland" box tonight (thanks to <br/>
Kiddie Writer for her status report alerting me to the fact that <br/>
critters were gnawing holes in it).  Luckily the contents were safe and <br/>
sound, although the deer flies and mosquitoes were fierce.<br/>
<br/>
We also relocated my "Playing Possum" box tonight and the revised clues <br/>
are posted on LBNA.  I was very excited to see a REAL possum as we <br/>
drove out of the park!  It stood on the road for a bit before it <br/>
scurried into the underbush, so we got a good look at it.<br/>

As a matter of fact, the rock wall and the decorative fence are also gone.  There is now some major construction work going on in the area.<br/>
