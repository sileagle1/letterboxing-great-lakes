<br>
We did see a couple of other families letterboxing throughout the day, and chatted briefly with one of them, but failed to do any actual exchanges.  Very fun day at the Faire, though, m'lords 'n ladies!  I see Dragon has planted a 10th box for the season, so there's even more encouragement for anyone who was thinking of going.<br>

replacing lost boxes and moving some.  The faire was simply to busy<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We searched for Dragon all day yesterday and came up empty, despite <br>
running into parents of one of his students. THEY had an awesome <br>
logbook.<br>
<br>
Wizard's Wardrobe was NOT to be found as of 6:30pm. Worse, the shop <br>
owner appears to find that her favorite spot to sit (a tall, leggy <br>
blond of 30-40ish years). I had to circle back six times and still <br>
came up empty.<br>
<br>
The Pig'n'Whistle pole is in the right place, but the bench had been <br>
confiscated and relocated about 15ft away. Without the bench, I <br>
couldn't tell where to search and so had to let that one go.<br>
<br>
As for security, they kept a good eye on me right up until I let them <br>
know I was on a treasure hunt. Apparently there were two other <br>
assorted hunt type activities in progress.  Five or six times I was <br>
studied, watched, approached, and then given the amused smile and left <br>
alone.  This was NOT while stamping in, but simply doing the visual up-<br>
and-down from the clues to locations. Maybe it was the way that made <br>
my hat bob :)<br>
<br>
The Spell of Incantrix was placed late. I actually got to be a first <br>
finder! Woo! Never did THAT before!!!<br>
<br>
The brother of Grainger says the clue needs serious updating. The new <br>
watchword is Lupin Hop. Never could catch him off stage.<br>
<br>
Barefoot Ankh is not in the shop listed. KissMeKate(according to her <br>
bf, a delightful gentleman in blue brocade)is apparently  all in <br>
chocolate fabrics this year, but walks faster than I can. We were <br>
*moments* behind her in four locations!<br>
<br>
One more comment: The clues to one box refer to a concrete cover. It <br>
is NOT. It's plaster. If you know the Faire, then you know that means <br>
it's also WET plaster. A fistful of towels would be well advised.<br>
<br>
The weather was perfect! 70 degrees, breezy, and dry! Talk about a <br>
great time at the Faire. Thanks, Dragon!<br>
