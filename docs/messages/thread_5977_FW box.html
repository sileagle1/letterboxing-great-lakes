We found your MRSA box in San Francisco area yesterday, but have no idea what MRSA stands for!  We suspect something to do w/your job since I think you were out here for a work conference earlier this year.  (We were the 2nd finders.)<br>

MRSA = Methicillin Resistant Stapholococcus Aureus (antibiotic resistant bacteria).  It is quite an issue in hospitals now, and is also showing up in the community in places like day care, locker rooms, etc.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">MRSA (pronounced mersa with the emphasis on the mer) is a really ugly staph infection that nobody wants to catch because it's resistant to anti-biotics and kicks their butts. Didn't it start out big in prisons and hospitals and now it's increasing rather frighteningly in the general population?  I work here and there with prisoners and it's a problem, particularly when it's so difficult in many prison systems for prisoners to have access to doctors.  <br>

I hate to ask what the stamp image looks like.  The box has to be a different MRSA than *that* MRSA.  Doesn't it? FW??? <br>
