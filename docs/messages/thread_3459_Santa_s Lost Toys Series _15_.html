There are 14 micro boxes containing lost toys stamps.  There is a 15th <br>
box containing a larger stamp for this series and the only logbook.  <br>
The clue has been updated and are active on Atlas Quest.  <br>
This is a popular series for parents and children to visit during the <br>
school winter break.  This series will remain in place until January <br>
30, 2007.  <br>

I went to Atlas Quest.com and searched under the name<br>
of the letterbox "santa's lost toys", but got the<br>
message "area search must be run from the area search<br>
page".   ????<br>
<br>
Can you tell a beginner how to find the clues for this<br>
particular quest?<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>
