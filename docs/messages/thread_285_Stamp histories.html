Ok, so I'm trying to log everything into my book, and I realized that I'm missing a couple of details.  If anyone could fill me in, it would be awesome:<br/>
<br/>
1) Who carved the beautiful "Cooler by the Lake" with the giant sunglasses?<br/>
<br/>
2) Where did that "Marilyn" roving event stamp come from?  Who carved it?<br/>
<br/>
3) Was the never ending story/HH Hostel yours, Dragon?  If not, whose?<br/>
<br/>
4) Who carved the "Opra-ha" stamp?<br/>
<br/>
and the most important:<br/>
<br/>
5) Just how many mosquito bites does one have to get before they're hospitalized?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; 1) Who carved the beautiful "Cooler by the Lake" with the giant <br/>
sunglasses?<br/>
<br/>
That was the event stamp carved by John ofLeapin' Lizards.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2) Where did that "Marilyn" roving event stamp come from?  Who <br/>
carved it?<br/>
<br/>
That was by Ledgermiane (sp?) who also did the KMarthas - well, at <br/>
least the original KMartha.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3) Was the never ending story/HH Hostel yours, Dragon?  If not, <br/>
whose?<br/>
<br/>
Yup, that was me!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 4) Who carved the "Opra-ha" stamp?<br/>
<br/>
Joker's Wyld?  That's the bexst I can tell. Not sure.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and the most important:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5) Just how many mosquito bites does one have to get before <br/>
they're hospitalized?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, I don't even think it counts for the purple heart box.  <br/>
Otherwise the PH Box could've been an event stamp!<br/>
