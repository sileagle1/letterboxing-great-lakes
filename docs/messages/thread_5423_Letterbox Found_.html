something that a letterbox can be thankful for - the return of a <br>
missing letterbox!!!  One of my boxes was reported missing by someone <br>
who had previously found it and was returning to the area with a new <br>
letterboxer.  So she knew where to look.  I replaced the box but not <br>
until after I scoured the area for the missing box.  Yep, it was no <br>
where to be found.  Today, I receive an email from another letterboxer <br>
that BOTH boxes are in that one location as of yesterday. I'm not sure <br>
what to make of this report, but I'm glad that the missing box has been <br>
found. <br>
Happy Thanksgiving to all from Beetle. <br>
