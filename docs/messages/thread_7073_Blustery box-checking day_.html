In looking through the logbooks, I had forgotten how Martini Man and Wisconsin Hiker had an uncanny ability to be first finders on all of our boxes!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for replanting the Retzer box - Mr. Peabody and I went out for it today.  Would've gone yesterday but it was hailing!  We were first finders - though I half expected MM and WH to be first finders on the re-hide.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Smelly Cat is definitely among the most memorable finds for me.  Excellent way to to hide a box, near an apropo(?) location.  And the title brings back memories, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for planting and re-planting!<br/>
