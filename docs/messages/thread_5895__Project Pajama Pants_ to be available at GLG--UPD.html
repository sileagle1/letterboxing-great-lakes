                    <div class="plaintext-content">FungusWoman has generously offered to give any donations from this <br>
letterbox of hers and any of your donations----to my son's unit rather <br>
than the IL group.  My son's unit is getting ready to deploy out of Fort <br>
Bragg NC with the 82nd Airborne.  They are a heavy field artillery unit <br>
and are front line combat soldiers that shoot the 105 and 155mm <br>
Howitzers. (The big cannon looking things that recoil after firing.)<br>
<br>
My son, Greg, is not deploying with them this time (which was not by <br>
choice---but by orders to become a recruiter in Rochester NY for 3 <br>
years.)  He would much rather be deploying with his guys but they all <br>
have to take their turn with a 3 year rotation doing something else <br>
before returning to a 4th deployment if they are career military.  These <br>
are his soldiers that are going this time without him and he is <br>
struggling with this---even though they are in good hands with the <br>
soldier who Greg recommended to become their leader---Sgt. Chris Hall.  <br>
I talked to Greg tonight to see if sending his unit these items was <br>
possible and it sounds like he is really grateful to know they are going <br>
to get the same kind of generous support he and his unit got when he was <br>
deployed---so mega thanks and blessing klk/fw for your generous offer. <br>
