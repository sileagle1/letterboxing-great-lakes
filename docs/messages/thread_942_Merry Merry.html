Hello all,<br/>
Christmas is almost here!  How exciting ~ do you all have your <br/>
shopping done.  I know I don't!  And I'm usually so up on all that <br/>
stuff!<br/>
<br/>

winter hours.  This is my first winter and I could use a few hints.<br/>
<br/>
I've been knitting, but to tell the truth, the sweater I'm working <br/>
on is fairly teadious and often bores me to tears!  Anyone want a <br/>
pair of socks??  That's my favorite thing to make!<br/>

Carve, carve, carve!  That is what I am hoping to do.  I'm way behind on<br/>
getting some stamps and boxes out.  I have 5 designs on "pink stuff" which<br/>
have traveled to several states with me this year (along with carving<br/>
tools), but for some reason the surface of the pink stuff has still not felt<br/>
the tip of the tools.  I thought I'd spend some evenings in a hotel carving,<br/>
but that only happened once.  Usually I'm crashing from a long day of work<br/>
or boxing, or planning boxing activities for the next day.  These "almost<br/>
stamps" should have the status of hitchhikers -  I think they've been in at<br/>
least 5 states!  Now I've also got lots of logbooks and those good<br/>
Rubbermaid containers just ready &amp; waiting for the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on catching up this winter since temperatures near zero do NOT<br/>
entice me to do much boxing.  But if it would get up into the teens......<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays everyone &amp; happy carving!<br/>

'boxers" too.  (We actually found out about<br/>
Letterboxing in fall of 2003, but didn't try to find<br/>
our first box until spring of '04).<br/>
<br/>
I'm with Wisconsin Hiker - the cold, cold temps keep<br/>
me from wanting to venture outside.  But since we're<br/>
over 50 finds, and our original signature stamp is<br/>
starting to wear, one of our winter ventures will be<br/>
to carve a new signature stamp.  It's designed, we<br/>
both approve of it, now just to decide which of us<br/>
will carve it and when.  We'll probably be symbolic<br/>
and start using it when we hit 100 finds.  I've also<br/>
got a few ideas for some new letterbox plants, so<br/>
working on designing those stamps and writing witty,<br/>
clever clues...and of course, since we are at over 50<br/>
finds, finally organizing all those photos we've taken<br/>
along the way should take me well into spring....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My first winter I carved and even did a fair bit of letterboxing -- I<br/>
actually love hiking in the snow, as long as it is not sub-zero and the wind<br/>
is not straight from the north.  I remember doing First Letterbox on the<br/>
Lake and the Birthday Box at Saugatuck Dunes in the winter.  One is<br/>
protected in the woods -- the other is exposed to the lake winds.  My<br/>
fingers were so cold I could barely do the stamping!  I also put together<br/>
the Moo-Mahh virtual letterbox series that winter.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I kind of took the winter off from letterboxing due to a lot of<br/>
other things going on at the time and I was really itching to get back at it<br/>
when spring rolled around.  As we are in the midst of remodeling parts of<br/>
the house and I have several art projects I am dying to spend some long<br/>
snowy winter weekends on, I will probably ease back again this winter, with<br/>
the exception of a really cool project that I and a fellow 'boxer are<br/>
working on for spring.<br/>

Here's wishing a very Merry Christmas to all you Great Lakes Letterboxers -- <br/>
may Santa bring you lots of carving goodies and rubbermaid.<br/>

odd sized containers I have.  If I get truly ambitious I will try a few<br/>
more different methods of binding logbooks.  I'm also hitting some urban<br/>
boxes and drive-by boxes that I probably wouldn't do in the nicer weather <br/>
because I'd rather be out hiking then.<br/>

Yep, I've been busy carving and have 3 regular boxes<br/>
and a 4 box series ready to plant so far. I've done<br/>
some drive by scouting for locations, but haven't been<br/>
out walking around much, especially since it has been<br/>
in the single digits a lot this week. I do miss the<br/>
hiking...I can feel my rear-end expand due to all of<br/>
the christmas cookies, meals, goodies, popcorn,<br/>
chocolate and other crap that people have placed on my<br/>
desk this week. I tried the whole letterboxing in the<br/>
snow thing over Thanksgiving and have decided<br/>
officially that it is completely for the birds! Even<br/>
though most of the boxes were drive by, freezing my<br/>
hands off stamping just isn't very fun. I'll wait till<br/>
spring!<br/>

This is also my first winter, although I found and placed my first <br/>
boxes last January. I don't think I was officially obsessed until <br/>
mid-Spring. I got some boxing in with speedsquare last Saturday and <br/>
when I woke up to the single digit temps on Sunday, I considered <br/>
myself lucky to have gotten my "fix" in when I did! I am also <br/>
planning to carve some stamps, especially to place Up North in <br/>
Michigan when I go on vacation again. I can't wait to check on <br/>
my "Fishing Mullet Lake" series in Topinabee as I haven't heard <br/>
anything about them, so I will probably be checking on them in <br/>
January while my husband and daughter go skiing one weekend. I've <br/>
also got to keep up my carving for the Indy area...we're on track to <br/>
being a real hot spot for letterboxes. Last January when I did my <br/>
first search, there wasn't a single box to be found in Marion <br/>
County, but now there's a huge base to choose from:)<br/>
