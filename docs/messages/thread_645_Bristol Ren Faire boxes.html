                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, this year's season is now over!  Sorry to have missed any people<br/>
that thought Sunday was the last day of the faire (today was).  I did<br/>
get to meet Laughing Panther and Kiss Me Kate.  In addition to Laghing<br/>
Panther, I have a few other workers at the faire interested in doing<br/>
it next year, so look for next year's installment of letterboxing at<br/>
the faire!<br/>
<br/>
It looks like lots of people had fun this year.  Sorry for the lost<br/>
Ale and Sassafras and the wet Turkey Legs box.  Apparently some<br/>
teenager boys ran off with the Knight of Swords stamp on Saturday too.<br/>
 If anyone knows anything about this, please contact me off list.  (I<br/>
have some suspicions....)<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

<br/>
I have gotten a late start on these boxes.  I am currently waiting for<br/>
permission to do these boxes again this year at Bristol and I expect<br/>
no problem getting permission.  Since the Faire opens on July 9th<br/>
(next Sat), I hope all the planning goes quickly...<br/>
<br/>
I am currently also in contact with a number of "letterpoeple" both<br/>
new and old to work out clues and details with them.<br/>
<br/>
If allowed, this year's letterboxes theme will be "The Shoppes of<br/>
Bristol".  For those of you that missed getting the Gamemaster stamp<br/>
in 2003 and/or the Ale and Sassafrass stamp in 2004 (as these went<br/>
missing) these will be placed this year in tribute to their respective<br/>
shoppes.    There will also be new boxes to find for other shoppe<br/>
themes.  The "Letterboxing BRF" box will also be available again this<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
The clue page will probably not be updated until the night before the<br/>
faire opens.  If you are planning to go to the faire on opening day,<br/>
let me know, so I can make a point of letting you know the clues are<br/>
ready.  I will also be a "letterperson" available on opening day at<br/>
least, if not other days.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.<br/>
