                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, the mini-meet sounds like it was a blast.  Too bad Katy and I couldn't make it.  But we had our own letterboxing adventures this weekend at Fort Harrison, IN.  Fortunately, we had beautiful weather on Sunday.  The sun was shining all day and the day was only a bit chilly because of the wind (although our wind was more like a breeze than what the mini-meet boxers had to deal with).  The only down side was that the trails were a bit busy.  <br/>
<br/>
First, we stopped off at Explorer Park (after much confusion about directions and turning around several times) for the box placed there by Jr. Girl Scout Troop #1744.  This stop turned out to be a lot more fun that first impressions suggested.  The stamp was really neat and gave us ideas for if we ever worked with the local Girl Scouts on letterboxing.  And it was our first hybrid box.<br/>
<br/>
Then it was off to Fort Harrison and the Fall Creek trail.  First we visited "Picnic in the Park."  Then we searched for "Papillon II" but and found an empty box.  We suspect that this box may have been re-hidden carelessly since we could see it easily from the trail.  When we re-placed the box, we put some peices of bark in front of it and it was no longer visible from a distance.  On to "Cicada Land."  This box was alive and well...and what a gorgeous location!  After finishing this trail, it was definately time for lunch, or so our stomachs said.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch, we went after the Lawrence trail boxes.  First we searched for the "Independance Day 2004" boxes (well, the one that wasn't listed as missing anyway).  Unfortunately, we believe we found the location but there was no box to be found.  Then off to "Crosscountry Crossroads."  There was a tree branch down on part of the trail that the clues lead to but we found the box with a little searching anyway.  At this point, we were starting to wonder if we were cursed. (the trails seemed clear as we were hiking but as soon as we found a box and attempted to log in, people would appear out of nowhere!  and this box was off the main trail too)  <br/>
<br/>
After finally stamping in, we backtracked to find the "More than corn" micro-box.  At some point, the logbook had been soaked, but a previous visitor had donated some paper and a baggie.  Again, we never saw a soul on the trail until we tried to recover the box and stamp in.  Oh well.  On to the "Morning Glory" micro-box.  Unfortunately this box was not in such good condition.  It's hiding spot was full of water and the box, having been chewed on by animals, was also flooded.  We dried off the stamp and donated some paper and a new plastic bag but all the stamps that were in the log book were ruined.  And, since we were getting tired of being interrupted, we carried this box deep into the woods.  Unfortunately, we somehow ended up right next to the horse trail and got yelled at for being "on" the horse trail.  After relocating deeper into the woods (and away from the horse trail), we STILL ran into people who were wandering around off-trail!<br/>
<br/>
By now, the afternoon was well progressed.  But since we were so close anyway, we decided to go after Artdog's Halloween-themed series.  We found the "Frankenstein Lives" box easily enough.  But even here we had to be very very careful because no sooner had we gotten out of the car then someone else pulled into the cemetary to visit the graves!  By now, I was sure we were cursed.  We had a little trouble finding the "Remains of the Day" box in part because of the other people and in part because we read the compass a bit differently than Artdog had.  We did, however, find a hidden grave marker that had been completely overgrown.  And our persistance paid off in the end.  We decided to retreat to the car to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we were off to Fortville and the Gravel Lawn Cemetary for the rest of Artdog's series.  We found both "All Hallow's Eve" and "I Want my Mummy" with no problems.  And this time we read our compasses correctly.  Plus, miracle of miracles, there was NO ONE ELSE at the cemetary!  The curse had been lifted!  Of course, it may just have been because it was dusk.  Then we set off on our 2 1/2 hour ride home.<br/>
<br/>
Our journeys also took us past one of the IN State Park Series mystery boxes, so we picked that one up to...bringing our total F-count to 11 boxes.<br/>

<br/>
Sure.  Here's the link to the clue page on letterboxing.org:  http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=11391&amp;boxname=Explorer_Park<br/>
<br/>
It really was a neat little box and a neat park too.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good thing you guys went to Ft. Harrison on<br/>
Sunday...there was a marathon around the park and the <br/>
entire city of Lawrence on Saturday...which is why we<br/>
didn't even try to get the Explorer box. Glad to hear<br/>
they added a stamp...I had heard that it was stampless<br/>
at first. As far as the Independence Day box is<br/>
concerned, it's a little bit tricky. I thought I was<br/>
in the right spot at first too, then tried further<br/>
back and found the right spot. <br/>
<br/>
We were in Indy on Saturday and were the first finders<br/>
for Heartland Film Festival box. Good thing I had my<br/>
tall friend Dave with me, as I would have never been<br/>
able to reach the hiding spot. We also went back to<br/>
Eagle Creek and found "Bird's Nest", which had eluded<br/>
me the first trip. We didn't see a soul on either<br/>
trip, mostly because it was bitterly cold and at the<br/>
crack of dawn. <br/>
<br/>
Then we froze ourselves watching the Boilers lose.<br/>
Waste of 4 hours...could have been letterboxing dang<br/>
it! At least we had the foresight to smuggle in some<br/>
Jimmy John's sandwiches into the stadium. It made all<br/>
of our pain go away. <br/>
<br/>
Sunday I headed solo to Ft. Custer near Battle Creek.<br/>
Found "Flutterby" and both Fort Custer boxes. Got<br/>
"Snap" of the Breakfast Elves, but then it got too<br/>
dark and I got too lost to find the other two.  I'll<br/>
have to make another trip, this time earlier in the<br/>
day. <br/>
<br/>
I keep dreaming about the sheer quantity of boxes in<br/>
the Connnersville, IN area....i'm heading there next<br/>
dang it!<br/>
