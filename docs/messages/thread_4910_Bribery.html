It's  true Spring Chick can't be bought; at least not with "just" fancy<br/>
papers.  Now she wants fibers too! lol.<br/>

Here's a link to the how-to for the technique.  But I don't like what Trish<br/>
made quite as much as what others in the group made.  If you're not a member<br/>
of Next-Generation-Stampers on yahoogroups, you might want to join if only<br/>
just to lurk and check out the photos section.  What some of the others have<br/>
done so far for the faux grass challenge (it's one of the "background<br/>
challenges") will be in the photos section of that yahoogroup.  Talk about<br/>
lookin' like real turf.<br/>
<br/>
I want to try it when the dandelions pop up here so that I can include<br/>
dandelion petals.<br/>
