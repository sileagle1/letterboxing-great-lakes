                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's been mentioned on various message boards over the years, but <br/>
today we saw more proof that there are a LOT of letterboxers who <br/>
aren't as "hard core" as those of us on this list.  These people <br/>
simply lookup some clues, find the box and go about the rest of their <br/>
lives.  They don't plant boxes, they don't log their finds on-line, <br/>
they don't participate in letterboxing boards, etc.  Who ARE all <br/>
these mystery letterboxers???<br/>
<br/>
What was the proof?  We checked on one of my boxes at Devil's Lake <br/>
State Park (Demon's Dwelling).  It's been in place for over 3 years.  <br/>
In that time I've received 10 notices or emails from people that have <br/>
found the box.  Imagine my surprise and amazement when we looked <br/>
through the logbook this afternoon and counted up 43 different <br/>
groups! Many of these groups appeared to be families and it was nice <br/>
to think about all these people hiking up the bluff and then <br/>
succesfully finding the box.  Most of these were stamps we had never <br/>
seen before, nor were we famililar with the trailnames.  Therefore we <br/>
consider them "mystery letterboxers".<br/>
<br/>
It was also great to find the box in near perfect condition.  All <br/>
baggies were sealed well and the box was completely dry inside.  The <br/>
olny thing we need to do is bring another logbook, since the first is <br/>
almost full!<br/>

P.S.  No one left any money in this box!<br/>

"Presidential Series: Ronald Reagan" near his childhood home. <br/>
<br/>
I too had 9 groups of people over the near 2 years its been there. Stopped  <br/>
on our way home from BoaF gathering and found the logbook 1/2 full . . .  <br/>
amazing!! I was thrilled.... just wished for some more progress notes -- I  thought <br/>
the box was missing for a time.<br/>
