still think of myself as a letterboxer, even though at this point it's<br>
probably been a year since I placed a box or looked for one other than<br>
one of my own.<br>
<br>
I started letterboxing in the summer of 2002 after my daughter found<br>
the LBNA link in a blog.  I live just outside Chicago (Oak Park, about<br>
to move to Forest Park) and have placed boxes around here, but am<br>
frustrated when they keep disappearing.  I've had better luck with my<br>
boxes in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where we spend most of our<br>
vacation time, and where I have a lot more time for carving and clues,<br>
not to mention eager nieces and nephews who area always looking for<br>
projects.  I also like to look for boxes on trips.  I'm going to<br>
Stockholm in March and one of the first things I did after I bought my<br>
tickets was to check whether there are any boxes there (unfortunately<br>
the answer is no, or, more precisely, not yet!).  <br>
<br>
I'm a terrible carver (and somewhat intimidated by the incredible<br>
artistry of many members of this group), but I love writing clues,<br>
expecially clues that tell a story.  I incorporated a lot of my<br>
father's family history into a bunch of boxes we placed on a family<br>
trip to Wyoming in the summer of 2003, and even though a couple of the<br>
six boxes have disappeared, I still hear often from people who've<br>
found them, including one recently who said they spent an extra day in<br>
the area after they found my clues!  <br>
<br>
I've been to one LbGLK meet (the first) and one micro-meet here. <br>
After we get settled in our new place next month I'm hoping to be able<br>
to do more boxing and join you all in person more.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for the topic, SpringChick!<br>
