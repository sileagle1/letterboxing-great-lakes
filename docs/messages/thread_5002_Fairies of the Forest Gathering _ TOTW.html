                    <div class="plaintext-content">We too would like to give a shout of thanks out to Family of 6 for hosting the event.  The <br/>
park couldn't have been better for the theme!  The time and detail you put into this <br/>
gathering was very evident...Thanks for a great day!  And the event stamp was incredible!  <br/>
We will never carve again the standard is now too high!<br/>
<br/>
Topic: Difficulty of clues at a gathering leading to longer times out on trail...<br/>
<br/>
Our opinion...Yes, some of the clues yesterday were difficult, but that is fine! - especially if <br/>
the clues are going to be in place permanently.  The problem as we see it, is that when you <br/>
are handed a book of clues at a gathering, the letterboxing saliva starts in and you want to <br/>
tackle all of them at once.  We are always overwhelmed by the task.  We never do very well <br/>
at gatherings (we found 7 yesterday...and 2 we had to reconfirm that we were in the right <br/>
spot and had to go back for them and dig deeper).  It takes a lot of time to trace your <br/>
steps and them retrace them..we were on one trail 3 times.  The price for spending that <br/>
much time is that we hardly got to meet &amp;  exchange with anyone.  Tiptoe was <br/>
disappointed..Tonto and Kemosabe (who enjoyed his first gathering very much!) wanted to <br/>
spend all of the time out on the trail and were very happy.  In spite not meeting very many <br/>
new boxers, we thoroughly enjoyed the trails, the boxes and the old friends!<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions have been to have easier temporary boxes for the kids...that sounds <br/>
great..as long as the likes of T&amp;T can have a crack at them too!  But to label boxes "easy" <br/>
or "difficult" is a little more tricky.  We have found that some boxes that others found to <br/>
be easy were in fact difficult and the reverse has played out too.  One boxer's idea of "easy <br/>
can be another's "hard"...and that is what makes the game interesting.  Frustrating at <br/>
times?  You bet!  But, that is what keeps us pursuing the challenge... and how sweet it is <br/>
when we meet it!<br/>
<br/>
Less boxes at a gathering would afford more exchange time, but could be less <br/>
challenging for the high voltage boxers....(thinking of Leapin' Lizards here)  A better <br/>
suggestion is to provide therapy at the pavilion for those of us that think we MUST find <br/>
ALL of the boxes in one afternoon!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterdays boxes were very well hidden...in some cases involving more digging, debris <br/>
moving, etc.  than we like as it causes the site to be compromised with all the removal of <br/>
stuff, but still we enjoyed them.  The question begs itself as to the perfect amount of <br/>
coverage, protection, how far into that hole do you shove it?????....Not too much and not <br/>
to little.  A difficult balance indeed.  On the 2 boxes that we had difficulty, we were at the <br/>
right location, but due to the hiding spot being buried we were actually standing on one of <br/>
the boxes and not knowing it!<br/>
<br/>
What do all of you in letterbox kingdom think about the clueing of clues at a gathering? <br/>
Should they be easier or remain challenging?  The number of boxes? How to enjoy the best <br/>
of both worlds..the finding of boxes and the meeting of others?  Maybe this is too many <br/>
topics, but they all are related to one another.  How to best enjoy a gathering!<br/>

Well maybe not hard and easy but some listed as "very short", "Child <br/>
Friendly" "no walking needed"? My problem was just the amount of <br/>
playgrounds we went past, we had to push all 3 of the kids on every <br/>
swing and teeter totter we went past. LOL Next time I need to go <br/>
ALONE! I also didn't realize it was ok to work with other people when <br/>
looking for boxes and thought that was "cheating"<br/>
<br/>
Now can someone tell me what to do with my Hitchhiker I made for this <br/>
even that I never found the box to hide it in!<br/>

<br/>
Now to your musings about gatherings:  Whenever possible, we try to make a whole weekend out of an event.  That way the "gotta find these boxes" urge has enough time to be satisfied while still allowing us time to socialize during the event.  If clues are made available on a Friday evening or early Saturday morning, then the early birds can get hopping after the "worms" (boxes) and get a boxing fix in the morning, then spend time socializing during the afternoon.  That also leaves Sunday for more boxing.  This of course assumes that the boxes will remain in place for at least the entire weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that we're seeing more of in recent years is a pre- and/or post-gathering during the evening.  This is a GREAT idea as far as we're concerned because it's getting dark then and not so good for finding boxes anyway.  We then are not torn between being out "on the hunt" and chit-chatting with our LB friends.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding clues:  we like them at least a bit challenging/interesting but at an event they hopefully won't require Google  research to figure out.  Hiding spots:  we've been boxing for almost 5 years and have always read that you never "bury" a box, so wouldn't think to start looking for something buried.  Covered with a rock or sticks, etc. but still somewhat noticeable when you got to the right spot.<br/>
<br/>
We've got 3 events coming up in the next 8 weeks, so we're really looking forward to doing some boxing AND socializing in Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois!  I do hope the forecast for Decorah, IA improves for Saturday....  but if the weather is really bad we'll just spend more time socializing at the comfy cabin and hit the trails on Sunday!<br/>
