GretchenF, YooperGal and I got together in the TC area and had a<br>
wonderful time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Did three of SpringChick's letterboxes - she is everywhere! I think<br>
of her clues often as suggestions - put on your thinking cap when going<br>
after hers.  As usual, she shows us new places we have not been before<br>
which is amazing since I spent every summer up in the TC area from age<br>
10 on and I went to a Nature Preserve that I didn't know existed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, we always liked the hiker's creed "take only pictures, leave only<br>
footprints" - but we left letterboxes, too.  If you like pictures,<br>
check out http://tinyurl.com/r2ook <http://tinyurl.com/r2ook><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We added two boxes - Lost boat at Suttons Bay<br>
<http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=16906>    and<br>
Fishtown <http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?gBoxId=16856>   . <br>
Set a hitchhiker free and released another.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you haven't been to the Lake Leelanau Peninsula, it is worth a day or<br>
two.  What always amazes me is you can forget all your troubles and<br>
worries - the wind and water just take them away.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the fun SpringChick - and when I grow up (I know I'm older<br>
than you already) I want to carve like her.<br>
