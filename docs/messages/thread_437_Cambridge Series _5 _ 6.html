I checked on box #5 yesterday. It's fine and right where it should <br/>
be. The last stamp-in was on Mother's Day, but it was still hidden <br/>
well and nice &amp; dry.<br/>
<br/>
Shutterfly -- I suspect you may have done what I did on my first <br/>
attempt at finding it and gone to the fallen tree just to the north <br/>
of it. (You were on the right path, you just needed to go a little <br/>
farther, if this was the case.)<br/>
<br/>
I added Box 6 clues to it, so you no longer need to print clues in <br/>
advance to continue the series.<br/>

&gt; Hi Shutterfly and all, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The series is kinda far from home to run out and check it.  I'd <br/>
&gt; appreciate any updates from the group so that I can replace it if <br/>
&gt; necessary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone ever runs into any problems with my boxes, let me <br/>
&gt; know right away.  I take  box maintenance very seriously.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course, I also like to hear when things are right, too. :o)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Speaking of box #5, has anyone found it since the 7th? Wiener <br/>
&gt; Mouse <br/>
&gt; &gt; and I were out there shortly after it rained and noticed that <br/>
there <br/>
&gt; &gt; was a lot of debris washed away to the bottom of the hill, and <br/>
&gt; hoped <br/>
&gt; &gt; it wasn't down there. We slid all over in the mud, but couldn't <br/>
&gt; seem <br/>
&gt; &gt; to find the box. We eventually gave up, and swore to come back <br/>
&gt; later <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the month when we come back for more of the Milwaukee <br/>
&gt; boxes. We've <br/>
&gt; &gt; missed totally obvious boxes in the past, so it wouldn't be a <br/>
&gt; suprise <br/>
&gt; &gt; if we walked right by this one too. :) Hopefully when we go <br/>
&gt; back, it <br/>
&gt; &gt; won't be as muddy and we can search a little better. Can't wait <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; get box #6 as well!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, Dragon.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, Czeltic Girl is a bit frantic these days, so the clues <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; box 6 have not been put <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; inside box 5 yet. If you're heading out to do the series, print <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; clues ahead of time. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm going to try to get the clues into box 5 sometime this <br/>
&gt; weekend.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (Remind me never again to buy a house during the busiest <br/>
&gt; time of <br/>
&gt; &gt; the year at work. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Between the two, they're eating up all my letterboxing time!)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The clues for Czeltic Girl's box (#6 in the Cambridge <br/>

&gt; &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the webpage.  I did it before I left for Ohio.<br/>
