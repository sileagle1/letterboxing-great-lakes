<br>
I checked on box #5 yesterday. It's fine and right where it should <br>
be. The last stamp-in was on Mother's Day, but it was still hidden <br>
well and nice & dry.<br>
<br>
Shutterfly -- I suspect you may have done what I did on my first <br>
attempt at finding it and gone to the fallen tree just to the north <br>
of it. (You were on the right path, you just needed to go a little <br>
farther, if this was the case.)<br>
<br>
I added Box 6 clues to it, so you no longer need to print clues in <br>
advance to continue the series.<br>
