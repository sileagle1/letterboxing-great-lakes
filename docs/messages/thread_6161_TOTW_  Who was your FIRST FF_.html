My sister (I Voted) and I planted "Chick Days" and "Ruth-a-baga" Labor Day weekend 2008.  Sassy Sister was the official first finder for both boxes the next spring!<br/>

Interesting turn-about: Sassy sister's first plant was "Fawn Doe Crossing" in June 2009 and I was the first finder!!<br/>

That box had to be recarved and replanted the following year, but now it's still in place and has 2 others in the series.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just checked my first plant - my first finder was from out of the region - Front Range Hiker from Colorado.  I met her at my first meet-n-greet, a dinner out in honor of her visit to Milwuakee's Irish Fest.  Meeting her and many local boxers really reeled me into this hobby hardcore!<br/>
<br/>
This first plant - Magic School Bus Hops Home (Parade of Books) - was also my first carve - it's um, shall we say "crude" or "primitive"?  I thought about replacing it, but it is such a contrast to my later carves that it shows how we improve in our skills rather quickly.  In the same town (tee-hee) is the stamp I get the most compliments on.  The pair are a nice contrast!<br/>
