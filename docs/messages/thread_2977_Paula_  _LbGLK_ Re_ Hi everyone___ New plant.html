That statement just cracks me up!  "Geocaching - Using billion dollar satellites to hunt Tupperware."  ROFLOL!!!  That's exactly right.  Letterboxers are more artsy and low tech.  <br>
Thanks!  You brought a smile to my face tonight.<br>

  We can always tell how old the Sat pics are by looking at my mothers <br>
  pool - is the cover on? Was it stained yet? Was the sunroom on the <br>
  house? LMAO We have the most recent ones nailed down to April or May <br>
  of this year - and we know we weren't home when they were taken. <br>
<br>
  Too funny - I always laugh because we have a neighbor who feels the <br>
  need to burn lawn waste EVERY nice breezy day - that is, when the <br>
  breeze is coming towards our windows. In one of the Satellite pics, <br>
  you can see her smoke cloud wafting over to our windows... UGH. But at <br>
  least if it ever gets ugly - Ive got proof! (See? Our tax dollars are <br>
  doing something?!) <br>
<br>
  I love the geocachers statement... Geocaching: Using billion dollar <br>
  satellites to hunt tupperware.<br>
