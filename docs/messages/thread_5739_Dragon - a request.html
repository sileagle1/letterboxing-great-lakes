I am so glad we can finally follow up on your request to check on the box - and say that it is still in place.  I've emailed you about this also, but decided to post here cause I wanted to share my victory at finally finding the Lockbox after seriously, 3 tries and probably 3 hours of looking.  Luckily for today, due to the cold, it only took us maybe ten minutes.  Now I want to see the inside of the box.  Please.  0:)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My deepest apologies for not getting this out earlier.  The matrix for the final clue to mathman 9 can now by found in my new folder in the files section - The Dragon Den - under Clues and more clues.<br>

I'll probably get around to fixing my webpages during Easter break.  I know of some broken links with some of the historical boxes.  I also know I need to update the grail info.  If anyone notices anything else strange, broken, etc. on my website or with the LBNA or AQ info, please let me know.  I've been keeping track of the info in a database so when I have the time I can fix it all.<br>

Back to school work....<br>
