placing some of the boxes for "THE FATE OF EASTER" series. <br/>
<br/>
We had some boxes from one of those Dollar Store places that passed <br/>
the bathtub test so we were going to use them. (Fill box with rocks, <br/>
place lid on, sink in a full bathtub and leave for at least an <br/>
hour ... if it's dry inside when opened after this, it can be used <br/>
for boxing. LOL)<br/>
<br/>
However, they have BRIGHT WHITE lids and we're thinking of using <br/>
parks around the GR area, so we expect heavy traffic in the area. My <br/>
daughter begged to be given time to "fix them up" (note: when <br/>
negoating with me, I don't hold up will to excessive repetiations of <br/>
the same request)and promised just to use whatever she could find <br/>
around here.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short ... she covered them with black gesso and used <br/>
matte acrylics in a sort of camoflague pattern then covered it all <br/>
with a couple of coats of fluid matte medium. I'll take a picture <br/>
and upload it later.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking the stuff would scrape right off as she didn't sand <br/>
them or do any prep work on them. They did have a nice roughed up <br/>
texture on portions though. So far our "test scratchings" haven't <br/>
removed their camo coating.<br/>
<br/>
We're going out now to get some of these six boxes hidden. The goal <br/>
is to have the series ready for this weekend. (We'll see how we do <br/>
with that.)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
