My odds of winning Bingo would be much better if SC had called my state this week. It seems she is putting off calling an April state since it would probably increase the odds of having 17 Bingos called on the same day.  Let's see if there is a Bingo before next Wednesday....<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to guess that one of the Atomic Beans (IL) will win.  They've been faithfully playing every year and have never won - they are probably due!<br/>

&gt; So, as of 4-23-10, 84% of all bingo words have been called.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 89% of boxes<br/>
&gt; 88% of trailnames<br/>
&gt; 80% of events<br/>
&gt; 80% of general terms<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 93% of B <br/>
&gt; 81% of I<br/>
&gt; 74% of N<br/>
&gt; 85% of G<br/>
&gt; 89% of O<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which means, 99% of the time, Sprinchick CANNOT be bought to call your words (unless you through in some wicked craft paper and plane tickets to see her grandkids, which, I'm pretty sure, will get you the FULL card bingo!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, my guess is this.....90% of the Illinois and Wisconsin people are all waiting for the same words...7% have given up long ago...and 3% are dipping into Tiptoe and Tonto's famous spa and don't give a darn about BINGO now (We can include Spartanfans here too!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, your odds of Sprinchick working her magic fingers in your favor for what's left is this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You have a 9% chance she will call a B word, 24% chance for I, 33% chance for N, 19% chance for G, and a 14% chance for O (THIS, of course, will all change after 4-24-10!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, to add more fun, you have a 24% chance that the next word will be a letterbox, a 14% chance that it will be either a letterboxer or an event, and a 48% chance that it will be be a general term...this too shall change after 4-24-10.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, what does this mean for you? What are your odds of winning? Why don't you check out these odds and see if yours are better:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Odds of being murdered: 18,000 to 1<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Odds of getting away with murder: 2 to 1<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Odds that a celebrity marriage will last a lifetime: 3 to 1<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Odds of getting hemorrhoids: 25 to 1 <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chance of winning a bingo game where 100 players manage four cards each: 1 in 100 <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chance of having a stroke: 1 in 6<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chance of dying from heart disease: 1 in 3<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chance of getting arthritis: 1 in 7<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chance of suffering from asthma or allergy diseases: 1 in 6<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chance of getting the flu this year: 1 in 10<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Odds of being killed on a 5-mile bus trip: 500,000,000 to 1<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't know about your chances at wining the bingo, but I would say the bus trip looks pretty good! (want more? http://www.funny2.com/odds.htm )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow...anyone want to take a guess on who is going to take it all? and from what state?<br/>

And thanks to WiHi for the vote of confidence, but as for Atom or I <br/>
winning Bingo, I'm afraid it's not looking good for either one of us <br/>
again this year (although I don't know off-hand how many he has left - <br/>
Pace may have just helped him out a lot). Unfortunately, I still have 4 <br/>
open spots left, and chances are someone else in IL or WI needs the same <br/>
words, only fewer of them! :P<br/>

I'm rather sure we don't have all the same 4 words left...but I too have <br/>
4 words left (and have for what seems like FOREVER)...<br/>

I'm equally as pessimistic about the chances of some sort of Atomic <br/>
BINGO.  :-(<br/>
