been set!<br>
<br>
It'll be at Como Park in St. Paul on Saturday, October 20, 2007. <br>
<br>
Since it'll be after the "picnic season", the shelters are available <br>
on a first come, first served basis. I'm not positive that the <br>
electricity will be on in the shelter. I'm going to try to grab the <br>
Como Shelter on Midway Parkway near Hamline Avenue. Just look for <br>
the girl wearing the hat with cat ears.  There might also be <br>
balloons. I'll be there early to snag the shelter and hide last <br>
minute boxes.<br>
<br>
The time has also changed.  It'll be from about 12/12:30ish until <br>
whenever.  Since (hopefully) it'll take up a large portion of the <br>
afternoon, it would be great if people would be willing to bring <br>
snacks/something to munch on.  <br>
<br>
If you are attending, feel free to hide your own Halloween or Autumn <br>
themed letterboxes in the park.  You can either hand out the clues <br>
yourself or email them to me to include in the clue booklet.  There <br>
are also going to be boxes donated by several letterboxers from <br>
around the country that will only be available at this event.<br>
<br>
If you plan on attending or have any questions, please email me at <br>
the_red_cat529@yahoo.com.  There's also an event page at AtlasQuest.<br>
