which had a really neat stamp has vanished.  I suspect animals for<br/>
reasons that people who have found the box would know -- less damage,<br/>
lets just say, than if it were stolen by n'eer-do-wells.<br/>
<br/>
This definately is a box that is near and dear to my heart, so I will<br/>
be re-doing it soon.<br/>
<br/>
So, don't look for that one.<br/>
