                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a special box I'll be bringing (or sending, if it works out that I<br>
can't make it) to the gathering.  It's basically an event stamp, but will<br>
also be visiting a few out of town friends as a postal.  It's called The<br>
Blue Dog, and its purpose is hurricane relief awareness.  Those of you who<br>
are familiar with New Orleans' artist George Rodrigue's Blue Dog paintings<br>
will know what I'm talking about.  (see www.georgerodrigue.com<br>
<http://www.georgerodrigue.com/> )  As a postal, I've made the requirement<br>
to receive it a donation to the American Red Cross or other relief agency of<br>
your choice.  For the gathering, I'm not going to collect money, but would<br>
appreciate (honor system) that you not stamp in unless you have made a<br>
donation (large or small, I won't check up on you!).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Anyone who can't make the gathering, but would like to receive it as a<br>
postal, please sign up on AtlasQuest.<br>
