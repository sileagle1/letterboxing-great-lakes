                    <div class="plaintext-content">FYI, I was at my local Michael's store yesterday.  Noticed there weren't any <br>
individual pkgs. of Speedball gouges in the art section, where I'd found them <br>
previously.  Checked out the clearance aisle, and there they were.  This <br>
particular store only had pkgs. of No. 2 and No. 4 gouges, and they were marked at <br>
50 cents (normally $2.99).  They also had some Speedball Scratch Knives, two <br>
different shapes in a pkg., also marked down to 50 cents (normally $3.99).  <br>
Figured these might come in handy for cross-hatch patterns and light texturing.<br>
<br>
Thought I'd share the info in case any one gets a chance to check out their <br>
local store.<br>
