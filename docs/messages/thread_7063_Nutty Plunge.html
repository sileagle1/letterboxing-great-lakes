Upon trying last fall, I couldn't find it either, all was too overgrown.  After searching for 30 min (and I had visited this box often), I gave up and decided it would have to be replaced.  Being lazy, I did not get around to recarving.  So yesterday, went to check and there is was.  Amazing what a winter kill will do to uncover secret hiding places.  Anyway, I moved it just a short distance from it's original spot, where hopefully it can be accessed year round.<br>
