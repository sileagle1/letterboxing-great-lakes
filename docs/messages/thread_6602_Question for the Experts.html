                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally, I count it as another find if it's in an entirely different location.  I figure that I've enjoyed a completely different hike, with new clues and a new hiding spot; the fact that it's the same stamp is minor.  This has only happened to me twice, both times for boxes originally placed temporarily at events (in the woods, not on a table), then re-planted permanently at parks hundreds of miles away.<br>
<br>
The LbNA FAQ says that "A box can be counted as Found more than once if [...] its clue, location, and stamp image have all changed since Found the first time." So my philosophy does not strictly live up to that definition.  However, I would agree with not counting a box a second time if it were simply moved to a slightly different location in the same park.<br>

If someone finds a box and logs it in as a find, and then the box (same stamp) is moved to a new location ... is it considered another find if that person finds it at the second location, as well as the first?<br>
