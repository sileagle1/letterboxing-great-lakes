<br/>
I must admit that I was tempted to put Minnesota down, as I figure not many  <br/>
people would choose MN -- don't know why, I just did. Looks like Illinois is <br/>
at  the bottom of the popularity poll.<br/>
<br/>
Our actual air temperature right now is -2 (yes, that's a negative in front  <br/>
of the 2)!! We have windchill of negative 35 too.... boy is it windy.<br/>
<br/>
So far this December we have had more than twice the snow we did last year  <br/>
-- and last year was bad!! <br/>
<br/>
This winter reminded me of an Email my Dad forwarded me a couple weeks  ago;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Due to recent budget cuts and the  rising cost of  electricity, gas, and  oil,<br/>
<br/>
The Light at  the End of the Tunnel has been turned  off. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for the  inconvenience.<br/>

<br/>
We didn't see Rod Blagojevich listed in the database????<br/>
<br/>
Some of us from IL would rather choose the state of their birth...Tiptoe says let's here it for <br/>
IN!<br/>
Tonto has to remain from IL along with Rod!  So, as soon as you get our booty there will be <br/>
at least 2 Illini!<br/>
Freezing with the same temp and wind chill as Hrtx6 on this side of IL...Tiptoe &amp; Tonto<br/>
<br/>
BTW...We are so excited that PineCone from CT will be playingBINGO along with all of us here <br/>
in the Great Lakes!!!!  Give a hug to Pine Needle for us..tell her Tonto is still looking for boxes <br/>
around the inn!<br/>

I updated the players database to reflect everything I've received<br/>
thus far. To date I have 15 entries in hand, with another 19 showing<br/>
as en route. The prize booty is looking great so far -- I am sure the<br/>
winners will be quite pleased! Thanks to everyone for the thoughtful<br/>
and generous items you've sent!<br/>
<br/>
Just as an item of interest... here is the breakout on the wild card<br/>
