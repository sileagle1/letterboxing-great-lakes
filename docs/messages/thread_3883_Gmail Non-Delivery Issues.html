Subject: [yg-alerts] Gmail Non-Delivery Issues<br>
<br>
<br>
We've had reports that some users with Gmail accounts have not been<br>
receiving Groups mail since approximately March 14, 2007. This was a<br>
difficult issue to diagnose, because we were able to replicate the<br>
issue with some, but not all, of our test Gmail accounts. Some of us<br>
were missing Groups messages in our Gmail accounts, some of us were<br>
receiving them as usual. We appreciate those of you who wrote in<br>
detail about the problems your members were having on the Groups<br>
Technical Issues board and in email to Customer Care. Having detailed<br>
information helps us get to the bottom of issues faster.<br>
<br>
The problem appears to be on Gmail's end. We have gotten in touch with<br>
the Gmail team and are working to resolve this issue. We'll post an<br>
update when this has been resolved.<br>
<br>
We've posted further information about email delivery on the Yahoo!<br>
Groups Team Blog: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/y_groups_team?p=3094 <br>
