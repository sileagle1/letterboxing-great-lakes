I haven't been there, but I think the C.C.C. Bridge box is actually <br>
in Kalkaska County.  The clues say it's in Antrim, but if I'm reading <br>
the directions and maps correctly, it is in Kalkaska.<br>
<br>
Branch is colored green on the map. So, I think you're right about that.<br>
<br>
So, if I'm right about that ccc bridge box, there should be 12 left.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeh, I think you're right.  I had seen that one and just assumed that even though it listed Kalkaska as the closest city, it must be close to the border with Antrim county and the box actually in Antrim county.  But in taking a closer look at it and following the clue directions on a map, you end up smack in the center of Kalkaska county, so I think that one is listed incorrectly.<br>
<br>
That puts Michigan down to 12 counties left to go!<br>
