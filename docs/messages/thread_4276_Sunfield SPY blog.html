   SPYs Treasure Hunt Update: <br/>
<br/>
* Due to numerous requests from teams, a Hint Line is now open to help you out with a set of clues <br/>
if you are stumped and frustrated. Teams are allowed one hint call a week. Just call Da Fish at headquarters (566-8278). Help is just a phone call away.<br/>
<br/>
* Bonus Hint-Of-The-Week #1: If you plan on going after the Giant Coaster box you had better due it quick while the area is dry. Earlier in the year the site was under water.<br/>
* The name of Betsy Louthans team is Moms Night Out.<br/>
<br/>
* We have another team that is beginning to show up in logbooks by the name of Suntrail, but I <br/>
dont know who they are yet.<br/>
<br/>
* Bonus Hint-Of-The-Week #2: The Superhero Series #1 box is back on-line now. <br/>
<br/>
* Bill The Fanatic Weller is soooooooo into the Treasure Hunt that he even went out in the rain to <br/>
rack up finds. Before he hit the trail, he stopped and bought a new rain suit. By the time the day was through, the rain pants were shredded due to his patented power-hunt techniques. He ended up chucking what was left of them in a trash can on the way out of the last park he visited.<br/>

I looked back and several of the older posts on the blog.  A "Treasure <br/>
Hunt" seems to be an annual event for this youth-focused group.  This <br/>
year the orientation meeting was held mid-May and the event was planned <br/>
to last at least 2 months.  I wasn't able to discover when it would be <br/>
officially "over", but the good news is that it does seem that there <br/>
will be an end.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly they said that this year's event would be quite different <br/>
from previous years and that it wouldn't require a lot of "brain-power" <br/>
(?!).<br/>

Here's a short blurb:<br/>
<br/>
The SPY's were founded in 1975. We currently have over 100 active <br/>
members. The main focus of the SPY organization is to provide <br/>
opportunities, both athletic and scholastic, for area youth....<br/>
<br/>
The SPY's have been instrumental in a wide variety of other community <br/>
projects as well. <br/>

 Here's a link to the Sunfield SPY blog and a clipping from the 7/28 blog<br/>
 entry. This is horrible!<br/>
<br/>
 http://www.sunfieldspys.org/dirtsheet.shtml<br/>
 . SPY's Treasure Hunt Update:<br/>
<br/>
 * Due to numerous requests from teams, a "Hint Line" is now open to help you<br/>
 out with a set of clues if you are stumped and frustrated. Teams are allowed<br/>
 one hint call a week. <br/>
 Just call "Da Fish" at headquarters (566-8278). Help is just a phone call<br/>
 away.<br/>
<br/>
 * Bonus Hint-Of-The-Week #1: If you plan on going after the "Giant Coaster" <br/>
 box you had better due it quick while the area is dry. Earlier in the year<br/>
 the site was under water.<br/>
 * The name of Betsy Louthan's team is "Mom's Night Out".<br/>
<br/>
 * We have another team that is beginning to show up in logbooks by the name<br/>
 of "Suntrail", but I don't know who they are yet.<br/>
<br/>
 * Bonus Hint-Of-The-Week #2: The "Superhero Series" #1 box is back on-line<br/>
 now.<br/>
<br/>
 * Bill "The Fanatic" Weller is soooooooo into the Treasure Hunt that he even<br/>
 went out in the rain to rack up finds. Before he hit the trail, he stopped<br/>
 and bought a new rain suit. By the time the day was through, the rain pants<br/>
 were shredded due to his patented "power-hunt" techniques. He ended up<br/>
 chucking what was left of them in a trash can on the way out of the last<br/>
 park he visited.<br/>

the actual game only includes the boxes that they planted, but some<br/>
are liking the activity so much that they are going beyond the ones<br/>

One might point out to them their post on the blog about their disgust<br/>

I looked back and several of the older posts on the blog. A "Treasure <br/>
Hunt" seems to be an annual event for this youth-focused group. This <br/>
year the orientation meeting was held mid-May and the event was planned <br/>
to last at least 2 months. I wasn't able to discover when it would be <br/>
officially "over", but the good news is that it does seem that there <br/>
will be an end.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly they said that this year's event would be quite different <br/>
from previous years and that it wouldn't require a lot of "brain-power" <br/>
(?!).<br/>

of my boxes last weekend, and he seemed very nice.<br/>
<br/>
"Are you part of the Sunfield Area SPY's? Could you give me a little <br/>
information about your group and your letterboxing hunt? I ask because <br/>
your treasure hunt (and help line) has been brought to the attention of <br/>
the area's letterboxers. Although your email to me was very warm and <br/>
helpful, some of the rest of your group has been portrayed in a negative <br/>
light. Your group sounds like it does a large amount of work that <br/>
benefits the local community, and before I jump to any wrong <br/>
conclusions, I wanted to get some information from you (as you seem to <br/>
be a key player).<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Atom "<br/>
<br/>
Here is what he responded.<br/>
<br/>
"We have somewhere around ten or so teams  and there's a summer long <br/>
'treasure hunt' of boxing going on.  We are all new to boxing this <br/>
summer.  We have a tip line which helps people by warning them when <br/>
boxes are missing or when the landmarks have changed and they need to be <br/>
a little creative when searching for a box.  I certainly hope no one <br/>
from our group has done something unethical boxing-wise or any <br/>
other-wise or has offended anyone in any way.  I can relay info to the <br/>
guy who is running this contest, and we can correct it.  Can I ask what <br/>
the problem is?"<br/>
<br/>
Before I respond, do you have any key points I should hit?  I was going <br/>
to reiterate the stealthy aspects, express our disdain for the help line <br/>
(as it is contrary to the sport), and our concerns of large groups.  In <br/>
addition, I am most interested in the 'help-line'  for reporting missing <br/>
boxes as many boxes have lasted for years and should not go missing so <br/>
often.  <br/>

Leave no trace!<br/>
Don't create a trail to the box.<br/>
Re-hide the box and its contents as well or better than you found it.<br/>
Re-seal and double bag contents (if applicable).<br/>
Don't handle the box if you have food smell on your hands.<br/>
Make sure no one is watching you.<br/>
Help-line okay for reporting problems with boxes (flooded area, park<br/>
closed, box possibly missing) - heck we report those things here - but<br/>
not okay to give clues, locations, or info to find boxes (spoilers)<br/>

If this is a game to see who gets the most boxes I would worry not only<br/>
about them rushing and not putting them back correctly but also about them<br/>
hiding them off the mark so the next person can't find it at all.  If they<br/>
can't find it they can't get credit for it.<br/>

<br/>
I guess I would mention that the ideas of giving out public hints <br/>
isn't appreciated, unless it is the owner of the box that is giving <br/>
the hint.  However it sounds like they are mostly warning of <br/>
problems, similar to what some of us might do on the Great Lakes <br/>
board (box is currently under water, etc).  That doesn't seem too bad <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also ask what size the teams are, or how many go out together.  <br/>
Since they are "competing", I really doubt large groups are going out <br/>
together.  However there is probably increased traffic to certain <br/>
boxes, but that is probably no different than when an article is <br/>
written that appears in a publication, or some type of class/program <br/>
about letterboxing is offered in an area.  Again, I doubt they are <br/>
doing anything "wrong".<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the most important thing is to ask if the participants are <br/>
familiar with the secrecy and discretion aspects of the hobby and the <br/>
importance of rehiding the box well and minimizing the impact on the <br/>
area around the box (social trails, etc).<br/>
<br/>
I'd also encourage them to send "Contact the Placer" messages when <br/>
they find public boxes.  However it sounds like some of them are <br/>
already doing that, if you heard from him already.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like at least one of this group has posted some interesting <br/>
clues to boxes in Sunfield.  This may not be such a bad thing as <br/>
initially assumed.<br/>

Here's a link to the Sunfield SPY blog and a clipping from the 7/28 blog <br/>
entry. This is horrible!<br/>
<br/>
http://www.sunfield spys.org/ dirtsheet. shtml<br/>
. SPY's Treasure Hunt Update:<br/>
<br/>
* Due to numerous requests from teams, a "Hint Line" is now open to help you <br/>
out with a set of clues<br/>
if you are stumped and frustrated. Teams are allowed one hint call a week. <br/>
Just call "Da Fish" at headquarters (566-8278). Help is just a phone call <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
* Bonus Hint-Of-The- Week #1: If you plan on going after the "Giant Coaster" <br/>
box you had better due it quick while the area is dry. Earlier in the year <br/>
the site was under water.<br/>
* The name of Betsy Louthan's team is "Mom's Night Out".<br/>
<br/>
* We have another team that is beginning to show up in logbooks by the name <br/>
of "Suntrail", but I<br/>
don't know who they are yet.<br/>
<br/>
* Bonus Hint-Of-The- Week #2: The "Superhero Series" #1 box is back on-line <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
* Bill "The Fanatic" Weller is soooooooo into the Treasure Hunt that he even <br/>
went out in the rain to<br/>
rack up finds. Before he hit the trail, he stopped and bought a new rain <br/>
suit. By the time the day was through, the rain pants were shredded due to <br/>
his patented "power-hunt" techniques. He ended up chucking what was left of <br/>
them in a trash can on the way out of the last park he visited.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In addition to what Dragon suggests, you may want to suggest that they reiterate some of the basic rules of letter boxing (especially leave no trace/respect the environment, be stealthy when retrieving and rehiding boxes, hide boxes as good or better than you found them) to their teams.  It is apparent from the number of "new team" announcements that not all of the people playing this game attended the orientation meeting held this spring, perhaps they did not get quite the same message as those who attended the meeting.<br/>
<br/>
I would also be sure to point out the general concern over the hint line, since that really does seem to be the biggest concern.  While it's ok for things like noting poor trail conditions, potentially missing boxes, and things like that letterboxers should still be encouraged to try contacting the placer first.  You should point out that it is generally against letterboxing ethics to offer hints on other people's clues as well as mentioning mystery boxes without the placer's permission.  I don't mind giving hints for my own boxes if someone emails me and tells me they're having a hard time finding them, but I really wouldn't want people to be able to call a "hint hotline" to get hints to the clues.  Some clues are deliberately tricky and it may be the placer's intention and desire for them to be worked out without the assistance of others.<br/>

 Leave no trace!<br/>
 Don't create a trail to the box.<br/>
 Re-hide the box and its contents as well or better than you found it.<br/>
 Re-seal and double bag contents (if applicable).<br/>
 Don't handle the box if you have food smell on your hands.<br/>
 Make sure no one is watching you.<br/>
 Help-line okay for reporting problems with boxes (flooded area, park<br/>
 closed, box possibly missing) - heck we report those things here - but<br/>
 not okay to give clues, locations, or info to find boxes (spoilers)<br/>

Good job, Atom!<br/>
You may want to add a "respect the environment" blurb.  I don't know <br/>
that they aren't, but that one "power hunt" comment and the shredded <br/>
rain pants makes me think that the guy is just barrelling through <br/>
stuff with no regard for his clothing or the environment he's trudging through.<br/>
