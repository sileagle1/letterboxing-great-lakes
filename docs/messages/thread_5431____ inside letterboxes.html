                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm amazed that people would actually leave any large sum of money inside a letterbox.  Hard core letterboxers have always felt that finding the hand carved stamp inside the box was 'the prize.'  Don't get me wrong, it's not that I wouldn't love to stumble across a box with $100.00 bill inside, but if word got out that there was CASH inside letterboxes, that could open up a whole new can of worms and create problems.  If people went searching for letterboxes as if it were some sort of $$$ treasure hunt hoping to find money and there wasn't any $$$ inside, they might simply toss the box aside and not value the real intended prize contents.  Just my thoughts.  <br>
<br>
Several years ago, I created The Great Rondout Train Robbery Letterbox and I included several $1 million dollar bills (replicas) because the story (clue) told of how the stolen millions were never recovered from this famous crime.  <br>
<br>
Come to think of it, occasionally I use to find first finder paper certificates inside boxes, but not recently.  Those were some artistic tags!  <br>

  I heard of a certain box in the PNW that held a $100 bill as the first <br>
  finder prize.<br>
<br>
  This was about a year ago or more.... wonder if anyone has found it yet.<br>
