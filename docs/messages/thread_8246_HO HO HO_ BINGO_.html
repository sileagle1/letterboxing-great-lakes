<p></p><p class="MsoNormal">The end of the year is approaching fast and so is the deadline for getting your entries in for the upcoming 2016 Great Lakes BINGO game.  I suspect that due to this nice weather, some of you are still trying to find a few more boxes so you can use them on your card.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/>
As most of you know, part of our winter fun is playing the Great Lakes
Letterboxing BINGO game started by SpringChick back in 2006. She ran the game
for 5 years, then the illustrious Mr. Familyof6 took the reins for two years
and now I'm honored to be hosting the BINGO game for a fourth  time. 2016 will be our 11<sup>th </sup>year of
Great Lakes Letterboxing BINGO. We're hoping to have a lot of participants for
the 2016 game, so spread the word. You sure wouldn't want to miss experiencing
the slow motion thrill of victory and agony of defeat that this game is famous
for!<br/>
<br/>
The necessary files are ready for your use in the "Files" section of
the message board (just scroll down to the "Great Lakes Letterbox BINGO!
folder, click on it, then click on the 2016 BINGO Game folder). </p><p class="MsoNormal">  </p><p class="MsoNormal">General instructions are in the Bingo 2016 FAQ.pdf file, the
terms to fill your card are in the BINGO 2016 Word List.pdf  file and the blank card is found as two
formats: BINGO GRID 2016.doc and BINGO GRID 2016.pdf.  You may wish to use the MS Word version to
type (or cut &amp; paste) your terms directly into the grid. You can then save
a copy and send it as an attachment in an email to me. Then, if you haven’t already done so, make
sure you mail a booty prize and $2 to my address (see FAQ file) by December 31 or
you can give me your booty and $2 in person if you want to save the mailing
costs. <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(205,35,44)">The absolute deadline for getting your card and booty to me is DEC 31, because
the game starts on January 1, 2016 and we will be traveling and unable to
receive packages after that date .</span><br/>
<br/><span style="word-spacing:normal">We will once again have a prize for the BIGGEST LOSER this
year - the person who has the LEAST squares crossed off at the completion of
the game.</span><br/></p><p class="MsoNormal">

If you have any questions, just shoot me an email, or post the question to this
board.<br/>
