Hi there,<br/>
I did find this cipher lesson plan a couple weeks ago.  It's geared <br/>
specifically toward letterboxing.  It was created by Fox-Fyr.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her if I could share the file with you and she agreed.  So, <br/>
I've uploaded the docs to the files section.  There is one file with <br/>
a bunch of info and ciphers.  The second file is the same, except it <br/>
includes the answers.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link. <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/files/Cipher%20help/  Hope this <br/>
helps everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Fox-Fyr for all the terrific tips and sharing them with everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Bali <br/>
