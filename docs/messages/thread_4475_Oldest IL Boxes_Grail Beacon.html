was certainly missing...and it didn't seem to be in a location that a <br>
replacement would be wise.<br>
<br>
We also checked on the "Grail Beacon" today.  It seems that the small <br>
stand of trees that was hosting the box (between the trail and marsh) <br>
has been removed. <br>
The platforms and trees referenced at the end of the clue are no longer <br>
there.  All that remained are some stumps.  We searched the ground near <br>
the two remaining trees along that stretch, but we couldn't locate any <br>
signs of the box.<br>
