Could you please upload the pictures to the photo album on the AQ "Horsin' <br>

NamVet and I went after the "Horse Sense" and "Epona's Steeds" boxes today, <br>

I put our copy of the group photo in the Photo folder on Great Lakes message<br>
board. We'll add more later this week. Here's a direct link:<br>

.... I would LOVE to see peoples' trail pics, as I spent most of the day at<br>
the <br>
shelterhouse and only got out on the trail for a little while with Beetle. <br>

It was great seeing many of our new boxers in the area at Horsin' Around!  Plus the new boxers from a little further away. It was fun meeting Maude at the Friday night dinner together.  I'll get a photo of that night up soon.<br>
 <br>
Thanks to all of you who brought all the great food for the event.  What a perfect day weatherwise.  FungusWoman, so sorry to hear about your fall ... and yours, too, SunnySide Up!!  I can sympathize with those of you getting a bee sting, as I did.  I didn't feel a thing from it until my hand started to swell that night ... went to Immediate Care Sunday morning to get some medication as it was really swollen and itching by morning.  No other effects, however, so it should be better in a few days.<br>
 <br>
Looking forward to seeing more photos!<br>
 <br>
Thanks again to all of you great boxers ... you are truly the ones that made Horsin' Around a great event!<br>

The first picture was taken when I got home...very red, but no shiner yet.  The second one is from the next morning before the shiner fully ripened (it eventually went all the way to my eyebrow), but the redness went down.  As of right now, it's way less purple than the second picture, but I'm now all yellowy.  The only wound left is the one under my nose.  The lip bruise is gone too.<br>

And I got a tetanus shot, so I'm good to go for my next mishap!<br>

Last night I carved a new PT based on my experience.  To obtain it, you must give me a band aid to help me restock my first aid kit.  (-:<br>
