We visited Pleasant Valley today, and made a serious attempt at The <br/>
Flower.  <br/>
<br/>
Pleasant Valley is still missing the stamp, and the log book is a <br/>
sorry bunch of damp newsprint, and The Flower is MIA, as far as I can <br/>
tell.  I've attempted contacting the placer, Babybird's Dad, but <br/>
haven't gotten any response.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if these boxes are still being maintained, and if <br/>
not, are they up for adoption?<br/>

Pleasant Valley was intact back in late May, but I didn't find any <br/>
trace of The Flower at that time.  Like you, I received no response <br/>
from the placer.  <br/>
<br/>
How does one go about adopting a box?  <br/>

Yes, how does one adopt a box?  This is of great interest to me since my not-so-distant plans involve moving around a lot and I would rather not have to take *all* of my boxes with me when I go.<br/>
