If any of you have tried and failed to find the Amazing series at <br>
Yankee Springs...I can only say I now know why! The park has added and <br>
taken away many signs and posts used in the clues! In fact we were <br>
there yesterday revising the clues, and in the hour and a half we were <br>

we met a (very nice) ranger who was adding to and removing signs and <br>
