ever noticed if the scents attract other critters, like yellowjackets??<br/>

Hmmm..must have been a late night gathering.  Usually the "wires" are<br/>
buzzing already with all the "great time!!!" messages by now.  I oughta know<br/>

<br/>
My sister accidentally discovered that one of her scented lotions makes an<br/>
excellent mosquito repellent.  We were boxing together for Fungus Woman's<br/>
Fish Out of Water: spring break in MN.  I got so many bites I was miserable!<br/>
She got not one!!!  So when I went out to check on one of my boxes on the<br/>
way home, I tried the lotion and got no new bites.  Today I put some on<br/>
before going out hiking by a marsh, which was extremely mosquito-infested.<br/>
We could hear them buzzing all around our ears and they would land on us,<br/>
but then immediately leave.  Only one bite!  I'm sold!  It's Bath &amp; Body<br/>
Works White Tea and Ginger Body Cream...and right now they are having their<br/>
semi-annual clearance so you can get it cheap!  Thought I'd pass this along.<br/>
