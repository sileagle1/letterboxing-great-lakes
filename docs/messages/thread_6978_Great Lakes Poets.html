FYI:  If you need any Girl Scout Cookies, I'd be happy to ship them to my Letterboxing friends.  I still have a house full of them.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree, that would be a good word for him to call.  That shows where I rank among friends.  It doesn't seem that many people are doing that good this year which just means it's going to be a loooooong game.  Which is fine, maybe I'll win the side wager.  I picked the day Familyof6 and I met at a party after my college graduation about 17 years ago.  Yikes that makes me feel old!  I'll be as old as him at the end of May.  I'm planning a Letterboxing event in MN that weekend to keep my mind off of being old.  I haven't posted it officially yet but it will be May 28th in Roseville, MN.  More details to come soon.  It's the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend.  I wish all of us better luck in Bingo.<br/>
