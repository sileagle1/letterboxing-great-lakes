you who have placed boxes for us to find!<br>
<br>
As a non-boxing friend pointed out to us, we're averaging about 1 box <br>
for every 2 days since we started LBing.  Is this considered an <br>
addiction??<br>
<br>
We have a 3-day boxing weekend planned for Door County next weekend, <br>
3 days next month in Muskegon, MI area AND 5 days in Connecticut for <br>
the big Monster Mash event in October!!  Is anyone else from the <br>
Great Lakes region heading east for this event?<br>

coming up also!  Looking forward to seeing your stamp in some of the boxes<br>
around the Muskegon area.<br>
<br>
I have contemplated heading out to CT for the Monster Mash -- would only be<br>
a fly in, fly out kind of thing as I don't have much time off work<br>
available.  Haven't decided for sure yet.  I'm sure you will have a great<br>
time, and think of the letterboxers you will meet!<br>
