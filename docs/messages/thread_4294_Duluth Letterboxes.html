<br/>
We were in the Duluth area in January and I can tell you that this box was<br/>
difficult to find. We did however find it. Contact me at jrussell6@wi.rr.com<br/>
privately. I will protect the clues, but I can find out if you were on the<br/>
right track and help determine if the box is indeed missing or not (and give<br/>
you hope).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Best regards<br/>

We were in Duluth a couple weeks ago and attempted to find the "In Bloom"<br/>
letterbox by Daisy. Does anyone know the status of this box or how to<br/>
contact the placer? My email hasn't gotten a response and were going back up<br/>
soon. After all the time we spend looking for it, we'd really like to find<br/>
it. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
