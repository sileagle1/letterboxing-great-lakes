We found a business on the outskirts of Kickapoo with a loading dock and backed the van down into it so we were mostly below ground level.  Then we all crouched down in the back of the van covered under blankets and pillows...unfortunately we didn't have any chocolate cream pie, but I was probably too hysterical to eat at that point!    Quincy (our dog), thought we had come up with a new game and rode out the storm with no worries.  We wanted to have the Wizard of Oz series adventure, but not quite that literally!  I'm glad to hear everyone weathered the storm.  BTW, there are several videos posted on YouTube of the tornado...here's a link to one of them.  Thanks for an awesome event!  <br>

Maybe our next Topic of the Week should be where were you on 6/5/10 around 8 pm... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
...I was in the basement of the Jubilee Cafe eating chocolate cream pie (YUM!), while my daughter and her friend were huddled in the office at the Country Inn.<br>

Those that were at the hotel last night were<br>
apparently asked to congregate in some "safe" areas and the TJMich parents<br>
told their boys that everyone was having a cookie party so they didn't get<br>
too worried about the storm (our hotel always had cookies available in the<br>
lobby). We heard that the LBers at the hotel took the opportunity to do a<br>
few exchanges at this time (Great Lake boxers are always prepared!). I'm<br>
curious how the hotel contacted people. Since we were out to dinner w/Tiptoe<br>
& Tonto at the time, we weren't part of the hotel corridor/laundry room<br>
party. (By the way, at Buffalo Wild Wings, someone who works there did tell<br>
us the best place to go in case of a tornado was the restaurant cooler room.<br>
This was probably the same thing as the Steak & Shake freezer, except we<br>
didn't actually need to go into it! Instead we stood around and watched the<br>
storm reports on the large screen TVs, then sat down to eat & socialize. I<br>
heard the people that ate earlier at the Jubilee Cafe went into the basement<br>
for safety, but they also got free pie while there!) <br>
