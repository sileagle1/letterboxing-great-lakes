                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone who mailed me their TESS stamps.  I have a pile of <br>
packages here from the past week or so and have not yet a chance to go <br>
through them.  I will try to get to them this week and let everyone <br>
know their stamp arrived safely.<br>
<br>
If you have not yet sent your stamp, please do so as soon as possible <br>
as I would like to get these over to She Who Plants within the next <br>
couple of weeks and get it off my plate.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

collection of carvings for the Great Lakes Travelling Event Stamp <br>
Showcase -- or TESS.  There are a total of 15 wonderful carvings, done <br>
by members of this group, based on the theme "Made in My State."  The <br>
stamps are accompanied by a unique handmade log book, which also <br>
serves as the box.<br>
<br>
This collection of event stamps made its debut at the 2006 Great Lakes <br>
Gathering and was also in attendance at the MI Fall Mystery Gathering <br>
yesterday.  It is available for any event in the region.  If you are <br>
hosting a gathering and are interested, please e-mail me and I will be <br>
happy to send them out to you.<br>
