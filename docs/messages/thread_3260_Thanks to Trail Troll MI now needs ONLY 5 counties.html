these counties.  I've added up your points and put your name on the<br/>

<br/>
How cool that your name will be on SpringChicks historical data list<br/>
as first to place in Arenac and Iosco counties.<br/>
<br/>
Like Bali Grl, I've got my fingers crossed that SpringChick was able<br/>
to get back out today and cover Montcalm county because that would put<br/>
MI on the home-stretch with less than 5 counties to go!!<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm off to update the MI map and read the clues for all the new MI<br/>
boxes that have been placed. Good work everyone. <br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>

  Great job Trail Troll! Thanks for getting out there and covering<br/>
  these counties. I've added up your points and put your name on the<br/>
  slips of paper already.<br/>
<br/>
  How cool that your name will be on SpringChicks historical data list<br/>
  as first to place in Arenac and Iosco counties.<br/>
<br/>
  Like Bali Grl, I've got my fingers crossed that SpringChick was able<br/>
  to get back out today and cover Montcalm county because that would put<br/>
  MI on the home-stretch with less than 5 counties to go!!<br/>
<br/>
