How cool that your name will be on SpringChicks historical data list<br>

Like Bali Grl, I've got my fingers crossed that SpringChick was able<br>

MI on the home-stretch with less than 5 counties to go!!<br>

Now I'm off to update the MI map and read the clues for all the new MI<br>
boxes that have been placed. Good work everyone. <br>

Sail on!<br>

  Great job Trail Troll! Thanks for getting out there and covering<br>
  these counties. I've added up your points and put your name on the<br>
  slips of paper already.<br>
<br>
  How cool that your name will be on SpringChicks historical data list<br>
  as first to place in Arenac and Iosco counties.<br>
<br>
  Like Bali Grl, I've got my fingers crossed that SpringChick was able<br>
  to get back out today and cover Montcalm county because that would put<br>
  MI on the home-stretch with less than 5 counties to go!!<br>
<br>
  Now I'm off to update the MI map and read the clues for all the new MI<br>
  boxes that have been placed. Good work everyone. <br>
<br>
  Sail on!<br>
