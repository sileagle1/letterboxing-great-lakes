Jabber (and Mr. Jabber) and Palestar (and Mr. Palestar) did a fantastic job hiding over 75 stamps (to my delight, I discovered Jabber and I have almost an identical stride length, making her clues absolutely spot on accurate!). I wish I could thank them here, but they don't belong to this board.....  <br/>

Camp Woodsmoke's facilities are wonderful.  We had delicious food at all our meals and celebrated Flute20's 13th birthday (one of the members of Team WOGS).  Even the weather cooperated...thunderstorms only during Friday-into-Saturday night, temps in the upper 80's Saturday.  We're looking forward to SITW2 next year!<br/>

This was the first event I attended where I found every stamp there.  (-:<br/>
