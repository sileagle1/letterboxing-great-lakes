Am struggling a little with the idea that I don't have to get EVERY box in a particular area.  In my case, I am reluctant to have to pay admission to get some boxes if my only reason for being there is the boxes.  I've gotten some at places I'm already a member of - or I've gone on free days.

As for the addiction nature of LBing - I'm moving to doing more of the supply-side of the hobby.  I lag in the listing of the clues, so I have like 9 to write up and 8 more to plant.  yikes.  Having a hard time with the idea of planting my Rosie the Riveter stamp as far as (only) an hour away from me - she may end up closer to home.  I spent so much time on it - and had doing this one in mind for such a long time as I wanted my skills to be up for doing the subject justice.  <br>

All the hard work going to waste.  But then I decided that if only 1 or 2 people got to see the image before it went missing then it was 1 or 2 more than would have seen it sitting at my house.  I would just have to recarve it, hopefully my skills got better.  But I did cry about our first plant when we thought it was missing.  Thanks to Tat2Bob for going around barricades to check.  The park it was in was getting updated and EVERYTHING in the park had been leveled except the 1 branch that held our box.  Still haven’t replanted but will soon.   <br>

Sorry I can't make that recovery meeting.  Maybe the next meeting.  Unless I'm out letterboxing which means I'll miss the next meeting too.  <br>
 <br>
I spent a cold/rainy but fun filled weekend of camping which including some time spent finding several letterboxes by Fungus Woman and others.  Sadly, my first two attempts resulted with nothing, but when I finally found my first box of the day, I actually shreaked "I found it! (followed by a little happy dance) <br>
 <br>
I don't need to attend those meetings.  (giggle)  <br>

When is the Recovery Meeting? How do I get that event stamp?<br>
Letterboxing is not an addiction, and we can stop at any time.<br>

Letterboxing IS an addiction! You might be able to suppress the urges for<br>
short periods of time. But it IS always going to be an addiction. I dont<br>
thing they have recovery meetings yet, do they? LOL Be glad you dont have<br>
first findersitis. It is harder to control those urges then wanting a smoke<br>
back when I was quitting.<br>

I dreamt last night that a Meijers store was opening up nearby - and I was<br>
super excited because I've heard about LBers getting good boxes there.<br>
LOL. I thought after reaching the big 1K that my interest in LBing might <br>
wane.<br>
Guess not!<br>
