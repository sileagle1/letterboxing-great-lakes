                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Hello everyone, this is Chris G. from Burnsville MN. I am writing to let everyone know officially about the first ever, and hopefully annual, MN. spring gathering. I've narrowed down the options for parks to two. The only thing I'm waiting on is word if the weekend I plan the gathering for is open or not. The gathering is tentatively scheduled for Friday May 19th thru Sunday May 21st. I will be reserving a large group campsite for us all, and I'm so excited I can hardly stand it. As far as themes for the gathering goes, I'm open to suggestions and I think putting a few ideas to a vote is a great way to go, that way everyone gets a say in things. My first idea was to have a theme of birth. whether it be the sprouting of spring flowers, the birth of new animals, the birth of children, the birth of the first MN gathering, the rising of the sun, etc. (My wife and I just had our first child in September, so that's where the whole birth idea comes from). I just think that spring is such<br/>
 a wonderful time of new beginings and there is so much to celebrate. The birth theme also leaves alot of room open for interpretation so that everyone has a very broad range of choices to carve from. As I said I'm open to suggestions from all and we'll put this to a vote a little later on. I have one special workshop I have planned  that doesn't have anything to do with letterboxing. I will be teaching those who have always wanted to learn how to juggle , how to juggle. I have been a juggler for several years and find it a most satisfying hobby. If there are those that can already juggle, I can show you many new and fun things. I digress, back to letterboxing, The gathering will start on Friday afternoon/early evening for the early birds from out of town so that you can hit several of our local boxes, over 40 within a short drive from either proposed site. It will be a camping weekend, with a huge "oatmeal dump" (I'll explain) early on Saturday morning to give us all lots of energy<br/>
 throughout the day to box like mad. Both parks have a resident four boxes in them already and my series of nine (It's a surprise)themed boxes will be making their debut! Plus whatever other stamps people will be contributing. O.K., "oatmeal dump" is just like a "chili dump", no wise cracks :) I'll be asking people to bring their favorite brand of oatmeal, regular not flavored please, and we'll "dump"  it into a huge pot to be shared among all of us. Kind of a community breakfast and a great way to get to know people before we all run off in seperate directions. I'll keep you all up to date on the specifics and as soon as the site is picked I'll post info so you can check it out to start your planning. The two locations so far are either in Afton, MN. or in Marine on St Croix, Mn. both of which are just this (MN) side of the St Croix river. So they are both very close to Wisconsin, which leaves you no excuse to not be there :) Thank you for reading this long post, I look forward to<br/>
 meeting each and every one of you. If you have questions for me or would like to let me know you'll be there (Which would be much appreciated so I know how large of a group campsite I need to reserve) please email me at my hotmail account which is <crisper_33@hotmail.com<br>
<br/>
  P.S.. Pay no attetion to the "&lt;" at the beginning of my email address, it isn't part of it,  I just didn't want it to turn blue :)<br/>
