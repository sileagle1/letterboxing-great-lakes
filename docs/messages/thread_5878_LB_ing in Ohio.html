                    <div class="plaintext-content">We will be in Cincinnati, we are visiting the zoo and Kings Island.<br>
We are leaving Sunday and Monday open to box on the way home.  We are not opposed to staying in Cincinnati another night either.<br>
<br>
I did a trip search on AQ for boxes north on 75. We don't want to go to far from the highway.  Beavercreek came up as having a lot of boxes<br>
but they were pretty scattered and a lot seemed like drive-by's.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know of a park with multiple boxes planted so we can make a day of it?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would suggest that you contact, franzsolo, Mama Stork, Team Mad Dawg <br>
or Lindsays Snowman for guidance.  If you like cemeteries, Spring Grove <br>
is a HUGE and stunningly gorgeous cemetery in the area.  In fact, if I <br>
remember correctly, it's the second largest in the nation and was <br>
designed to be a gathering place for the community. There are many great <br>
boxes there and you would get tons of walking in while exploring and <br>
boxing.  (Just one suggestion---but for the parks, the other folks would <br>
be your best bet.)<br>
