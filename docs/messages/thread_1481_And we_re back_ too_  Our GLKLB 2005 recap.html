swimming with all the people we met, all the boxes we<br/>
found, all the neat hidden surprises that were around.<br/>
 And I must say, I was taken aback a few times when<br/>
Deedle &amp; I introduced ourselves and were greeted with,<br/>
"YOU'RE Doodle &amp; Deedle Bug!"  Wasn't expecting that,<br/>
made us feel so special! :)<br/>
<br/>
Alas, we headed out to box during Mark &amp; Sue's<br/>
Dartmore talk, so we're not in the group photo - but<br/>
we were captured on the photo titled "More Stamping"<br/>
(I'm in the bandana, Deedle's in the flannel) so there<br/>
is proof that we were there!     <br/>
<br/>
Too exhausted to find all the boxes on Saturday, since<br/>
we were camping in the area we went back to the park<br/>
Sunday morning to find a few more.  And wouldn't you<br/>
know it, we found a cuckoo clue in the one box, but<br/>
because the clue specified that it was for the<br/>
gathering, and given where we determined the box would<br/>
have been we're pretty sure that it wasn't there for<br/>
us to find any longer.  Ah well....<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to go over all the stamp images we gathered<br/>
this weekend again!  But alas, it's Monday morning,<br/>
and here I am back at work...reading emails about<br/>
letterboxing ;)<br/>
