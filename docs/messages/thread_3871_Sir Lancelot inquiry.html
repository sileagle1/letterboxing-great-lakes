<br/>
I'm asking for my mom who is currently in South Carolina without any<br/>
internet...<br/>
<br/>
She is wondering if Sir Lancelot is planted and ready to find? If I<br/>
understood her phone message correctly she swung through on the way to<br/>
SC and couldn't find it and wants to swing by again on her way home.<br/>
At one point it was reported missing? The holy grail web site does not<br/>
list it as missing... But, anyway. She said it was once missing, she<br/>
couldn't find it, she wonders if it's still missing or if she is just<br/>
clue-impaired.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we want to road trip to Minnesota during my spring break after<br/>
Easter. So if there are any vital updates about grail boxes there<br/>
please let me know that, too. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
LG.<br/>

leaves on the trail (no snow, it was a warm end of the year).  We <br/>
can't claim that we took the shortest path to reach him, he was a bit <br/>
elusive and some wandering in circles and unnecessary detours did <br/>
occur.  <br/>

On another note, both Sir Lancelot and King Arthur may be moving to new locations this spring due to the unpleasant tick problems at their current locations.  If this happens, Dragon will be updated immediately and we will also post a message to this list.<br/>

infested with ticks while retrieving King Arthur and Patsy over Labor <br/>
Day weekend!  They're located on a less frequently traveled path, and <br/>
when I returned from going off-trail to get them, my legs were COVERED <br/>
in the icky little buggers and spread some to Atom too (luckily we both <br/>
always wear pants).  This was our first experience with ticks, and we <br/>
were all itchy and grossed out for the rest of the day. :P:P  I don't <br/>
remember having any problems retrieving Lancelot though, and we didn't <br/>
have tick problems with him.  I guess only King Arthur gets to be that <br/>
well-guarded!<br/>
