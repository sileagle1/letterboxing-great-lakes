                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, as of 4-23-10, 84% of all bingo words have been called.<br/>
<br/>
89% of boxes<br/>
88% of trailnames<br/>
80% of events<br/>
80% of general terms<br/>
<br/>
93% of B <br/>
81% of I<br/>
74% of N<br/>
85% of G<br/>
89% of O<br/>
<br/>
Which means, 99% of the time, Sprinchick CANNOT be bought to call your words (unless you through in some wicked craft paper and plane tickets to see her grandkids, which, I'm pretty sure, will get you the FULL card bingo!)<br/>
<br/>
So, my guess is this.....90% of the Illinois and Wisconsin people are all waiting for the same words...7% have given up long ago...and 3% are dipping into Tiptoe and Tonto's famous spa and don't give a darn about BINGO now (We can include Spartanfans here too!)<br/>
<br/>
So, your odds of Sprinchick working her magic fingers in your favor for what's left is this:<br/>
<br/>
You have a 9% chance she will call a B word, 24% chance for I, 33% chance for N, 19% chance for G, and a 14% chance for O (THIS, of course, will all change after 4-24-10!)<br/>
<br/>
And, to add more fun, you have a 24% chance that the next word will be a letterbox, a 14% chance that it will be either a letterboxer or an event, and a 48% chance that it will be be a general term...this too shall change after 4-24-10.<br/>
<br/>
So, what does this mean for you? What are your odds of winning? Why don't you check out these odds and see if yours are better:<br/>
<br/>
Odds of being murdered: 18,000 to 1<br/>
<br/>
Odds of getting away with murder: 2 to 1<br/>
<br/>
Odds that a celebrity marriage will last a lifetime: 3 to 1<br/>
<br/>
Odds of getting hemorrhoids: 25 to 1 <br/>
<br/>
Chance of winning a bingo game where 100 players manage four cards each: 1 in 100 <br/>
<br/>
Chance of having a stroke: 1 in 6<br/>
<br/>
Chance of dying from heart disease: 1 in 3<br/>
<br/>
Chance of getting arthritis: 1 in 7<br/>
<br/>
Chance of suffering from asthma or allergy diseases: 1 in 6<br/>
<br/>
Chance of getting the flu this year: 1 in 10<br/>
<br/>
Odds of being killed on a 5-mile bus trip: 500,000,000 to 1<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about your chances at wining the bingo, but I would say the bus trip looks pretty good! (want more? http://www.funny2.com/odds.htm )<br/>

Anyhow...anyone want to take a guess on who is going to take it all? and from what state?<br/>

Well, after seeing the list of odds...Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man could possibly win based on the fact that they have already won an Olympic Medal this year ...thus conquering the 662,000 to 1 odds...Then again, Tonto is thinking he will be the full card BINGO winner as he already feels that he has beat the odds on becoming a saint...20,000,000 to 1...for being married to Tiptoe for almost 30 years.  She on the other hand, thinks she could come out on top because that last statement is causing her to choke (chances 1 in 370,035) and she also will bump up her chances for striking it rich on Antique Roadshow (60,000 to 1) when she trades Tonto in as a definite "antique"....that is if he can survive the 1 in 5,005,564 odds of not dying from contact with hot tap water as he is presently in the bowels of the basement with the plumber!<br/>

Fun statistics -- thanks Fo6. :)<br/>
<br/>
And thanks to WiHi for the vote of confidence, but as for Atom or I <br/>
winning Bingo, I'm afraid it's not looking good for either one of us <br/>
again this year (although I don't know off-hand how many he has left - <br/>
Pace may have just helped him out a lot). Unfortunately, I still have 4 <br/>
open spots left, and chances are someone else in IL or WI needs the same <br/>
words, only fewer of them! :P<br/>
<br/>
Coffee Beans<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm going to guess that one of the Atomic Beans (IL) will win. They've <br/>
&gt; been faithfully playing every year and have never won - they are <br/>
&gt; probably due!<br/>

I will still anxiously check email though, just like I have for the past four months!<br/>

&gt;I'm definitely winless! But, I don't think I qualify for your <br/>
&gt;luck-wishes. Pretty sure I didn't play the first year.  I think I was <br/>
&gt;on the board, watching, but I don't think I participated in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the only way I can win this year is if SC does call a wild <br/>
&gt;card word tomorrow and it matches mine, as well as tomorrows word <br/>
&gt;matching mine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But, I'd be willing to bet that tomorrow will bring a post that <br/>
&gt;declares at least the first, if not all 3, of the full card winners.<br/>

      Well hopefully the winner will be someone who has played EVERY year (4 years!), but is still waiting for a win.  If my notes are accurate, that would include:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Atom 118 &amp; Coffee Beans<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BNL BaliGirl<br/>
<br/>

Fun statistics -- thanks Fo6. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And thanks to WiHi for the vote of confidence, but as for Atom or I <br/>
<br/>
winning Bingo, I'm afraid it's not looking good for either one of us <br/>
<br/>
again this year (although I don't know off-hand how many he has left - <br/>
<br/>
Pace may have just helped him out a lot). Unfortunately, I still have 4 <br/>
<br/>
open spots left, and chances are someone else in IL or WI needs the same <br/>
<br/>
words, only fewer of them! :P<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Coffee Beans<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I'm going to guess that one of the Atomic Beans (IL) will win. They've <br/>
<br/>
&gt; been faithfully playing every year and have never won - they are <br/>
<br/>
&gt; probably due!<br/>
