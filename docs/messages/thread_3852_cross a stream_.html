I don't think I'd cross a stream in the rainy season with small children. <br>
I don't think I'd go to a game area during hunting season, or ford knee<br>

I'm curious about the poll though.  Who's the extreme boxer among us?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL  I am I guess the extreme boxer?!  I sure didn't THINK I would be <br>
the only one, but on the other hand I skydive among other high adventure <br>
type things. To most, I know that sounds like a big risk taking type <br>
person, but I am extremely disciplined and put many safeguards in place <br>
when I do any of these type things.  I answered yes to the one about <br>
crossing the creek and did it for a box in the NE area of Ohio right <br>
after all the rains came through after Hurricane Katrina. <br>
<br>
I had no idea I would have to do this...and I suppose neither did the <br>
person who planted the box.  I always carry extra clothes with me <br>
letterboxing in general.  Had I had small children with me, I definitely <br>
would not have done that.  I also picked up my cell phone and called a <br>
friend to let them know what I was doing before attempting this...just <br>
in case.  (Yes, I got lectures!!)  :)  It is a memorable box for me.  I <br>
will say that I did stop short of reaching into a spot for a box after I <br>
traveled from Ohio to MD and then another hour long hike when the clues <br>
said that this was an area with high risk of rattlesnakes...?!  Even <br>
though I was standing right in front of the huge boulder that "looked <br>
like a couch" I did not reach in.  Does that count???<br>

Something for new folks to always keep in the back of one's mind is when the<br>
box was planted.<br>
<br>
Waterfall Glen in Darien, IL comes to mind.  It has some wildly fluctuating<br>
terrain.  During the fall and late winter (especially if it's been a winter<br>
with little snow cover), there are many parts that can be easily walked on<br>
and one's tootsies will never come in touch with a single drop of water.<br>
During the spring, those same areas will have a person sinking, oh, maybe<br>
ankle deep in mud.  In summer, those areas will be knee deep in good ol'<br>
water.<br>
<br>
I always like to check the placement date on the clues to see what types of<br>
vegetative landmarks might be missing because of the season I'm searching vs<br>
the season the box was planted (small trails that were so easy to<br>
distinguish in summer can seem completely missing when the leaves fall and<br>
cover everything later in the year), but I also check the placement date to<br>
note if the type of terrain might also have changed......from dry<br>
land........to swamp.......to pond......<br>
<br>
Drought is another thing to keep in mind.  There's a box in Kane County, IL<br>
that basically has a person walking up a creekbed.  In some of the droughty<br>
summers we've had lately, there's really not much danger and it's fairly<br>
easy to walk up the creekbed.  The creekbed, however, is rock, and not flat<br>
rocks at that, with a lot of fallen branches and logs to trip over, so at<br>
the times when the creek has water in it, even if it's only ankle deep or<br>
maybe calf deep, it's going to be very slippery and dangerous.  Breaking<br>
thru the brush to go up via shoreline is a possibility but it's tough going<br>
and going up via creekbed will seem deceptively easy but actually could be<br>
quite dangerous.<br>
<br>
But whoever planted the box may never have been there when there was water<br>
in the creek to realize that and I know that when the box was planted, it<br>
was a baaad drought and there wasn't a drop of water in the creek.<br>

3 trys to find one box.  Extremely easy to find in the winter (that was<br>
when it was placed and the theme of the box), but finding it in the<br>
summer, well, was for the chipmunks!  I could not even see the logs that<br>
it was supposed to be in the weeds, etc. were so tall (did not help we<br>
were new at it at the time).<br>
