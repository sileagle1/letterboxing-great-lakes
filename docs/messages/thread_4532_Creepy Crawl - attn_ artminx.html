I've had a few groups drop out of the crawl and I'm thinking it won't <br/>
be as overwhelming as I orignially thought.  If you still want to do <br/>
the crawl part, you can go ahead and sign up.  You have to figure out <br/>
the location names ahead of time for the 8 boxes.  I think you should <br/>
have plenty of time to do that, they aren't that hard.  Sign up <br/>
through AQ and be sure to get all the clues and info off the blog.  <br/>
The clues for boxes 3, 5, 6 and an answer sheet are stored in the <br/>
files section of this group.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you decide to come to the whole event,<br/>
