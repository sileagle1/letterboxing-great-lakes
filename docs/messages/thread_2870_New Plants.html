I have been wondering that myself.  I have a box in Clinton Co., Mich.,<br/>
listed on LbNA, but on the overview map, Clinton is still not showing<br/>
as green.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The "green" counties at one time were a representation of the counties with <br/>
letterboxes.  As this is a manual process and there are only a couple of <br/>
people who do the map graphics, it is not accurate.  Since letterboxing has <br/>
virtually exploded in the past couple of years and there are several dozen <br/>
new boxes planted every day (as compared to a couple dozen a month when the <br/>
county coloring first began), it is nearly impossible to keep this <br/>
up-to-date and frankly I think we stopped trying to keep up with it.  At <br/>
some point, the color variance should probably just be eliminated, but it <br/>
isn't at the top of the to-do list.<br/>
<br/>
Even when there were fewer boxes and is was easier to stay on top of it, you <br/>
never could be sure as many mystery boxes are listed without a county and <br/>
may be in a county that otherwise appears boxless.  On top of that, now that <br/>
some people list their boxes on AtlasQuest and not on LbNA, there wouldn't <br/>
be an easy way to keep up with boxes listed both places.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to find out if a county has boxes is to check the regional <br/>
pages on LbNA and do a search on AtlasQuest.<br/>
