out there that are LBers, so I know you all know the kind of heart <br/>
ache I am going through. I thought it would be nice to include any <br/>
LBer who has lost a pet in this memorial box. I was thinking that not <br/>
only could you leave your stamp in the log book, but maybe bring a <br/>
stamp of your deceased pet and commemorate the good times you had with <br/>
your pet by sharing a story in the log book. I'm not sure if anyone <br/>
would be interested in something like this, but I'm going to give it a <br/>
try. I think it will help the healing process for me and I hope it <br/>
will for others too. I just need a location in SE Mi to place it. Any <br/>
suggestions? I was thinking of a spot that would not be too buggy, so <br/>
people would not feel rushed. A nice spot for reflection and serenity. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to hear about your cat. :-( If you are ever in the Ann Arbor <br/>
area, there is a box here (by clickermom, I think) called "In Memory <br/>
Of..." that is actually very similar to what you are proposing. The <br/>
logbook encourages the finder to write down fond memories of pets who <br/>
are no longer here. So if you would like some inspiration, or just a <br/>
place to write about your cat, you should visit this box! (Plus, the <br/>
stamp is great!)<br/>

I think that's a wonderful idea!!!  A few years ago, I lost my <br/>
Mastiff.  His stomach flipped and he already had it flipped back over <br/>
twice before.  He was outside and I checked on him and he was okay.  <br/>
I was waiting for my dad to come home to take him back to the vet to <br/>
have him checked out.  I came back 5 min later to check on him, and <br/>
he passed away.  I was so mad and upset, I screamed!!!  My dad and <br/>
our neighbor came and took him away to the vet.  The vet Dr. was very <br/>
nice and knows are family well and he took care of Maverick for me.  <br/>
I cried for days!!!  About a week later, a neighbor across the street <br/>
told me about a greyhound who was abused and needed a good home, and <br/>
thought we could help each other out.  Well, I wanted him site <br/>
unseen, and he's been there for me as I have been there for him.  He <br/>
was really scared of people, especially men, but a year later, he was <br/>
alot better.  His name is Waylon. I still cry when I think of <br/>
Maverick, but having Waylon helps ease the pain a little.  <br/>
