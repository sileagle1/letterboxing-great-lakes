for ticks that have already attached themselves (ugh); I will keep this <br/>
method in mind and hope I never have to use it :)   I am also glad to hear <br/>
that you two have given up, at least temporarily,  your banditry against <br/>
unsuspecting boxers whom you have nefariously lured out into the woods <br/>
heheheheh<br/>
<br/>
I have created a photo album in the "Photos" section for this group entitled <br/>
"DOGS" and have put in pictures of our shelties, Harry and Silvie.  I'd love <br/>
to see pics of other letterboxing dogs and encourage you all to add pics of <br/>
your own companion dogs.<br/>

<br/>
Our new letterboxing doggie, Kemosabe, had a bout with ticks two weeks <br/>
ago...We<br/>
checked online and found the following video very helpful, if not darn right <br/>
fun to do!<br/>
<br/>
http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-remove-a-tick/<br/>
<br/>
It worked so well that we were hoping he would get more ticks so we could do <br/>
this<br/>
remarkably easy trick to remove them....Tiptoe actually has a thing for <br/>
insects, bugs etc.<br/>
