<br/>
Wondering if anyone still had access to the clue packet from the Harvest and Haunts event this last October? One Love Journeying and Lighthouse Keeper will be out Saturday at Cottage Grove Ravine Park. We have printed off the clues, however, it looks like it would be easier to just follow the packet since some of them are in order of one another.<br/>
<br/>
Also if there are any MN boxers that would like to join us we would love to meet you! We plan to get out to the park around 9am. There is a 30% chance of rain but if your hardcore like we are a little rain won't stop you from some fantastic letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone!<br/>
<br/>
LK and OLJ<br/>
