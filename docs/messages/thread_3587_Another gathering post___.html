the Memphis Drive-In.  A moment of silence, for the<br>
drive-in was located here in Brooklyn, Ohio, operated<br>
for over 50 years and was the last drive-in still<br>
operating in Cuyahoga County.  They closed their gates<br>
forever in October 2006.  Well, closed at least until<br>
Deedle & I can make our millions and buy back the<br>
drive-in and buy the entire corporation that purchased<br>
it in their effort to take over Brooklyn ;)<br>
<br>
In other news, concerning the Camping Database, when I<br>
set it up I didn't do something right so people<br>
couldn't edit their entries.  That should be fixed<br>
now.  (Note to Atom 118 & Coffee Beans - I deleted<br>
your original entry that you weren't able to add your<br>
campsite to)<br>
<br>
Also, so that the hotel campers didn't feel left out,<br>
I was going to create a database for them to list the<br>
hotel they're staying at if they wanted.  But Yahoo<br>
wouldn't let me create a new database (either we've<br>
met our allowed database quota, or Yahoo got tired of<br>
me adding stuff).  So, if the hotel campers want to<br>
add an entry to the Camping database (GLG 2007<br>
Camping) go ahead, and list your hotel as your<br>
campsite.<br>
<br>
Time to rest my hand so I can start on our drive-in<br>
stamp!<br>
