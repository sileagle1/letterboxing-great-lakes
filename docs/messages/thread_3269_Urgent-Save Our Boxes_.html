                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last night, I drafted a letter to the sorry excuse for a journalist <br>
who irresponsibly wrote and printed that article about letterboxing <br>
in the newspaper in the Pinckney, Michigan area.  This morning, I <br>
reviewed the letter, made corrections, toned down my extreme level <br>
of frustration but got straight to the point before sending the <br>
email letter to the reporter.  Then, I called the reporter and left <br>
a 'friendly message' for him to call me.  GRRRRR!!!!  IF he hasn't <br>
read his emails and unknowingly dares to call me back, I plan to <br>
give it to him with both barrels loaded!!!  I think we also need to <br>
contact the editors and editorial board of that newspaper to let <br>
them know that the reckless way in which that article was written <br>
and printed shows a lack of professionalism and a failure to do the <br>
necessary research before printing a story.  GRRRRRRRR!!!<br>
<br>
Dragon, we feel your pain and frustration.  As I told <br>
this 'reporter', and I use that designation term loosely, he <br>
obviously doesn't have a clue how much time and effort goes into <br>
researching and writing a clue, before an individual creates a <br>
letterbox.  SHAME ON THIS REPORTER!!!<br>
<br>
So what are serious letterboxers learning from these recent media <br>
articles?  <br>
<br>
1.  Nothing on the Internet is private.  <br>
2.  Clues need to be challenging.  I recall spending 6 months <br>
reseraching one clue just to reveal the starting point.  Most <br>
newbies won't bother with that clue.  I found that box! <br>
3.  Never trust the media!<br>
4.  Once, a wise letterboxer advised me: Always include compass <br>
bearings in your clue. This will prevent most weekend family thrill <br>
seekers from looking for that box. This is true.   <br>
5.  Another wise letterboxer shared this thought with me: It is OK <br>
to post a clue on LbNA or AQ, but when it comes to specifics, force <br>
the person to contact the placer of the box. So, I tried this <br>
approach.  WOW!!!  You cannot believe the type of emails you will <br>
receive.  The inquires you will receive will make your toe nails <br>
curl!  <br>
<br>
Sometimes, I will create s simple drive by box for beginners.  If it <br>
goes missing, so what.  I don't spend a lot of time on drive by box <br>
stamps or logbooks.  <br>
<br>
When boxes go missing, we as clue writers must realize that we are <br>
partically to blame.  Yes, I will accept part of the blame when my <br>
boxes go missing.  I vow to spend more time writing the clue in a <br>
way that also protects the box.  Maybe then, boxes will remain safer <br>
even when the media crosses the line and reveals clues in their <br>
publications.  <br>
