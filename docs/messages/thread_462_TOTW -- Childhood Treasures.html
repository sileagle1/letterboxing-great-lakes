Collectible coins from who-knows-where.  Maybe a few prized marbles, a matchbox car, and (best of all!) a real arrowhead dug up from my father's garden.  <br>

gumballs to fill a suitcase just trying to get me one silly little trinket.  And <br>
they used to make some great ones too back in those days.<br>

All I ever wanted to play with when I was little were those trinkets, model <br>

I remember glueing paper to the insides of the box so I could personalize the inside.  I don't really remember what I kept in it, though...the only thing I recall is my Hot Wheels car.  My brother had all the matchbox & hot wheels & other mini cars, but that ONE was mine.  It was white, and had a flag design on the hood.  I do recall that as I got older, I had kept my Girl Scout patches that couldn't fit on my sash in that box, and for all I know, they're all still in that box somewhere at my parents'...<br>
 <br>
One childhood treasure that wasn't kept in the box was the V.  My brother & I were HUGE Voltron fans.  We loved that cartoon, every day when it came on we watched, we'd race around on our bikes pretending to be the lions, and since our parents never bought us the Voltron toys we'd make our own with his Legos.  Anyway, we lived really close to our elementary school.  One day, we found this V.  It was one of those letter tiles, like the numbers that are put on houses to show the address.  Black background, raised white V.  So to us, it was the V for Voltron, and we kept it hidden in a hollow at the base of a tree at the school, and we'd make special visits to check on the V during the summer.  Hiding things in trees...my precursor to letterboxing?<br>

Sounds like a good letterbox series to me!  Collect all five lions in<br>
order to get the Voltron box!  And you already have one hiding location!<br>

Mind you, I'm a horrible packrat, so pretty much any drawer/box/whatever was chock full <br>
o' little treasures I had saved. I was (and sort of still am) always a sucker for small things <br>
-- cool trinkets from gumball machines & other charms, floaty pens, squished pennies, <br>
etc.<br>
<br>
I still actually collect some of the things I hoarded as a kid  -- most notably the floaty <br>
pens and squished pennies.<br>
<br>
Never had a cool cigar box to keep it all in, though. Of course, it's never too late to get <br>
one. :-)<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a child, I had a large jewelry box, all covered with golden <br>
paper, lined with velveteen, and endowed with song by a built-in <br>
music box.  This treasure trove was crammed with jewels: jacks <br>
and marbles; costume jewelry and trinkets from the gumball <br>
machine; skate keys and tiny rubber balls; individual playing <br>
cards that my mom used to trade and collect as a kid, cards I <br>
inherited as her eldest daughter.<br>
<br>
I kept the box locked at all times.  After all, I had two curious little <br>
sisters.  As a child who had her nose in a book more often than <br>
she could be prevailed upon to play with the "little kids," I was <br>
something of an enigma to them.<br>
<br>
One of my books was "Tony's Treasure Hunt."  As you can <br>
imagine, the story followed Tony as he followed a set of <br>
mysterious clues to find--surprise--a birthday present and party <br>
at the end of the hunt.  Always one to be inspired by literature, I <br>
set a hunt for my sisters and cleared the jewelry box of the <br>
baubles I was outgrowing.  I wrote clues, I planted trinkets as <br>
incentives along the way, and at the end they gained the big <br>
treasure chest.<br>
<br>
I wish I still had the clues, and I wish I could see the treasure <br>
chest again, but I've never regretted giving all that loot away.  It <br>
gave my sisters pleasure, I loved writing clues and being <br>
sneaky, and the memory of that hunt gives me even greater <br>
pleasure than my sisters took in it.<br>
<br>
Today, when I place a letterbox, I try to scan the stamp and <br>
photograph the logbook and packaging so I can have a good <br>
record that I can think back on with pleasure when the <br>
letterboxes ultimately go the way of all ephemera.<br>

double doors and on each "door" was a colonial drawing of a man and a <br>
woman.  In this box I stashed things that I couldn't part with.  <br>
Looking through that box recently I found there wasn't much of <br>
interest now, but I did have my first pair of glasses that I got in <br>
5th grade.  They were oval frames in a thick, black plastic.  I <br>
remember wearing them home from the eye doctor's and looking around <br>
in amazement at what I could now see.  When I found them I tried them <br>
on and, boy, did my kids have a good laugh!  Not exactly the height <br>
of fashion!  I don't think that style will EVER come around again!<br>

I started wearing glasses back in the 1950s.  Yep, I still have 'em.  Or had <br>
'em.  I recently found the earliest pairs missing.  A friend of ours is an <br>
actor and his son is in the theater department at the local high school.  They're <br>
doing "Grease."   He stole my 1950s pairs for the play.  <br>

  Heh. Different kind of squished pennies, actually. I collect the little<br>

I got my first pair of glasses in '83, where the style<br>

Armadillo's college "box o' crap" reminded me of my<br>
freshman year of college.  A lot of my friends were<br>
still in high school, and I told them that anything, I<br>
meant ANYTHING they sent me I'd hang up in my college<br>
dorm room.  I had a string of empty sugar packets that<br>
we'd gone through one night at a coffee shop hanging<br>
up in the room, all scotch-taped together into a long<br>
strand, like garland.  And we kept adding to the<br>
chain...there were well over 50 empty sugar packets<br>
hanging up in my dorm room.  My roommate must have<br>
loved me.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Geez oh pizza! **I** had a box of treasures too! LOL ... too funny, <br>
how so many of us did.<br>
<br>
More amusing still, is how many of us still have either the box <br>
itself or at least some of the treasures. <br>
<br>
My box of treasures was a small portion of the wooden tool box my <br>
Great Grandfather made for himself and used as long as I knew him. <br>
It was divided into three sections and had many of the same things <br>
you've all mentioned plus a few other odd ball things. <br>
<br>
My mother still says that the oddest thing I ever wanted for my box <br>
was what I asked for as my First Communion gift (yes, I'm another <br>
one who grew up Catholic ... lol) when my Grandparents asked me. I <br>
told them I wanted some "pretty rocks for my box" Now, mind you, I <br>
didn't then and still don't think that was odd at all. (grin)<br>
<br>
My Grandparents came through aces up! They bought me a very cool set <br>
of 12 gemstones mounted in a wonderful, tiny little box with itty-<br>
bitty pull out drawers. I still have some of the gemstones, but the <br>
box and most of the stones where lost sometime when Bindle Bum (ex-<br>
military) and I moved 7 times within 5 years. (My family started <br>
making jokes that I didn't "do" spring cleaning anymore, I just <br>
moved. LOL!!)<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
