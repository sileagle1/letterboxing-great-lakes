<br/>
I'll share 2 trail encounters.  We had a couple and their dog pass us <br/>
while we were stamping in, they came from a side trail and went by <br/>
us.  We continued down on the trail and eventually came to a location <br/>
of a box near where the same couple was sitting by the river.  We <br/>
commented on the lovely location and were comtemplating if we could <br/>
quitely grab the box (the couple was further in front of where we <br/>
were with their backs to us) continue down the bank and find a place <br/>
downstream to stamp in when the couple got up and headed back up the <br/>
trail.  As they passed us, the woman turned and asked, "Are you <br/>
geocaching?"  We explained the difference between letterboxing and <br/>
geocaching, hopefully this will be one couple that will not disturb a <br/>
letterbox if they find one on their travels.<br/>
<br/>
The second encounter was coming back up from the lake on the north <br/>
side of the park.  We saw a creature in a tree.  It was a small tree, <br/>
maybe a 10" diameter trunk.  The creature had apparently heard us <br/>
coming and climbed the tree, clinging to the side opposite the <br/>
direction that we were coming from.  Unfortunatly for his attempt to <br/>
hide, he stuck out on both sides.  We went past the tree and stopped <br/>
to look and see what it was, I thought it was a porcupine.  When we <br/>
asked someone at the shelter though we were told that they didn't <br/>
think they lived around the area.  I thought about it all way home, <br/>
because I couldn't think of anything else that fit that description, <br/>
so I went on the parks website today.  Sure enough, under the list of <br/>
mammals for the park, there is a porcupine listing.  So that was my <br/>
first ever siting of one!<br/>
