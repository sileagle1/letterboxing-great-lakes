<br/>
First, we will not be able to make it to the June gathering :-(<br/>
So sad *sniff* Hopefully next year!!<br/>
<br/>
Now, this Saturday we will be driving down to Champaign, IL (are there <br/>
any other Champaigns' in other great lake states?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone in the Champaign area that may want to meet up for an exchange? <br/>
We will be finding a few boxes while we are down there. Any <br/>
recomendations?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are several on this list from Cham-bana!  Unfortunately, Flying Dragon and I are heading to Chicago (ok, Rosemont, but close enough) to engage in another obsession this weekend (the 10th annual Anime Central Anime Convention!) so we won't be in town. <br/>
<br/>
There is a Champaign (and an Urbana, also in a Champaign county), OH.  The towns here in IL were actually named for the ones in OH!<br/>
<br/>
I have to be honest, I haven't really kept up to date on all of the boxes planted here (darn school, getting in the way of important things like letterboxing!) so I can't say that I really have any particular recommendations.  Just a word of caution though, UofI graduation is this weekend, so be very aware of what's going on if you decide to go after any of the boxes on campus because there may be a lot of people milling about.  Also, Saturday is the first Market on the Square (our local farmer's market...great fun, but also always draws a great huge crowd every saturday) so if you plan on going after my DNAngel boxes I suggest waiting until afternoon (the market usually wraps up by 1pm at the latest).  And my boxes out at Homer Lake are both sitting on my table waiting for me to get a chance to run back out there and replant them, so don't go looking for Hands OFF! or the GLK Exchange box.<br/>

they're in a really neat park about 20 miles SW of Champaign/Urbana.  We <br/>
also did a few of the Urbana Park boxes.<br/>
