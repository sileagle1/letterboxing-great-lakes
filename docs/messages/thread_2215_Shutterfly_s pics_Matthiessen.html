dry. The picture was taken the previous summer (2004) when you first <br/>
placed the Hershey's Hike box. Those stepping stones were so fun, but <br/>
I was constantly worried I would drop my camera as I went from one to <br/>
the other. :) I can't wait to have a rainy summer when I can go back <br/>
and see the waterfalls!<br/>
