                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple of the most common general purpose orienteering compasses are a Silva and Suunto, but I'm sure there are others that are good also.  Most of the major sporting goods stores carry either Silva or Suunto or both.  I got my Silva Explorer at Dunham's a couple years ago for about $20.  You don't need a fancy model -- look for a fluid-filled baseplate compass -- which means it has a rectangular baseplate (preferably transparent for ease in using on a map) -- with a transparent housing (the round part with the numbers inside), preferably with gripping ridges.  Other nice to have features -- ruler edge, magnifying lens and stencil holes.<br>
