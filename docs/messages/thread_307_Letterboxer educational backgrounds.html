                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've also wondered if there is any "certain type" of person that is drawn to<br>
letterboxing.  It definitely does seem to be of interest to teachers (at<br>
least 4 of the Wisconsin crew).  However it also seems to attract technical<br>
people.  The teachers I know of that LB in Wisconsin are not English<br>
teachers, but math/science oriented:  nursing, math, computer<br>
science/electrical engineering.  Others are not teachers, but have science<br>
related jobs.  Neither my husband nor I teach, but we do fall into the<br>
technical area (my bachelor's was in Electrical Engineering and he works in<br>
Information Technology).  Note: One of the 4 is an Art teacher.<br>
<br>
Since LB combines many different aspects, that may be why it appeals to a<br>
wide range of people.  Martini Man & I love puzzles and games, so the "clue<br>
aspect" is a major draw for us.  When I was a kid, I would play spy games<br>
and in grade school we were always devising codes and writing secret<br>
messages rolled inside fountain pens (yes, I'm old enough that we actually<br>
did use fountain pens in Catholic grade school).  When we first started<br>
LBing last summer we laughed at ourselves for playing "secret agent man" in<br>
our late 40s.  However we had too much fun to let that stop us.  Now we tell<br>
people that LBing is "hiking with an intellectual aspect" to make our<br>
playing sound a little more serious!  However most people still think we're<br>
nuts...<br>

I was a journalism major who comes from a family with a long history of<br>
teachers<br>
(including 2 current ones: my mom and brother).<br>
<br>
Is that close enough? :-)<br>
