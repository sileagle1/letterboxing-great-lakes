One of the things I included in my Letterboxing presentation at the<br>
local library was a bit about animals sense of smell. I wanted to<br>
impress on the kids that they should not be eating snacks while out<br>
hunting boxes. Food smells may transfer from hands to the box or its<br>
contents and attract hungry or curious animals. The animals may then<br>
destroy the box just because they are looking for the food they smell.<br>
I also stressed to them that the best thing for cleaning stamps is<br>
plain water, again because any lingering scent may attract animals who<br>
wonder that that smell might be. <br>
<br>
Here is the science behind what I was telling the kids: <br>
Humans have an olfactory membrane that covers about 4 square cm. which<br>
is just barely the size of two postage stamps.<br>
The size of a cats olfactory membrane is about 14 square cm. <br>
A dogs olfactory membrane is huge by comparison and covers up to 150<br>
square cm. which is an area equivalent to a large pocket handkerchief.<br>
<br>
To help you understand what the size of the olfactory membrane means:<br>
 a normal dog can smell a variety of substances at concentrations<br>
1,000 to one million times lower than humans.  <br>
<br>
Stunning, isn't it?  And you know that wild animals have to hunt for<br>
all of their food (which takes up a great part of their existance) so<br>
will check out anything that offers even the remotest chance of being<br>
a meal ... especially if it seems like an easy meal (meaning it won't<br>
try to eat them!)<br>
<br>
Plus there are some animals that are just plain curious and will check<br>
out just about anything just to see what it is. (Toss an empty paper<br>
bag on the floor in front of your cat and just watch how they can't<br>
resist sticking their nose in there just to check it out.)<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
