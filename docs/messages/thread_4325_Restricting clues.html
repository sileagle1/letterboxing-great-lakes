Not everyone wants to log their finds publicly, including even some "serious" letterboxers.<br>

This isn't meant as a flame...<br>
I just think there are many, many people who enjoy boxing, hiking,  <br>
being outdoors that don't log (or have time to log) all their finds;  <br>
yet I would consider them serious boxers.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Didn't mean to open a can of worms regarding the option to limit clues <br>
by found counts, as I said in an earlier post, I don't think the answer <br>
is to have all clues restricted in some way. Just wanted to point out <br>
one option that may (or may not) discourage some less scrupulous <br>
hunters. As some LBers have pointed out, I think a variety of LB <br>
options is great - the easier ones will appeal to beginners and those <br>
limited for other reasons (physical ability, children, etc), the more <br>
challenging ones will appeal to another set and some to both. That's <br>
part of what makes it so appealing.<br>
