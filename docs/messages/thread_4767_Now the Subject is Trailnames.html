 <br>
I've been brainstorming trailnames for the twins ever since they were just  a <br>
year old.<br>
 <br>
Best I could come up with for Maddie as Little Chickadee, Li'l  Chickadee.<br>
 <br>
I have NO idea for Will.<br>
 <br>
SO I'll open that up for the group.... ideas for the twins trailnames (go  <br>
ahead and give suggestions for Maddie as well).<br>

  A friend of mine has 2 sets of twins and it seems when each set was born they were often called "this one" &  "that one". Usually the names were followed by a question mark, since we couldn't tell them apart for a while. I always thought it was kinda funny!<br>

How about a Seuss theme:  Thing 1 and Thing 2 (although it does sound <br>
rather impersonal).  Or since a hart is another name for deer, you <br>
could have deer/dear one and two.<br>
