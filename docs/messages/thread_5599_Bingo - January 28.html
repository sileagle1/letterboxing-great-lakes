“What’s Happening!” I'll tell you what...this little monkey is beginning to think “My So Called Life” is “Lost in Space!”  I’ve become “An Alien in America.”  It is a “Fact(s) of Life” that no one will even associate with me.  I’ve become “That Girl” that everyone calls “The Biggest Looser.”  I’m trying not to get “Maude(lin)” about all of this loss, but in my defense, I feel I was “Miss Guided” into believing that I’d get at least one word called in a months time. It’s going to take a “Leap of Faith” to believe that tomorrow will be a brighter day. In that light, today’s TV Bingo word is “Mission: Impossible.”<br>
