“What’s Happening!” I'll tell you what...this little monkey is beginning to think “My So Called Life” is “Lost in Space!”  I’ve become “An Alien in America.”  It is a “Fact(s) of Life” that no one will even associate with me.  I’ve become “That Girl” that everyone calls “The Biggest Looser.”  I’m trying not to get “Maude(lin)” about all of this loss, but in my defense, I feel I was “Miss Guided” into believing that I’d get at least one word called in a months time. It’s going to take a “Leap of Faith” to believe that tomorrow will be a brighter day. In that light, today’s TV Bingo word is “Mission: Impossible.”<br/>

&gt; My bet is that Tiptoe will by out for blood at The Iditarod. All you<br/>
&gt; other participants better watch if she is foaming at the mouth that<br/>
&gt; day! LOL<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yeah, I almost typed something yesterday about Tiptoe trying to<br/>
have her<br/>
&gt; &gt; streak be a whole month.... but then deleted it.  However she<br/>
&gt; obviously is<br/>
&gt; &gt; taking it in stride with all those humorous TV posts!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; GO TIPTOE!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Wisconsin Hiker<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S.  To make up for Bingo, she will probably win the Iditarod!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Bali! How could you???? I mean, we were all thinking the same thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; but we weren't going to say it out loud!!! Sure, why don't you kick<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tiptoe a little more while she's down? I'm sure there's a spot left<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere near the right rib. (hee hee)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; and speaking of the Lions, that is really funny.<br/>
