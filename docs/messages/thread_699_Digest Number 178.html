You should be ashamed of yourself. The dog isn't the problem in this situation. <br>
<br>
>You'd think she'd learn a lesson, right...? <br>
<br>
You're the human, bless your heart, with the superior intellect. You accepted responsibility for the well being and safety of that poor dumb animal when you elected to make her your pet. After the lucky break you got when the window shattered the first time, and there were no injuries, why didn't YOU "learn a lesson" and come up with a way to keep her safe and protect your truck? How come it's the dogs fault?<br>
<br>
Right glad that she didn't get hurt none this time and sure hope you come up with a idea or two on how to prevent that from happening again.<br>

Subject: Anyone want a dog...cheap???<br>
<br>
Scenario: A beautiful Indian summer day, clear blue sky, no rain in<br>
forecast, temp in the 70's. Husband Tom left 4:00 this morning for a<br>
weeklong fishing trip in Canada. Daughter Michelle is in school and has<br>
practice afterwards until 5:00. I bought groceries yesterday, so I have<br>
nothing pressing to do (well, there's always housecleaning, but who wants to<br>
do that?). "Hey, Hershey, want to go bye-bye in the car? Want to go<br>
letterboxing?" Needless to say, she's right there. I pack up the gear, put<br>
her in the back seat, rev up the Jeep, power down the back window for her<br>
and CRASH! My back passenger window is shattered.<br>
<br>
Let me explain...she has this goofy habit that when the window goes down she<br>
growls and bites at the window. We used to think it was funny until she<br>
grabbed at Tom's Explorer's window and it shattered in her mouth. (no<br>
injury to her that time or this time, thankfully) You'd think she'd learn a<br>
lesson, right...? So now we have broken window #2 to deal with. The car<br>
gets unpacked, the insurance company called. I'm stuck at home on a<br>
gorgeous day cleaning up broken glass waiting for the repair place to call<br>
that the replacement window has arrived so I can go have it installed.<br>
<br>
On the plus side of this all, at least I have an inspiration for a new<br>
letterbox! "Bad Dog"...or how about "Dog in the Doghouse"..."Jaws (just<br>
when you thought it was safe to sit in the back seat...)"...hmmm, the<br>
possibilities are endless!<br>
