                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would like some words of wisdom about this.  One of our Underground <br/>
RR boxes is in Lombard, IL near a tiny little museum (which is <br/>
actually the homestead of the person that the letterbox is about).  <br/>
The clues start you out at the homestead, where you need to get some <br/>
info from outside signs.  Then you use these numbers in your clues to <br/>
find the box, which isn't a terrible distance away.  <br/>
<br/>
I got an email today from someone (a volunteer?) at the homestead, <br/>
wondering if they could put some information about this letterbox in <br/>
the museum.  I haven't replied yet, because I wanted to get some <br/>
other opinions.  This museum is really small and it is only open Tues <br/>
and Sat. afternoons (so I don't know how much traffic they get).  Am <br/>
I asking for trouble (i.e. a soon-to-be missing box) if I let this <br/>
museum post the clues?  I really don't know if they could give some <br/>
of the "rules" of letterboxing (stealth, rehide it well...)along with <br/>
the clues, which makes me a little leary.  Then I thought, maybe I <br/>
could just have the box in the museum, but the hours are so limited <br/>
that this might not work so well. <br/>
<br/>
Is there some way to work with them, without posting the clues??  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, any thoughts....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&gt; You might consider leaving the current box where it is, then place a <br/>
box in the museum that the museum curators feel some ownership over. <br/>
It might be a "bonus box" for regular letterboxers to go and get on <br/>
the days the museum is open. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had forgotten that that box was even there.  The area right now is pretty<br/>
bad with litter and trash because of how heavily the area is used by kids.<br/>
Some folks in the area have kind of been calling to see if the Sheriff's<br/>
dept might be agreeable to taking a jail work crew out there and doing some<br/>
spring clean up.  There's also a crew of Scouts that might come out and do<br/>
some spring clean up.  And our landscaping company also said they might be<br/>
agreeable to going outside the fence and doing some.  None of that will<br/>
probably come to pass but just a note of caution to keep an eye on the box<br/>
as we get into springtime because if anyone is picking up trash in that<br/>
area, they might not look that carefully at what they toss into their<br/>
garbage bags.  Anyone who finds the box needs to rehide it really well and<br/>
not leave it laying out or within sight.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don't know as if it'd be any too good for the box for the<br/>
museum to post the clues.  The box is too close to the museum, it's not a<br/>
long walk at all, and I think folks are likely to go follow the clues and<br/>
check it out without doing any studying up at all about the game.  Maybe the<br/>
museum, rather than directly giving out the clues, could let folks know that<br/>
there's a "game" attached to the museum, and have the museum direct folks to<br/>
letterboxing.org instead?  That way folks might wander into a little<br/>
research on letterboxing before they wander over to find the box.  I'd be<br/>
afraid of teachers taking classes of kids, or parents taking groups of<br/>
children, to follow the clues after they finish at the museum because it'd<br/>
be another good "learning tool" for math and such without realizing the need<br/>
for discretion and rehiding well.   Especially in the springtime.  And where<br/>
the box is hidden is well-travelled by kids on foot and on bike -- they're<br/>
likely to want to show the box to their pals without realizing the danger<br/>
they'd be putting the box in.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, you can always recarve the stamp and redo the box if any<br/>
of the above should happen.  And maybe the museum doesn't get that much<br/>
traffic anyway as far as field trips.  I would kind of think it would be a<br/>
popular place with the local schools, but maybe not.<br/>
