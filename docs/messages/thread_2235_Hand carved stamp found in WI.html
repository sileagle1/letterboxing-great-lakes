<br>
Our friend "JAB" (a relatively new letterboxer who is slowly <br>
convincing her friends to go out "on a short walk" with her to find <br>
boxes) was at our house tonight.  She gave us a stamp she found on the <br>
ground on Saturday near one of the boxes in Minooka Park in Waukesha.  <br>
It is a loose stamp, not in a baggie, nor did she mention any sign of <br>
a logbook nearby.  We don't think it is someone's personal stamp, but <br>
perhaps someone may have lost something they hoped to plant or perhaps <br>
a hitchhiker stamp that got separated from the rest of its package.  <br>
<br>
If anyone is looking for a political animal, let us know if this is <br>
your stamp and we'll make arrangements to get it back to you.<br>
