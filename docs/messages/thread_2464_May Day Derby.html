                    <div class="plaintext-content">The earlier boxes were not as tough as I was trying to seed the area and get people interested and didn't want to scare them away with logic puzzles and cryptic codes, etc.  Now that there are many boxes in the area, I am having some fun with different kinds of clues.  I have learned though that I need a reliable tester because I am a very poor judge of the difficulty of my own clues.  I have 6 boxes planted in a park in Grand Haven and I've always felt these were all quite *easy* and often recommend them to new boxers and families.  While the hikes themselves are not extremely long or strenuous, many people have written that the clues are more difficult than I felt they were...  well, I guess they were justified on the box whose major landmark had been hauled away in a truck at some point after I planted the box.<br/>
<br/>
But it is true, most of them, especially these days, are not straight follow-the-directions clues...  it's all about thinking outside the box.<br/>

  Oh, Howling Coyote ... now, come on.  You know in your heart, that not<br/>
  all of SpringChicks "regular" boxes are as tough as those darn logic<br/>
  puzzles. <br/>
<br/>
  Why, there's plenty of boxes that are perfect for beginners, families,<br/>
  or even people like me -- with limited mobility.<br/>

  ...it's all about thinking outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
Which is good, because thinking inside the box would be a bit cramped!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I just couldn't resist.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, that sounds like a fun party!  I've thought about trying something on that order with a series of letterboxes, but it would be quite involved and would require people to figure out the puzzle on the spot once they collected all of the clues.  The other bad thing is that if one box with a clue goes missing, the whole thing falls apart.  Still thinking on a way to administer something of that sort without the pitfalls.  But as a party game --- what a blast!  Might be fun for an event -- a twist on the clue mystery game...<br/>
