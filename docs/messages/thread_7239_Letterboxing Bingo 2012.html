Are you playing bingo this year? if so, you need to sign up ASAP as the game<br/>
starts on January 1st. Hey...I'll even make it easy for you. Go to the files<br/>
section and look for the bingo FAQs, rules, word list, gameboard, etc. You<br/>
can open up the bingo grid document, fill it out on your computer, save a<br/>
file, and then email it to me by the deadline. Then, mail out the paper<br/>
