probably have to expand your search circumference a bit.  But once you <br>
get the hang of what constitutes a good letterbox (type of hiding <br>
place, how to write good clues and carve a stamp, etc.), you can start <br>
placing your own, and then your neighborhood will be covered too.  <br>
Placing letterboxes can be just as much fun as finding them. <br>

--klk/FungusWoman, who will be happy to come find your boxes once you <br>
place them!<br>
