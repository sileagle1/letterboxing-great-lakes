from it!  I had a bag full of equipment for rock hounding so I'v left <br>

The fun thing that I'm working on for myself and for my two friends <br>
who join in, is a book for each of us that is gutted and turned into <br>
a sort of bag/purse.  It's just lined with fadded bandana fabric that <br>
is glued on and has gussets glued to the book covers at each end, top <br>
and bottom.  This allows it to open slightly wider or to close <br>
together along the right edge of the book.  I'm going to glue in <br>
twine or cording for two handles that just tuck inside when not <br>
used.  It will house my notebook, stamp, inkpad, compass etc. and <br>
displays handily on the shelf at home.  The book I've found for <br>
myself (it was 26 cents) is "The Moral Compass".  Nice because it's <br>
about 3inches thick, but I'm wondering if I should read it first :)<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, I'm going to sit back and take notes on what else to include!  <br>
Thanks :)<br>

  Glad to be part of the group.  Here's some "bag" thoughts.<br>
  Our "bag" is a smallish, canvas shoulder bag (Musette?) of probable war <br>
surplus origin: about 9"x7"x3".  In it we keep the usual logbook, a good <br>
compass, stamps, inkpads, pens, pencils, and clues.  We also have a set of <br>
"Brush Markers" for the stamps that require multiple colors, a 9"x7"x1/4" <br>
piece of Masonite that works well as a small lap table, a wad of paper <br>
towels for drying out the LBs that have been "moisture compromised", some <br>
extra zip bags should they be needed, and some alcohol wipes (unscented!) to <br>
clean off messy stamps.  And, lest I forget, an LbNA patch on the cover <br>
flap.<br>
  That said, we've been thinking of a somewhat different approach.  I'm a <br>
forester and have a "Filson Cruiser Vest".  It's heavy cloth, has upper, <br>
front pockets for a compass and pencils, two lower, front snap pockets (for <br>
stamps? inkpads?), two large, inside pockets (for logbook and clues?), and a <br>
pocket that covers that entire back for all the other things plus lunch, <br>
camera, small dog, etc.  It would probably work really well.  The down side <br>
is that while I've had mine for many years, news ones cost around $60, but a <br>
fishing or photography vest would probably work well too.<br>
  Hope this helps.<br>
  Merlin and Ardea<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've got a fairly simple pack, but it serves me well. It's a canvas <br>
messenger bag. Contents include: stamp, stamp pad, brush <br>
markers, my journal (which has very handy aluminum covers -- <br>
they make for a nice hard surface to stamp on), clues, a pen or <br>
two, compass, Leatherman mini, mini Maglite, gardening gloves <br>
(for  the hunt -- like I said before, nature and I are not the best<br>
of friends) and a couple little packets of hand wipes, since I <br>
always seem to get ink on myself.<br>
<br>
The Leatherman and Maglite were sort of afterthoughts. They <br>
usually reside in one of the pockets of my jacket, but since we're <br>
moving into warmer weather (and hence, fewer pockets or no <br>
jacket), I moved them to the bag. The flashlight has proven <br>
invaluable in locating letterboxes that have fallen a little farther <br>
into tree hollows than they're supposed to be.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of carrying extra baggies. I may have to keep a <br>
couple in the bag. Thanks for the tip!<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">For the first year I used a comfy old khaki backpack that was <br>
structureless -- one big pocket with a small front pocket on the <br>
outside.  I liked it because I had had it for a long time (i.e. <br>
didn't have to buy it), it washed up beautifully and it was as big or <br>
little as the stuff you put in it.  Unfortunately, I am also a pack <br>
rat and as the assortment of stuff inside the pack grew, it became <br>
harder and harder to find what I was looking for since it was all <br>
jumbled in the same place together.<br>
<br>
Last summer I bought a real backpack with several pockets.  The bad <br>
thing is that it is bulkier and has more structure to it so it feels <br>
clumsy even when there is not a lot in it.<br>
<br>
There are two large partitions -- the back one is the "dirty <br>
pocket."  In it I carry and boxes/HH that I will be placing, boxes/HH <br>
that I pick up, a couple of spare plastic grocery bags for trash or <br>
whatever and extra supplies (various size baggies, letterboxing info <br>
sheets, a sheet of "this is a letterbox" labels, a sheet of "this is <br>
a HH" labels and a sheet of labels with my contact info on).  <br>
Sometimes I throw in an extra container if there is not already too <br>
much stuff in there -- otherwise there are usually a couple in the <br>
vehicle just in case.<br>
<br>
The other large partition is the "clean pocket."  In it I carry <br>
clues, log book, a small spiral notebook for jotting clues and notes, <br>
our stamps, a variety of ink pads, unscented wipes and a roll of TP.  <br>
This pocket also has a handy plastic sleeve that is just the exact <br>
size for my compass.<br>
<br>
There is a medium sized pocket on the front in which I keep a small <br>
first aid kit, gloves, a small flashlight, matches, a long-handled <br>
wooden spoon (works great for digging in sand*) and sometimes extra <br>
socks if it is wet out.<br>
<br>
On the outside there are also two elastic-top net pockets on the <br>
sides -- one carries a bottle of water and the other my cell phone, <br>
and a small slot pocket on the front that nicely holds a GPS -- no <br>
not for geocaching, but I do have several of my box locations marked <br>
as waypoints in the GPS to make it easier to locate them from the <br>
lake when we are out on the boat.<br>
<br>
I also always have my camera bag with me, although usually just the <br>
small one when letterboxing.<br>
<br>
* about the digging...  I know you are not supposed to dig when <br>
letterboxing, but placing boxes in the sand dunes of West Michigan is <br>
unique.  What was a totally open root cavity when you placed the box <br>
may be under 2 foot of sand when you come back -- keep that in mind <br>
as you search for boxes in sandy areas also.  And digging in the sand <br>
is not really harmful to the environment -- at least not the amount <br>
of sand me and my wooden spoon can displace in an afternoon.<br>

Your comment about the camera...<br>
I never used to carry one (I'm not much into taking pictures) BUT, <br>
I've discovered that it's the perfect accessory to create the <br>
impression that you're doing something (other than letterboxing).<br>
I've been openly carrying a camera during boxing excursions for the <br>
past few weeks and find it the perfect justification for just <br>
standing there and looking around curiously -- as letterboxers do -- <br>
when anyone else is in sight.<br>
I like the inclusion of tools in the pack -- "just in case".<br>
The other thing I didn't mention earlier is that we carry bright, <br>
hunter-orange vests in our pack during the fall. I first saw <br>
letterboxers in NH wearing them during hunting season and it made <br>
good sense.<br>
Yeah, be safe.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My bag is a medium sized camera bag.  It is just large enough to <br>
hold my log book, inking pens, and stamp, and leaves room for other <br>
things I may add from time to time, like HHs, wiping towels, my <br>
camera, extra baggies, etc.  My compass fits nicely in a little <br>
front velcro pocket, which is easy to get at when needed.  Usually I <br>
leave the "bigger" items or "not often used" items in the car.  If I <br>
am going on a "plant", the bag is big enough to hold the box too!<br>
<br>
As a side note, I often put the clues in one of those plastic "sheet <br>
protectors".  I learned that one real quick after letterboxing in <br>
the snow and rain.<br>
<br>
I also second the "take a camera" idea for the same reasons Azobox <br>
mentioned.  In fact, for one of my boxes it is recommended.  If you <br>
get to the location of the box, which is on the edge of some very <br>
public "private" property, they don't bother you if you look like <br>
you're taking pictures.  They don't like "tresspassers" looking at <br>
their "property" but are okay with people that are "enthusiastic" <br>
about their "property" and leave them alone.  I always found this <br>
double standard interesting.<br>
<br>
Now for a question.  I've been wanting to get my pack down to just <br>
logbook, stamp, and ink pad into a tightly fit pack, so I can wear <br>
the pack while running on the trails to a letterbox.  The camera bag <br>
I use now flops around too much when I run.  Any runners out there <br>
that have a solution? (Fanny packs flop around too.) Thanks!<br>
