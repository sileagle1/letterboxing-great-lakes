slow down. My Red Dragon's Lair does seem to get a bit of buisness, but <br/>
I think it is mostly because it is closer to Oakland county. My Home of <br/>
the Woodland Fairy box seems to get the least, like 1 to 2 a year! At <br/>
least I know its safe lol. I don't think anyone has tried the Fantasy <br/>
Quest which is an eight box series I planted in July. Or at least no <br/>
one is contacting me about these boxes. <br/>
It feels like no one is planting around this area too. <br/>
