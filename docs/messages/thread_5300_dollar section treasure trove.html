<br/>
I still find the Lock and Lock boxes at Dollar Tree to be the best bargain around.  So far, the boxes I have bought are holding up outside.  <br/>

  Target's dollar section has some of those nice little albums <br/>
  again...some of you may recall the kind I've used for individual event <br/>
  logbooks instead of my usual daytimer style. They have eight pages of <br/>
  cardstock (I'd guess about 90 lb stock) with those screw-post <br/>
  bindings. I've been able to double that by adding my own pages. They <br/>
  have stamp pads and other scrapbooking supplies there too, including <br/>
  the cutest little alphabet stamp set (wood mounted nonetheless!)...all <br/>
  for a buck apiece!<br/>
<br/>
  Now if we could only get them to stock some decent plastic containers <br/>
  in that part of the store....<br/>
