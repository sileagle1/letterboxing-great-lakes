                    <div class="plaintext-content">T&amp;T, and any others who can't make the evening festivities...the B4 event boxes which have CLUES will be hidden and available earlier in the day for your boxing pleasure...this includes Humpty Dumpty, Hollywood Foliage, Clueless Claus, Presto!, Hudson (maybe), and Candles for Joseph. Contact me offlist to let me know what time you'll be looking for them to be sure I have them ready for you.<br/>

(And FYI...virtually all the stamps for this event are recycled, so you may have seenone or twoof them in one form or the other before over the years.)<br/>

With all of the Christmas options, this event is one we have been looking forward to attending again this year! We got our tickets in the mail yesterday and will be attending Sunday's performance. Even though we have a work dinner to attend on Saturday night, we are planning on getting out to the zoo earlier to present the Cottontail Birthday Girl her book. <br/>
