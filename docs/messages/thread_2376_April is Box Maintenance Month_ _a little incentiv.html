                    <div class="plaintext-content">Those of you who have been around the list for a while will probably <br/>
remember that a couple of years back Dragon officially dubbed April <br/>
as "Box Maintenance Month."  The idea is to get out to check on as <br/>
many of your boxes as possible and get them spruced up for another <br/>
letterboxing season.<br/>
<br/>
As a little incentive, I started a database (click on "Database"" <br/>
over on the left-hand sidebar menu) called "April Box Maintenance."  <br/>
For each of your boxes that you yourself physically visit and/or <br/>
replant during the month of April, make one entry.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the month, I will put each entry into a drawing and <br/>
pick one out at the Michigan Spring Fling gathering on May 6.  The <br/>
winning entry will win a *fabulous* prize (oooh, aaaah...)<br/>
<br/>
Can't make it over to Maybury State Park in Northville, MI for the <br/>
TJ_Mich Spring Fling on May 6?  Don't worry, you need not be present <br/>
to win!  The fabulous prize will be mailed to you if you are not <br/>
there ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Just get out there and check on those letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Which Boxes Qualify for Entry into the Drawing?<br/>
<br/>
1) It must be your own letterbox or a box that you have officially <br/>
adopted (i.e. you maintain the clues for this box)<br/>
2) You or a member of your team must be the ones to physically check <br/>
on the box<br/>
3) It must be checked during the month of April<br/>
4) It must be a previously planted box (not a new plant)<br/>
5) It must be either checked/cleaned/okay or replaced (cannot count <br/>
a box that you went to check on and found missing unless you replace <br/>
it during April)<br/>

Can we still add to the list if we checked boxes in March...a little <br/>
ahead of the game? <br/>

I marked the *missing* boxes at Atlas Quest and LbNA.  Do you want to see box checks in <br/>
this database if they are confirmed *missing*?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, this is supposed to be fun and I don't want to get into <br/>
technicalities about which boxes count and which don't.  <br/>
<br/>
I realize that some people maybe checked boxes last month (or the <br/>
month before that...) or simply cannot get out within the next few <br/>
weeks and just because a box is missing you still put in the effort <br/>
to go out and check it...<br/>
<br/>
I had to draw the lines somewhere and as long as everyone is playing <br/>
by the same rules...  It's just for fun anyway and to provide a <br/>
little kick in the back end to those of us who did not have the <br/>
gumption to get out and check boxes yet.<br/>
<br/>
So, to answer the questions posed -- boxes checked during March do <br/>
not count and boxes confirmed as missing do not count unless they <br/>
are replaced within the month of April.<br/>
<br/>
Which Boxes Qualify for Entry into the Drawing?<br/>
<br/>
1) It must be your own letterbox or a box that you have officially<br/>
adopted (i.e. you maintain the clues for this box)<br/>
2) You or a member of your team must be the ones to physically check<br/>
on the box<br/>
3) It must be checked during the month of April<br/>
4) It must be a previously planted box (not a new plant)<br/>
5) It must be either checked/cleaned/okay or replaced (cannot count<br/>
a box that you went to check on and found missing unless you replace<br/>
it during April)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and get out there and check those boxes!<br/>

I wasn't trying to get an advantage on this one.  I knew they didn't<br/>
count, but I just wanted to make sure I wasn't litterboxing your database<br/>
with my confirmed missing boxes that I don't plan to replace; I will be<br/>
moving in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Now back to some fun!<br/>
