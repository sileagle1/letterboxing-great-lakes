I'm not slighting anyone here by not choosing CR2, just evening boxers out.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">He may not have been, but I think he has been around and actively  involved long <br/>
enough to qualify at a "nationally known" boxer.  Same  with folks like <br/>
MapSurfer, Amanda from Seattle, Green Tortuga, Team  Green Dragon, Legerdemaine, <br/>
Funhog, Lockwench, Uneksia, Barefoot Lucy, Wand (of the infamous Pete and <br/>
Wanda), etc. who have all been BINGO terms  in previous years.  It gives a <br/>
little extra perk to folks who have made the effort to go to events outside of <br/>
our area as those events are typically not included in BINGO.<br/>
