                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had quite the eventful letterboxing weekend.  My husband and I went up to Chicago for the Pet Expo and decided I could do some boxing while we were there.  Friday night we hit the two Historic Chicago boxes (Comumbian Exposition and Clark House) and Mat the Rat's Underground Chicago box.  <br/>
Saturday, after the pet expo, we went after Fungus Woman's Sit Sip Stay, Hurray for Hollywood, and Happy Apple boxes.  I would have gone looking for Fish out of Water 1 if I had realized it was so close when I was putting together my clues but at that time I didn't think I would have as much time as I did for letterboxing since my husband isn't really into it...or so he says  We finished the day with the Chicago Portage box, which took us right past the cheapest gas we saw all weekend right when the tank was near empty.  <br/>
Then Sunday we spent the whole day letterboxing!!  First we tried the missing Dala Horse box and then we shot over to Evanston to look for the Grosse Point Light box.  We didn't find that box either...but at least our drive over to Evanston took us past the Omega Pancake house for a nice breakfast.  We did find the Architectural Mystery box however.  We also found Cmoon's 67 Squirrels and Oh Deer! I Can't Sleep, which were nice hikes in spite of the mud.<br/>
Then, Monday, Katy and I went looking for the new Handicap box at Kickapoo state park.  The box itself was rather dissapointing as it contained no stamp and the image stamped on paper for people to take was from the other box in the park that we had already found.  But the girls had fun anyway and we got to check out a trail that I had been wondering about for a while now but never had time to hike.  And Monday evening I got a call from someone putting together a Women in the Outdoors event at Eagle Creek down on Lake Shelbyville and they want me to teach a class on letterboxing for the event!  <br/>
Tuesday, I finally got off my butt and re-carved my missing stamp from my Hidden Village series and re-placed all of the boxes in that series.  And during Monday's hike, it dawned on me that that particular trail was where I wanted to plant Aina's boxes.  So Tuesday I set about doing that.<br/>
Now I've got my letterboxing fix for a while, which is good because I don't see myself doing much 'boxing for the next 2-3 weeks.  And I think my husband really had fun letterboxing too...not that he'd ever admit to it.  But yesterday he was asking me questions about how I was going to transfer my image to my carving medium and how I was going to carve the stamp and other assorted questions about how I was putting my box together ;)<br/>
