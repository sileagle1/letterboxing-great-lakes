trip).  My husband does not know this yet, LOL!  I wish we could get <br/>
there sooner, but I just do not see it happening.  Too many vehicle <br/>
repairs to be done before we make that trip - ugh - we thought we <br/>
were just down to one issue, but nooooo, that would be way too <br/>
simple!  Ah well!<br/>

&gt;Sounds like my kids . . . all four of them. Looks like they have <br/>

&gt;Are you still coming to the Quad Cities? I've held off on pulling my <br/>
&gt;Channel Cat stamp . . . I need to re-locate my "Isle of Capri" <br/>
&gt;stamp, figure most people wouldn't want to wander into a homeless <br/>
&gt;camp to find a stamp (unless you had a sandwich to share).<br/>
