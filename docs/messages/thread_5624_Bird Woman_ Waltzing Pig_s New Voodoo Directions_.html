                    <div class="plaintext-content">OH dear! I see that the voodoo chants for you must go to the next<br>
level. So, follow these steps exactly:<br>
<br>
1. Chant three times: "Springchick WILL call my word todaY!" Actually,<br>
scream it from your back porch loud enough for her to hear in West<br>
Michigan, OK?<br>
2. Thing sandals DO NOT count! There are no sandals involved.<br>
3. It's a RUBBER chicken you MUST have.<br>
And here is where you bump it up a notch:<br>
4.Take some red ink (yes, it must be red) and smear it across your<br>
forehead. Repeat: "By the ink-stained fingers, I summon the voodoo<br>
letterbox gods to intervene on this poor, poor soul." then, do twenty<br>
jumping jacks, cross your eyes, and recite 10 times, "Springchick WILL<br>
do my bidding, or a pin she'll get" (At this point, you know what to<br>
do with the pin...or at least should.)<br>
<br>
IF this fails, summon the Tiptoe TV BINGO gods, or.....go shopping at<br>
the mall. (At least put some clothes on before you go.!)<br>
<br>
Hope this helps....and please...update us on your status. :)<br>

  OH dear! I see that the voodoo chants for you must go to the next<br>
  level. So, follow these steps exactly:<br>
<br>
  1. Chant three times: "Springchick WILL call my word todaY!" Actually,<br>
  scream it from your back porch loud enough for her to hear in West<br>
  Michigan, OK?<br>
  2. Thing sandals DO NOT count! There are no sandals involved.<br>
  3. It's a RUBBER chicken you MUST have.<br>
  And here is where you bump it up a notch:<br>
  4.Take some red ink (yes, it must be red) and smear it across your<br>
  forehead. Repeat: "By the ink-stained fingers, I summon the voodoo<br>
  letterbox gods to intervene on this poor, poor soul." then, do twenty<br>
  jumping jacks, cross your eyes, and recite 10 times, "Springchick WILL<br>
  do my bidding, or a pin she'll get" (At this point, you know what to<br>
  do with the pin...or at least should.)<br>
<br>
  IF this fails, summon the Tiptoe TV BINGO gods, or.....go shopping at<br>
  the mall. (At least put some clothes on before you go.!)<br>
<br>
  Hope this helps....and please...update us on your status. :)<br>

            OH dear! I see that the voodoo chants for you must go to the next<br>
<br>
level. So, follow these steps exactly:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Chant three times: "Springchick WILL call my word todaY!" Actually,<br>
<br>
scream it from your back porch loud enough for her to hear in West<br>
<br>
Michigan, OK?<br>
<br>
2. Thing sandals DO NOT count! There are no sandals involved.<br>
<br>
3. It's a RUBBER chicken you MUST have.<br>
<br>
And here is where you bump it up a notch:<br>
<br>
4.Take some red ink (yes, it must be red) and smear it across your<br>
<br>
forehead. Repeat: "By the ink-stained fingers, I summon the voodoo<br>
<br>
letterbox gods to intervene on this poor, poor soul." then, do twenty<br>
<br>
jumping jacks, cross your eyes, and recite 10 times, "Springchick WILL<br>
<br>
do my bidding, or a pin she'll get" (At this point, you know what to<br>
<br>
do with the pin...or at least should.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
IF this fails, summon the Tiptoe TV BINGO gods, or.....go shopping at<br>
<br>
the mall. (At least put some clothes on before you go.!)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps....and please...update us on your status. :)<br>

Way, Way too funny!!!!  I'm tempted to put the photo as my screen <br>
saver, but it might scare the kids--or give them too many opportunities <br>
to razz me.<br>
<br>
I think your photo antics should be pointing your way to your new <br>
career.  <br>
