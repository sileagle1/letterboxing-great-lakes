                    <div class="plaintext-content">OH dear! I see that the voodoo chants for you must go to the next<br/>
level. So, follow these steps exactly:<br/>
<br/>
1. Chant three times: "Springchick WILL call my word todaY!" Actually,<br/>
scream it from your back porch loud enough for her to hear in West<br/>
Michigan, OK?<br/>
2. Thing sandals DO NOT count! There are no sandals involved.<br/>
3. It's a RUBBER chicken you MUST have.<br/>
And here is where you bump it up a notch:<br/>
4.Take some red ink (yes, it must be red) and smear it across your<br/>
forehead. Repeat: "By the ink-stained fingers, I summon the voodoo<br/>
letterbox gods to intervene on this poor, poor soul." then, do twenty<br/>
jumping jacks, cross your eyes, and recite 10 times, "Springchick WILL<br/>
do my bidding, or a pin she'll get" (At this point, you know what to<br/>
do with the pin...or at least should.)<br/>
<br/>
IF this fails, summon the Tiptoe TV BINGO gods, or.....go shopping at<br/>
the mall. (At least put some clothes on before you go.!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps....and please...update us on your status. :)<br/>

&gt; in a<br/>

&gt; &gt; friend, Tiptoe, didn't get this memo in time, and forgot to dance<br/>
&gt; &gt; around WITH the rubber chicken. All along, Tonto thought he was in<br/>
&gt; &gt; heaven! So,,,with a name like bird woman (that should cover the<br/>
&gt; &gt; chicken part) and waltzing pig (covers the dancing), you should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; okay. A word of caution though: DO NOT DANCE AROUND IN FRONT OF THE<br/>
&gt; &gt; WINDOW with the lights on at night and the blinds open. It scares <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; neighbors! Let us all know how this goes for you. :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IT DIDN'T WORK--I'm now at Day 24 without a BINGO word.  I did just <br/>
&gt; as you said.  I got my flip-flop thong sandals out of the swim bag <br/>
&gt; and put those on.  Then I went to the frig and got the tupperware <br/>
&gt; container with the leftover chicken from a dinner out.  And I twirled <br/>
&gt; around the house holding the tupperware and chanting the magic <br/>
&gt; words.  I can't believe I did such a bad job picking general terms--<br/>
&gt; or is it the caller????  ;~)   Guess not, since MobiusKlein just got <br/>

&gt; &gt; scream it from your back porch loud enough for her to hear in West<br/>
&gt; &gt; Michigan, OK?<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. Thing sandals DO NOT count! There are no sandals involved.<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. It's a RUBBER chicken you MUST have.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And here is where you bump it up a notch:<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4.Take some red ink (yes, it must be red) and smear it across your<br/>
&gt; &gt; forehead. Repeat: "By the ink-stained fingers, I summon the voodoo<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox gods to intervene on this poor, poor soul." then, do twenty<br/>
&gt; &gt; jumping jacks, cross your eyes, and recite 10 times, "Springchick WILL<br/>
&gt; &gt; do my bidding, or a pin she'll get" (At this point, you know what to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do with the pin...or at least should.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; IF this fails, summon the Tiptoe TV BINGO gods, or.....go shopping at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the mall. (At least put some clothes on before you go.!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps....and please...update us on your status. :)<br/>

            OH dear! I see that the voodoo chants for you must go to the next<br/>
<br/>
level. So, follow these steps exactly:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Chant three times: "Springchick WILL call my word todaY!" Actually,<br/>
<br/>
scream it from your back porch loud enough for her to hear in West<br/>
<br/>
Michigan, OK?<br/>
<br/>
2. Thing sandals DO NOT count! There are no sandals involved.<br/>
<br/>
3. It's a RUBBER chicken you MUST have.<br/>
<br/>
And here is where you bump it up a notch:<br/>
<br/>
4.Take some red ink (yes, it must be red) and smear it across your<br/>
<br/>
forehead. Repeat: "By the ink-stained fingers, I summon the voodoo<br/>
<br/>
letterbox gods to intervene on this poor, poor soul." then, do twenty<br/>
<br/>
jumping jacks, cross your eyes, and recite 10 times, "Springchick WILL<br/>
<br/>
do my bidding, or a pin she'll get" (At this point, you know what to<br/>
<br/>
do with the pin...or at least should.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IF this fails, summon the Tiptoe TV BINGO gods, or.....go shopping at<br/>
<br/>
the mall. (At least put some clothes on before you go.!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps....and please...update us on your status. :)<br/>

&gt; The Waltzing Pigs have a Skype account and a camera on their PC!  I <br/>
took a peak and I think BirdWoman has the right voodoo dance now.  I <br/>
uploaded a photo if you want to check it out...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Way, Way too funny!!!!  I'm tempted to put the photo as my screen <br/>
saver, but it might scare the kids--or give them too many opportunities <br/>
to razz me.<br/>
<br/>
I think your photo antics should be pointing your way to your new <br/>
career.  <br/>
