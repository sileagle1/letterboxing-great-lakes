First, I'd like to say that I love all signature stamps! They represent the  <br/>
person who holds them. I look back on some with nostalgia such as DMS's,  <br/>
NamVet's, Kraits &amp; Dogllvrs. Some I get a kick out of such as Big  Purple Foots (I <br/>
just love the new look with the girl with a big purple foot...  very <br/>
fitting), Two Free Timers &amp; Gooble Gobble. Some Sig stamps so closely  represent a <br/>
trail name with an image such as Wisconsin Hiker, Garfan &amp;  PackerBackers.<br/>
<br/>
However, the sig. stamp that I always go back to and just stare at is  <br/>
ArtGekko's new siggy that was introduced at the "Great Lakes Gathering 2008:  Land <br/>
of 10,000 Letterboxes" Included in the image is her Trail Name &amp;  city/state in <br/>
one of the smallest fonts I've ever seen carved.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp itself is 2" x 1.5" and is PACKED with details, carved with a  <br/>
hypodermic needle!! <br/>
<br/>
I'd have to say the incredibly detailed ArtGekko Signature stamp is my  <br/>
favorite.<br/>
