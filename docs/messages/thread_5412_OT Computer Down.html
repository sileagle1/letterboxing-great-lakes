Sure, we've made back up files and disks. But we don't do that but every 2 or 3 months or so and its been a couple of months since we last did. We should be able to get much back, but we still have that sick feeling in our guts.<br>

Three times a week Shadowprotect automatically (at 2:00 a.m. in my case) makes a complete restorable copy of my C: drive. Software to do a stand alone restore is also included. I actually had to do this once to recover my PC. When to do the backups is schedulable and is entirely up to you. Individual files are also recoverable or just accessible if you just want to look at an older version. Peace of mind.<br>

You might want to take it to a computer store to see if they can <br>
retrieve the data.  We had a power surge a few years back that fried <br>
our computer (and a bunch of other stuff).  And we were panicked <br>
because it was more like 7-8 months since we had last saved <br>
everything.  We took it to the computer repair place in town and they <br>
were able to retrieve everything.<br>
<br>
That did motivate us to be more proactive about saving our data.  We <br>
use a service called Foldershare, which is internet-based.  It <br>
basically stores all your computer data on another computer, and it <br>
does so all through the day (at least when both computers are <br>
online).  Our home computer is linked up with my DH's work computer.  <br>
So he has the benefit that work stuff is automatically backed up.  <br>
There is more than one company that does this, and I think there are <br>
some that store your files online.<br>
<br>
Hope you get all that data back!!!<br>

After she made the back up, I went through and added the 60 some boxes that had been found since late August. I didn't have the time to add the boxes I planted yet.<br>

BTW Atlasquest is better when it comes to figureing out what boxes we had found in the last 3 months (just hit the newest first option) I had a hard time figureing out the LBNA only boxes out.<br>

Either way, I got that done at about one o'clock this morning. Becki called me at noon and told me the computer crashed again :-(<br>
