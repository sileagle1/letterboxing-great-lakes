with 12 stamps, I think it would be a great idea to<br/>
plant them in a park that you love and is remote. I<br/>
would definitely go to a park with 12 boxes as a day<br/>
trip and I think that others would stray off the<br/>
beaten path to catch your series. It's a great way to<br/>
populate an area with letterboxes and get people to a<br/>
place that they normally wouldn't visit. Go for it!<br/>
