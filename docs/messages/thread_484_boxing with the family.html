going to try to introduce him to Lbing, but I doubt I'll be successful.  He<br>
has a stubborn streak a mile wide.  Once he makes up his mind he wants<br>
nothing to do with something, you cannot convince him otherwise.  He is also<br>
very impatient, so he may not appreciate all the stops involved in checking<br>
up on my LaSalle boxes, yet alone looking for others.  Hershey, on the other<br>
hand, is very excited to not only be going boxing, but is even going to<br>
place her first box... she even designed the stamp with her very own<br>
pawprint.  Her tail...er... "trail" name is "Muddy Feet the Dirty Dog".<br>
Pretty clever, eh?<br>
<br>
Also going to check up on FOOW2, to see if it has gone AWOL again or is<br>
merely very well hidden.<br>
