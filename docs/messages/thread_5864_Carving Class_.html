<br>
Just wondering if anyone would be interested in a carving class type of gathering; good carvers required to help people like me (no skills whatsoever) get going on carving? I would pay for the space at Severson Dells Nature Center (this would be Rockford, IL)and maybe we could convince the naturalist there to accept a box or two planted.<br>
<br>
Please advise,<br>

I would be willing to join in. I typically carve using various size gauges and needles. I did a brief carving presentation at a recent gathering (SILO 3 - February '09), and we were able to get a lot of good discussion going about what tricks and tools people have discovered over time.
