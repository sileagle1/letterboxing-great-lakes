If you go to Atlasquest, it will allow you to do a search where you put in the road and it will give the boxes so many miles from that road.  I'm not sure if all the roads that you mentioned are in the database, but it would be worth a try.<br>

Ted Drewes custard is awesome.  When looking at their web site:  teddrewes.com           it looks like there are 2 locations.<br>

Thank you all for your responses - I will check out the clues.  I mention my goals only being two finds because I won't have much  control over our intinerary.  This will be be my inlaws show - FIL is showing us the areas he grew up in, and there's a lot of ground to cover.  We will have our own car, thank goodness, so I'm hoping to sneak away.  I might even skip the Lincoln Museum so I can take a break from family.  I do want to see my DH's "ancestral homeland", so I'll be around for all that.<br>
<br>
It is gorgeous outside and less buggy, so I'm going to try to find a good place for a very special LB - Welcome to Family - that is in honor of the addition via adoption of my new 6 year-old niece!   <br>
<br>
Happy Trails!<br>

after I've found a place to hide the box.  Also tell me what hotel you're <br>
staying at in Springfield - just curious.  I'll be in Springfield Friday and <br>
Saturday nights, and 100% of my non-hotel time will be at the fairgrounds <br>
watching the Morgan regional championship horse show.<br>
<br>
Also - have you already gotten "You're So Vane", Pastor's Wife's box at one <br>
of the I-39 rest areas?  A quick drive-by find.  I'm stopping there myself <br>
early morning 9/3 to do a little needed maintenance on it.<br>
<br>
You MUST NOT skip the Lincoln museum!  I haven't been there yet myself, but <br>
EVERYONE I know who has says it is absolutely wonderful.<br>
<br>
Looking forward very much to receiving your stamps!!!<br>

Hey Sunny ... If it'll be easier to talk your family into LBing early on, there's I-39 SERIES: YOU'RE SO VANE as TR said, as well as I-39 SERIES: WILD BILL.  Wild Bill Hickok's birthplace is Troy Grove, a little further south than the PawPaw box.  It's a quick off/on I-39 and a fun little memorial park ... you can't get lost in Troy Grove!!!<br>
 <br>
I'll be boxing up in the Escanaba area of the U.P. and around Eagle River, WI at the same time as you're traveling south!<br>
 <br>
Have a great time while you're gone!!!  Our son and his family just loved the Lincoln Museum this summer!<br>

I might even skip the Lincoln Museum so I can take a break from family. I do want to see my DH's "ancestral homeland", so I'll be around for all that.<br>
<br>
It is gorgeous outside and less buggy, so I'm going to try to find a good place for a very special LB - Welcome to Family - that is in honor of the addition via adoption of my new 6 year-old niece! <br>
<br>
Happy Trails!<br>

As a matter of fact, one of three new this summer was just placed yesterday right off I-80.  I haven't even posted clues yet.<br>

> Hey Sunny ... If it'll be easier to talk your family into LBing early on, there's I-39 SERIES: YOU'RE SO VANE as TR said, as well as I-39 SERIES: WILD BILL.  Wild Bill Hickok's birthplace is Troy Grove, a little further south than the PawPaw box.  It's a quick off/on I-39 and a fun little memorial park ... you can't get lost in Troy Grove!!!<br>

> TR - What are the odds???? We are leaving late afternoon on the 3rd for Springfield! Would it be wrong to ask you to text me the clues? Just so I could check them out for you? Yeah, it'd be a public service to the LB community - that's right. I will have the laptop with me as well - but don't know if I'll have internet access before we get to the hotel Springfield. <br>

> Thank you all for your responses - I will check out the clues. I mention my goals only being two finds because I won't have much control over our intinerary. This will be be my inlaws show - FIL is showing us the areas he grew up in, and there's a lot of ground to cover. We will have our own car, thank goodness, so I'm hoping to sneak away. I might even skip the Lincoln Museum so I can take a break from family. I do want to see my DH's "ancestral homeland", so I'll be around for all that.<br>
