Wow - GREAT sites!  I've certainly bookmarked those for future <br>
reference.<br>
<br>
Now there is no reason that ANYONE can't come up with an idea for <br>
planning an event.  It would be great to see somebody new plan <br>
something in WI yet this fall (hint hint).<br>

Yes, Team Dutch Elm was on the trails today.  We must be mad!!!  The sweat was rolling off us...two HOT babes!  NOT a beauty picture.  However, there is always a mischievousness that occurs when we start talking, brainstorming and thinking that it's time to plan another indoor letterbox gathering.  Well, we're at it again!!!<br>
<br>
So this is the first time we are announcing what we've been plotting and planning. Fungus Woman and I are planning a 'infamous,' 'roaring good time' letterbox gathering for February 2008.   Yes, we have a theme!  It's not Chinese New Years/Dress in "RED" (that was a hoot!), but it will be another one of those crazy Kodak memories to remember!!!  We know how letterboxers need a reason to play with stamps, sniff ink, and dress up in funny clothes when the weather is too cold outside to be on the trails, so we'll plan another hot time at the Silo....SILO II! <br>
<br>
Proposed date: Sometime in early to mid-February.  Watch for details to follow.  HINT: The date and the month definitely have something to do with our new theme.  Any guesses?<br>

  Glad to hear you & FW are getting out on the trail! Will you next be <br>
  heading up to Lapham Peak to find any boxes you may have missed last <br>
  year? Some pretty good hiking if that's what you're looking for.<br>
<br>
  We still don't know when we'll be down to IL this year. It may not <br>
  be until SEP... I'm headed back out to CA again soon - the project <br>
  that just won't end!<br>

ROFLOL!!!  This exactly why I like being associated with the zany creative people in the LbGLK group.  Surprisingly, our theme is not among the wacky holidays listed on that website.  I guess there's always a holiday and a reason to celebrate.  Maybe I should not have taken my Christmas tree down this month....but that's another story.  <br>

My new boxes (the dozen boxes I hoped to place last spring? ) should be in<br>
place before September for you to find. I've found several historical,<br>
interesting, scenic locations, now it's time to get busy carving and placing<br>
the actual boxes. So this area will be infested with Beetle Boxes soon! <br>
<br>
Yes, Team Dutch Elm was on the trails today. We must be mad!!! The sweat was<br>
rolling off us...two HOT babes! NOT a beauty picture. However, there is<br>
always a mischievousness that occurs when we start talking, brainstorming<br>
and thinking that it's time to plan another indoor letterbox gathering.<br>
Well, we're at it again!!!<br>
<br>
So this is the first time we are announcing what we've been plotting and<br>
planning. Fungus Woman and I are planning a 'infamous,' 'roaring good time'<br>
letterbox gathering for February 2008. Yes, we have a theme! It's not<br>
Chinese New Years/Dress in "RED" (that was a hoot!), but it will be another<br>
one of those crazy Kodak memories to remember!!! We know how letterboxers<br>
need a reason to play with stamps, sniff ink, and dress up in funny clothes<br>
when the weather is too cold outside to be on the trails, so we'll plan<br>
another hot time at the Silo....SILO II! <br>
<br>
Proposed date: Sometime in early to mid-February. Watch for details to<br>
follow. HINT: The date and the month definitely have something to do with<br>
our new theme. Any guesses?<br>

Glad to hear you & FW are getting out on the trail! Will you next be <br>
heading up to Lapham Peak to find any boxes you may have missed last <br>
year? Some pretty good hiking if that's what you're looking for.<br>
<br>
We still don't know when we'll be down to IL this year. It may not <br>
be until SEP... I'm headed back out to CA again soon - the project <br>
that just won't end!<br>
