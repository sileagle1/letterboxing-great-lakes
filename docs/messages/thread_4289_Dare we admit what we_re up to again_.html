&gt;too cold outside to be on the trails, so we'll plan another hot time <br/>
&gt;at the Silo....SILO II!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Proposed date: Sometime in early to mid-February. Watch for details <br/>

  Glad to hear you &amp; FW are getting out on the trail! Will you next be <br/>
  heading up to Lapham Peak to find any boxes you may have missed last <br/>
  year? Some pretty good hiking if that's what you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
  We still don't know when we'll be down to IL this year. It may not <br/>
  be until SEP... I'm headed back out to CA again soon - the project <br/>
  that just won't end!<br/>

  &gt; Fungus Woman and I hit the trails today. Heat, high humidity, mud <br/>
  puddles, and some on-again-off-again rain drops can't keep us home on <br/>
  a day off from work. We went in search of several boxes today; some <br/>
  were there, some were missing ( or we were just completely off the <br/>
  mark.) But we hiked our little legs off! <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; The point I want to make is this. There is no way on this green <br/>
  earth that any individual youngsters or families with children would <br/>
  have gone in search of these boxes. After the heat started to affect <br/>
  our speech and mental capabilities, it was obvious that letterboxes <br/>
  are safe when considerable thought is given to the placement, clues <br/>
  are well written (and not too obvious), there is some challenge, or <br/>
  the boxes are placed in remote areas that require stamina, <br/>
  perseverance, back tracking, and lots of deductive reasoning (and <br/>
  prayers) to find them. If a clue causes you to read, research, solve <br/>
  it, drive, hike, re-read, use a compass, and 'think outside the box', <br/>
  I'm convinced that any mischief makers or unsupervised youngsters <br/>
  will look for something easier. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; All this hiking around today....why do we abuse our bodies this <br/>
  way?!!!<br/>

  Tactics in Mid-Michigan<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Do you have any secrets to share as to how best to get clues <br/>
  out <br/>
  &gt; there without going through LbNA or AtlasQuest?<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Seems that letterboxing is going to have to go through some <br/>
  sort of <br/>
  &gt; change if it's going to survive the onslaught of so many <br/>
  articles, <br/>
  &gt; newstories, kids mags, etc. that it has so continuously been <br/>
  exposed <br/>
  &gt; *in* lately!<br/>
  &gt; &gt;PennyPenny<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Clearly, some sort of protection/controls seem to be needed.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Any thoughts, comments, discussion?<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Merlin<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I know some of you have participated in giving interviews, so <br/>
  don't <br/>
  &gt; take this personally... I really think the first step is to quit <br/>
  &gt; encouraging all the publicity. I know some people think it is <br/>
  better <br/>
  &gt; to have an experienced person participate in an article, but an <br/>
  &gt; alternate approach that I've used is to explain why I WON'T <br/>
  &gt; participate in an article someone is writing. I have taken the <br/>
  time <br/>
  &gt; to tell the reporter why many think publicity is a bad idea, what <br/>
  has <br/>
  &gt; resulted from some articles and that if they DO insist on writing <br/>
  an <br/>
  &gt; article that they should stress the secrecy and discretion aspect.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I agree with what Beetle wrote recently - letterboxing is <br/>
  something <br/>
  &gt; that started in England as a challenge for adults, so I am <br/>
  &gt; disappointed to see this turning into a "kid's activity", with <br/>
  &gt; articles (and now even corporate ads!) appearing almost quarterly <br/>
  in <br/>
  &gt; Family Fun magazine. We have taken our nieces and nephews out <br/>
  &gt; several times, but it is not as a kid's activity, but an adult <br/>
  &gt; activity that they get to do with us. They have learned compass <br/>
  &gt; skills, problem-solving, etc. We have created boxes that families <br/>
  &gt; with kids can easily do, but I've had at least 2 boxes visited <br/>
  &gt; by "Play Groups" consisting of 3-4 adults and 15-20 preschoolers. <br/>
  &gt; Yikes!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; One easy way to take your clues off-line, is to list them in the <br/>
  &gt; Files section on this message board. Another more involved <br/>
  appraoch <br/>
  &gt; would be to start your own website or blog using one of the free <br/>
  &gt; sites available (or start your own Yahoo group to host your <br/>
  clues), <br/>
  &gt; and link to it from this site. You can also then give the link to <br/>
  &gt; whoever you are comfortable sharing it with.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I'm sorry to see this happening, since I really like the <br/>
  convenience <br/>
  &gt; of finding almost all clues on the letterboxing.org site, no <br/>
  matter <br/>
  &gt; where we travel (although in the past year or so we've also had <br/>
  to <br/>
  &gt; check AQ, for the people that won't use the original letterboxing <br/>
  &gt; site). I plan to keep my clues on the LBNA site until a problem <br/>
  &gt; develops in our area. If it does, I'll move them to a private <br/>
  &gt; website that I already have developed. However in addition to <br/>
  &gt; excluding the troublemakers, that tactic will most likely also <br/>
  &gt; exclude people that may be traveling through the area.<br/>

Glad to hear you &amp; FW are getting out on the trail! Will you next be <br/>
heading up to Lapham Peak to find any boxes you may have missed last <br/>
year? Some pretty good hiking if that's what you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
We still don't know when we'll be down to IL this year. It may not <br/>
be until SEP... I'm headed back out to CA again soon - the project <br/>
that just won't end!<br/>

&gt; Fungus Woman and I hit the trails today. Heat, high humidity, mud <br/>
puddles, and some on-again-off-again rain drops can't keep us home on <br/>
a day off from work. We went in search of several boxes today; some <br/>
were there, some were missing ( or we were just completely off the <br/>
mark.) But we hiked our little legs off! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The point I want to make is this. There is no way on this green <br/>
earth that any individual youngsters or families with children would <br/>
have gone in search of these boxes. After the heat started to affect <br/>
our speech and mental capabilities, it was obvious that letterboxes <br/>
are safe when considerable thought is given to the placement, clues <br/>
are well written (and not too obvious), there is some challenge, or <br/>
the boxes are placed in remote areas that require stamina, <br/>
perseverance, back tracking, and lots of deductive reasoning (and <br/>
prayers) to find them. If a clue causes you to read, research, solve <br/>
it, drive, hike, re-read, use a compass, and 'think outside the box', <br/>
I'm convinced that any mischief makers or unsupervised youngsters <br/>
will look for something easier. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All this hiking around today....why do we abuse our bodies this <br/>
way?!!!<br/>

Tactics in Mid-Michigan<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Do you have any secrets to share as to how best to get clues <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; there without going through LbNA or AtlasQuest?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Seems that letterboxing is going to have to go through some <br/>
sort of <br/>
&gt; change if it's going to survive the onslaught of so many <br/>
articles, <br/>
&gt; newstories, kids mags, etc. that it has so continuously been <br/>
exposed <br/>
&gt; *in* lately!<br/>
&gt; &gt;PennyPenny<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Clearly, some sort of protection/controls seem to be needed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any thoughts, comments, discussion?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Merlin<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know some of you have participated in giving interviews, so <br/>
don't <br/>
&gt; take this personally... I really think the first step is to quit <br/>
&gt; encouraging all the publicity. I know some people think it is <br/>
better <br/>
&gt; to have an experienced person participate in an article, but an <br/>
&gt; alternate approach that I've used is to explain why I WON'T <br/>
&gt; participate in an article someone is writing. I have taken the <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; to tell the reporter why many think publicity is a bad idea, what <br/>
has <br/>
&gt; resulted from some articles and that if they DO insist on writing <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; article that they should stress the secrecy and discretion aspect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree with what Beetle wrote recently - letterboxing is <br/>
something <br/>
&gt; that started in England as a challenge for adults, so I am <br/>
&gt; disappointed to see this turning into a "kid's activity", with <br/>
&gt; articles (and now even corporate ads!) appearing almost quarterly <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; Family Fun magazine. We have taken our nieces and nephews out <br/>
&gt; several times, but it is not as a kid's activity, but an adult <br/>
&gt; activity that they get to do with us. They have learned compass <br/>
&gt; skills, problem-solving, etc. We have created boxes that families <br/>
&gt; with kids can easily do, but I've had at least 2 boxes visited <br/>
&gt; by "Play Groups" consisting of 3-4 adults and 15-20 preschoolers. <br/>
&gt; Yikes!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One easy way to take your clues off-line, is to list them in the <br/>
&gt; Files section on this message board. Another more involved <br/>
appraoch <br/>
&gt; would be to start your own website or blog using one of the free <br/>
&gt; sites available (or start your own Yahoo group to host your <br/>
clues), <br/>
&gt; and link to it from this site. You can also then give the link to <br/>
&gt; whoever you are comfortable sharing it with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm sorry to see this happening, since I really like the <br/>
convenience <br/>
&gt; of finding almost all clues on the letterboxing.org site, no <br/>
matter <br/>
&gt; where we travel (although in the past year or so we've also had <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; check AQ, for the people that won't use the original letterboxing <br/>
&gt; site). I plan to keep my clues on the LBNA site until a problem <br/>
&gt; develops in our area. If it does, I'll move them to a private <br/>
&gt; website that I already have developed. However in addition to <br/>
&gt; excluding the troublemakers, that tactic will most likely also <br/>
&gt; exclude people that may be traveling through the area.<br/>
