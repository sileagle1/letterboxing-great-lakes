I'm cross-posting here in case someone in our region knows something about this HH (who created it, where it might be now, etc).<br>
<br>
Here is what was posted on the national message board:<br>

Hi to all in LB land,<br>
<br>
Maybe someone can help me out..... It's about hitchhiker log booklets <br>
that are separated from a stamp that belongs to it.... a "Miller Highlife"<br>
stamp ....... It was sent out a few months back so who know's where they are?<br>
<br>
......<br>
<br>
Some information on this HH, If it's ok, here are some of the LBer's that were stamped in this HH.<br>
<br>
1)Travel'n Turtle<br>
2)Draft Horse<br>
3)Bumble Bee<br>
4)Spirit Seeker<br>
5)Anna & the kids<br>
6)Rebel Yells<br>
7)StepAWay2<br>
8)WhoGoesThere<br>
9)Princess Lea<br>
<br>
I may have started in Canton, Ohio by HootyFind In the Mazen Letterbox (Trumpeter is also listed) on 8/12/2008<br>
<br>
If this can help to locate where this HH is now , that would be great........ Then the Miller Highlife stamp can be sent in that general direction........ Peace & Love .... <br>
