So, I've been wondering about those silica crystal packs. Do they<br>
actually help keep a letterbox's contents dry? Or drier?<br>
I imagined that they'd absorb as much as they could hold, then their<br>
affect would be nil.<br>
<br>
Perhaps in a smallish microbox it would help?<br>
<br>
I dunno.<br>
<br>
Any evidence? I recall some controlled experiments being done out east<br>
(?) a few years back in which it was shown that even a totally<br>
airtight box would exhibit signs of moisture, due to condensation.<br>
Perhaps in those cases, the silica would help.<br>
And of course, we all know, Do Not Eat the contents of those little<br>

So, if there is a "do not eat" warning label for humans, what are the <br>
chances that they may not be particularly safe for animals should the <br>
box be invaded or otherwise strewn about in the woods?<br>
