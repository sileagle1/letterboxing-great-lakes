I know my response is a little late but I'm just back from visiting <br>
my brother, in West Chicago, after the gathering. I just want to add <br>
my thanks, as well, to everyone that made the gathering such a <br>
success and so much fun! A special thanks to Dragon for all the work <br>
he did! To John from Leapin Lizards for carving such a great event <br>
stamp!  To Springchick for her help and great carving advice. To <br>
everyone that hid boxes. They sure kept us all busy!<br>
<br>
Didn't find any ticks on me but Tuck managed to pick up one. I'm just <br>
grateful it wasn't more. About those mosquitos, I can't remember the <br>
last time I ended up with so many bites. I have to say it was all <br>
worth it, though. Next time I'll just make sure I have a head net and <br>
some heavy duty spray.<br>
<br>
While I was mostly busy with family events in Chicago, I did manage <br>
to drag my sister-in-law (I'm slowly converting her over to the <br>
hobby) out to hunt down Bees Knees #2. Found it alive and well. <br>
Another great carving, Melinda and Kate! Thanks for the good excuse <br>
to make it back to that lovely little park!<br>
<br>
Tim, did you ever manage to track down your windshield tricksters?<br>
