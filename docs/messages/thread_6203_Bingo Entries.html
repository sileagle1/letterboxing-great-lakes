I've received the entries from everyone who is listed in the players database, except one -- Beetle I emailed you, please contact me so we can figure out what happened with your entry.

I will be verifying all of the entries today just to make sure nobody has duplicate words or words in the wrong columns -- will email anyone if there is problem.<br>

If you've been crazy busy with holiday happenings and just didn't get a chance to mail your Bingo stuff but want to play, there is still time!  Mail has been arriving in 1-3 days so anything going out tomorrow should still make it in time.  If you are going to mail tomorrow yet, it might be a good idea to email me a copy of your entry form first, just to make sure that arrives in time -- I am okay with the booty package arriving a day or so behind, but must have your card in time in order to participate in the game.<br>
