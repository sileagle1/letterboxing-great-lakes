notice on the first attempt from Outlook, so I'm sending this <br/>
directly from the web.  I hope that doesn't continue, it's highly <br/>
annoying!<br/>
<br/>
I found out that if you make a copy through a FAX machine (they use <br/>
toner) that you can then get a nice, dark black, crisp transfer with <br/>
a few seconds of cotton setting heat and pressure from an iron!<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you're looking for some basics AND details I have a tutorial <br/>
on carving:<br/>
http://sunnisan.com/jacqui/tute-carving.html<br/>
<br/>
For the person who just started carving with an exacto, I recommend a <br/>
#1 speedball blade/tool. I found it MUCH easier than the Exacto <br/>
(which I kept undercutting what I wanted to keep) especially on <br/>
curves :-)<br/>
<br/>
You can get that at some Michaels/hobby lobby or at www.Stampeaz.com <br/>
