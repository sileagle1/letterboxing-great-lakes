Unlike other people, I've never had any luck with heat transfer.  However I<br/>
usually do quite well with using acetone on a toner image (from a laser<br/>
printer or copy machine that uses old style toner).  I simply lay the image<br/>
(face down) on top of the carving media, then firmly PAT (not rub) the back<br/>
of the image with a cloth dampened w/acetone.<br/>

more than homework/class content.<br/>
