There's a huge summer one in early June, but I don't know if it's <br/>
been decided exactly where or when yet.  I haven't heard anything <br/>
about it and I wasn't around last year to know when these things get <br/>
decided. =)<br/>

However, if no one from those states is up for hosting the annual gathering we'll have to pick a different state.  I don't remember when we usually vote on this...should be coming up in the next month or so though.<br/>
