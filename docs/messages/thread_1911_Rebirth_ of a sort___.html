Marblehead Lighthouse to see if SpringChick's<br>
letterbox planted there still existed.  (It rained. <br>
It poured.  It was so bad a tree limb fell on the hood<br>
of a minivan in the parking lot - thankfully no one<br>
was hurt.)  <br>
<br>
Checking my email just now, I saw a notice from the<br>
letterbox announce list that there was a new box<br>
planted in Ottawa County, Ohio.  Anytime Ohio appears<br>
in the subject line I'm on it, even if it's nowhere<br>
near us.  Box name, Marblehead Lighthouse.  "Did<br>
SpringChick replant her box?" I wondered, knowing that<br>
after our report back to her she officially retired<br>
it.  Here, a boxer in the area named antimony is<br>
trying it again.  Wonder if they know of the first<br>
box?  Anyway, Deedle & I had hoped to make it out the<br>
lighthouse again one day, since it wasn't open the day<br>
we visited.  Now we have even more reason :)<br>

box 2 times (total 3 carves, plants, etc.) and it just kept coming up <br>
missing.  I began to wonder if it wasn't the park people removing the <br>
box.<br>

Just in case, you'd better get over there quickly!<br>
