The first one I checked was Mob Massacre, which had been tucked under a LARGE log (6 or 7 feet long and a diameter of 3-4 feet). Well, that log and its equally large neighbor were now standing on end and crushing a fence.  I wanted to poke around and see if the box was still there somewhere but it was too slippery and slimy.  I'll need to go back when things are dry and see, but I fear that this box went for a swim.  Parts of the cemetery are still underwater.<br/>
<br/>
Then it was on to Anarchy.  The hidey-hole in a tree trunk was empty--rats!  But then I noticed a camo box caught in the branches of a nearby bush--yeah! Things were looking up after that, as I found several other boxes exactly where they should be.  Hoping that other boxes near rivers fared well after all this flooding.<br/>
