As the Biggest Loser I didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised with the two gift cards for food, some LB notebooks, some awesom LTCs from ASL Girl and Dartmoor Dreamer (which I've yet to log), and a CD of "Biggest Loser"workout songs - Ha ha!!</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Thanks for making the winter more bearable, and for making this loser feel like a winner. And special BIG thanks to WiHi for organizing and calling.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Happy summer, y'all, and have a great time at GLG 2015!! Can't wait to hear the stories.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>-AG</span></p></body></html>
