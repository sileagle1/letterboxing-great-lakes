                    <div class="plaintext-content">Back by popular request, I have hidden the Santa's Lost Toys Series of <br/>
15 boxes.  This limited time series is easy to find even during the <br/>
cold and snowy month of December. They are hidden in an area <br/>
approximately 1/8th of a mile.  This series is usually in place only <br/>
till January 1.  This year, I might leave it in place till the S.I.L.O <br/>
II gathering on Feb. 16. Lots of great personal stamps in the original <br/>
logbook from 2005! <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This series is a limited time series and I usually take it down on New <br/>
Years Day.  This year I received several requests to leave the series <br/>
up till the S.I.L.O. event on Feb. 16, so I agreed and I posted that <br/>
message.  But plans have changed.  It appears that the village has <br/>
begun posting utility flags. Earth moving equipment has begun to dig <br/>
trenches along that area. YIKES! The series has been removed...till <br/>
next year.  Sorry if this causes any inconvenience for anyone.  <br/>
