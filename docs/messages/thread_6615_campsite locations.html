Check in is anytime during the day and check out is at 3 pm. So if you check<br/>
in on Friday at 8 am and check out Sunday at 3 pm, you are charged for 2<br/>
nights ($40 for electric), for example.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of electric camp sites available at Jubilee, but the<br/>
Woodchuck Loop would be my choice- it is cozier with only 45 sites &amp; is the<br/>
closest to the no electricity tent area where some other boxers may be<br/>
staying. It would be easy to seek out other letterboxers if everyone camped<br/>
in Woodchuck &amp; the tent only areas. The other two camping loops run together<br/>
and are quite massive. All of the camping is far from the shelters, so<br/>
regardless where you camp you'll probably want to drive down to the<br/>
gathering.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!!!<br/>

I'm tent camping, but need an electric site. It's hard to tell from the map<br/>
where the good sites are, so I figure I'll just get there and go scout a<br/>
place. Does anybody know what time you can start checking in? I suppose if<br/>
the site you want wasn't occupied on Thursday night, any time Friday morning<br/>
is good, but does anybody know what time "check-out" is?<br/>

I'm afraid you may have trouble trying to check in after 10 pm. Maybe someone who is coming in earlier can reserve a spot for you. If not, here is the number for the park manager, Tom, he might be able to advise you: 309-446-3758. Good luck &amp; safe travels!<br/>

&gt; Hey everyone....so are we correct in that the park doesn't take reservations? We will be arriving on Friday but probably not till late like after 10p. Is there a gate at the entrance? Is there someone we can contact when we get there? We are on the road from key west right now and have limited access to the internet from my phone. Just want to make sure we have a place to sleep after driving for 15 hours ;) we are soooo excited for Saturday!!! <br/>
