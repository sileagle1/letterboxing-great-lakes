&gt; WI Letterboxers,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope that I'm not being being too out of line with this, forgive me<br/>
&gt; if you feel I am, but I felt I needed to make contact today with the<br/>
&gt; WI geocacher group on our behalf for a couple of reasons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The primary reason was that after a long walk in the cold rain to get<br/>
&gt; to the Aslan box in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe series, I<br/>
&gt; found that a geocacher failed to notice the large print on the box<br/>
&gt; saying that it is a letterbox and promply exchanged a travel bug for<br/>
&gt; the Aslan stamp!  (Sorry Sophie &amp; Me!)  I'm hoping that the president<br/>
&gt; of the WI Geocachers can hunt down the geocacher involved, so we can<br/>
&gt; get the stamp back before it bounces around too many geocaches!  (I<br/>
&gt; should also note that another geocacher had also came by and put a<br/>
&gt; plastic orc fighter in the letterbox and "took nothing").  As<br/>
&gt; mentioned below, I know of the geocache in the area, and it is yards<br/>
&gt; away from the Aslan box.  (It is actually only a few yards away from<br/>
&gt; another letterbox in the area.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Secondly, as is indicated on their group's website, and as I noted in<br/>
&gt; an earlier post to this group, the WI geocachers are trying to set<br/>
&gt; policy for geocaches in WI with the state DNR and parks.  As we know,<br/>
&gt; these policies often get converted to include letterboxes without our<br/>
&gt; knowledge until it is too late.  I firmly believe that the current<br/>
&gt; problems that the IL letterboxers are having with various preserves<br/>
&gt; are a result of policies that were inacted for geocachers, in which<br/>
&gt; the geocachers were aware of what was going on but the letterboxers<br/>
&gt; were not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As such, I sent the following email to the president of the WI<br/>
Geocachers:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;snip<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Greetings!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm representing a number of letterboxers in WI who<br/>
&gt; feel there is a need for our two groups to at least<br/>
&gt; have some contact with each other since our two<br/>
&gt; activities share similiar concerns.  Athough we do not<br/>
&gt; have a state organization (yet), there are over 100<br/>
&gt; letterboxers in WI, most of whom are part of the Great<br/>
&gt; Lakes Letterboxing group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One area we are particularly concerned about is your<br/>
&gt; group's discussion with the WI DNR and state parks. <br/>
&gt; As many states adopt policies restricting Geocaching,<br/>
&gt; too many of them automatically assume that<br/>
&gt; letterboxing is the same and force the geocaching<br/>
&gt; rules on us.  Often these infringe on the very areas<br/>
&gt; where letterboxing and geocaching are different or<br/>
&gt; have differing philosophies and tend to ruin our<br/>
&gt; hobby.  Before the WI geocachers "strike a deal" with<br/>
&gt; the state, we would like to have a say in the deal, as<br/>
&gt; we may not be in complete agreement with you on some<br/>
&gt; issues.  By contacting you, I'm hoping that we can<br/>
&gt; work together for the good of both hobbies in WI (not<br/>
&gt; to mention all the other fringe hobbies related to our<br/>
&gt; hobbies).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also have another concern I'm hoping you can help me<br/>
&gt; with.  On my letterboxing walk today at Lake Park in<br/>
&gt; Milwaukee, I found the box I was searching for, but it<br/>
&gt; had been found by two different geocachers (at the end<br/>
&gt; of Oct.) who failed to notice that it was a letterbox<br/>
&gt; and not the nearby geocache (although the box is<br/>
&gt; CLEARLY marked as a letterbox).  As such, one of them<br/>
&gt; who goes by the name Great Teton 2020 took the hand<br/>
&gt; carved stamp that needs to remain in the letterbox. <br/>
&gt; They left travel bug #477229.  The other geocacher<br/>
&gt; left a plastic figure.  The stamp that they took means<br/>
&gt; a lot to many letterboxers and we'd like your help in<br/>
&gt; tracking down this geocacher and hopefully getting the<br/>
&gt; stamp back to where it belongs.  I also have in my<br/>
&gt; possesion the items the geocachers left behind, since<br/>
&gt; although I know there is a geocache near the<br/>
&gt; letterbox, I'm not sure exactly where it is, so I<br/>
&gt; couldn't put them in the geocache.  (I know about the<br/>
&gt; geocache because I happened upon a geocaching family<br/>
&gt; (who are actually friends of mine) as I was searching<br/>
&gt; for a different letterbox nearby over a year ago). If<br/>
&gt; you find out who this Great Teton geocacher is, please<br/>
&gt; have them contact me by email so we can work things<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This actually brings up another concern for both of<br/>
&gt; our groups.  Although most letterboxers know about<br/>
&gt; geocaching and know what to do with a geocache, I've<br/>
&gt; found that geocachers tend to not know about<br/>
&gt; letterboxes.  Anything that your group can do to alert<br/>
&gt; WI geocachers about letterboxes so that situations<br/>
&gt; like this don't happen would be greatly appreciated. <br/>
&gt; This is the first time I am aware of that a geocacher<br/>
&gt; has taken the stamp of a letterbox in WI.  I have,<br/>
&gt; however, personally experienced this in many of the<br/>
&gt; surrounding states on my letterboxing trips.  (In one<br/>
&gt; extreme case, a geocacher actually removed a letterbox<br/>
&gt; so they could take over the great hiding location.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for your efforts, and here's to our two groups<br/>
&gt; working together in WI!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely, <br/>
&gt; Tim Kuehl<br/>
&gt; "The Dragon""<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;snip<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will keep you all informed of anything that transpires from this<br/>
&gt; contact through posts like this to the GL group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It would also seem prudent at this time for us to officially form a<br/>
&gt; group.  I in NO WAY wish to become a "splinter" group of the GL group,<br/>
&gt; NOR do I wish us to create a separate Yahoo Talk Group.  We should<br/>
&gt; stay a complete part of the GL group.  All I am suggesting is that we<br/>
&gt; form a "recognizable group" that the DNR, etc. can recognize and<br/>
&gt; contact.  I think it would be nice to have our own webpage, with<br/>
&gt; information that is particularly for WI letterboxers - particularly WI<br/>
&gt; newbies.  So we all have a voice in whatever policies affect us, we<br/>
&gt; should join together by creating a membership list of letterboxers in<br/>
&gt; WI, with contact people, who can turn around and inform the other<br/>
&gt; members either through the GL group or by email.  (I also think it<br/>
&gt; might be cool if we created a "Letterboxing WI" logo.  Maybe it could<br/>
&gt; even be carved for the traveling event stamps SpringChick is looking<br/>
&gt; for and/or for our own patches, but I digress.)  I don't think we need<br/>
&gt; to go the route of the geocachers and have a "president", membership<br/>
&gt; dues, etc. for our group either.  Just a couple of contacts on the<br/>
&gt; website in case someone from the outside need to contact us as a group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you don't like any part of this, let me know, but please be kind :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you agree with me that this is a good idea and would like to help<br/>
&gt; in any area I mentioned in the formation of the group, please let me<br/>
&gt; know the specific area in which you'd like to help.  I definately feel<br/>
&gt; there is much to be gained by having newer WI letterboxers as well as<br/>
&gt; established letterboxers joining together to put this group together,<br/>
&gt; so don't be shy to volunteer!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, if you are interested in visiting the WI Geocachers website, go<br/>
&gt; to http://www.wi-geocaching.com/about.php  On this page is info about<br/>
&gt; their dealings with the state allbeit minimal info.<br/>
