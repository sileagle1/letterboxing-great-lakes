It's such fun to get together with friends at Christmas time.  Besides, there will be lots of letterboxes, even some easy ones just incase the weather is <br/>
if-y.  And gifts to exchange.  And maybe even St. Nick himself will show up and start naming names as to which of us have been naughty or nice this past year...and tell why!  That would certainly be good for some laughs!  <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you both...better late than not.  <br/>

  We really wish that we could come, but we have a conflict in the <br/>
  morning. We are pretty sure that even if we came, there wouldn't be <br/>
  much boxing for us. There are some names on the list we would really <br/>
  like to meet, not to mention all of the names we would like to see <br/>
  again. Who knows, you may see us there.<br/>
<br/>
  The Cottontails<br/>
<br/>
  P.S. It may be a good idea to look up our travelers, just in case.<br/>
