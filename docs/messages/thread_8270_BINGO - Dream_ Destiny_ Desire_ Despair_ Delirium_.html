<p>Thank heavens this was called early and will not be the reason for loosing the full card when the game gets down to the wire!  This elusive box (at least for us!) has haunted us since early fall!  We hiked every trail at that park going around three times and could not for the life of us figure out the directions...it was maddening because we knew the confusion was not with the clues, but the problem was clearly due to our lack of interpretation....pathetic letterboxers!  We left empty handed and disappointed.</p><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>Several weeks later at an event, we actually asked someone we knew who had snagged it to see where we were going wrong...after a quick recount the "Ah Ha" moment hit...then the frustration took on a new form for us as we weren't able to get back up there to redo our steps. So frustrating!!!  We both SO wanted to put this box on our BINGO card.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>Oh well...if not for BINGO, we still have it high on our "to do" boxing list...but we are going to wait until the temps move out of the ridiculous minus wind chills we are presently experiencing!</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>Happy Bingo everyone!  The game really is helping us get through January so far!</div><div>Tiptoe &amp; Tonto</div>

P.S. Since some players have more than one word crossed off, I'd like to remind people to keep a watch on their cards for a 6-pack configuration. And of course the first person to cross out ANY 10 words will be the 10-spot winner.<br>
