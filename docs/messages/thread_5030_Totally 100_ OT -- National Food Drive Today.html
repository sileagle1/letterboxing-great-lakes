                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep, when we got finished up for the day, we were down too.  6000 pounds<br>
last year compared to 4900 this year (Lombard, IL -- area of probably about<br>
45,000 to 50,000 people). Times are getting rougher.  But it's 4900 pounds<br>
that the pantry didn't have on Friday, so I'm EXTREMELY grateful to our<br>
patrons for contributing.  Five LLV mail trucks filled to the gills.<br>
<br>
I take the day as a vacation day to be able to just concentrate on the food<br>
drive.  A lot of carriers who are on vacation, are retired, have the day<br>
off, etc. come in on Saturday just to drive around and pick up any food they<br>
see on porches so that the carrier doing the route has a little less to have<br>
to carry.  Plus we go out and pick up the food from the patrons of carriers<br>
who don't cooperate with the drive at all and won't pick up the food from<br>
their patrons.  In driving around Lombard, plucking food off porches, twice<br>
I almost picked up a load of dirty diapers.  Now, if they'd been clean<br>
diapers I would've grabbed 'em as a donation.  :-)<br>
<br>
Folks donated some usually-not-thought-of items too.........someone donated<br>
a bunch of hearing aid batteries (might come in handy for folks who visit<br>
the pantry & wear hearing aids), a few people donated new children's toys,<br>
lots of soaps, shampoos, pet food (poor folks often have pets too), the<br>
kinds of things that can't be purchased with food stamps.  Some patron<br>
must've gotten a good deal on VO5 shampoo because one patron donated 50<br>
bottles.  Or maybe they work for the company.<br>
<br>
And then...........<br>
<br>
then...............<br>
<br>
someone donated a package of opened hot dogs in a tupperware bowl.<br>
OKaaaaaaaaaaaaay.<br>
<br>
And we got some candy with an expiration date of 2006. OK, that's gonna be a<br>
wee bit stale. :-)<br>
<br>
My huuuge downfall was the M&Ms.  I'm an M&Maholic and carriers were<br>
bringing in bags of donations that had those really large bags of M&Ms in<br>
them.  Our maintenance guy was helping us pack the food in tubs and I made<br>
him take them and hide them all way down in the bottom of our packing while<br>
I kept my eyes closed so I didn't see where he put them.  Making sure that<br>
M&Ms get to the pantry is my only downfall in food drives.<br>
<br>
You mentioned pantries needing food all year long -- that's why I like<br>
having a national food drive at this time of year.  Folks tend to think of<br>
their local food pantries around Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc., and this<br>
time of year supplies can get tight for the pantries.<br>
<br>
!!! ThankyouThankyouThankyou !!! to everyone who donated.<br>

My mother is the VP of her local food pantry, so I spent 5.5 hours<br>
today putting away the food that was donated.  We actually finished<br>
it tonight, which makes me think that there were fewer donations this<br>
year than in the past.  I know the economy is tough and food is<br>

Candy from 2006?  That's nothing!  In one donation that I unpacked, I <br>
found a can of Campbell's soup that expired in 1994.  Yes, I am <br>
serious.  Unfortunately, a few people see this food drive as a way to <br>
clean out their cupboards of expired, open and bulging items. :(<br>
