last year compared to 4900 this year (Lombard, IL -- area of probably about<br/>
45,000 to 50,000 people). Times are getting rougher.  But it's 4900 pounds<br/>
that the pantry didn't have on Friday, so I'm EXTREMELY grateful to our<br/>
patrons for contributing.  Five LLV mail trucks filled to the gills.<br/>
<br/>
I take the day as a vacation day to be able to just concentrate on the food<br/>
drive.  A lot of carriers who are on vacation, are retired, have the day<br/>
off, etc. come in on Saturday just to drive around and pick up any food they<br/>
see on porches so that the carrier doing the route has a little less to have<br/>
to carry.  Plus we go out and pick up the food from the patrons of carriers<br/>
who don't cooperate with the drive at all and won't pick up the food from<br/>
their patrons.  In driving around Lombard, plucking food off porches, twice<br/>
I almost picked up a load of dirty diapers.  Now, if they'd been clean<br/>
diapers I would've grabbed 'em as a donation.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Folks donated some usually-not-thought-of items too.........someone donated<br/>
a bunch of hearing aid batteries (might come in handy for folks who visit<br/>
the pantry &amp; wear hearing aids), a few people donated new children's toys,<br/>
lots of soaps, shampoos, pet food (poor folks often have pets too), the<br/>
kinds of things that can't be purchased with food stamps.  Some patron<br/>
must've gotten a good deal on VO5 shampoo because one patron donated 50<br/>
bottles.  Or maybe they work for the company.<br/>
<br/>
And then...........<br/>
<br/>
then...............<br/>
<br/>
someone donated a package of opened hot dogs in a tupperware bowl.<br/>
OKaaaaaaaaaaaaay.<br/>
<br/>
And we got some candy with an expiration date of 2006. OK, that's gonna be a<br/>
wee bit stale. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My huuuge downfall was the M&amp;Ms.  I'm an M&amp;Maholic and carriers were<br/>
bringing in bags of donations that had those really large bags of M&amp;Ms in<br/>
them.  Our maintenance guy was helping us pack the food in tubs and I made<br/>
him take them and hide them all way down in the bottom of our packing while<br/>
I kept my eyes closed so I didn't see where he put them.  Making sure that<br/>
M&amp;Ms get to the pantry is my only downfall in food drives.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned pantries needing food all year long -- that's why I like<br/>
having a national food drive at this time of year.  Folks tend to think of<br/>
their local food pantries around Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc., and this<br/>
time of year supplies can get tight for the pantries.<br/>

Candy from 2006?  That's nothing!  In one donation that I unpacked, I <br/>
found a can of Campbell's soup that expired in 1994.  Yes, I am <br/>
serious.  Unfortunately, a few people see this food drive as a way to <br/>
clean out their cupboards of expired, open and bulging items. :(<br/>
