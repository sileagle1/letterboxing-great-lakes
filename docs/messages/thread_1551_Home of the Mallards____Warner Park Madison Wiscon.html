in Warner Park...we are MadCats.  It went missing before it was found <br>
and we were notified by Christmas Elves...we went to check and sure <br>
enough...gone! It was so disheartening as it was our first plant and I <br>
worked very hard on the stamp and the hitch hiker...of course the stamp <br>
was a funny cat and the traveler was a tiny mouse with cheese (I am in <br>
Wisconsin!!...so cheese seemed to fit!)...Anyway,  I would be happy to <br>
try to duplicate the stamps and replace if I feel assurred that I can <br>
plant the box according to rules..?  Let me know any thoughts on this.  <br>
And Thank you Christmas for showing intterest.  We are still <br>
letterboxing.  MadCats <br>
