<br>
We see that BahaMama has finally realized der be snow up here, eh, and paying some spect to us Canuks. Bout time, eh? However, we see dat she even put us in Bunny Hugs in our photo, eh? We wondering where she get those photos and how much she pay for dem, eh? Probably Lonnies and two knees because the heads are a little small, eh?<br>
<br>
Anyhow, we're wondering if she has been spying on us and thought we saw her traveling through Tronno on The Basketweave driving all cookie like, until she was stopped by our beloved Mountie. Apparently, there is a rumour she was packing it hard and was Seein' the Governor with a sixty-sixer and two four on the side, eh? We are sure that her companion, MartininMon, was toting a mickey and  poverty puck as well. An incrimating video was even found in der car, eh? See for self: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZmDWltBziM <br>
<br>
Now, we're pretty sure she claimed that as a training video, for we seen what she done to those friendly Jamaican's car and how she be trashin those Swedes (which, btw, we love anyone who roll round in duh snow, eh? Maybe they be having some two-fours too?)<br>
<br>
And speaking of those Jamacain competitors, we even spotted PoPo Bullys and Bali at Horny's picking up some jam busters, beaver tails, and bismarcks's. I'm sure they have serious muchie problems, eh, seeing how they drive that herbal vehicle and such, eh? Of course, it was a brief glimpse as they yelled out their winders about getting out of Kay Beck to zip through The Peg to get to Lotus Land in time to visit some of their Coastie friends at the Lympics, eh? Can't blame them though...that poor Bali looks like she be having a skull cramp with her hair like that. Need we say more about their "jam buster" from that music?<br>
http://bahamachampions.homestead.com/Jamaica.html  We think they should stick to the poutine next time. <br>
<br>
So, we'll be seeing ya in Van in February, eh? Takitish.<br>
