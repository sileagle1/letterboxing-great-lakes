                    <div class="plaintext-content">Chris and I went to Kings Island for the fourth of July weekend, and <br>
we decided to get a letterbox near our motel before we left town.  <br>
This box, StampawayUSAbox (Sharonville, OH), was unfortunately not in <br>
very good condition.  Because we didn't come prepared for repairs and <br>
we don't live in the area, we sadly had to leave it as is.  When we <br>
got back, I sent a status report to the placer (franzsolo) through the <br>
LbNA site, but haven't heard back, so I don't know if it was <br>
received.  Given the condition of the box, I am going to guess it is <br>
not being maintained much anymore.<br>
<br>
So, I thought I would write a note to this group in case there are any <br>
Cincinnati-area boxers here who might be able to give the box some <br>
TLC, and so people who intend to find the box can come prepared.<br>
<br>
The main problem is that the container is rather beat up and obviously <br>
no longer watertight.  The contents were very damp when we found <br>
them.  As a result, the wood backing on the stamp has warped, making <br>
it difficult to get a good impression.  Also, the log is full.  There <br>
are various loose pages in the box that finders have added.<br>
<br>
So, in my opinion, StampawayUSAbox is in need of:<br>
1) a new log<br>
2) a new container<br>
3) a new backing for the stamp<br>
4) drying out of the existing log<br>

We liked the stamp in this box a lot, by the way.<br>
