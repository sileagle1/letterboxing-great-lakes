To clalrify.<br/>
What I meant to say in my earlier post (and did not convey very<br/>
clearly) is that *limited distribution* diminishes vandalism.<br/>
I did not mean to suggest that simply a reporting of a number of finds<br/>
guarantees some known degree of trustworthiness.<br/>
<br/>
As Wisconisn Hiker pointed out, it only takes a few minutes to log 50<br/>
or 100 finds online.<br/>
<br/>
I'm saying hide the clues as well as you hide the boxes.<br/>

I would daresay that most would-be "just for fun" vandals are not<br/>
likely to hike 5 miles or take the time to decipher code just to have<br/>
a little fun with a letterbox.  Not that all boxes need to be long<br/>

Legerdemaine -- clues that took some thinking, hikes that involved<br/>
distance, etc.  Many of these boxes are still in place -- years after<br/>

the increase in no-brainer clues and drive-by type letterboxes and of<br/>

I have always maintained that the best defense against intentional<br/>

<br/>
Another box I found required 6 months of web surfing and inquiring about local area history from older residents in that town.  I even visited the town's library.  Of course, I must have sounded like a historical buff, but I certainly never let on that I was looking for a letterbox.  I finally found that box too.  And yes, it's still in place.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel a 'need' to find a box, so I look for a quick and easy one.  But there are times when I 'need' a challenge and I enjoy the mental process.  Then, there are times when I feel a good hike will help to loosen up my joints and some exercise would be good.  But exercise for the sake of exercise is....well, let's just say I 'need' more motivation and a letterbox is the answer.  <br/>

  boxes well.<br/>
  &gt; Boxers need to take the time and be both more descrete on the path and<br/>
  &gt; RECOVER the boxes well. I have experienced both of these problems<br/>
  which I<br/>
  &gt; sure contributes to majority of discoverd and vandalized boxes out<br/>
  there.<br/>
  &gt; Staff is presently researching a variety of hexes, curses, jinx and<br/>
  &gt; enchantments (think King Tut's tomb) for box protection.<br/>

<br/>
  Those who are limiting their boxes are doing so by choice...remember we don't have particular rules so they CAN.  <br/>
<br/>
  If it makes them available longer, I would be all for it.   Granny<br/>
