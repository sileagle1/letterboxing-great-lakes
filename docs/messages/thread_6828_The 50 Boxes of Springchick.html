One way to save yourself all this work would be to declare the winners now--then you wouldn't have to draw words and post them day after day after day after day.  I'll nominate myself for one or two or three of those winner slots   ;~)<br>

Plus, Hartx6 already spoke up with dibs for sucking up...and it didn't work out to well for him either (unless, of course, he sends me that..ahem..."deposit"...WINK, WINK). Besides, I'm following in the footsteps of our beloved Springchick, and like her, I choose to remain honorable. (Wait! Did I just say that?) Yeah...never mind...I like bribes! ;-)<br>
