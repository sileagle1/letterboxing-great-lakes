&gt; you don't <br/>
&gt; become a "Desperate Housewife" and do something<br/>

&gt; Bingo words, and you card needs an "Extreme<br/>
&gt; Makeover".  <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, "The Facts of Life"—and the<br/>
&gt; Bingo facts—prevent you <br/>
&gt; from changing your card.  But it is NOT a "Mission<br/>
&gt; Impossible".  It <br/>
&gt; is time to "Get Smart" and become a<br/>
&gt; "Designing Woman" and figure out <br/>

&gt; <br/>

&gt; a gentler approach (like "Bewitch"-ing Old Shoe)<br/>
&gt; to get one of your <br/>
&gt; words called.  If that fails, you could use some<br/>
&gt; "Dirty Sexy Money" <br/>
&gt; to bribe Old Shoe and turn him into "The Six Million<br/>
&gt; Dollar Man".  I <br/>
&gt; almost hate to suggest this, but you may need to consider<br/>
&gt; those more <br/>

&gt; My dear Tiptoe--I hope you're not getting "Dark Shadows" under your <br/>
&gt; eyes as you think about your Bingo woes.  And I pray that you don't <br/>
&gt; become a "Desperate Housewife" and do something that would put <br/>
&gt; you "Six Feet Under".  Remember, you are a "Survivor" and "Happy <br/>
&gt; Days" are sure to comesometime??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Granted, you may have been a little "Clueless" when you chose your <br/>
&gt; Bingo words, and you card needs an "Extreme Makeover".  <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, "The Facts of Life"and the Bingo factsprevent you <br/>
&gt; from changing your card.  But it is NOT a "Mission Impossible".  It <br/>
&gt; is time to "Get Smart" and become a "Designing Woman" and figure out <br/>
&gt; your strategy!!<br/>
