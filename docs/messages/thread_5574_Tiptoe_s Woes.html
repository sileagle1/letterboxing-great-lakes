<br>
Granted, you may have been a little "Clueless" when you chose your <br>

Unfortunately, "The Facts of Life"and the Bingo factsprevent you <br>
from changing your card.  But it is NOT a "Mission Impossible".  It <br>
is time to "Get Smart" and become a "Designing Woman" and figure out <br>
your strategy!!<br>
<br>
Now, the voodoo doll might be a little harsh; perhaps you should try <br>
a gentler approach (like "Bewitch"-ing Old Shoe) to get one of your <br>
words called.  If that fails, you could use some "Dirty Sexy Money" <br>
to bribe Old Shoe and turn him into "The Six Million Dollar Man".  I <br>
almost hate to suggest this, but you may need to consider those more <br>

your mind off your troubles.  A "Home Improvement" project?  Time <br>
with "Friends" (after all, you shouldn't be a "Lone Ranger" during <br>
such a stressful time).  Or maybe a tripI hear that "Hawaii Five-O" <br>

<br>
Just take it "One Day at a Time" and don't lose the audacity of <br>
your "Chicago Hope".  Keep thinking that "Today" is the day.  One <br>
day, that word will come!  Don't get TOO greedy for more words (after <br>
all, I want to win).  You may decide that "Eight is Enough".  <br>

a "Bonanza" of Bingo Bootie.  Oryou may realize that "It Takes a <br>

Rest assured that   "All My Children" will give big "Cheers" when you <br>

up with a most clever antidote to my woes has catapulted me into a whole new frame of <br>
mind.  Laughter is good for the soul and an empty Bingo card!  Your tale has sent roars of <br>
laughter throughout the house!  Maybe tomorrow I won't have to choose "American IDLE" <br>
afterall...if I still come up empty tomorrow, I will just re-read your prose and start looking <br>
in the sofa for that "Dirty Sexy Money".  <br>
