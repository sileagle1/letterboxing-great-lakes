me.  I was itching to jump back in and headed back over to the big <br>
list after being away since last fall.  After only a few days I was <br>
asking myself "why am I doing this again?"<br>
<br>
But after exchanging a few e-mails with azobox and thinking back to <br>
the gathering last year, I still felt rarin' to go.  It just kind of <br>
occurred to me, if all these other areas can have their own groups <br>
where people share stories with boxers in their own neck of the <br>
woods AND behave respectably with one another -- why can't we?<br>
<br>
Glad you are enjoying it -- I know I am and thanks to all of you for <br>
being a part of this and for making letterboxing a happenin' thing <br>
here in the Great Lakes area!<br>
