                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was great seeing so many people out in the snow and cold.  We had <br>
lots of fun and were excited to finally meet many of you.  We had hoped <br>
to finish some of the boxes on Sunday...but unfortunately other things <br>
(like finally shoveling mom's driveway) took their toll before we had a <br>
chance to go back out.  Many thanks to Dragon, MM, Wi Hiker, FW, Beetle <br>
and everyone else who helped make such a wonderful day.<br>
<br>
I took the hint for Wi Hiker's post, and Fungus Woman also asked I post <br>
the recipe....so here it is!  These were the oatmeal bars I made for <br>
Saturday's Gathering.  Actually, they are a 30 year old recipe from the <br>
Wisconsin State Journal's Cookbook.  I leave the nuts out.<br>
<br>
Cookie part: 1 cup butter or margarine, 2 cups brown sugar, 2 eggs, 2 <br>
tsp vanilla, 2 1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt (optional), <br>
and 3 cups quick rolled oats<br>
<br>
Chocolate filling: 1 can (15 oz) sweetened condensed milk, 1 pkg (12 oz) <br>
semi-sweet chocolate chips, 2 Tbl butter or margarine, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 <br>
tsp vanilla, and (1 cup chopped walnuts, optional)<br>
<br>
In a large bowl, cream 1 cup butter and the brown sugar.  Beat in eggs <br>
and 2 tsp vanilla.  In a separate bowl, mix flour, soda, and salt.  Stir <br>
in oats.  Stir dry ingredients into creamed mixture until blended.  Pat <br>
2/3 of mixture into the bottom of a greased 13x9x2 inch baking pan.<br>
<br>
In a heavy saucepan over low heat, melt milk, chocolate, 2 Tbl butter <br>
and salt.  Stir until smooth.  Stir in remaining vanilla (and nuts).  <br>
Pour mixture into pan over oat layer, and then dot chocolate with <br>
remaining oat mixture.  Bake at 350 for 25-30 min.  Cool and cut into bars.<br>

Thanks for the recipe!  I bought the ingredients tonight and plan to <br>
make them for a party this weekend.  Those things were scrumptious!<br>
