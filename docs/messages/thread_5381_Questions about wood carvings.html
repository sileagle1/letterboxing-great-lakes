<br>
1)Would the fact that the stamps are machine produced prevent any of<br>

2)Does anyone have any experience with the durability of hiding a wood<br>
stamp carving in a letterbox?  If so, what might I do to keep them<br>
from rotting too quickly, and what is the best way for letterboxers to<br>
get a good image of the stamp?  What kind of wood might work best?<br>

Perhaps you could check with Cottontails, I think he has created some stamps from laser images. However I can't remember if the actual stamp was carved by hand or machine.<br>

Have you tried using a lino block on the laser cutter?  They are firmer (and thicker) than our soft block materials but yet have more give than wood.  There is a gal up in the U.P. who carves some of her stamps using lino blocks.  Although it is more difficult to get a *perfect* image than it is when using rubber, it produces much better results than wood, especially if you take the time to ink it really good and have a hard surface to stamp on.  The stamps seem to hold up fine despite the weather up there.<br>
<br>
Congrats on the team's great season and good luck at state!<br>

  I'd have no problem finding a custom machine-produced image, however if the material is WOOD, that is NOT good based on my experience! We've come across a few stamps carved into wood and have gotten horrible images from them.<br>
