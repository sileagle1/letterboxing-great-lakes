So, don't let that hold you back. Also, I-96 is always kept clear in this area as well as the roads going into Grand Ledge, so you shouldn't have any problems. <br/>

Thanks again to all of the Family0f6 for another great winter event!!!<br/>

I loved the clues and the stamps i the boxes that we did find.  Everything was well-coordinated, and a good time was had by all.  Also, Bahama Mama and Martini Mon's website really helped build the anticipation (I still think the poll was fixed).  The stamps and displays by all of the competitors were wonderful to see.  Congrats, F0f6, for the highest audience participation factor ever!  Thanks for a really good workout too.  (And thanks for mentioning me in one of your clues. I feel so special.)<br/>

But we quickly found that only certain areas had that much snow. Other times it was only 1/2-way to our knees, LOL!<br/>
<br/>
The clues were great and the carvings were too! It was great seeing people again (this was only our 2nd event). Can't wait for the next one!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have safely arrived back in Sweden after experiencing another fabulous Familyof6 winter event.  They provided great organization, wonderful letterboxes with creative hiding places, and a foot of snow to trounce through!<br/>
All of the teams went to such great extent to showcase their countries - the likes we haven't seen since memorable "Science fair/History fair" projects of school yore!  We especially loved Team Portugal's offering of wine and the amazing homemade cheese!  And we can't forget Team New Zealand's "live whale" exhibit and their professional Olympic uniforms!<br/>
Kudos have to go to our Olympic champs from the Bahamas for not only winning the overall event, but for their creative blog that fueled us all winter long with their humor and wit in anticipation of the event!<br/>
We are giving Andrew and Co. (especially Mrs Famo'many) a standing ovation for a job well done and a bouquet of appreciation!  Just like in Vancouver, Team Canada can stand tall and proud - best Olympics ever!<br/>
Team Sweden..aka  Gunhild &amp; Igor...aka Tiptoe &amp; Tonto<br/>
BTW - all pictures...(and videos) depicting us as dumb blondes have been altered by photoshop!<br/>
