                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, you remember that I mentioned that our Letterboxing bag, with <br>
our digital camera in it, was lost at the zoo.  My husband called the <br>
zoo (while ya'll were having fun in Wonderland, LOL) and the person <br>
he talked to did not find it in the lost and found.<br>
<br>
Well, while I was folding Mt. Laundry (I cannot believe we had that <br>
much laundry, but anyway), I was praying about it.  My 7 yr old was <br>
sure she brought the bag in and I was praying that God would show me <br>
where the bag was.  I am telling you now, He told me to call the zoo <br>
(several times, because I simply cannot listen properly to anything <br>
the 1st time).  So, I called the zoo this morning.  They dug deeper <br>
in the lost and found box - AND IT WAS THERE!  AND THE CAMERA WAS <br>
STILL THERE.  An honest person found the bag and turned it in!<br>
<br>
Needless to say, The CatHerders are doing a Happy Dance and saying <br>
thankful prayers today!  All of our images restored and the camera, <br>
too!  Guess what we will be doing in Delafield this Sunday after church!!!<br>

do the same thing, but at the zoo - well, the odds are seemingly <br>
against it!  I was so sad last night typing an email to a friend who <br>
want to get her family into Letterboxing and now I am a happy <br>
CatHerder who cannot wait to go with them in a couple of weeks!<br>
