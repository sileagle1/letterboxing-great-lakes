Monty Python Letterboxes planted throughout the Great Lakes States, <br/>
specifically regarding Knights Who Say Ni. Before Gooble Gobble's <br/>
extended hiatus from Letterboxing, I had asked him about Knights Who <br/>
Say Ni coded message (Cryptogram)?, and had been meaning to discuss it <br/>
with him @ GLG 2008 but didn't get time. I am usually pretty good at <br/>
figuring out coded messages but this one has me completely stumped!<br/>
Since Gooble Gobble won't be back for who knows how long, are there any <br/>
of you who could help me understand how to solve the code?<br/>
Also, FoundUnicorn and I live very close to Megasoma Punctulatus <br/>
(Rhinoceros Beetle) Letterbox planted by Gooble Gobble, and sometime <br/>
this fall we will check on the LB to make sure it has enough paper, <br/>
etc.. in Gooble Gobble's absence.<br/>

the code part:<br/>
<br/>
"Being a GL group project, all of the letterboxes in this series are <br/>
scattered around the Great Lakes region.  It is your quest to find each <br/>
of the 40 letterboxes and the series hitchhiker and collect not only the <br/>
stamp images, but also the encrypted clues they contain.  Once you have <br/>
collected all the clues, you can put them in order to decipher the clues <br/>
to the location of the Holy Grail box.  Since accomplishing this task <br/>
will be a huge undertaking, there will be prizes for the first three <br/>
individuals that complete the series in its entirety.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of those questing, please do _/*NOT*/_ distribute secret <br/>
information about the series (via WOM, email, etc.).  Do note that the <br/>
*_/location/_* of the series hitchhiker _/*should*/_ be regularly <br/>
reported, and that the hitchhiker _*MUST*_ be placed only in HG series <br/>
boxes (excluding the Grail box of course)."<br/>

More info about the whole series is located here (if the link will paste <br/>
