<br/>
Well, we finally got around to posting the clues for<br/>
our latest letterboxes.  A new box has been added to<br/>
Bailey's Washington Island Series.  Another one is on<br/>
the way...we lost part of the clues. :(  Two new<br/>
Famous Faces are out there too. Another one is<br/>
planted, but we have again lost part of the clues...I<br/>
want to just say "go south" but I don't know if that<br/>
would be sufficient.  If anyone is interested in<br/>
trying the clues for this third box in the Milwaukee<br/>
area without the degrees, email us and we'll give you<br/>
the clues.  In the mean time, we will be working<br/>
diligently on a better way to organize our clues so<br/>
they aren't getting lost. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Box on,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think in the situation you are referring to, the placer planted the <br/>
box and made notes as to the location but then misplaced them before <br/>
writing up and posting the clues.  I have done this myself a few times <br/>
only to find them months later.  A couple time I had to actually go <br/>
back and retrace the trail to the box, making new notes.<br/>
<br/>
There is also the case of "lost" clues for boxes that were placed some <br/>
time ago and clues were posted to the old letterboxing.org website, but <br/>
never made it over to the new letterboxing.org site when the transition <br/>
took place a couple of years ago.  This most likely would have been <br/>
because the boxes were unclaimed at the time of the transition.  So <br/>
even though the boxes are in place and some people may have old copies <br/>
of the clues, the clues are not on the main clue sites -- some people <br/>
refer to the these as "lost" clues.  You can access the old web site <br/>
and also the letterbox basement by following links in the LINKS section <br/>
of this list.<br/>
