saturday. Woo hoo! :-) I wasnt sure if I was going to be able to make <br/>
it being that I just moved to Kentucky, but I got the time off of work. <br/>
It is a good thing because I am so NUTS about letterboxing. I look <br/>
forward to meeting everyone. Also check out the clues to my personal <br/>
traveler located on letterboxing.org under Michigan mystery. See ya at <br/>
