I'm embarrassed to admit when I first started watching and the <br>
commentators said, "Jordan has a triple double" that I had no idea <br>
what the heck a triple double was!<br>
<br>
Of course it was having double figures in rebounds, points and <br>
assists.<br>
<br>
Now, in the letterboxing world I can say I have a triple triple. I <br>
have triple figures in my PFX counts!!<br>
<br>
Today in the 10 degree weather, with 4 inches of snow on the ground I <br>
hiked a mile and planted 5 boxes.<br>
<br>
The first box I planted today was my 100th!<br>

My official stats are; P104 F446 X153<br>

Looking forward to hitting F500 in the spring.<br>
