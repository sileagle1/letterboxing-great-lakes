  For the first time in over 20 years, I am not, BUT you truly have my <br/>
  deepest sympathy. I know how bad it is to have to work these holi~days <br/>
  and how badly it cuts into time to prepare and into family time. I don't <br/>
  know what you do for a living, but my guess is that you serve the public <br/>
  somehow. Thank you!!<br/>

  I hope you get some quality time somewhere!!!<br/>
  Happy holidays to you.<br/>

<br/>
This is the 5th year in a row that I (a homecare nurse by profession)<br/>
have worked Christmas Eve day, Christmas Day and the day after Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
For the last 4 years, I did this of my own accord. I have no young<br/>
children and didn't mind making modifications so that my co-workers,<br/>
who did have children, could spend time with them.<br/>
<br/>
This year, with a new employer, I had hoped my previous commitment (of<br/>
4 years with another employer) would count for something ... however,<br/>
no such luck, it's as if you are starting over from scratch. ~sigh~<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that I should be off the hook next Christmas (when my<br/>
grandson will be 3 ... and MIGHT actually retain the memory!)<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll go start that database re: kids born this year... check<br/>
it out and add yourself or a family member.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
