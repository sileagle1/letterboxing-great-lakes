  For some good finds, I would suggest trying...<br/>
  Buckeye State of Mind (Emily Traphigan Park across from Zoo)<br/>
  Connecticut State Birds Nest In Ohio (same park as Buckeye State of mind)<br/>
  Walk the Dog Part 1 &amp; 2 (along the Olentangy Bike Trail)<br/>
<br/>
  I haven't gotten the ones in Reynoldsburg yet...but they are fairly new so the chances are good they are still there.<br/>
<br/>
  Most of the earlier ones (2003 &amp; 2004) were planted by 'boxers who are no longer 'boxing or are no longer in this area. Most of the boxes have been abandoned and their status is unknown. I'd stick with the ones that are more recently planted. <br/>
  Unless you would like to look for the older ones and adopt any of the one that are still intact but aren't tended to anymore. (Just make sure they have indeed been abandoned.)<br/>
