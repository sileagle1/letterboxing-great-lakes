                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Acorn, for the info.  We had so much rain at times last year here<br/>
that I almost had forgotten streams and rivers do get dry.  I'll check out<br/>
Titanic Outfitters.  We must have dependable tubes.  I'll be watching the<br/>
local conditions reports, which reminds me, did y'all know there is a<br/>
webcam where you can watch the corn grow in Indiana?  I am not making this<br/>
up!<br/>
