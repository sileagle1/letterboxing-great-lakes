She also mentioned that last year water levels were VERY low, so conditions were not <br>

Maybe this year will be better.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Acorn, for the info.  We had so much rain at times last year here<br>
that I almost had forgotten streams and rivers do get dry.  I'll check out<br>
Titanic Outfitters.  We must have dependable tubes.  I'll be watching the<br>
local conditions reports, which reminds me, did y'all know there is a<br>
webcam where you can watch the corn grow in Indiana?  I am not making this<br>
up!<br>
