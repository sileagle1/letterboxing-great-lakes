<br>
Do you think there should be a 'secret signal' to identify other letterboxers on the trail, and if so, what?  <br>
<br>
This made me stop and think...How would I answer that question?  Should we have some sort of secret signal or do we just linger around an area, glancing at the other person, wondering when they are going to leave the area so we can palm the box we seek? <br>
<br>
Sometimes, I go to a mini meet and I wonder how I will find the letterboxers that I have never met before and they have never met me.<br>
We usually find each other.  Inky fingers are a dead give away. <br>
<br>
My leg is still on the mend. For now, I'm reduced to short hikes and drive bys. Several new boxes in my area and I just can't reach them.  Oh, the pain of it all.  <br>

That's a good secret signal.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Mr. Beetle is fine.  Mrs. Beetle is not so good.  I'm having trouble walking after the accident.  It's taking a lot of physical therapy and I'm still in a lot of pain.  This is really cutting into my letterboxing activities.  <br>

It is still up in the air whether Addison and I will be attending Boxacon, but we're trying to make it and drag The Fellowship along with us.  When do the festivities start?<br>

A very late CONGRATULATIONS on the arrival of Liam!!! (although, I don't think that was the name we picked at GLK in June...) As for his new trail name/stamp image...a little dragon spewing green "fire" on a beautiful girl in a kimono might work.<br>
We will all miss you at Boxacon - the drive we understand is a stretch, but the feeding demand every 2 hours is just about Tonto's schedule and it hasn't stopped us!<br>
Can't wait to meet the new little boxer!<br>

I hope you have a speedy recovery...I remember how long it took my knee to heal after my motorcycle accident and that was just a really badly skinned knee with no other major damage.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you. And no, Liam is not the name you picked at the GLK gathering. However, I believe you were betting on him being a girl and had picked Susan, or something like that (I can't remember where we left that logbook). For those who were wondering, the result of that guessing game was boy. Turns out a majority of the letterboxers are good at guessing!<br>
<br>
"We will all miss you at Boxacon - the drive we understand is a stretch,<br>
but the feeding demand every 2 hours is just about Tonto's schedule and<br>
it hasn't stopped us!"<br>
<br>
Maybe not, but I'm betting Tonto doesn't then proceed to spit up all over himself, you, the carseat/seatbelt, etc either! Don't worry, there's always the SILO! We're currently planning on coming again this year and we might even dress up too (graphic novels/manga count as comics, right?).<br>
<br>
And, with the passing of yet another birthday and the birth of my firstborn, I am officially retiring my trail name and adopting the "new" trail name of Kimono Momma. I have a stamp concept, just need to sit down and finalize and carve it. So those of you attending the SILO have two things to look forward to...meeting the newest member of our family and a new signature stamp from me.<br>

Kimono Momma<br>
