It is not because they want people to continue to look for something that is not there, rather because it would be impossible to know which finders are reporting a truly missing box and which finders just were not able to find the box, even though everything in the clue seemed to match and they were convinced it was the right place.  I cannot tell you the missing box reports I receive that are not actually missing boxes, and most of these people were *positive* they were in the right place.  It is frustrating enough to me that they then enter an "attempted" status on the box because this often causes subsequent seekers to avoid the box thinking it may be missing, but for a finder to have the ability to actually effect a status change would just be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
While I don't think anyone intentionally sends placers on a wild goose chase for boxes that no longer exist, it is a part of the game.  Letterboxers come and go and leave their boxes behind which then eventually go missing, long after they've stopped keeping track of them.  Even active letterboxers often have a hard time always having up-to-date status on their boxes due to the fact that they have lives outside of letterboxing that usually takes priority.<br/>
<br/>
When you set out to look for a box, there is always going to be the chance that you won't find it, either because of your own error or because it is truly not there -- it could have been missing for 2 years or 2 days, but it is equally as disappointing to you when you get to the empty hidey-hole.  You should always try to contact the placer so they are aware and can check it out.  Many people choose to look only for boxes that have been very recently found, as indicated by status updates on LbNA or AQ -- especially if they are doing the hike with young children, as this is usually a pretty good indicator that the box is still there.  But as with everything in life, there is not always going to be a reward at the end of the trail.  This is where it is definitely a plus if you are enjoying the entire process -- the unraveling of clues, the hike, the time spent outside with friends and family, because even if you don't find the letterbox, you still had a wonderful time and had the opportunity to use the experience as a lesson in disappointment.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also agree with the lesson in disappointment, specially with children. There are so many lessons in life that the children raising children don't have the ability to teach because they haven't learned them yet themselves.  I can say this from experience as I was a child raising children. Thankfully I had a family based support system, not everyone does.<br/>
  We teach our kids to be good losers or good sports. We teach them to share, be kind and courteous. We teach them about the loss of life but how often do we get to teach them how to deal with disappointment? ( I could get on my soap box here about the kids throwing temper tantrums in the stores and the parents/grandparents who give in! But I won't.)<br/>
  In life we all run across so many disappointments and how we deal with them says a lot about our character. <br/>
  So seek out those boxes!! Both the ones recently found and those attempted. Be brave. Head out on your journey with a light heart and a spring in your step. Grabs those clues and dechiper them alone or with friends and family. Enjoy being together and experiencing nature. You will be glad you did..... regardless of the outcome.<br/>

<br/>
If the box is listed on LBNA, send an email to the web masters, explaining that the store is no longer in business and that you have tried contacting the placer so they can update or remove the clues, but you haven't received a response.  Ask the web masters to therefore remove the clues from the active list.   They may then try to contact the planter themselves and if they get no response, they will probably remove/retire/archive the clue.<br/>

Many letterboxers (including myself) really don't want to see an ability for searchers to comment on boxes.  However in the situation you described, here's what I suggest:<br/>
<br/>
If the box is listed on LBNA, send an email to the web masters, explaining that the store is no longer in business and that you have tried contacting the placer so they can update or remove the clues, but you haven't received a response.  Ask the web masters to therefore remove the clues from the active list.   They may then try to contact the planter themselves and if they get no response, they will probably remove/retire/archive the clue.<br/>

&gt; OK - yes - I got it.  I know it's part of the game - But I wish there<br/>
&gt; was a way to place a comment on a box - the one that is annoying me is<br/>
&gt; a Hitchhiker Hostel that was in a store that is now gone.  And yes,<br/>
&gt; I've contacted the placer, but she does not update her boxes and she<br/>
&gt; has retired from LB-ing.  It is a fun concept to go to a HH Hostel -<br/>
&gt; sort of a "sure thing" because it was in a protected store. OK I'll<br/>
&gt; let it go.  <br/>

&gt; I also agree with the lesson in disappointment, specially with <br/>
children. <br/>
<br/>
Having been VERY disappointed at not finding the Calvin &amp; Hobbes box <br/>
near me (my cats were named C&amp;H), I decided ONE LAST TIME (AKA#3) to <br/>
try for this box, as part of my quest to find all findable boxes in the <br/>
county.  Yup, it turns out the hiding place IS under water - foooey.  I <br/>
check nearby spots that are even remotely similiar - nothing.  So, as <br/>
I'm about to walk out of the underbrush, I look back over my shoulder  <br/>
to see this square camoflauged-taped box floating in the water - YES, I <br/>
FOUND IT - wohoo!  What a victory!  I do some first aid, stamp in, then <br/>
find a new hiding place - and later inform the placers.  So, as much I <br/>
really do prefer to find boxes on the first try - having to work harder <br/>
for a find does have its rewards!<br/>

But again, the placer is not active, and it is not my "place" to try<br/>
to retrieve the box because I don't own it. My DD and I were the last<br/>
finders listed on AQ, and there were 3 HH's in there at that time. <br/>
One that we brought back from MA.  Now that we talked it through, I<br/>
believe that is what is bugging me.  I feel bad for the HH that I<br/>
abandoned in that box.  I completely understand retiring from LB-ing -<br/>
I don't understand why she wouldn't let her boxes be adopted or<br/>
retired or retrieved.  But, as instructed, I have let this go (as of<br/>
the my last message) - irresponsibility is all a part of life's lesson<br/>
and Lb-ing.<br/>
