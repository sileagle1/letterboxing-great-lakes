                    <div class="plaintext-content">  We have come around to the view that location is probably the most <br>
important thing to consider when placing a letterbox.  There are many <br>
times we have wondered how a letterbox has survived due to the poor <br>
location it's in.  We've found a  number of LBs with great stamps <br>
and/or beautiful logbooks that seem to be just waiting to be stolen <br>
or vandalized.<br>
  Well, that said what do we look for when placing a letterbox.  A <br>
place...<br>
1.  that is away from casual observation.  A spot off the beaten path <br>
that may require a bit of honest orienteering to find.  That <br>
way "curious folk" grubbing around in the brush are less likely to be <br>
noticed by passersby.  Gather your courage, get off the trail, and go <br>
into the woods. (A - "Mosquitoes and chiggers and ticks - Oh, my!"  M-<br>
 You forgot, "Poison Ivy and spiders and skunks --- Poor Baby!")<br>
2.  that hides the letterbox well.  Grotty, little boys can be, and <br>
usually are, anywhere and everywhere.  (M - Having been one, I know.  <br>
A- No further comment.)   A tiny part of a blue and/or white box <br>
peeking out from under leaves is a beacon.  (A- Now be honest, that's <br>
helped us locate many boxes.  M- Well, OK.)  <br>
3.  that protects the letterbox.  Rain and snow are obvious, but in <br>
one park they were using prescribed fire as a management tool and the <br>
LB was in a hollow log. (A- Luckily the LB was on the side of the <br>
trail/fireline that hadn't been "managed".  M- Old ecological <br>
maxim: "Every community need a crisis.")  We have also found boxes <br>
that have been perilously close to streams and lakes.  One with an <br>
orange stamp pad had been flooded.  It was winter and the inside of <br>
the box was an orange popsickle.  (M- Yeah, and I got orange hands <br>
extracting the stamps.)<br>
4. where it is easy to rehide the box well.  Sad to say some LBers <br>
just don't seem to spend the time to do a good job of rehiding the <br>
box.<br>
   As to urban letterboxes... well, there have been a couple really <br>
good ones (one here in Milwaukee, for instance), but most are <br>
obviously existing on borrowed time.  It seems a shame to spend all <br>
the time scouting out an interesting area, dreaming up and carving <br>
the stamp, writing and posting the clues, and getting all the bits <br>
and pieces together and then basically throwing it all away with <br>
careless placement.  <br>
   So, we feel that location is directly related to the longevity of <br>
a letterbox and the fun/satisfaction of finding it.<br>
