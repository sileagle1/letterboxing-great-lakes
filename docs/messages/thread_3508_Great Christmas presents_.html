one son stating that he will accompany me on three letterboxing <br/>

is very cool.  The other son gave me a gift certificate for a special <br/>

either one--stay tuned! <br/>

I am so glad that both 'kids' (22 and 24) have become interested in <br/>
letterboxing.  We headed to Springfield, IL for a few days of <br/>
roadtrip, Route 66, and letterboxing.  Springfield only has two, but <br/>
they provided a beautiful walk through a beautiful park on a warm and <br/>
sunny day. What great weather we've been having for letterboxing!<br/>
