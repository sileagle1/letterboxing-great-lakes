one son stating that he will accompany me on three letterboxing <br>
searches so that I have a 'body guard' in remote places. I think that <br>
is very cool.  The other son gave me a gift certificate for a special <br>
stamp that he will carve. He also wants to design a hitchhiker.  He is <br>
quite an artist, so I can't wait to see both. I'll hide very well, as <br>
I know they will be great and I don't want somebody to walk off with <br>
either one--stay tuned! <br>
<br>
I am so glad that both 'kids' (22 and 24) have become interested in <br>
letterboxing.  We headed to Springfield, IL for a few days of <br>
roadtrip, Route 66, and letterboxing.  Springfield only has two, but <br>
they provided a beautiful walk through a beautiful park on a warm and <br>
sunny day. What great weather we've been having for letterboxing!<br>
