It has been brought to our attention that letterboxes have been <br/>
placed on National Forest lands. We, the Superior National Forest <br/>
have a policy on placement of geocaches and letterboxes. Our policy <br/>
is available on our website: www.fs.fed.us/r9/superior. We would <br/>
appreciate it if you would place this information on your website or <br/>
at least notify your members to know who owns the lands they are <br/>
placing their caches on. <br/>
We have removed one of the letterboxes off of National Forest land <br/>
and are contacting the letterbox owner to inform them of the removal.<br/>
I can be reached at the above address or by calling 218-626-4322.<br/>
I thank you in advance. Judy Ness<br/>
