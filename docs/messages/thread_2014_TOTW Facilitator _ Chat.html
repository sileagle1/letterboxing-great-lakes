<br>
Mark Pepe's newboxers site has a TOTW, but I think that sometimes it is difficult to come <br>
up with new topics regularly.  Is is a duplication of effort?  Just asking.  Maybe a TOTW <br>
more focused on issues within our GL region as a guideline?  Or maybe a TOTW in the <br>
database, where the question could be posed and responses logged?  Might be a quick <br>
reference?  Just a thought.<br>
<br>
For example:  What time of year do you find boxing the most enjoyable in a specific area? <br>
Why?  Or what types of critters are common a specific area?  Special precautions first-time <br>
visitors should take?  I could see a database forming in this format.  I could create a <br>
database shell and see what everyone thinks.  Do we have sufficient resources to <br>
accomodate multiple databases?<br>
<br>
I read LBGLK, newboxers, travellers, travelling event boxes and the big list.  I am starting <br>
to think the big list doesn't add to my knowledge base and maybe I will drop it.  I also read <br>
Atlas Quest regularly.  I occasionally find time on Sunday to chat (hi bindlebabe) and I <br>
found it difficult to watch several different conversations taking place simultaneously.  It's <br>
a newboxers chat, but I'm not sure it remained focused enough for the newest of boxers.  <br>
Maybe a more local flavor would enhance the chat experience and generate some new <br>
TOTW's that could be posted either on the message boards or in a database.  Or chat <br>
could replace TOTW.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree that it can become difficult to come up with new topics <br>
after you've been running TOTW for a while.  That is the main reason <br>
that it fizzled out here.  I imagine if we began again, there would <br>
be a lot of repeat since there have been so many new members since <br>
then.  You bring up a good point about overlap with the newboxers <br>
group -- I don't know how many people here are regular readers at <br>
the newboxers list, if that would be an issue or not.<br>
<br>
The database idea is interesting and you are welcome to give it a <br>
try.  There is no doubt it would be a great way to organize topics, <br>
but I've found at this group and any other I've ever been a member <br>
of, that very few people actually look through the stuff in the <br>
databases, files, links at a Yahoo! group.  With a database you <br>
would lose the benefit of "discussion" which is what really drives <br>
TOTW more than the topic itself.<br>
<br>
Another option is to have kind of a freeform TOTW -- we could set a <br>
time, say any time on Sunday or Monday morning, etc. and anyone <br>
could throw out a topic, preceeding their post with TOTW.  Once <br>
there is a topic posted, we work with that one for the week and <br>
anyone else who had a topic to post waits until the next week.<br>
<br>
I personally have not ever been a big fan of chat for the very <br>
reason you mentioned -- I find it difficult to follow the variety of <br>
threads that get going.  It always feels to me like people are <br>
stepping all over each other, not to mention it is only a small <br>
percentage of the chat that is actually productive.  My friend and I <br>
have a joke about chat rooms, that sometimes the only conversation <br>
is "hi" so-and-so, "bye" so-and-so and "I'm back."  But I know <br>
people who find it a very effective way to communicate on the <br>
Internet and as it is an option with a Yahoo! group, we are <br>
certainly able to use it if there is interest.<br>
<br>
I liked the comment at the end of your post -- maybe chat could <br>
replace TOTW, or vice-versa?  Perhaps both are not necessary, as <br>
either would provide a forum for tossing ideas around and discussion.<br>
<br>
However, I am finding with this, as with the Gathering and other <br>
things that come up, there are lots of people who think they are <br>
good ideas, but when it comes right down to it, there are very few <br>
who have the time or are willing to put the effort into doing it.  <br>
So while both of these tools (TOTW and chat) are there if we want to <br>
use them and there has been interest expressed, they are not going <br>
to get off the ground unless there is somebody willing to faciliate <br>
them.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">TOTW was/is a good way to bring some reluctant contributors into the<br>
discussion and to share a range of opinions. I noticed during the<br>
early days of this list that a topic would occasionally elicit<br>
comments from people from whom we'd never previously heard a peep.<br>
It seemed as though lurkers would read a topic and realize that they<br>
had an opinion or an idea, and that this was a non-threatening venue<br>
to voice it.<br>
<br>
While we could re-run some of the tried and true topics again and some<br>
of the newer members would gain from exposure to the experience of<br>
more seasoned boxers, it is just as likely that the old-timers might<br>
not take the time to chime in yet again on athe TOTW.<br>
<br>
"What's in your pack" or "Where are you boxing this week" or "What's<br>
the origin of your trailname" can only be explored so many times....<br>
<br>
Having read other regional lists and having tried to come up with<br>
topics for this list awhile back, I think that maybe we need to let it<br>
rise and fall as the desire/need is dictated by the members here.<br>
<br>
We are, by and large, a group of friendly and helpful folks. It seems<br>
as though if someone here has a question or concern, it can be posted<br>
and there are likely to be responses. Perhaps adding the prefix "TOTW"<br>
or something like that will alert the rest of us that you'd really<br>
like some comment or input from a broad base of participant experience.<br>
<br>
As for chat....I've not participated in those kinds of discussions so<br>
I can't address it with any experience. I do know that I'd not be apt<br>
to sit down at a prescribed date/time to interact with boxers online.<br>
