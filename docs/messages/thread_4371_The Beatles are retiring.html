The Beatles Series of 4 boxes in Lake Forest, IL is retiring after just over 2 years.  Paul was reported missing.  He may have been washed away due to unusually heavy rains and flooding.  I contacted the Open Lands Association to inquire if a box was found; and it wasn't.  But they informed me that they 'highly discourage' any treasure hunting games on their properties.  They found a letterbox once before and contacted LbNA.  LbNA contacted me because I'm the only one in this are who is one of those crazy letterboxers.  Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it.  Sitting on the sofa isn't my idea a having fun in life.  That found box belonged to another letterboxer who I recognized and I mailed it back to her.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, John, George, and Ringo bid farewell to Paul...where ever he drifted off too.  And this series will be retiring in the morning.  <br>
<br>
Thought...It's getting harder and harder to find a good place to hide a letterbox.  I guess 2 years was a good length of time for this series, but I would have hoped it would have lasted longer.  Maybe I should recarve Paul and relocate the series.  <br>

I really liked that series.  And Paul was my favorite carving!<br>

enjoy the "Norwegian Woods" after their vist to the diner.  Sorry to <br>
hear that Paul drifted off in the "Yellow Submarine".  "I've Got a <br>
Feeling" that he wanted to go "Here, There and Everywhere", "In Spite <br>
of All the Danger".<br>
<br>
But Beetle, don't say "Not a Second Time"!  "You Know What To Do" - <br>
don't be "The Fool on the Hill", but instead tell us "It Won't Be <br>
Long" before Paul rejoins "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".  I <br>
can almost hear him saying "It Won't Be Long" before "I'll Be Back"...<br>
<br>
"With a Little Help From My Friends" I'm sure we convince you <br>
that "There's a Place" that would be perfect for another "Magical <br>
Mystery Tour" for boxers that haven't met these icons of "Rock and <br>
Roll Music".<br>
<br>
"Do You Want to Know a Secret?" - "I've Got a Feeling" they'll <br>
be "All Together Now" in the near future.  Then you'll be sending us <br>
a message to "Come and Get It"!<br>

Dear Beetle,<br>
I am so sorry to hear about Paul's demise.  Those four stamps are <br>
among my very favorites.  I would suggest you recarve Paul and try <br>
to leave them out there a bit longer because they really are a great <br>
series.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now there's a good idea!  But I'm still waiting for the reunion...even if I have to wait for it to be a 'heavenly reunion.'  The Beatles breaking up.....oh the pain of remembering those days of sue me sue you blues.  <br>
<br>
It was raining today.  This got me to thinking about the heavy rains and flooding in certain low areas and that is surely the reason Paul drifted off.  He was hiding under a bridge and on top of two support beams....at least a foot off the ground.  But when we got hit with those flash flood, down pouring rains recently, I'm sure that had some affect on several letterboxes. <br>
<br>
This might require more thought.  Maybe in the future I will move them as you suggest and plant one box in this current area; a very scenic hike.  And The Fab Four might move to a new home or homes.  <br>
<br>
Tonight, I'm recarving Paul....the new, better than before Macca stamp.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for the idea.  Good reason to be part of this creative, always thinking group of letterboxers.  <br>
