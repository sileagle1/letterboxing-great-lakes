Funny, they set up this program and when I go to report that I have I checked my boxes and report to them they say I dont have to, but their rules say I do have to. Its as if they have intentions of controling it but they dont actually want to do the work. Oh well. I have mine out there until they go "dissapeared". A few have already.  Corie was the ranger in the south district that would go with me and take the GPS coordinates and book them. I cant remember the guy's name who ran it all, he is a Geocacher ... I'll see if I can remember. Does anyone know who sent the email? They tend to go all out for a short term and then drop the whole thing. Our scout troop was going to be working with them on a letterboxing project and then they stop responding. Odd really. Forward this on if you would like to, not sure it will help anyone but I worked closely with them and actually even had the first 4 permits. My advice is .... I bet they will back off in a bit. Really, they only want<br>
 to protect the more sensitive areas and were really easy going about placing in general basic wooded areas. <br>
