<br/>
At my Michael's it is on the side of the room where the artists' materials <br/>
are ... the paints, brushes, artist paper, etc.  There are a couple of aisles of <br/>
artist supplies - if it is not in those aisles, it is the aisle before it... <br/>
I can't remember what else is in the aisle (painting canvas, maybe?)<br/>

<br/>
IF your Michael's has them, look for them in the Art section with <br/>
paints, calligraphy inks, etc. Not all Michael's have them and DON'T <br/>
expect the Michael's employees to actually know where they are. Even <br/>
the ones that are responsible for the section often don't know what <br/>
the stuff is used for.<br/>
