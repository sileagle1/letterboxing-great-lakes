                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did a Google search and found this: "University of Wisconsin-Waukesha <br>
alumna Pamm Kasper, Greendale, has agreed to join the campus' Friends & <br>
Alumni board, filling a vacancy."  Other Internet references indicate <br>
she is a Soil Scientist and avid knitter.  Not only is she teaching <br>
the "College for Kids" about letterboxing, there is a similar class <br>
being offered for "Middle School University".<br>
<br>
I'm hoping she hides a separate box for them to look for, not one (or <br>
more) of the existing boxes.  Not sure how large the classes will be, <br>
but if they look for some of the existing boxes we may need to replace <br>
our logbooks soon.<br>
<br>
To answer Cigna Cat's question re: my Retzer box - I haven't checked it <br>
recently but plan to do so next week since someone reported they <br>
couldn't find it.  I also need to check on our Toboggoning box.  I hope <br>
they're both still in place!<br>
