My last pair of hiking boots I ordered from LL Bean.  They are waterproof, rigid( which I like for hiking) and fit great.  I really like the items from L.L. Bean.  Good quality and good guarantee.  I don't know where you live, but they have a retail store in Schaumburg, Il.  Otherwise, you can order on-line.<br/>

I think it really depends on a) what you are looking for and b) how your<br/>
eet are shaped.  Do you want really warm boots?  Waterproof?  I have a pair<br/>
f Salomon boots that I adore.  They are fairly lightweight, waterproof<br/>
actually the rubber comes halfway up the body of the shoe part), and fit my<br/>
eet perfectly.  They are also pretty rigid, which some people do not<br/>

erfect for me.<br/>
