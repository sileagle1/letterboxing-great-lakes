Oh-oh! Too funny/sad!  I hope my mom's experience won't be <br>
similar....   She was only with us once to find a relatively quick box <br>
(we had been somewhere else and she had ridden with us, it wasn't <br>
specifically a boxing trip).  She was fine tagging along as we searched <br>
and successfully found the box.<br>
<br>
However one of our friends from the hiking club has expressed an <br>
interest in boxing, so she and my mom are going to try it together.  I <br>
carved them signature stamps this week and delivered them (w/logbooks) <br>
on Tuesday night.  I told them they were on their own for getting <br>
inkpads and compasses.  My mom has successfully explored LBNA and <br>
identified some "easy" clues and boxes for them to tackle.  But she <br>
also asked "where are those other places you look at for info?"  I sent <br>
her some links yesterday and she is in the process of figuring out how <br>
to get on this message board, as well as looking at some other sites I <br>
recommended.  We're leaving town tomorrow, and I expect that they may <br>
go out on their first hunt either this weekend or next.  I wonder what <br>
kind of stories they'll have to tell us when we get back home?!?!   <br>
Hopefully it won't be like Tiptoe & Tonto's story.....   (plus I hope <br>
they remember to take their stamps along!)<br>

Now - this is where it gets sticky....the placer is my dearest LBing friend!!!!  What to do?!<br>
<br>
It all worked out in the end...we called the placer and she pointed us in the right direction, plus, she met us at the end of the trail, and gave Mom a ride back to the car.  Phew!  What a day!<br>

Another "oh-oh!...."    Well I'm still hoping for the best...<br>

My mom did successfully register as a member on letterboxing.org last night,<br>
got a Yahoo account, joined letterboxing_usa, and the Great Lakes group.<br>
However she said it was terribly frustrating because she wasn't sure what<br>
she was doing and what everything meant.  I called her to help straighten<br>
things out, only to discover she had actually gotten everything done, almost<br>
w/o realizing it.   (Hi mom!, in case you're reading this!)<br>

  It sounds like this fine gentleman could use a little morning pickup.<br>
  Boodles is good, although I am partial to Bombay Sapphire. Does he like<br>
  olives? On my wedding day, in between the pictures and the reception I can<br>
  recall getting plied with my namesake killers by my father-in-law. The<br>
  reason I remember this so well is that the glass had a fair amount of gin<br>
  intermixed with nine, yes nine, olives. He also did not believe in too much<br>
  vermouth. The approach was to shake the bottle of vermouth, take off the cap<br>
  and wave it over the glass.<br>
<br>
  I have other martini stories, but it seems prudent to stop now and return to<br>
  regular letterboxing discussions at this time. Good luck with the da.<br>

  We are sighing at your seemingly perfect day in initiating your Dad <br>
  to LBing!  We couldn't help but re-live the nightmare day that my <br>
  sisters took my Dad out to find one of our boxes on one of the <br>
  hottest days we had this summer - He couldn't understand why we had <br>
  put all that history "fluff" to explain the box...why we had him <br>
  go "all over cock-robin's barn" to see the whole place when he could <br>
  have gone backwards on the path to find the box in seconds flat!  He <br>
  got eaten alive by mosquitos, my nephew who was along for the event <br>
  got stung by bees and his face swelled up.  If that wasn't enough, <br>
  they read the wrong coordinates and couldn't find the box...So, what <br>
  does dear old Dad do?  He grabs my sister's cell phone and calls <br>
  Tonto to yell at him about what a stupid hobby this is and where in <br>
  the heck (not exactly his word) was the darn (again, not exactly his <br>
  word) letterbox.  This normal behavior would have been easily <br>
  handled by Tonto, but at that very minute he was right in the middle <br>
  of a sales presentation to a big school district and took the call <br>
  thinking it was an emergency - after all it was coming from my <br>
  sister in Ohio...we are in Illinois! and the box was in Indiana!  <br>
<br>
  I don't think we will get him out on the trail anytime soon!  But, <br>
  your account of LBing with your Dad gave us some hope that it might <br>
  be possible to try it again...maybe after we've imbibed him with a <br>
  little bit stronger drink than coffee....Maybe Martini Man could <br>
  help in that catagory!<br>

He he he, the above reminds me of the first time<br>
Deedle & I went out to search for a letterbox.  We<br>
kept griping about how the clues were too vague, and<br>
if WE had placed the box we'd be more specific, blah<br>
blah blah.  However, even though we never found the<br>
box (turns out it might have already been missing<br>
before our ruckus of resorting to looking in every<br>
hole in every tree along the path), it just made us<br>
want to find a box even more, and as much as we<br>
complained about the clues we still thought, "But we<br>
must have done something wrong..."  We have learned to<br>
appreciate and love the "awful-vague clues" now and<br>
laugh when in our planted box logbooks people have<br>
complained about how the clues needed to be more<br>
specific.  Ahh, maybe one day in the future they'll<br>
get it, too. :)<br>
