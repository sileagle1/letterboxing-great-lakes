find some other things that I was looking for - but still have some <br>
questions.<br>
<br>
Store bought - vs - Hand carved.  Is it better to plant Store bought - <br>
or not at all - The answers to this pretty much covered the spectrum.<br>
<br>
Questions I have remaining at the moment.<br>
<br>
1 - is there a place where I can look at the number of boxes people <br>
have scored and attempted?<br>
<br>
2 - has anyone had any problems going alone - I travel with another <br>
human or a dog - but at times I have had some time and wanted to sneak <br>
out on my own??<br>

<br>
I only went out boxing by myself once and I didn't really like it at <br>
all!  I did leave a message on my answering machine at the beginning <br>
of the day saying where I went, but I didn't think about leaving a <br>
message before and after every stop.  That'd be smarter.  My message <br>
was like "I'll be here, here, here, here, here, here..." all spaces <br>
spread out over an entire county!  So, if anything really had <br>
happened to me, that's still a pretty big search area.<br>
<br>
I did okay on all of them except the last one which was at an old <br>
Indian burial ground and it was the last box I did that day, so it <br>
was getting dark.  You have to drive down this very long skinny dirt <br>
road with lots of trees (I hate those kinds or roads in the <br>
evening/night anyway) until you get to a dead end.  There's this <br>
little small trail, not well used that heads off into the burial <br>
ground.  I had already been talking to myself about how stupid this <br>
was to be driving around in the middle of nowhere down this scary, <br>
lonely dead end road.  Then this trail was really spooky, and again, <br>
it's nearly dark, so I was totally freaked out and thinking how dumb <br>
I was and wondering how long it would take someone to find me if <br>
something happened.  When all of a sudden, this deer came running <br>
through the woods and across the path right in front of <br>
me!!!  YIKES!!!!  Needless to say, since I was already to tense, I <br>
flew about 10 feet in the air, let out a loud gasp and a few swear <br>
words!  LOL  But, the burial ground was really cool and it was a nice <br>
spot.   I did manage to appreciate it after I chilled out for a bit.<br>
<br>
I'm glad I went, and obviously nothing happened.  But, the advice <br>
you've had here is good.  Bring a phone, and some protection.  Trust <br>
your instincts and be prepared to abandon ship if things don't seem <br>
right or safe.  Have fun and be safe!<br>
