find some other things that I was looking for - but still have some <br/>

<br/>
Store bought - vs - Hand carved.  Is it better to plant Store bought - <br/>
or not at all - The answers to this pretty much covered the spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
Questions I have remaining at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
1 - is there a place where I can look at the number of boxes people <br/>
have scored and attempted?<br/>
<br/>
2 - has anyone had any problems going alone - I travel with another <br/>
human or a dog - but at times I have had some time and wanted to sneak <br/>
out on my own??<br/>

<br/>
I only went out boxing by myself once and I didn't really like it at <br/>
all!  I did leave a message on my answering machine at the beginning <br/>
of the day saying where I went, but I didn't think about leaving a <br/>
message before and after every stop.  That'd be smarter.  My message <br/>
was like "I'll be here, here, here, here, here, here..." all spaces <br/>
spread out over an entire county!  So, if anything really had <br/>
happened to me, that's still a pretty big search area.<br/>
<br/>
I did okay on all of them except the last one which was at an old <br/>
Indian burial ground and it was the last box I did that day, so it <br/>
was getting dark.  You have to drive down this very long skinny dirt <br/>
road with lots of trees (I hate those kinds or roads in the <br/>
evening/night anyway) until you get to a dead end.  There's this <br/>
little small trail, not well used that heads off into the burial <br/>
ground.  I had already been talking to myself about how stupid this <br/>
was to be driving around in the middle of nowhere down this scary, <br/>
lonely dead end road.  Then this trail was really spooky, and again, <br/>
it's nearly dark, so I was totally freaked out and thinking how dumb <br/>
I was and wondering how long it would take someone to find me if <br/>
something happened.  When all of a sudden, this deer came running <br/>
through the woods and across the path right in front of <br/>
me!!!  YIKES!!!!  Needless to say, since I was already to tense, I <br/>
flew about 10 feet in the air, let out a loud gasp and a few swear <br/>
words!  LOL  But, the burial ground was really cool and it was a nice <br/>
spot.   I did manage to appreciate it after I chilled out for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad I went, and obviously nothing happened.  But, the advice <br/>
you've had here is good.  Bring a phone, and some protection.  Trust <br/>
your instincts and be prepared to abandon ship if things don't seem <br/>
right or safe.  Have fun and be safe!<br/>

&gt; &gt; just pictured someone coming over the hill in overalls spitting<br/>
