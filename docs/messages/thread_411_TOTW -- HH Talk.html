                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've found 8 HH so far and one WAS in a rather large cylinder.  It wouldn't fit into any boxes we found, so eventually we just used a large freezer bag to hold both the HH and the box we had found. We figured that whoever found the box couldn't miss the HH that way. Afterwards, I read on one of the message boards that some people think it is a bad thing to put a box in a bag, so perhaps what we did wasn't the best approach.<br>
<br>
One idea I've had is to place a larger HH in a spot near a box, then put a note in the box with directions on how/where to find the nearby HH.  This assumes the HH is in a waterproof container.<br>
<br>
Generally, I think it is probably best to just use a sturdy baggie to hold the HH and its logbook. That minimizes the space required and therefore maximizes the chances of placing it in a box.<br>
<br>
Where do they go?  I've assumed they're just slowly circulating around.  Unfortunately not everyone sends an email to HH originator or to Wanda & Pete so the HH website can be updated.  Using that website, we like to check on those HH we've found to see where else they've ended up.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, I've been dealing internally with this question for quite some time now (since about April, when I came up with an idea for a letterbox but decided it might make a better hitchhiker since the concept was supposed to be all about letterboxer unity, etc etc, and I thought a hitchhiker would get it a bigger audience).  The stamp is carved, but I've now been debating how to create a logbook.  I could just staple some sheets of paper together, but sometimes I'm a horrible perfectionist (just ask Deedle how many times I've stamped and restamped images to get the "perfect stamp" for our collection while on the trail ;) and want the log book to look semi-professional...or at least, ensure that it won't get crumpled or damaged too badly in its travels.  And, because I'm so protective, I've been trying to search for a container that I could put a hitchhiker stamp in and a logbook and have it small enough to fit inside larger containers.  Film canisters immediately come to mind, but<br>
 then the logbook would have to be rolled, and from what I've seen on the trail, rolled logbooks can be hard to stamp into, and/or the first page gets ruined from residual ink left on the stamp.  I think I finally found the perfect box - a plastic container that travel Q-Tips came in.  Maybe 2 by 3 inches, but that's just a guesstimate...I haven't actually measured it yet, but it looks like it would fit inside the containers we're planning on using for our full-fledged letterboxes.  I'm not sure how well the contents would fit, though, with constant packaging and repackaging.  So maybe I'll just have to give in and put the hitchhiker in a plastic baggie...<br>
 <br>
I know, I'm sure that doesn't help anyone out :)  As for where the missing hitchhikers go, hmmm....I could see them very well partying with the missing socks and the lost car keys in a field somewhere....<br>
