                    <div class="plaintext-content">My very first stamp was store-bought (can you believe I actually found a stamp that said "SpringChick"?).  I replaced that after only a one or so with a hand-carved one once I realized that carving wasn't all that difficult.  I used that one until 100 at which time I began using the stamp I am using now.  My F100 box has both the old one and the new one stamped in.  I meant to switch every 100 finds, but my F200 was up in the U.P. and I don't keep very close track of numbers and didn't even realize I was getting close, so didn't have a new stamp ready for the occasion.  Since then I have stopped keeping track of numbers all together and don't really have any idea what F# I am even at.  I like the stamp I have now and will probably continue using it for a while yet.<br/>
<br/>
I did carve up a tiny stamp a while back that I carry with me and use in micro-boxes because mine is too large for some of the very tiny logs/scrolls.<br/>
<br/>
It is simply a matter of preference...  If you're ready for a change, go for it!<br/>
<br/>
SpringChick<br/>
<br/>
Question of the day...  in which box did SpringChick stamp both the old and new stamps?  Azobox, you cannot answer...  that log book is a collector's item <grin><br/>

I also think it is fine for  a boxer to change stamps as frequently as they<br/>
want.  I have heard rumors of some boxers using multiple trail names and sig<br/>
stamps.  Why the heck not??  Ultimately, this hobby is about enjoying it<br/>
your way and if that means  multiple sig stamps, I personally will enjoy<br/>
seeing them!<br/>
