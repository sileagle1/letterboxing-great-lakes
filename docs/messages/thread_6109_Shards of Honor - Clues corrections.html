&gt; Buckaroo Banzai - as you climb out of the gravity well, you should look for a path to your left, not the right.  ( we even walked that after we planted it and didn't catch that mistake.  ah well )<br/>

&gt; Danger Will Robinson - you are taking 33 steps not 3320.<br/>

&gt; Shards of Honor&amp; Royal Manticoran Navy/On Basilisk Station  These clues are mostly right but the order is all mixed up right now.  As you leave the Death Star, climb the hill.  At a slight crest follow the clues for Shards of Honor and you should find the Basilisk Station box.  Leave that box and follow the clues for Basilisk Station and you should find the Shards of Honor box.  We put a correction in the Death Star box Sunday morning as well, so hopefully people who had not done that loop yet would be able to get it.  Sorry about that mix up, my notes got backwards when we were adding some more boxes after our first planting sweep.<br/>

on Sunday w/just 2 of us covering the same ground.<br/>

Since WFM did find it, but said the box wasn't where they expected it to be,<br/>

We noticed a couple of messages about trouble with Shards of Honor. Are<br/>
those troubles continuing even after using aimlesst's correction below or<br/>
were they with the printed clue packet? We haven't hunted that one, yet.<br/>
There are still lots of gathering boxes on our to do list. <br/>
