                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Everyone! <br>
I know it's been a while since you heard from us, but I assure you we will never stay away long! Just been a busy semester at school for me at UW Stout... and away from each other, Lighthouse Keeper and I just don't seem to make as much time for letterboxing! But I've been on winter break, and thus we've been back on the trails! We finished out 2009 by boxing Wisconsin Hiker's "Year of the..." boxes on the Holidays. What a great way to end the year. <br>
<br>
2009 in summary- Count of boxes that LK and I found together was 206 boxes, 19 HH's! Plus we had our first meet and greet as well as our first event and of course our first boxes planted! Plus we've found boxes in 14 states (together... I think i've found boxes in quite a few more given the road trip I started 2009 on) and Canada! Though we haven't counted, I'm sure LK and I are both over 300 boxes total for ourselves. Not too bad for our first year letterboxing! (Hoping to beat it in 2010 tho!)<br>
<br>
Anyway, we have a good story about todays letterboxing adventure we wanted to share. LK and I went to Menomonee Park in Menomonee Falls, WI to grab a small handful of boxes that were planted for the Harvest Gathering of 2005. The first box we found, however, was located in a rather high opening of a tree and was FROZEN SOLID into that hole! Luckily, we had thought to bring my car ice scraper along (for easier digging, as we have no trowel)... but we were still presented with the problem of how either of us would get up there to dig! <br>
<br>
After finding that having LK stand on my shoulders would not work long enough to be effective, we decided we needed to find some OTHER way to get up there. As usual, the Universe provided us with a solution, and we managed to find some amazing large and sturdy branches that I was able to use like a little ladder to climb up and get that sucker OUT! (I'll see if I can figure out how to post the pictue LK took of me getting that box!)<br>
<br>
Funny thing was, it wasn't even the box we were looking for! This box wasn't even on our list... BONUS! Still, we had to find the other one (which was also in a tree). Turns out, it was ALSO frozen! So I headed back to grab our "ladder" and chopped away a second time. Didn't expect to work up such a sweat on a 15 degree day!<br>
<br>
Then, we nearly left the park without finding the last box on our list because it was getting late for the Packer game! But we only had one more parking lot to check so it HAD to work! (unless we missed it along the way) Fortunately, it was there! So we left the park only 30 minutes late, with 5 new stamps and a great sense of accomplishment! <br>
<br>
Tonight, we are going to brave the cold to check once again for Merlin and Ardea's elusive Chrysalis box. We've looked about 3 other times but we just can't let it go! And while we know that the chances of finding it in the dark are small, I have to leave for school tomorrow, so we MUST go tonight! *grins*<br>
<br>
Well, thanks for enjoying my novella here! Hope you all have had a wonderful holiday season and that 2010 brings you much love, laughter, and letterboxing adventures!<br>

As one, and with love, <br>
