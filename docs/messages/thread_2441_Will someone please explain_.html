Thanks for asking the question, Gooble Gobble, I've just been ignoring <br>
the other lists - I think it is one of those things that if you know <br>
the people involved it is funny, otherwise, I'm with you - way to <br>
confusing.<br>

My read on it is that many "clues" have been laid out via all the conversations, ransom notes, etc. and there is an answer to the mystery, for anyone willing to dive in and figure it out.  Another twist on letterboxing, problem-solving, or clue-deciphering, for those who are so inclined!  Who knows what the reward may be.<br>
