Message:<br>
It has come to our attention that letterboxes are being placed in<br>
Minnesota state parks without prior approval of the park manager. <br>
Would you please advise users of your site that a permit is required<br>
to place a letterbox on land administered by the MNDNR Division of<br>
Parks and Recreation.  The permit process is important for both the<br>
division and the person responsible for the letterbox.  It insures<br>
that the letterbox is placed in a safe location for users, and ensures<br>
that natural/cultural resources are not impacted.  In addition, we can<br>
help the individual place the letterbox in a place where it won't be<br>
destroyed during management actions such as prescribed burning and let<br>
them know when to disable the site during periods when it is not<br>
appropriate for people to visit the letterbox, such as when the park<br>
is holding a deer hunt. Letterboxes without permits are classified as<br>
abandoned property by MN State law and may be removed by division<br>
staff.  Thank-you for your assistance.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">True Story - Once upon a time, some unsuspecting letterboxers planted<br>
a box in a park in a neighboring state.  Unbeknownst to the<br>
letterboxers at the time of planting, said park has a geocaching<br>
policy that specifically applies to letterboxing.  <br>
<br>
Time passed and things changed as they often do.  <br>
<br>
One day, the letterboxers received a Contact the Placer note from the<br>
park manager, informing them that the box was pulled for lack of a<br>
permit and suggesting that the box be picked up at the park office.  <br>
<br>
The intrepid letterboxers conducted some research, located and<br>
reviewed the park policy and responded to the park manager.  The<br>
letterbox appeared to comply with the park's policy, except for the<br>
permit.  The letterboxers had heard no cries of distress or planting<br>
policy concerns from natives to the area.  The park's policy did not<br>
require a fee and did not contain any renewal or other onerous<br>
requirements.  See the guidelines and permit forms at<br>
http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/geocaching/index.html.<br>
<br>
A prompt reply was issued to the park manager.  Were there any issues<br>
with the location?  If not, the letterboxers would be happy to<br>
complete a permit application.<br>
<br>
This prompted a veritable flood of information and helpfulness from<br>
the park manager.  The location seemed acceptable.  Although the snag<br>
was cut, the stump holding the original hiding place remains.  Others<br>
would be involved in the review process.  Once approved, the park<br>
manager would return the letterbox to its home - a very happy event<br>
for the letterboxers.  The park's interest in the letterbox was also<br>
revealed.  You see, while the box nestled in its snag, park staff came<br>
along and cut the snag.  Being neat and tidy workers, they were busy<br>
picking up branches and otherwise cleaning up after themselves when<br>
they discovered and removed the letterbox.  <br>
<br>
The letterboxers proceeded to archive their clue and mark it as<br>
temporarily unavailable.  As the park manager suggested, they plan to<br>
adjust the clue to change the snag to a stump.<br>
<br>
As the letterboxers continue their adventures, they look forward to<br>
receiving an approval and confirmation that the box is living happily<br>
ever after in its home.<br>

You know, I understand some areas/parks/counties/states would like you to  <br>
register your letterboxes. <br>
 <br>
Some places require a registration fee . . . some places require you to  <br>
"check your box once a month."<br>
 <br>
The thing that irks me the most (with the above quote) is, I don't think  <br>
I've *ever* been to *any* park (state, county or national) looking for  <br>
letterboxes and not stumbled across discarded beer cans and garbage . . . in the  wide <br>
open!!<br>
 <br>
The "division staff" will take the time to follow clues to find a box and  <br>
remove it . . . while true litter is out there.<br>
 <br>
I don't have a problem with the rest of the letter, just irked me when I  <br>
read that last line.<br>
