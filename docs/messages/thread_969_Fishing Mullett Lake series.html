Has anyone Up North looked for or found this series? I haven't heard <br>
anything since I planted it and had hoped to check on it over <br>
Thanksgiving weekend. Unfortunately, we didn't make it up that way, <br>
so it looks like I won't know until summer, unless someone out there <br>
can give me an update:)<br>
