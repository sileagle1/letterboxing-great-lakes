Pi is the number 3.14, so Pi Day is March 14th. I had read through lots of clues last fall for SE WI and N IL, and remembered there was one about Pi Day. TJ Mich was right (thanks!) that it was the series around West Bend. Dragon emailed me that it may get replanted later this month.<br>

Had to laugh when I saw the Chuck Norris comment.  My son was looking through FaceBook flair last night and there are pages and pages of Chuck Norris flair--lots of funny comments (Chuck Norris is the reason Waldo is hiding----chuck norris counted to infinity..twice).  I had him check out letterboxing--there were 2 pages of flair on that, including the Great Lakes logo.<br>
