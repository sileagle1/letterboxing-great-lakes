&gt; Hello. Peabody here.<br/>

&gt; To clarify an earlier comment, I knew pi four digits further out  <br/>
&gt; than anyone else in my class. That got me the extra credit.<br/>

&gt; Chuck Norris knows what the last digit of pi is - he round-house  <br/>

Had to laugh when I saw the Chuck Norris comment.  My son was looking through FaceBook flair last night and there are pages and pages of Chuck Norris flair--lots of funny comments (Chuck Norris is the reason Waldo is hiding----chuck norris counted to infinity..twice).  I had him check out letterboxing--there were 2 pages of flair on that, including the Great Lakes logo.<br/>
