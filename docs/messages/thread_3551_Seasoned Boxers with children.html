Hales Angels, I've never been to a gathering with my little one <br>
(she'll be 3 at the Ohio shindig) but would love to hear what you're <br>
brewing up. I'm still trying to figure out how to convince my husband <br>
(a reluctant boxer) and my toddler to go. We'd probably not camp; got <br>
family nearby that needs a visit (my tactic to get my hubby there).<br>
<br>
Can't wait to hear the unveiling.<br>

  I see you guys have been busy planting in the Rock Island area.  I hear a weekend trip coming up for me this spring.  I wonder what Hiker Babe thinks of this??????<br>

My family makes an annual trip to Freeport every year in May/June. We just  <br>
started letterboxing a couple months ago and were thrilled to see you have a  <br>
series of stamps in Krape Park. We go to Krape Park, Union Dairy and usually <br>
eat  at Culvers. <br>
 <br>
I used to deliver wholesale flowers to the flower shops up in Freeport and  <br>
beyond.<br>
 <br>
Keep your eyes pealed, most of my boxes are "Coming Soon" I just wanted to  <br>
"reserve" the box names (and find out which ones are already taken) so that I  <br>
could make my first finders certificates in advance of planting.<br>
 <br>
If the weather cooperates (and right now it's ify) this Saturday should be  a <br>
planting blitz!<br>
 <br>

 <br>
P.S. in the next 12-18 months us Quad-City boxers are hoping to start an  <br>
annual event/gathering in the Quad-Cities -- we have all been busy planting  <br>
(check out Diamonds in the Rough, they've been on a planting blitz  themselves).<br>
