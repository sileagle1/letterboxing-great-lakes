I have been notified that all of my boxes (3) may be missing in the DeKalb area. I hope to get out this weekend to check. Mine have also been out for over a year and they all came up missing around the same time. Coincidence? or Conspiracy?  Are the goblins out gobbling up boxes?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple weeks ago, I received a warning from someone through the <br>
letterboxing website that letterboxes hidden on Winnebago County forest <br>
preserve property (as two of mine are) were in jeopardy of being confiscated <br>
by the forest preserve people.  I have checked both of mine and they are <br>
still in place so far.  The warning mentioned that letterboxes were going to <br>
be grouped with geocaches and under the same restrictions.  I checked the <br>
WNFP website and read that permits are required to place geocaches and <br>
letterboxes.  So far I haven't done anything.<br>
<br>
Two of the six boxes I placed last year came up missing by early this spring <br>
(neither on forest preserve property, however).  I was pretty discouraged by <br>
this.  I am wondering whether it would be a good idea to pull all my boxes <br>
in late fall/early winter and replace them in early spring, rather than <br>
leaving them out to endure another northern Illinois winter.  What do you <br>
guys do?<br>

Seriously though, if it is a group of high schoolers, they really need <br>
to find something else to do with their time. Stealing letterboxes is a <br>
pretty stupid thing to do to get their kicks...especially when most <br>
people have never heard of the hobby before. I can just see it now... <br>
(fade into a HS hallway)<br>
<br>
Teen 1: So, what did you do this weekend?<br>
Teen 2: Oh man, you wouldn't believe it! I annoyed so many people by <br>
going out into the woods and...<br>
Teen 1: Eeeewwww! I've heard of those creepy people before!<br>
Teen 2: No, listen. I went out to the woods, looked for these little <br>
Rubbermaid containers, and get this, I threw them all away! (triumphant <br>
grin)<br>
Teen 1: Uh...how do these containers get into the woods?<br>
Teen 2: These people called letterboxers place them there. It is a <br>
scavenger hunt sort of thing that they like to do. Long hikes with a <br>
reward at the end, you know.<br>
Teen 1: So...you spent all your free time traipsing through the woods <br>
looking for plastic containers just so you could throw them away and <br>
annoy a few people? Dude, you're lame! (walks away)<br>
Teen 2: But wait! It's funny though! (chases after Teen 1)<br>
Teen 1: (mumbles) You wouldn't catch me in those creepy woods unless <br>
there is a Hollister hidden in one of those little plastic boxes.<br>
<br>
And that is how the story would go. Teen 2 would then be known all over <br>
the high school as one of those creepy people who hang out in the <br>
forest preserves all day...lol. Or something like that. ;)<br>
<br>
Okay...I think it is time to go be productive. I think I'll skip out on <br>
subbing today to go steal some geocaches!! Who's with me?<br>

confiscate letterboxes, none of mine on WCFP property have disappeared.  The<br>
two boxes of mine that disappeared over the last winter were on state<br>
property (Rock Cut) and Boone County property (Kinnickinnick).  If anything,<br>
I would blame a curious raccoon (perhaps one who had been trapped and<br>
released by an annoyed suburbanite, and who thus knew that rubbermaid<br>
containers mean FOOD) on the Rock Cut disappearance, and perhaps kids for<br>
Kinnickinnick.<br>
<br>
ALSO - if it was indeed the FP guys, why wouldn't they have taken ALL the<br>
boxes?  I checked on your "Tuber" just a short while ago and found it in<br>
place - although it was uncovered.  I piled the bark pieces back on top.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I would think the FP would be more concerned about the prevalence of<br>
solitary people sitting in cars waiting for a hookup in their parking lots -<br>
especially Blackhawk Springs.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">How long ago did you find Tuber? I was going to try to get out there <br>
this weekend to see if I could find it. Today I checked Creatures... <br>
#1 (with bonus box) and they were both gone.<br>
<br>
Just to be on the safe side, I contacted the WCFPD to see if they <br>
have been or plan on finding and getting rid of letterboxes in the <br>
area. The only thing that makes me wonder if someone actually took <br>
them or not is that there is not one trace that they were there <br>
before. There are no plastic pieces from animals chewing them or <br>
leftover log pieces from people destroying them. Also, I have checked <br>
on geocaches that are near my boxes and have found them missing as <br>
well.<br>
<br>
I don't know. I'm going to drop the issue until I hear back from the <br>
WCFPD. I just want to be able to pass on the information to the <br>
others in the area if they are planning on picking them all up soon <br>
so we can get them out of the preserves. :)<br>
