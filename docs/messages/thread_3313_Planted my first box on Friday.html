nice lady in the town where I work had created so many wonderfully <br>
easy boxes and cool stamps to find. I have quite the collection. I <br>
felt the need to give her something new to do LOL.<br>
<br>
Wow, what a lot of trouble it is to plant a box! I appreciate <br>
evenmore everyoen else's efforts. And this stamp isn't even that <br>
good -- I went to 3 stores looking for the stamp carving material, <br>
finally found some -- beige-ish stuff -- and it was hrrible. Kept <br>
crumbiling. But I did the best I culd with it.<br>
<br>
Me being a scrapbooker, of course I had to make a fancy schmancy <br>
logbook with all my supplies though. So even if the stamp ain't all <br>
that at least the logbook is cool.<br>
<br>
I am hoping I picked a good spot and that my clues/directions were <br>
neither too easy nor too hard. Hoping someone finds it and gives me <br>
some feedback. I will be happy to rewrite the clues if any are <br>
confusing.<br>
