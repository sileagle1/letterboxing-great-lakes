fine Mother's Day.  The weather here this morning was just perfect for it.<br>
<br>
1.  Bundle of Joy in Hinsdale, IL<br>
<br>
Found the box doing quite well, but I THINK the bag to the stamp was ripped<br>
on the bottom.  (We can't remember for sure whether it was Bundle of Joy or<br>
FOOW 5 but we'd say that we're 80% positive it was Bundle of Joy.  We folded<br>
the bottom of the bag up so that, temporarily, it should be just fine.)  We<br>
carry bags with us but none near small enough to be able to replace it.<br>
<br>
Very nicely done stamp.  But I forgot to pack pink ink as suggested!<br>
<br>
2.  Fish Out of Water 5: Swinging Bridge, Riverside, IL<br>
<br>
We were amazed that we were only the second finders!  On the other hand,<br>
maybe it's not so amazing.  Maybe finders before us went mad on the streets<br>
of Riverside before finding the bridge.<br>
<br>
If I never ever see another curving street, it'll be like one century too<br>
soon.  Only the Marquis de Sade could have designed the layout of Riverside.<br>
That took either an evil mind or an alcohol-laced one.  Being<br>
Directionally-Challenged, at least we had a compass with us.<br>
<br>
Found the box easily once we found the swinging bridge and the box was in<br>
good shape.<br>
<br>
Went east along the river to sit down and stamp in.  A family with a couple<br>
of pre-teens slowed down to watch us, so we pretended the letterbox was a<br>
water collection tube and began talking about measuring water pollution and<br>
such.  The father called out, wanting to know how bad the water was.<br>
Ancient called back "That's what we're going to find out!"  They moved on<br>
across the bridge and outta sight.<br>
<br>
3.  Fish Out of Water 9: Hoffman Tower<br>
<br>
Stupidly, we decided to take the route with less hiking since we'd spent so<br>
much time with wandering the streets of Riverside up to that point.  So what<br>
did we decide to do?  Take the "shorter" alternate route that involved<br>
driving instead of hiking to the box, and we ended up wandering the streets<br>
of Riverside once again!<br>
<br>
The second time around was no better than the first.  We ended up somehow<br>
going around in a circle and coming right back to the fire station again,<br>
which is where the swinging bridge was.  OK.  We asked the nice firemen how<br>
to get to Hoffman Tower.  I'm sure they gave us excellent directions.  Being<br>
Directionally-Challenged in every single meaning of the words, we still got<br>
dreadfully lost yet again.  So we decided to just wander around and look at<br>
the incredible houses around the area.  And lo and behold, all of a sudden,<br>
looming up ahead of us was Hoffman Tower!  OK!<br>
<br>
We wandered down the path, being quiet as church mice so as to not disturb<br>
the men fishing.  No women were fishing.  It's Mother's Day!  They should be<br>
home with their mothers!  Or did their mothers kick them out of the house?<br>
<br>
We were the first finders to the box, and all was well with the box.<br>
Further into the woods was a very nice heavy horizontal log close to<br>
waist-height to use for stamping in.  Beautiful stamp!  (This lady can<br>
carve!)<br>
<br>
Started walking down the path back to the car, again being quiet as church<br>
mice.  Suddenly a slightly heated argument broke out between two men fishing<br>
on the bank.  So much for not frightening the fish.<br>
<br>
Saw two mallards, a male and a female, actually standing together in the<br>
fast-running water going over the dam.  Don't have the foggiest idea how<br>
they managed to balance themselves there, but they seemed to be having a<br>
good time.  I don't know whether the argument bothered the fish or not, but<br>
it didn't bother the mallards.  She seemed to be having an enjoyable<br>
Mother's Day.  Also saw some flashy tanagers.<br>
<br>
Took us awhile to find our way to back 31st St., but came home west on 31st<br>
and stopped at Scott's Pet Store at Wolf & 31st.  It's not the Shedd, but<br>
it's still fun to check out every so often.<br>
<br>
Did our best to avoid ZooTraffic.  Figured that everybody would be bringing<br>
Mom to the zoo today.  And even tho we had started out early this morning,<br>
by the time the Riverside streets finally released us, it was close to noon.<br>
Yep, lots of ZooTraffic.  But saw a lot of dads alone with children --<br>
holding the hands of little ones going across 31st, and dads pushing<br>
strollers.  Possibly dads and kids heading off to give Mom some<br>
well-deserved AloneTime?<br>
<br>
Happy Mother's Day to all the Moms out there in Letterboxing World!<br>
