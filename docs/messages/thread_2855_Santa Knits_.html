there at the North Pole, one would have to have some hobbies other <br/>
than letterboxing since the snow no doubt forces much time inside.  <br/>
So knitting seems a logical past-time since the elves pretty much <br/>
have that toymaking stuff under control.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it appears that Santa has had a great knitting teacher <br/>
(perhaps he has attended one of Doglvrs knitting workshops) as my <br/>
Secret Santa has brought me not one, but two pair of the most <br/>
awesome hand-knit socks!<br/>
<br/>
Of course I don't know the real identity of my north-pole knitter, <br/>
and there are no doubt several knitters on the list of <br/>
participants.  Although one person comes immediately to mind, the <br/>
postmark does not match...  however the postmark looks suspiciously <br/>
like that of an individual who could have conceivably teamed up to <br/>
help disguise my Secret Santa's true identity...  Regardless of <br/>
Santa's name, the socks are gorgeous and I love them! <br/>
<br/>
You can see a picture of them in the photos section in the album <br/>
Speedsquare created.<br/>

THANKS!!!<br/>
