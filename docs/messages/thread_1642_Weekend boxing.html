                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just wanted to say we had a great weekend boxing with our niece (Superfrog)<br>
and nephew (Jake the Snake), even though the weather could have been better.<br>
We managed to find 10 fantastic Puddlejumper boxes (hope that poison ivy<br>
doesn't really cause them to quit - they have some great stamps and fun<br>
clues!).  We also found a nice box by the M-Clan (another good carver).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We found a few boxes Friday on our drive up, but on Saturday we were plagued<br>
by on again, off again rain.  As Jake noticed, as soon as we found a box, it<br>
promptly started to rain again.  We ran into some rain at Rock Springs and<br>
didn't have our full packs with us, so no umbrellas.  However it was a light<br>
rain that didn't start until after we stamped in and visited the spring, so<br>
it wasn't too bad - just a short walk back under tree cover.  We managed the<br>
400 Trail with no rain, but as soon as we found Herbie it started.  Martini<br>
Man & I each retrieved an umbrella from our packs, and they protected the<br>
kids & us while stamping in and returning to the car.  We decided we really<br>
should take the other 2 umbrellas from the car for the next hunt.  However<br>
we tossed ours loose into the car to dry off while we ate lunch at a<br>
restaurant and waited for the rain to stop.  It did, so we headed out<br>
searching for "Run, Run, As Fast As You Can" series.  Little did we realize<br>
that the title would become our mantra on that hike!  Not only did we forget<br>
to take the 2 car umbrellas, we also forgot to put our pack umbrellas back<br>
in our packs, so we had NO umbrellas when a downpour started JUST as we<br>
found the first box.  It was a long walk/run back to the parking lot with<br>
the box in hand!  We took cover under a shelter and Martini Man got our<br>
beach towels (& umbrellas!) from the car.  We dried off, stamped in, and<br>
then MM headed back on the trail to replace the box.  Of course by now the<br>
rain had stopped again, so we decided to go for the 2nd box.  We enjoyed<br>
raspberries along the trail and quickly found the box.  However once again,<br>
the weather changed - it got very dark and very windy.  We thought it might<br>
be a tornado on the way...  We did have our umbrellas along, but since it<br>
wasn't raining yet, we made a mad dash to the car and made it back just<br>
before a huge downpour! We stamped in inside the car and after 10 minutes or<br>
so the rain subsided.  Jake & MM went out to replace the box but we then all<br>
agreed we were jinxed and gave up boxing for the rest of the day.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sunday we resumed but even though we got an early start, it was HOT and<br>
HUMID.  We found the 2 boxes at Mirror Lake and attempted one at Rocky<br>
Arbor.  After this, a 5-hour visit to Noah's Ark (huge waterpark) was very<br>
much appreciated by all of us.  However we had a mission - so we headed next<br>
to Devil's Lake.  We hiked all the way around the lake, doing both bluff<br>
trails, to place 3 new boxes.  It was HOT! HOT! HOT!  A quick dip in the<br>
lake cooled us off for the drive home (and to hunt for one more box at the<br>
Merrimac ferry!)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope you all also had a fun weekend (it sounds like the MI crew did, even<br>
though they had some rain).<br>

make a note on the clues and try to head up there in the next couple <br>
weeks.<br>
<br>
It's kind of sad to have a box potentially MIA before it was found <br>
once.  A waste ... I spent a lot of time on that stamp.<br>
<br>
But maybe I just screwed up the clues.  It was a quick place on my way <br>
home so I didn't triple-check (only double-checked).<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well we headed off on Friday to go up North to the Pine River for camping <br>
and canoeing. Last year's outing was our first letterboxing ever.. so guess <br>
our one year anniversary of boxing was this month too!<br>
We did the Newaygo Dry Sand Prairies and Jolly Roger. All boxes doing fine! <br>
Odd that we sometimes look at a tree or log and say, Man that would be a <br>
great place to hide a box.. then after following the clues we end up at <br>
that same tree or log... We managed to make it to the campground after dark <br>
of course and pitched the tent... Next day was great to kayak down the <br>
pine, thank goodness there was a breeze. On Sunday (after the terrible <br>
storms all night, leaking tent and a dead tree branch hanging over the tent <br>
that we did not see on Friday night) we tore down camp and headed off for <br>
more boxing. The Serendipity box which is a mystery box so I can't say <br>
much, but it eluded us last year due to a crucial mistake on my part but I <br>
swore we would be back this year to capture it. And we did! I wish you <br>
could have seen us enroute. For those of you who have found this box you <br>
know what I mean as we did it without the normal transportation. Anyway we <br>
decided to hit Grand Rapids on the way home. Grandvilla boxes seemed to <br>
surround our route home so we decided to hit a few of those. First was the <br>
Make a wish box. Nice park and fun hike. We missed one part of the clue but <br>
manage to locate the box anyway. Our thermometer said 99 degrees.. are we <br>
nuts! Off to the Sphinx and Serpentine boxes... Sphinx we found no problem <br>
well besides the stinging nettles. Sweaty and getting a little agitated we <br>
headed for Serpentine... I really enjoyed this area but did not enjoy the <br>
last of these clues... As naughty dog is a math major I let him handle <br>
these clues but I am sure he didn't do it right :-).. Grandvilla I will be <br>
contacting you off list to confirm... but walking along a man came jogging <br>
by with his dog! Now remember it is 99 degrees out and he was wearing a <br>
sweatshirt! At this point I am ready to strangle Naughty dog and we never <br>
did find the box... dang! Oh well I was glad to be back in the car with the <br>
A/C on.<br>
