I have had the same thing happen to me but I have far less Spam <br>
coming in (yikes! 500 messages!?) so I don't think contact the <br>
placer messages have slipped past me.<br>
<br>
When I read your note, I thought of a possible solution. This may or <br>
may not work, but I have just implement it myself.  <br>
<br>
Try adding the user: notify at letterboxing dot org <br>
(notify@letterboxing.org) to your email address book. I think those <br>
spamguard type programs have a feature that scans the address book <br>
before sending an incoming message to the bulk/junk mail box.<br>
<br>
If you try it, let me know. Maybe we can test each other's mailbox <br>
by using the contact placer feature at letterboxing.org (grin)<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

We've got our yahoo email account set up to sort the messages we get from our letterboxing talk lists into specific folders so we're not reading messages one right after the other & thinking, "Which group does this have to do with, now?"  I'm pretty sure an SBC Yahoo account has the same options for setting up filters, etc., as a regular free yahoo account.<br>
