hiking with this person, (don't get me wrong, Sophie is fun to <br>

impressed with this person, I've decided to write a poem in his <br>
honor....<br>

If you haven't found his "The Mysterious Woman" box yet, check it out.  Nice<br>

He sent me a message today that he had met you on the trail.  I'm looking<br>
