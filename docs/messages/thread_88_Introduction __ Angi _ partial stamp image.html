Apropos Deb's comments about stamping only a part of a larger stamp:<br>
last week while I was doing a bit of maintenance on a very small box <br>
I placed (with, of course, a very small logbook) there was the <br>
wonderful "Team Rabbit" stamp as a partial stamp with only the rabbit <br>
heads and eyes peeking onto the page.<br>
It was great!<br>
So, I'll bet you can make your stamp work.<br>
Welcome!<br>
