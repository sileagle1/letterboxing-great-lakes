Apropos Deb's comments about stamping only a part of a larger stamp:<br/>
last week while I was doing a bit of maintenance on a very small box <br/>
I placed (with, of course, a very small logbook) there was the <br/>
wonderful "Team Rabbit" stamp as a partial stamp with only the rabbit <br/>
heads and eyes peeking onto the page.<br/>
It was great!<br/>
So, I'll bet you can make your stamp work.<br/>
Welcome!<br/>

&gt; Hello Angi, welcome to the group and congrats on finding your first <br/>
&gt; box!  That's great also that you started right out by carving your <br/>
&gt; stamp!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes what people do if they have a larger stamp and it doesn't <br/>
&gt; fit into the log books (as they vary from about 3 x 5 to very tiny <br/>
&gt; ones in microboxes) is to just stamp a portion of the stamp -- one <br/>
&gt; corner or maybe a portion of the image that could stand all on its <br/>
&gt; own.  You can use water-based markers to color just parts of the <br/>
&gt; stamp if you don not want to stamp the entire image.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Boxing!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello everyone! My name is Angi and I just started letterboxing <br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; &gt; week after hearing about it for the first time...last week. I <br/>
&gt; found a <br/>
&gt; &gt; link to the letterboxing.org site while surfing around on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; internet and became very interested in it. When I got the chance <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; went out and bought a stamp kit and made my first stamp. It ended <br/>
&gt; up <br/>
&gt; &gt; being pretty big. It just barely fits on the tiny logbook page as <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; is about 2.5 x 4 inches. Oops. I am probably going to be working <br/>
&gt; on a <br/>
&gt; &gt; smaller one sometime soon.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When I found out that there was a box not very far from my house, <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; decided to start this weekend. I was originally going to start <br/>
&gt; once <br/>
&gt; &gt; school got out because all the other boxes would be like a day <br/>
&gt; trip <br/>
&gt; &gt; for me. Anywho...my first box was found today (or yesterday as it <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; 2:00 in the AM now) and was the Red Rover box (Midway Village) in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Rockford, IL. I didn't really pay much attention to the stamps in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; logbook, but am I right in thinking there was one from Leapin <br/>
&gt; &gt; Lizards? It was fun looking through the stamps.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So I have all this fun looking for my first box...and now I have <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; wait a month to go again. ::cries:: I can't wait for this <br/>
semester <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; be over with.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I hope I am making sense...it is way past my bedtime...lol.<br/>
