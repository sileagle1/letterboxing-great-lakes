But when I got back in from the field, Caveman said the horses went nuts<br/>
from about 4:15am to about 4:45am.  However, he also felt absolutely<br/>
nothing.  Felt nothing, heard nothing, saw nothing.  But he knew something<br/>
was up because I have one Appaloosa that the sky pretty much has to be<br/>
falling before he'll get upset, and Caveman said that even he was a really<br/>
nervous nelly.  So we knew that if THAT particular horse got upset,<br/>
something was going on.<br/>
<br/>
Checked for any barn fires.  Nope, nothing.  Checked for any predators like<br/>
the cougars they seem to be seeing around the Chicago area.  Thought maybe<br/>
one of 'em was lurking around the barns.  Nope, nothing.  Came in the house<br/>
for breakfast, flipped on the TV news, and there it was.  Earthquake.<br/>
<br/>
We desperately need a new garage.  But did the earthquake swallow the<br/>
garage?  Noooooooooooooo.  But I guess no damage at all is for the best.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">- Well, we also experienced the "aftershock" about 10:20 this morning.  <br/>
Normally that is morning break time and lots of people go out and <br/>
walk.  I stayed in.   Those of us who stayed in were "treated" to the <br/>
entire office building shaking.  The walkers did not feel it.  The <br/>
response in the office was interesting....  some unnerved ( as it <br/>
sounded like our suspended ceiling was about to fall on us) mixed with <br/>
some "wow"s, "Here we go again", to applause and cheering <br/>
(environmentalists, and geologists are such geeks).  <br/>
I have to admit when someone dropped something heavy this afternoon, i <br/>
did get a bit spooked. (this happened twice).  <br/>
<br/>
If i am to judge by dogs, i think we are done for awhile....  one is <br/>
lounging and the other is on her perpetual "i want...."  with the usual <br/>
rotation of food, water, out, to play, etc. currently rotating between <br/>
out and food.  But she can't be too serious about the food.... she <br/>
hasn't brought me her bowl yet, nor her sisters bowl - i end up with <br/>
both of them before she gets food. <br/>

PPE who must do something for the impatient dog....<br/>

So I read that there was an earthquake in the DeKalb, IL area that could be felt all the way up here in Milwaukee. I didn't notice it, but did any of you that live closer?<br/>

  The earthquakes of 1811/1812 may have been the strongest that anyone has experienced in this country.  Luckily, there weren't many folks around then.<br/>

It was in an area where there IS no known stress or fault line.  I actually woke up for this one in Buffalo Grove while I've slept through the others that were centered further south.  The big bang woke me, but I didn't register any shaking and promptly went back to sleep a moment later.  I woke up thinking it had been a dream.<br/>
