                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmmm.... I think I told some of you this story. My husband and I  <br>
went to Saugatuck for nice October LBing in a nice town. It was a <br>
spur of the moment trip so we thought we would just get a place when <br>
we get there, mistake #1. Apparently Saugatuck is a destination hot <br>
spot so we couldn't get any thing in town, and only thing that had <br>
rooms was a smelly best western that was NOT cheap. I asked my <br>
husband if I could see what clues he printed out for the weekend. <br>
All the clues he brought were for Battle Creek area mistake #2. So <br>
we thought ok we will just go to the local library and print out <br>
some for this area. Library closed at 12 noon on Saturdays. The <br>
Smelly best western had a wifi in rooms so we thought we will save <br>
the clues to our lap top and take the lap top with us on the trails. <br>
But then the lap top died and we didn't have a back up or a charger. <br>
So the best western had a pay as you go internet connection but no <br>
printer so my husband hand copied all the pertinent info onto paper <br>
from the LB site stopping for frequent hand cramps. We got about 4 <br>
sets of clues before our time on the computer ran out. We found <br>
Dragon Back and Birthday box. We tried to get the other 2 but some <br>
of the clues he wrote down I don't think were right so it was kind <br>
of fruitless weekend. Eventhough it wasn't as great as we thought it <br>
was going to be I realized how much my husband loves me! The weekend <br>
was so ridiculous that we had to laugh and all in all it was a fun <br>
time! The Saugatuck state park is one of the most beautiful places <br>
we have been in MI, we really want to sail there one day!! <br>

That's a great story.  :-)  I think one of our most memorable outings <br>
was when we took a friend of my sons with us letterboxing.  She is 15 <br>
and she's been over to the house when I was carving stamps etc.  The <br>
more she saw the activity the more curious she became.  So we were <br>
headed out one Saturday and asked her if she'd like to come.  We made <br>
a quick trip to Michaels for a small log book and a stamp. When we <br>
got to our destination we handed her the first clue sheet and said <br>
okay lets go.  Nothing truly remarkable happened on the trip to the <br>
box........but it will stay in my mind because of the look on her <br>
face when she uncovered her first box.  It was great!  She's <br>
accompanied us a few times after that and attending a gathering with <br>
us this summer.  I just really enjoyed re-experiencing the first <br>
find.  ~The Cats Meow~<br>

So many memorable moments - funny, sad, happy, exciting!<br>
<br>
I think the most memorable would have to be the getaway weekend my best friend and I <br>
took to Traverse City last summer.  She is more of a shopper and I am NOT!  I had tons of <br>
clues ready to go and all my boxing stuff - she was reluctant.<br>
<br>
She sat in the hotel and solved the entire clues for Wine Country I (a SpringChick box) with <br>
only a brochure and the phone book - I said "Let's go find it!"  she said...nahh..<br>
<br>
Finally - the last day - we are boxing!  She said we would - finally!!!<br>
<br>
We headed out to Old Mission Point - followed the clues for Old Mission Point <br>
Lighthouse...watching her face when the box was exactly where it was supposed to be - <br>
fantastic.  After I am all stamped in and she's waiting to replace the stamp....she says "I'd <br>
really like to have this stamp - it's beautiful."  And that's when I pull out the big guns - <br>
"Maybe you'd like to use the brand new logbook here in my pack."  <br>
<br>
She was hooked!!  We then found Old Mission Peninsula and at The Weagus - my most <br>
favorite find ever...the view...ahhhh the view!  It was a wonderful day!<br>
<br>
Upon returning home, I found 3 images in my email to choose her new signature stamp <br>
from - I carved it immediately!<br>

hooked on boxing and she wanted to go out. We took her 2 year old <br>
grandson with us. I took a stamp I carved and decided not to use, a <br>
little logbook I made, and washable ink for him. The first box we <br>
found was under a bush. So every bush we came to he got down and <br>
crawled around the bush looking for the box. He did mange to find one <br>
for us. He loved stamping in his little logbook. He lasted through 7 <br>
finds and 3 attempts before he fell asleep on us. We had a wonderful <br>
day and have some great memories to share. Hales Angels<br>

   <br>
  On our first trip to Florida, we were looking for 2 boxes in a big forested area. The park rangers had blocked the road because it was underwater in some parts from a recent storm. We drove as far as we could on the road leading through the field to the woods. When we couldn't go any farther we parked the car and started walking. We wandered around for awhile before we found the 2 boxes, and then started back for the car. It had been about an hour since we left it. Suddenly we heard a voice. It sounded far away and like it was coming from an intercom system. We just looked at each other and kept walking. Both of us were thinking we just imagined it. Then we heard it again. This time we couldn't ignore it. We couldn't really tell what it was saying, but sometimes we could make out several numbers. We spent the whole trip back to the car looking over our shoulders and thinking up reasons why we kept hearing it and why it was following us. Ax murderer? Other hikers? The<br>
 rangers trying to track us down because we had abandoned our car in the middle of the field? We thought this was the best possibility because the numbers we could make out were in the license plate number of the car. We finally got back to the car and...nothing. No other cars, no rangers, no ax murderers, nothing. Then when I dropped my backpack into the back seat, the voice! It turned out to be the talking pedometer that was buried under everything else in my backpack! <br>
   <br>
  And the second memorable outing...also in Florida. We parked the car at this little ranger station next to a small area used for fishing and hiking. We headed down the trail into the woods, in the rain. When we were done stamping in we came back and got into the car (really a conversion van). We drove down the little drive to the main road, but had to stop. When the ranger left his little building, he closed the metal gate at the end of the drive and locked it; locking us in. He had to drive right by the car to leave! Don't you think he saw that we hadn't left yet? And it was nowhere near "closing time" for the park. Luckily my husband always carries his emergency tool kit with him on trips. We found a wrench and took the gate apart.<br>
  We were even nice enough to put it back the way it was after we got out. I wonder what the ranger thought about the disappearing car?  <br>
   <br>
  I have a lot more memorable outings if anyone cares to hear them. But why do they all seem to involve a mishap of some sort? (I should write a book!)<br>

started back for the car. It had been about an hour since we left <br>
it. Suddenly we heard a voice. It sounded far away and like it was <br>
coming from an intercom system. We just looked at each other and <br>
kept walking. Both of us were thinking we just imagined it. Then we <br>
heard it again. This time we couldn't ignore it. We couldn't really <br>
tell what it was saying, but sometimes we could make out several <br>
numbers. We spent the whole trip back to the car looking over our <br>
shoulders and thinking up reasons why we kept hearing it and why it <br>
was following us. Ax murderer? Other hikers? The<br>
>  rangers trying to track us down because we had abandoned our car <br>
in the middle of the field? We thought this was the best possibility <br>
because the numbers we could make out were in the license plate <br>
number of the car. We finally got back to the car and...nothing. No <br>
other cars, no rangers, no ax murderers, nothing. Then when I <br>
dropped my backpack into the back seat, the voice! It turned out to <br>
be the talking pedometer that was buried under everything else in my <br>
backpack! <br>
>    <br>
>   And the second memorable outing...also in Florida. We parked the <br>
car at this little ranger station next to a small area used for <br>
fishing and hiking. We headed down the trail into the woods, in the <br>
rain. When we were done stamping in we came back and got into the <br>
car (really a conversion van). We drove down the little drive to the <br>
main road, but had to stop. When the ranger left his little <br>
building, he closed the metal gate at the end of the drive and <br>
locked it; locking us in. He had to drive right by the car to leave! <br>
Don't you think he saw that we hadn't left yet? And it was nowhere <br>
near "closing time" for the park. Luckily my husband always carries <br>
his emergency tool kit with him on trips. We found a wrench and took <br>
the gate apart.<br>
>   We were even nice enough to put it back the way it was after we <br>
got out. I wonder what the ranger thought about the disappearing <br>
car?  <br>
>    <br>
>   I have a lot more memorable outings if anyone cares to hear <br>
them. But why do they all seem to involve a mishap of some sort? (I <br>
should write a book!)<br>

recent trips:<br>
<br>
Boxing in Seattle area, late AUG & early SEP:  Our favorite hikes <br>
were to the top of Mount Pilchuck in the Northern Cascades, where we <br>
had fantastic views of the surrounding peaks from the fire lookout.  <br>
We had to scramble over boulders and then climb a ladder to get to <br>
the lookout.  Oh yeah, there were also two letterboxes at the top! We <br>
also enjoyed a 15-mile hike around Hyas Lake/Deception Pass / <br>
Cathedral Rock and also a hike to the Oyster Dome to see  a great <br>
view of the San Juan Islands. While in the area we had brunch with <br>
Amanda from Seattle and the Green Tortugua (aka Ryan, the creator of <br>
AtlasQuest) and Team Garlic.  Also met ClioMouse during our trip.  <br>
Always fun to meet the people in addition to finding boxes!<br>
<br>
Boxing at "A Pirate in Every Port" event in Connecticut in mid-<br>
September:  Amazing to see so many boxers decked out in Pirate gear!  <br>
(Photos on AQ:  <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/gallery/viewalbum.html?gAlbumId=56 ) <br>
Lots of Pirate themed boxes and we also had the opportunity to eat <br>
dinner with Pete & Wanda (the most prolific boxers that we know of, <br>
with over 10,100 boxes found!).  Wanda has hiked the Appalachian <br>
Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail multiple times - quite a feat! <br>
<br>
Boxing in Delaware at "It's Just a Game" event OCT 6-9:  Boxing a <br>
FULL day in steady rain, but managed to find 21 boxes nonetheless.  <br>
The next day we did some night boxing on a 3.5 mile trail - full moon <br>
AND a skunk!  We let him get well ahead of us before continuing <br>
on...  The last day of our trip we found a box that had been <br>
completely covered by water a day or two before (again, photos on AQ: <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/gallery/viewalbum.html?gAlbumId=143 ). <br>
Lots of "coastal flooding" last weekend! Because the contents had <br>
been double-bagged and well sealed in a good container, there was <br>
only a small amount of water in the box and contents were dry in <br>
their baggies.  Also had a chance to reconnect with several boxers we <br>
had met last year on our trip to Pennsylvania, including most of <br>
those that were featured in the recent "Games" magazine article <br>
(including Dude the Wonderdog).<br>
<br>
Memorable hikes, memorable boxes, and memorable people - letterboxing <br>
continues to be an "excellent adventure" for us!<br>
