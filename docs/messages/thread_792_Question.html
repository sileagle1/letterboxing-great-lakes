Hi.  I am new to this site but not the main one.  I've been LBing <br>
for several months now and just started to think about planting my <br>
own box.  There is a very beautiful and historic place in my small <br>
town but it's on private propery so I called to see if I could get <br>
permission to put one there-and they said i could *IF* <br>
1)  I made it a series (good)  <br>
2) I let them help pay for supplies (good good) and <br>
3)  I do a bit of "advertising" for them (bad!)  <br>
I dont know what to do!!  They are interested in having me do a spot <br>
on the radio letting people know about it.  It's a small town AM <br>
radio station, but I am afraid that my fellow LB'ers will be upset <br>
if I do it.<br>
any advice?<br>

Sounds like they need to do their own letterbox plant.  I find it <br>
difficult to imagine advertising the letterboxing attraction of this <br>
place on the radio (if that's what they want you to promote).  I have <br>
a hard enough time explaining the hobby in half an hour, much less <br>
trying to do it in 30 seconds!<br>
<br>
There have got to be other places around you that would be great <br>
locations for a plant - ones that you'll feel comfortable with.  Good <br>
luck!<br>

I, for one, am so violently opposed to the unbearable amount of marketing that we're barraged with everyday that I find it repugnant to attach it to a hobby like letterboxing.  I've heard reports of corporate magazines suggesting that retail stores plant a box, just to use it as an avenue for more advertising.  We are literally unable to get away from advertising (even my public school is no longer a commercial-free zone) without putting up a fight- I would hate to see letterboxing become a vehicle for more commercialism.<br>
 <br>
Maybe if there's public land near your intended site you could use that?  Reference the nearby private property in the stamp and image, but plant it in an area that won't make you accept such an offer.<br>
 <br>

<br>
Absolutely not!  There are plenty of "urban" letterboxes out there.  And, if you look in the archives, there is a thread about the metro crawl, which is a whole series of boxes placed near the tracks, several of them in restaraunts.<br>
<br>
As for your delema with the private property owners, maybe if you explained to them why you didn't want to do the advertising for them (for example, that's not what letterboxing is about) they would understand and let you place it there anyway.  It couldn't hurt to try...all they can do is say no and then you're back where you are now.<br>

<br>
I have stumbled upon caches while out letterboxing--and have also <br>
gotten reports of people finding caches while searching for one of <br>
our plants (or seen notes from cachers in our logbooks).  Unless you <br>
know about the other hobby and check their websites for locations of <br>
plants, you are not going to know if there is a box near yours.  And <br>
even if you would check their website, it might not do you any good.  <br>
If I checked the geocaching site for a certain area's caches and saw <br>
all those coordinates, it wouldn't do me any good since I don't have <br>
a GPS and have no clue where the cache is.  Likewise, if a cacher saw <br>
the clues for a letterbox, they might not have a clue where it is <br>
since it probably doesn't list coordinates.<br>
<br>
I don't think most letterboxers have the opinion that geocachers are <br>
out there maliciously destroying letterboxes or purposefully taking <br>
the stamps.  It is just upsetting when a stamp is taken when you have <br>
a big "Not a geocache!!" label on your box--and the person doesn't <br>
take the time to read that and so takes the stamp that you slaved <br>
over carving.<br>

As the mother of two Geocachers I have found that their "fun" in <br>
planting the geocache seems to be in the creativity of the "box". I <br>
have been told of hollowing out a log and placing a container in it. <br>
My oldest found a plastic rat ten feet up in the tree with it's belly <br>
slit open for the container. With letterboxing it is usually pretty <br>
obvious where a box could or can't be located. But with the geocache <br>
seems that they are so intent on it "not" being found that they do <br>
indeed need to root up the entire area to find it!<br>

<br>
If All Things Green is out of state then I probably won't be going.<br>
I live in Minnesota and as of yet have not been boxing or event <br>
boxing in other states. I did attend the Great Lakes Gathering 2008 <br>
in Afton State Park this year, if you were there. What state are you <br>
from? I have also done volunteer interpreting at my church even <br>
though I am not yet licensed.<br>
<br>
Thanks for keeping in touch! This is really cool to finally meet <br>
other boxers that know about ASL! Butterfly came from Massachusetts <br>
in November and that was my first real experience using ASL on the <br>
trail (actually at a mini-event) because Butterfly is Deaf.<br>

According to the permit to place a letterbox in a state park in Minnesota, you have to provide the directions to the hiding place, so do I have to go to the park, find my hiding spot, figure my clues, submit it BEFORE I even place the box like it says or can I place my box during that same trip in the hopes its approved? <br>

Before placing any boxes, and subsequently talking to rangers & the like. I recommend you find several boxes first (50 -100) to see how other people have placed them/written clues, etc. Every now and then I find one that is totally unique (and we've found 600+) and I contact the placer and asked them for advice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe a better route to go than talking to rangers. <br>

I recommend you find several boxes first (50 -100) to see how other people have placed them/written clues, etc. Every now and then I find one that is totally unique (and we've found 600+) and I contact the placer and asked them for advice.<br>
<br>
Maybe a better route to go than talking to rangers. <br>

We were just at Afton not that long ago, I didnt even think to check for letterboxes. We geocached. What was I thinking!! Haha!<br>
Well thanks for the information. I think I will just do it the proper way for the Minn. state parks and talk to the rangers when I go to place the box and around? here (Iowa) im going to talk to each parks rangers, ask for their help in choosing spots and see how it goes. So far no has even heard of letterboxing around here that I have run into.<br>
Once I go through all this a couple times I will get the hang of it. Then it will be easier. <br>
Thanks everyone for all your ideas.<br>

When the Great Lakes Gathering was held at Afton State Park in 2008, a local ranger contacted some of us to request that forms be submitted "after the fact". In that case, the boxes had been planted as part of the gathering, and left as permanent boxes, so they already had locations when we filled out the forms.<br>
<br>
But I can tell you that the ranger who pulled the boxes (initially) and helped facilitate completion of the forms was really helpful as far as providing coordinates for the box locations. (That was another field on the form.)<br>
<br>
If I recall correctly, you really do need to be able to give a specific location for the box, because they then approve the location. I went through a similar process in McHenry County, IL, and had to submit the form three times, suggesting different spots before they ultimately approved one.<br>
<br>
So it would be a good idea to find out if there are any areas that the park considers off limits due to conservation or risk concerns. Those were the things that caused some of my previous forms to be returned, and that resulted in back-tracking on my part.<br>
<br>
But I do think that the MN form requires an exact location.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wish there were 50-100 around here ( or even close) for me to find. Someone did hide a box in Sanborn, 45 mintutes away, I did go find that one last weekend. <br>
We are going to an event in Cottage Grove,MN in Oct and plan on boxing there and back. I might not get 50-100 but im trying.<br>
Im still going to place some boxes around here, may or may not be in a state park/grounds. Its fun. I have been told numerous times to keep hiding and eventually people will come and find them and hide their own. Which will be cool.<br>
There are so many geocaches around here, now we just need letterboxes.<br>
I carve my stamps and make my own journals for the boxes. I really enjoy doing that. Although im not at the bragging point for my carves. :)<br>
I have a 'mentor' from AQ helping with LTC's, And then postals. Gotta have something to do during the Winter months. :)<br>
I am hoping next summer to do a bit more traveling and find a bunch more so I can stop referring to myself as a newbie. How many do you think that will take??<br>
Thanks for all the advice and information. There is alot out there. I have spent hours and hours in AQ reading boards, tutorials, links, blogs, etc...<br>
I hope to get some more one on one at the Cottage Grove event in Minnesota in Oct.<br>
I would love for a more experienced boxer to come my way and hide a box with me. That would fun. Anyone?? Hahaha!<br>
Thank you again for the advice.<br>
