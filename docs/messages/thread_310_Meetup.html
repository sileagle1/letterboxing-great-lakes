Just to let people know, not all of the Bristol stamps that were <br/>
there last year will be available this year.  We're still working on <br/>
placing them, but with a big change in the roles of some people and <br/>
some not returning, we've only got 2 or 3 confirmed so far.  I'll <br/>
keep this list updated as a can, and look for new clues before the <br/>
Ren Faire opens.<br/>

&gt; July 10th just happens to be the first day of the Bristol Ren. <br/>
Faire, <br/>
&gt; if anyone is interested. I will be going that day and I believe <br/>
&gt; Dumpster Diva and Lipstick Chick might be as well. Maybe some of <br/>
us <br/>
&gt; could meet up there?<br/>
