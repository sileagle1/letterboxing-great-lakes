Just to let people know, not all of the Bristol stamps that were <br>
there last year will be available this year.  We're still working on <br>
placing them, but with a big change in the roles of some people and <br>
some not returning, we've only got 2 or 3 confirmed so far.  I'll <br>
keep this list updated as a can, and look for new clues before the <br>
Ren Faire opens.<br>
