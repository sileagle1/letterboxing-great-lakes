was talking next year. I like my gatherings to be a little... <br/>
different. It takes me a while to put it all together. But if you <br/>
would like to do one this year, please be my guest. You know I just <br/>
thought of an idea for a mini gathering that might be fun. Contact me <br/>
off list if you would like to hear my idea, and maybe help with it if <br/>
you like the idea.<br/>
