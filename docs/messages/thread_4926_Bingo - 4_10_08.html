It's going to be crazy!  Looks that way, anyway.  Fun for us, not so <br>
fun for Spring Chick, I think!<br>

LOL Interesting theory!<br>
<br>
After 4 months, I finally figured out (at least partially) the secret <br>
behind those mysterious posts.  So, I'm pretty sure the answer to <br>
your question is "no".<br>
<br>
I'm guessing she picked 4 days out of a hat!  Seems like a reasonable target.<br>
<br>
I'm still hoping for tomorrow!<br>
