There WILL be letterboxing at the Bristol Ren Faire starting this<br>
Saturday (when the faire opens)!<br>
<br>
We have some returning from last year and some new ones for your<br>
letterboxing enjoyment!  Since all of the clues have changed (even<br>
though some stamps have not) we are declaring that any of the stamps<br>
you get this year will be considered new finds, even if you got the<br>
stamp last year!<br>
<br>
The new clues will be posted a little later this week (before<br>
Saturday), but here's a taste of what we have for you this year:<br>
<br>
"LETTERPEOPLE"<br>
Eric Grainger (was The Crier Stamp in 2003)  (Available all faire days.)<br>
St. Brigid's Cross(was The Sweet Scent of Bristol Stamp in 2003)<br>
(Available all faire days.)<br>
??Sleeping Beauty?? (was The Tintinnabulation Stamp in 2003 but may<br>
have a new/different stamp this year)  (Available all faire days.)<br>
Letters, Letters, Everywhere (aka The Kilt-a-fied Stamp in 2003)<br>
(This letterbox is available on Sundays only.)<br>
The Knight of Swords (same as 2003) (Available all faire days)<br>
<br>
"LETTERBOXES" (Altiod Tins - stamp and small logbook only)<br>
The Great Food of Bristol Series (NEW!!)<br>
Garlic Mushrooms<br>
Pippins<br>
Turkey Legs<br>
Ale<br>
Spicy XDXrXaXgXoXnX CHICKEN Wings<br>
<br>
& The Letterboxing Bristol Ren Faire (LBBRF) stamp<br>
<br>
Sorry, the following stamps are not available this year:<br>
<br>
The Elusive Security Stamp (she quit)<br>
The Thomas Cecil Stamp (he married and moved on)<br>
The Hard Core Trad Stamp (Rua's in Ireland playing her many instruments)<br>
The Gamemaster Stamp (??????)<br>
Please No Rats in the Soup Box (she might actually be at the Dirty<br>
Duck still - we don't know, this was an independant letterboxer)<br>
<br>
Bristol gave their EMPHATIC approval of this activity, including the<br>
new mircoboxes.  The microboxes will be easy to find, but might not be<br>
easy to sneak away!  I suggest you start working on your "slight of<br>
hand" techniques if you want these boxes!<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
<br>

I haven't been to RenFaire in so long ... maybe I'll just have to <br>
letterbox my way through it on my own - or with Fungus Woman???<br>
