Okay, so back to t-shirts.  How much?  Will it cost extra for trailname?  Do<br/>
we pay ahead of time or that day?  Checks or MO okay?  (I don't do<br/>
electronic payments)  Do you know what color?  Would you like me to shut up<br/>
and stop asking questions now?<br/>

PS:<br/>
<br/>
"If someone wants to design the front and back of the T-shirt and<br/>
send me the design, I'd be all for it, but let me know soon.<br/>
Otherwise I'll work with the T-shirt guy I know. The suggestion was:<br/>
"I'm thinking something like the LBNA logo with "Letterboxers leave<br/>
nothing but great impressions." on the front, and on the back "Great<br/>
Lakes Gathering 2004 Cooler by the Lake in Illinois" on the back,<br/>
with the option of getting your trail name on the back shoulder."<br/>
(I suppose we could put www.leterboxing.org on it too - re:<br/>
SpringChick's message.)"<br/>
<br/>
That sounds like a good suggestion.  Make sure you spell "letterboxing"<br/>
right though!!!  (-:    (just teasing)<br/>
