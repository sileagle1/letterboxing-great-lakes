For some reason this morning I thought to myself, wait a minute.... I <br/>
think I just placed those boxes in what is officially a Wildlife <br/>
Refuge and I'm pretty sure that is a no-no.  Sure enough, I checked on <br/>
the Internet and it is NOT allowed.  I've just always thought of the <br/>
area as "Horicon Marsh", without any official designation, but that <br/>
was my mistake.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes will be there until we can get up there to relocate them or <br/>
if anyone from our area goes up to find them, could you bring them <br/>
back with you and make arrangements for us to pick them up from you?<br/>
