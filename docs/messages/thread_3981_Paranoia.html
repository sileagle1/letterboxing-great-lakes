experience at one time or another.<br>
There have been many discussions on this list over the years about how<br>
to create diversions.<br>
After all, if we *appear* to be doing something very expected or<br>
normal for a particular place, we hardly stand out at all.<br>
<br>
Artistamp and I almost always have a camera with us and very visibly<br>
present. We can appear to be taking pictures of trees, flowers, bugs,<br>
even eachother <g>.<br>
Other boxers assume a birdwatching persona, staring very intently at<br>
who-knows-what? Pointing at a tree with obvious curiosity is part of<br>
the role.<br>
<br>
I planted a box in a cemetary once and had to return several times for<br>
maintenance. I always had the camera. And even though I know that some<br>
of the neighbors were watching me, I made a point of visiting several<br>
of the sites and stones on each trip. I did not have any problems there.<br>
