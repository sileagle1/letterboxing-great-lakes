out LBing and make him drive, hahah! I think we might hit Oakland <br>
county or something completely different, like Wayne (never LBed <br>
there). I hope we don't get rained on and we find all the ones we are <br>
after. So I'll let all the people who's boxes we find know that they <br>
are safe and sound, or in need of repair. Anyone have a good box <br>
suggestion to find before we leave at 11:30am today?<br>
