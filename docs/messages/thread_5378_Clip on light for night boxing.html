I only did night boxing once.  Up in Madison I think it was the Duck <br/>
Pond one.  11:45pm!  Too bad I had to come home to Waukesha and get up <br/>
the next morning for work!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have good night boxing stories?<br/>

little crazy to keep going over the Rocky Mountains, then I said to <br/>
myself, "Yes, I have been known to persevere to get that box I came <br/>
for - You are not that different than Mathw!"   ;) I guess this <br/>
coming winter will test me - it's my first as a dedicated boxer.  I'm <br/>
looking forward to boxes related to the holidays, Leap Day, Pi <br/>
Day...  ;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of "Deere", I came close - 4' - to a deer several times while <br/>
looking for the Three Billy Goats Gruff boxes near a school.  It's head <br/>
moved, but it was there every time I went back and forth trying to find <br/>
what I believe was an MIA box.  I even figured out how to take a <br/>
picture with my phone!  I was reminded of Ardea's First Sighting, a box <br/>
we found at the 10th Anniversary of LBing in Wisconsin.  A deer is not <br/>
SO startling (or rare) as what Ardea saw though.<br/>
