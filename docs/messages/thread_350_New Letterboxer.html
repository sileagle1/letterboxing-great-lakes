Hiya everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I'm a brand new letterboxer in the southwest Chicago suburbs, and I <br/>
found my first 3 boxes today!<br/>
This is horribly addicting... I stayed up half the night last night <br/>
carving stamps, I have 4 ready to go for boxes I am making  :-)<br/>
<br/>
On the subject of box maintenance, my "letterbox kit" now includes a <br/>
ziploc baggie with a wet sponge in it so I can keep everyone's stamps <br/>
clean that I get when I am finished.  (It's also great for cleaning <br/>
BEFORE you stamp, especially if the person before you used some darker <br/>
ink than you are going to use).<br/>
I also have extra baggies and a small spare journal to help out if <br/>
someone's box needes it.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing!<br/>

Any relation to Laughing Coyote? (Another boxer in your area.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I find it helpful to take dry rags/towels to dry the stamps<br/>
after cleaning.<br/>

although we usually stayed in the city and took the train out every <br/>
morning -- doing the commute made us feel like true Chicagoans!<br/>

There is a pretty active group of letterboxers in the West Michigan <br/>

of the bunch!<br/>

Good luck on your first LB trip this weekend!<br/>

Muskegon State Park in North Muskegon, MI.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Gatherings folder in the Files section of this list with <br/>
a text file containing some basic info on this event.  It is also <br/>
listed at AtlasQuest (http://www.atlasquest.com/events/).  More <br/>
information will be up within the next few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
There will also be a Fall Gathering in MI this year.  I am still <br/>
working out arrangements for location/shelter, etc. but should have <br/>
that finalized by the end of this week.  Tentative date is Oct. 22, <br/>
possibly the 15th or 29th if those are the only dates we can get the <br/>
shelter.  Tentative location is Yankee Springs Rec Area -- just off <br/>
U.S. 131, between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo).  This is a nice <br/>
easily accessible and centralized location for West MI boxers and <br/>
there are really great trails here.  In the event that this shelter <br/>
is not available for any of the dates, we are looking at a couple of <br/>
other locations, but they are not as centrally located so I am <br/>
keeping my fingers crossed on Yankee Springs.  More details as soon <br/>
as I have them.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you at one or both of these events!<br/>
