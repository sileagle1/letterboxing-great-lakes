                    <div class="plaintext-content">I stopped after work this afternoon and picked up the White River <br/>
Lighthouse box.  I received report from a recent finder that the <br/>
area where the box was hidden has been posted as a Dune Preservation <br/>
Area and is now off-limits to foot traffic.  The box was in its <br/>
hiding spot safe and sound.  I think more than a few fisherman <br/>
wondered what on earth the crazy woman was doing walking out on the <br/>
beach/up into the dunes in work clothing in the fog (I really need <br/>
to remember to pack other clothes).<br/>
<br/>
I was so surprised to see that only 7 letterboxers/letterboxing <br/>
groups had logged in during the 18 months it was in place -- the <br/>
first finders being Leapin' Lizards last May -- 8 months after the <br/>
box was planted!  Anyway, I will clean the box up and plant it in a <br/>
new location.  Should go back out sometime next week with a little <br/>
extra surprise to sweeten the pot.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who found it for all the nice comments!<br/>

 SpringChick, <br/>
<br/>
We were shocked to find that we were the first finders after 8 months <br/>
of it being there...other boxes in the area seemed to be very active.<br/>
