It was with great pleasure that our traveling troup of talent was able to visit and meet you all at the GL Gathering last June. <br>
Since then, Boch's Circus has sadly split into factions that are independently visiting other areas of the country. You were the last performance as a complete troup. It was a pleasure to serve as temporary ringmaster for your fellow countrymen.<br>

So may good things in 2005.  We found our 200th letterbox, enjoyed <br>
the "Around the World In 80 Days" series until we hit a few snags near <br>
the end (we started too late in the year, but we anticipate completing <br>
the series early this year), we letterboxed in North Carolina, <br>
Virginia, Missouri and Indiana, and we thoroughly enjoyed the Yankee <br>
Springs gathering last Fall.  We are looking forward to an even better <br>
year in 2006.  We already have plans for a letterboxing trip to Texas.<br>

after a sheerly hideous day at work (the kind that<br>

epiphany and finally solving the clues for "One Tin<br>

the box the next day! The best mental health day EVER<br>
and one of my favorite finds to date. This year, I<br>
just want to do a lot of hiking......and maybe finish<br>
"Around the World" as Katrina threw a wrench in my<br>

Probably the biggest thrill was finding Green Tortugua's "McNeil Point" box<br>
near Mount Hood in Oregon.  Here's a link to the clue (it includes some<br>
photos):  http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?gBoxId=17  The hike was<br>
great, views were fantastic and we could hear the glacial ice cracking.  It<br>
took us quite a while to find the right "rock" in the photo, so when we<br>
finally did, we were ecstatic!  We were only the 2nd finders in 4 years.<br>
<br>
Other highlights were meeting so many friendly boxers in Pennsylvania and<br>
Oregon.  We really enjoy the chance to go out boxing with some "locals" when<br>
we travel and also meet them for dinner.  The hospitality of people such as<br>
Lightin Bug, Janilla, Irene of Hikers'N Hounds, Funhog & Pungent Bob, Maiden<br>
and all the other folks we met in these 2 states was much appreciated!<br>
<br>
We were also happy that the weather cooperated for the Haunted Harvest<br>
Gathering and that we had such a great turnout for the event!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Looking back on my first year of letterboxing it is hard to find a <br>
favorite moment, but here is a small collection:<br>
<br>
My (our) First, First Finder.<br>
<br>
Attending the "Haunted Gathering" and being able to put a face to <br>
the Stamps/boxes. (Not to mention having a terrific time and getting <br>
a ton of boxes! Thanks Wisconson Hiker and Martini Man)<br>
<br>
Carving my first stamp and having it not really stink and then <br>
planting that box.<br>
<br>
The rainy day that we got Poo Shoe, Girl with a sword, The Haunted <br>
Trail, and many many others.  A real test, if you still enjoy it <br>
when the weather stinks you must really enjoy it.<br>
<br>
The stunning realization that not only is this fun but it must also <br>
be exercise because just doing it is making me lose weight that my <br>
Dr. says I have to lose. (If you find it on the trail, I'm sorry and <br>
no, I don't want it back.)<br>
<br>
Spending all this extra time with my wife and getting our friends <br>
into it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I know that this was more than one but really it was a great year!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too would find it difficult to cite just a single box or event <br>
from the past year.  The highlights for me have been:<br>
<br>
* My favorite letterbox/hike would have to be WI Hiker's Moose Lift <br>
LB near Champion, MI.  This was an incredibly beautiful hike, <br>
particularly on a sunny autumn day.<br>
<br>
* Favorite series would be the Bailey's Washington Island Series <br>
(WI) by the Leapin' Lizards.  A couple of these challenged us (and <br>
almost made us miss the ferry), but we ended up with them all.  <br>
Superb scenery, superb carvings!<br>
<br>
* Meeting and spending the entire morning chatting with Norse Gnome <br>
while up in the U.P. this fall.  Oh, and that Big Pine letterbox <br>
that had us two-tracking for miles down mud-filled dirt roads (a <br>
couple of times wondering if we would soom be out pushing)...  and <br>
we even saw a bear!<br>
<br>
* Most memorable is definitely the rock scramble for the Bear Fence <br>
LB in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains.  We got to this one late in <br>
the day and although we would be tempting dusk (and thus had a <br>
slight concern about bears), it didn't sound like *that* long of a <br>
hike and we wouldn't be back that way the next day.  After climbing <br>
and climbing up the face of rocks and narrow ledges, we reached *a* <br>
summit.  While breathtakingly high and breathtakingly beautiful <br>
(especially at dusk), this was not *the* summit.  We looked ahead on <br>
the trail which skirted the edge of the rocks with a sheer drop-off <br>
along one side.  Not being mountain goats, we turned around, reread <br>
the clues and found an alternate way to the box in which we actually <br>
walked on the AT for about a mile, which was very cool.<br>
<br>
* Another highlight of the Virgina trip -- finding my first [clued & <br>
planted] Legerdemaine letterbox.  Oh what beautiful works of art his <br>
stamps are.  Certainly treasures in my logbook.<br>
<br>
* How can I not look back and remember meeting Mark & Sue Pepe?  <br>
Although that was one highlight of the GLG, it was certainly not the <br>
only highlight as it was great to attend that gathering and meet so <br>
many new letterboxers in the GL region and see all of the wonderful <br>
carvings in Boch's Circus.<br>
<br>
* Attending the Mystery Gathering in Rhode Island and getting to <br>
meet so many letterboxers from all over the country, particularly <br>
many whom I've exchanged e-mail with for the past 3 years -- <br>
Alafair, Funhog, Turtle McQ, Amanda from Seattle, Trish, Jay Drew, <br>
Wanda & Pete, Warrior Woman, Clueless & Silent Doug, Team Green <br>
Dragon, Always Chaos, Poison IV, Lady P... and of course a surprise <br>
visit from one of Michigan's own LB icons.  This was such a <br>
fantastic event -- I highly recommend it to anyone who has the <br>
chance to get to RI in the fall.<br>
<br>
What a *GREAT* year it was!  Thank you everyone for being a part of <br>
it!<br>

Gathering.  It was so much fun putting the names with<br>
faces, and all the extra word of mouth boxes and bonus<br>
boxes, etc.  That there were that many other crazy<br>
people like Deedle & myself who liked to search for<br>
plastic boxes in the woods was a wonderful<br>
realization.<br>

Highlights of Letterboxing 2005.<br>
<br>
1. My boyfriend's proposal using a series of letterboxes! (The Questions 1,2,& 3; Columbus area, Ohio)<br>
<br>
 Yes, I answered with a letterbox! (The Answer; Columbus area, Ohio)<br>
<br>
2. Our 10 day Letterboxing Honeymoon Extravaganza! 68 attempted boxes between Tallahassee, FL and Baton Rouge, LA.<br>
<br>
 We visited right between Hurricane Dennis and Hurrican Katrina. We also got to meet BOXDN <br>
<br>
 and get an exclusive US state (Ohio) Coin letterbox.<br>
<br>
3. Getting LB find #100! Destin: Henderson Beach State Park Series - PeekaBooBoo Kitty by Beachy.<br>
<br>
4. Finding out about Postal Letterboxing. (I'm totally addicted. I still love traditional letterboxing, <br>
<br>
 but postal fills in the gaps during the cold season.)<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Hopes for Letterboxing 2006.<br>
<br>
1. Another Letterboxing vacation; maybe to Connecticut.<br>
<br>
2. Having a great time at our first gathering. (Jan 21, Winter Barbeque in Louisville, KY)<br>
<br>
3. Getting LB find #200 AND PLB find #100.<br>
<br>
4. Maybe hosting a gathering in central Ohio.<br>
