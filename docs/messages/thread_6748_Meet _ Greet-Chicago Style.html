We would like to thank all of you for going out of your way to make our guests from Connecticut feel welcome!  We were so happy for the great turnout representing a good part of our Great Lakes area - you all are the best at making people feel welcome!<br>
<br>
Also, we feel that a good start was made toward little "Baby Bean's"  reading material thanks to the generous gifts of letterboxers attending the event....again..we repeat...YOU ARE THE BEST!  Thanks for coming!<br>
