Yikes!  <br>

But, in order to bring some calm into our letterboxing<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I decided to let the TOTW lie for a bit.  Participation had dwindled to just<br>
a few folks each week and list chatter is carrying itself well with topics<br>
presented for discussion by various members without presenting specific TOTW<br>
posts.<br>
<br>
Perhaps once we get a bit past the first of the year and life calms down a<br>
bit, I will revive the TOTW.  We continue to grow and some of the previously<br>
discussed topics would be helpful discussion for new members and good<br>
refreshers for list veterans alike as winter wanes and thoughts once again<br>
turn to letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Of course, anyone can post a topic for discussion at any time so if there is<br>
something that you feel would make a good TOTW and you'd like some input, by<br>
all means, pose the question to the list.<br>
