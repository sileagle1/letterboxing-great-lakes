<br/>
I'm sorry to hear about your boxes and the damage done to them.  Can you <br/>
explain more about what your "In Memory of All Missing Letterboxes" is?  <br/>
Do you put all the remaining pieces and parts in one large box or is <br/>
this a traveling event box with it's own stamp and logbook??  Either <br/>
way, it sounds like a great idea!<br/>
<br/>
About all those CT boxes gone---if that many boxes went missing over <br/>
this past weekend-ish, that was one heck of a lot of effort someone put <br/>
into pulling that many boxes?!  It makes you wonder who would be that <br/>
motivated or had that much free time, doesn't it?? <br/>

&gt; Some of the boxes I place are 'drive by' or require short hikes. I <br/>
&gt; think there should be a wide range of letterboxes for beginners, <br/>
&gt; people with limited mobility, as well as for the adventurous hikers <br/>
&gt; who will hike miles and enjoy the journey even if the box is missing. <br/>
&gt; So I assume some of the risk if a box is easy to find and ends up <br/>
&gt; being short lived.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At times like this, I pull back and rethink the true nature of this <br/>
&gt; hobby. It's sooooooo easy to blame others, but there IS a solution. <br/>
&gt; This hobby was intended to be a challenge for adults. Children were <br/>
&gt; welcome to come along, but I doubt young children or first timers <br/>
&gt; would pursue this hobby if more of the letterboxes were more challenging.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven't read about this epidemic in CT, but I will. This is one <br/>
&gt; reason I created a hand carved stamp and logbook called "In Memory of <br/>
&gt; All Missing Letterboxes." It was available at local gatherings upon <br/>
&gt; request to anyone who has ever lost a letterbox. Maybe CT folks would <br/>
&gt; like to create a similar tribute to those lost boxes and the people <br/>
&gt; who created them.<br/>
