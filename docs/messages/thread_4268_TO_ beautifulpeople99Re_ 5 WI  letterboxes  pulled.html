<br>
I'm sorry to hear about your boxes and the damage done to them.  Can you <br>
explain more about what your "In Memory of All Missing Letterboxes" is?  <br>
Do you put all the remaining pieces and parts in one large box or is <br>
this a traveling event box with it's own stamp and logbook??  Either <br>
way, it sounds like a great idea!<br>
<br>
About all those CT boxes gone---if that many boxes went missing over <br>
this past weekend-ish, that was one heck of a lot of effort someone put <br>
into pulling that many boxes?!  It makes you wonder who would be that <br>
motivated or had that much free time, doesn't it?? <br>

Some of the boxes I place are 'drive by' or require short hikes.  I think there should be a wide range of letterboxes for beginners, people with limited mobility, as well as for the adventurous hikers who will hike miles and enjoy the journey even if the box is missing.  So I assume some of the risk if a box is easy to find and ends up being short lived.    <br>
<br>
At times like this, I pull back and rethink the true nature of this hobby.   It's sooooooo easy to blame others, but there IS a solution.  This hobby was intended to be a challenge for adults.  Children were welcome to come along, but I doubt young children or first timers would pursue this hobby if more of the letterboxes were more challenging. <br>
<br>
I haven't read about this epidemic in CT, but I will.  This is one reason I created a hand carved stamp and logbook called "In Memory of All Missing Letterboxes."  It was available at local gatherings upon request to anyone who has ever lost a letterbox.  Maybe CT folks would like to create a similar tribute to those lost boxes and the people who created them.   <br>
