                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, if you haven't found my Happy Unbirthday box yet, I must <br/>
correct the clue. Where it says "southeasternmost intersection," <br/>
please know I really was referring to the OTHER southeast- commonly <br/>
known as southwest. To those who managed to find it despite my <br/>
confused directions, I send you my apologies and kudos. <br/>
<br/>
Next, I must add my appreciation for the mad planning skills of <br/>
Martini Man and Wisconsin Hiker- everything was just great. I can <br/>
only imagine how much time and energy you spent organizing this <br/>
shindig! Many, many thanks from me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Coffee Beans for putting up with two days of nonstop <br/>
opinionated sibling interactions (to Atom- I was totally correct).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who welcomed me to the group. I really enjoyed <br/>
meeting you all. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, thanks to the fine folks who manufacture the allergy <br/>
medications that allowed me to make it through the outdoorsy weekend <br/>
alive.  <br/>

P.S. How should I count the stamps I found this weekend? I <br/>
understand exchanges, but what about PTs? The Tess stamps? Cooties? <br/>
Please, educate me. Thanks in advance. <br/>
