Through the mud, rain, slips, falls, tornados, rabid raccoons, broken tents, finding shelter in outhouses, calls to the EMTs, etc etc etc . . . you guys simply amaze me with your good attitudes & graciousness!<br>
<br>
During the bad weather on Friday night, a HUGE number of you ventured out (including two that escaped their hotel while management had it under lock down during the tornados), to meet up at the after-gather. What was the final number? 30, 45? Either way, you guys made it and had a good time sharing horror stories of the day over some good food. Nothing like closing down a place at midnight . . . oh, and for our two fugitives that escaped from the hotel, they went back out to box the night away!! <br>
<br>
My words can only go so far. I've never known a heartier group of folks that love nothing more than to smile and laugh through lifes slips and falls . . . oh, and there's that planting and finding of rubber stamps in the woods too.<br>
<br>
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!<br>
<br>
Kudos to all of you, I'm privileged to call you friends!!<br>

Letterboxers are a pretty adaptable lot.  I think some of our good attitude starts with our fabulous hosts, however.  You all did such a great job with this event.  It was obvious that a lot of effort went into making this a great gathering.<br>
<br>
I felt bad for you that the weather did not cooperate, but it certainly made it more memorable.  We'll be talking about this one for years.  Picture us in, oh, 2040, walking (maybe a little more slowly) along the trails, wearing Tshirts that read "I survived GLG 2010", telling the young whippersnappers about risking life and limb to find some coins.  If "that which does not kill me makes me stronger", we all got a little stronger this year - and had a great time to boot!  <br>
