                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello All,<br>
Deb, I'm glad you began the TOTW here.<br>
First off, I'm a packrat and I'm afraid it's a trait that has <br>
followed me into letterboxing. SO the pack continues to grow and <br>
grow...I've disovered that it's now HEAVY. Yipes.<br>
Okay, quick inventory..<br>
Stamp and several ink pads are bundled with compass, paper, pens, <br>
baggies of several sizes, a spare logbook, wad of paper towels, <br>
alcohol wipes (for our hands as much as anything else), a few snacks <br>
(of course!)into a small over-the-shoulder or around-the-waist bag.<br>
That goes wherever we go and might conceiveably find a letterbox OR <br>
ANOTHER LETTERBOXER. Nothing worse than having that on-the-trail <br>
encounter and not having your stamp!(It happened to me while I was <br>
checking boxes last summer.)<br>
If we're going to be out for awhile, that smaller bag is supplemented <br>
with a backpack. Clipboard, groundcloth, matches, maps, flashlight, <br>
simple first-aid stuff, spaceblanket, knife,(most of the "Ten <br>
Essentials" for you serious hikers), and food and water. Oh, and a <br>
cellphone.<br>
Hey, I said I was compulsive.<br>
<br>
A number of the items I've listed I've learned from other <br>
letterboxers.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to hearing others' responses.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our pack is a "mini" backpack, purchased from a clearance rack at an office<br>
supply store.  It isn't as big as our regular daypacks we use for hiking,<br>
but is roomy enough to hold the necessary items.  We carry most of the items<br>
mentioned by everyone else:<br>
<br>
journals, stamps, clues, ink pads (and now lots of LePlume markers!), wipes,<br>
a pen, compass, gloves, extra baggies in various sizes, a Swiss army knife<br>
and a mini "leatherman" tool, a nice masonite board to act as a lapdesk<br>
(gift from Merlin!).<br>
<br>
Some other things we carry are an extra logbook so we can replace one if we<br>
find a box with a damaged, missing, or full logbook.  (We found one once,<br>
but this was before we thought about bringing a spare along.)  We also have<br>
some duct tape rolled around a pencil.  Duct tape can be used to patch a<br>
hole and could be handy for other things.<br>
<br>
We have several "first finder" key charms on the zipper (from Agent Ink &<br>
Z-fan boxes) and the LBNA patch on the outside of the pack.<br>
<br>
In the winter we use additional packs we received as gifts from Martini<br>
Man's parents.  These packs are actually a combination of pack & campseat.<br>
Our regular LB pack can fit inside this pack.  Having the campseats is<br>
really handy in the winter when there might not be a good place to sit or<br>
temporarily place items.  Being able to sit down to take care of stamping in<br>
(aided by the lapboard) is great.  The pack pouch is then under the seat, so<br>
it is convenient to place the box lid and other items as you go about the<br>
business of stamping logbook, journals, etc.<br>
<br>
I've put a photo of our pack in the Photo section of the LbGLK group.  It<br>
shows many of the items we always have in our pack.<br>

P.S.  I love the idea mentioned of bringing a camera as a prop - we have<br>
often felt we looked like quite suspicious characters and a camera would be<br>
a good cover.  (Especially when you go to a dog park to look for a box, and<br>
you don't have a dog!)<br>

Sorry, I had to mention this :0  <br>
Remember years ago when it was a fad to have those sort of stiffened <br>
or starched leashes attached to a harness so that it looked like you <br>
were walking an invisible dog. :0<br>
Guess I'm up too early;)<br>
But it would be pack friendly<br>
oh well, never mind ;)<br>

I thought a topic pertinent to that was in order...<br>
<br>
What do you look for when finding new places for boxes?  What are <br>
the qualities about a spot that make you say, "this is the spot?"  <br>
Do you have potential clue elements in mind as you look?  Do you <br>
tend to favor trails in the woods over urban locations or vice <br>
versa?  Do you seek out a specific type of hiding spot?  I am <br>
interested in both the big picture -- surrounding area, down to the <br>
specific qualities that you favor in a hiding spot.<br>

We look for places that we would like to visit with<br>
our friends and families.  The places doesn't always<br>
have to be a place of pure beauty.  Just interesting. <br>
Lately, we have been looking to place boxes in large<br>
series... We have several that have been placed or are<br>
just about ready to be placed.  The series are either<br>
city wide, state wide, or nation wide such as our<br>
Route 66 series.<br>
<br>
 What are <br>
> the qualities about a spot that make you say, "this<br>
> is the spot?"  <br>
As far as specific box placement, we look for areas<br>
that will not hold water...and are easy to camoflage. <br>
Having a view of what you brought the finders there to<br>
see is cool too...(when it happens):)<br>
<br>
 Do you have potential clue elements in mind as you<br>
> look? <br>
<br>
Sometimes things just click...one future series is<br>
going to require quite a bit of knowledge of the topic<br>
of the series.  Sometimes Sara gets an idea for a<br>
story.  She loves Spring Chick's stories.:)<br>
<br>
 Do you <br>
> tend to favor trails in the woods over urban<br>
> locations or vice <br>
> versa? <br>
Woods...we never really feel comfortable finding boxes<br>
in the city...too hard to look like you belong there.<br>
<br>
 Do you seek out a specific type of hiding<br>
> spot?  <br>
Any spot that is dry, fairly difficult for an animal<br>
to remove the box, and that allows the clues to work.<br>

I received the following message in an email from the <br>
notify@letterboxing that was a direct response to the TIME article:<br>
<br>
<br>
Message: <br>
I read about letterboxing in the latest issue of Time. I found the <br>
web site saw that your boxes are near by so I thought I would try. <br>
Today, Tuesday 7/20/04, it was a little warm at one in the <br>
afternoon.I went to the site off Hankes. You should see the way <br>
people have looked around the dead tree off the path on the left <br>
behind the old cabin. I was ready to give up and write to see if the <br>
box was still there. But, then I decided to go further. I finally <br>
found it in back under the tree branches. I was the second one <br>
there. Someone that uses a stamp of zorro was there on the 17th. I <br>
can't wait to see if my wife wants to do the one with multiple <br>
boxes. We use to do treasure hunts at night, where you solved <br>
puzzles and drove around the country. This was great fun! Thanks!<br>
<br>
<br>
We discovered letterboxing as a result of an article in Family Fun <br>
magazine.  Maybe the local authorities will not be so concerned <br>
about the placement of boxes on public land as a result of the <br>
article?  Since all of my boxes are close to my home, I like to <br>
check on them when we pass by.  There are many entries that make <br>
mention of a first letterboxing experience.  <br>

By the way, there are some new boxes in Illinois.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Based on what I am hearing, perhaps a routine TOTW is not the best <br>
route to go given the mix of old and new members and that so many <br>
topics have already been discussed.<br>
<br>
What I would like to propose is an impromptu TOTW.  Anyone who has a <br>
topic that they think would make a good discussion topic for the <br>
list, please post prefacing your subject with TOTW.<br>
<br>
A few ground rules:<br>
<br>
1) Anyone can post a TOTW.<br>
2) When posting a new topic, please begin your subject line <br>
with "TOTW."  When replying to a TOTW, please reply to the original <br>
post and keep the subject line as it was.<br>
3) Remember to delete parts of the message you are replying to that <br>
are not pertinent to your post so that they do not get so long for <br>
those receiving the digest.<br>
4) If there is an active TOTW, please wait to post yours -- by <br>
active TOTW ,I mean something that was posted within the past 3-4 <br>
days and/or is still receiving input and discussion<br>
5) If you were a part of a previous discussion on this topic, please <br>
do not post "we already discussed this" as the poster may be new or <br>
may be interested in feedback from folks who were not around during <br>
the previous discussion.  If you have participated in a disussion on <br>
the topic at hand and don't care to share your response again, don't <br>
say anything.  If you want to post a message number as to where the <br>
previous thread can be found as additional input, that is fine.  <br>
6) If you have something to add to the discussion, please feel free <br>
to post, but try not to post just saying, "yeh, me too."  We want to <br>
hear your perspective.<br>
7) Keep in mind that by nature a TOTW solicits opinions and they may <br>
or may not agree with yours, however each person's opinion should be <br>
respected.<br>
<br>
Good?  I will post a starter TOTW in the next message... and after <br>
that, it is an open forum.<br>
