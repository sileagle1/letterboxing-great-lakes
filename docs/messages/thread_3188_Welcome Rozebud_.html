Oh, and Hi! New here...invited to join by your own Wisconsin Hiker<br/>
after we met as the "folks coming from furthest away" at the DE Games.<br/>
Boxing seems to be less active in the midwest (and almost non-existant<br/>
here in St. Louis) so, looking for a little community, here I am! Nice<br/>
to "meet" you!<br/>
