Sorry to hear about such a tale of woe about the 80 Days series....  It will<br>
be even worse when you find out someone else found the elusive boxes this<br>
weekend!  The DARK side of letterboxing.  Yes, I can believe your family<br>
might be thinking about having you abducted to cleanse you of this<br>
addiction.  We, of course, take your point of view - hey!  it's hiking and<br>
we're just looking around while we're out there anyway.....  However we can<br>
tell you must have been BITTERLY disappointed in your recent hunts - we have<br>
NEVER said we hate letterboxing and that we would give it up.  However some<br>
clues and clue writers have generated a fair amount of discussion and<br>
gnashing of teeth on our part!<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to seeing you on Saturday!  Hopefully you won't feel<br>
compelled to slip off to MI instead...<br>

80 Days series! I know that B and I had a few of those moments, as <br>
well (Particularly when we were sure we were in the right spot but <br>
the box wasn't there! A few times, this was due to letterboxer <br>
error... but once it was not.). I hope you recover your letterboxing <br>

I went to find one on my own, and looked for hours, left dejected... and <br>

<br>
rofl!  I am so sorry my dear - alas, I know exactly how you feel....maybe we<br>
<br>
were stuck on the very same box?.....<br>
I went to find one on my own, and looked for hours, left dejected... and <br>
tried another - couldn't find that stinkin' box either!!  I was convinced I <br>
could NOT letterbox alone!  Went back with Mr. and the kids to hunt again <br>
and met up with Grandvilla and Mobiusklein in the parking lot - and darn <br>
that Grandvilla - she walked right to it!  (God love 'er!)<br>
<br>
Mrs. Doglvrs  (who can't wait to give you a big hug on Saturday!)<br>
