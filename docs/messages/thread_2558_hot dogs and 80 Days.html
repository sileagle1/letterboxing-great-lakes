Sorry to hear about such a tale of woe about the 80 Days series....  It will<br/>
be even worse when you find out someone else found the elusive boxes this<br/>
weekend!  The DARK side of letterboxing.  Yes, I can believe your family<br/>
might be thinking about having you abducted to cleanse you of this<br/>
addiction.  We, of course, take your point of view - hey!  it's hiking and<br/>
we're just looking around while we're out there anyway.....  However we can<br/>
tell you must have been BITTERLY disappointed in your recent hunts - we have<br/>
NEVER said we hate letterboxing and that we would give it up.  However some<br/>
clues and clue writers have generated a fair amount of discussion and<br/>
gnashing of teeth on our part!<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to seeing you on Saturday!  Hopefully you won't feel<br/>
compelled to slip off to MI instead...<br/>

rofl!  I am so sorry my dear - alas, I know exactly how you feel....maybe we<br/>
<br/>
were stuck on the very same box?.....<br/>
I went to find one on my own, and looked for hours, left dejected... and <br/>
tried another - couldn't find that stinkin' box either!!  I was convinced I <br/>
could NOT letterbox alone!  Went back with Mr. and the kids to hunt again <br/>
and met up with Grandvilla and Mobiusklein in the parking lot - and darn <br/>
that Grandvilla - she walked right to it!  (God love 'er!)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hopefully, a week of frantic end-of-the-school-year-crazy teaching<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;will offer a little R&amp;R and I will be fully recovered by this coming<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;weekend! Let me explain...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We also attempted to do as many of the 80 Day boxes that we could<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;fit in this weekend...That screaming you heard in the state of<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Michigan you ask? Tonto is making me confess that it was not a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;sonic boom...it was me screaming in moments of frustration, I HATE<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;LETTERBOXING" - Yes, it is true, I shouted this more than once in<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;the woods...the shame I'm feeling is more than I can stand. Trying<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;to get the 80 Day boxes, fighting the mosquitoes, the stinging<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;nettle, 600 miles in the car, and the 90 degree temps all were a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;piece of cake....The stamps were so wonderful that I could hardly<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;contain myself. We also managed to get a few of the Holy Grail<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;boxes including the "Migrating coconuts", but then it<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;happened....one of the 80 Day boxes eluded us....Maddening insanity<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;swept over me....We even stayed overnight near the eluding box -<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;thinking maybe we had hit a wall (and darkness!) a good night's<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;sleep would clear our thinking...back at it in the morning, it still<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;didn't reveal itself....AGHHHHH<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We had to shake the insanity out of each other - there was talk<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;about getting a chain saw and just mowing down the whole area until<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;we found the dog-gone box, but common sense prevailed and the only<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;damage done was a very heavy trodden trail to where the box should<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;have been!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We felt it best we move on, after all there were more world cities<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;to conquer and the clock was ticking...Thankfully more success came<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;in day two - We even ran into Kiss me Kate and Barefeet Ankh (who<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;wasn't barefoot at all I might add!) - fellow Illinoians trying to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;show the Michiganders that we too can scoot around the world in<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;record time - but then as the sun was setting and the bugs were<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;again feasting on our sweaty stinkin' flesh ...it happened again! A<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;second box proved to be our undoing..this time the clues just<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;evaporated...there was much swearing...and swating!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With tears in our eyes, scratches on our legs and fists shaking at<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;the sky we headed "back home again to Indiana"...We stumbled into<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tiptoe's parents cottage bewitched and bewildered just as the last<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;vestiges of light for the day gave up it's last spark. Her parents<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;scolded that there must be therapy available for this horrid hobby.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thankfully it was a holiday, and the Indy 500 was still filling much<br/>

this weekend! Wish we could've met up on the trail... Weren't the <br/>
stamps awesome?  Anyone thinking about doing this series know that <br/>
inspite all our frustration at not finding two of the boxes this <br/>
weekend this is without a doubt one of the best series we've ever <br/>
done (I'm sure if we lived in Michigan and could've done the boxes <br/>
at our leisure it wouldn't have seemed so overwhelming) - We love <br/>
having Spring Chick and Azobox in the Great Lakes region to push us <br/>
to our limits in this hobby!<br/>

our tinkerbell letterboxing lights will come alive again!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;that an intervention is going on somewhere in either Indiana or<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Illinois!<br/>

&gt; &gt; rofl!  I am so sorry my dear - alas, I know exactly how you <br/>
&gt; feel....maybe we<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; were stuck on the very same box?.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; I went to find one on my own, and looked for hours, left <br/>
&gt; dejected... and <br/>
&gt; &gt; tried another - couldn't find that stinkin' box either!!  I was <br/>
&gt; convinced I <br/>
&gt; &gt; could NOT letterbox alone!  Went back with Mr. and the kids to <br/>
&gt; hunt again <br/>
&gt; &gt; and met up with Grandvilla and Mobiusklein in the parking lot - <br/>
&gt; and darn <br/>
&gt; &gt; that Grandvilla - she walked right to it!  (God love 'er!)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;WI hiker &amp; Martini Man - We will gladly bring a couple of <br/>
packages<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;each of brats/hot dogs and buns - We really appreciate all your <br/>
&gt; hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;work and incredible attention to detail! But I must warn you <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I've sworn off letterboxing...Yes it is true, I quit! ....<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hopefully, a week of frantic end-of-the-school-year-crazy <br/>
teaching<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;will offer a little R&amp;R and I will be fully recovered by this <br/>
&gt; coming<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;weekend! Let me explain...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;We also attempted to do as many of the 80 Day boxes that we could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;fit in this weekend...That screaming you heard in the state of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Michigan you ask? Tonto is making me confess that it was not a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;sonic boom...it was me screaming in moments of frustration, I <br/>
HATE<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;LETTERBOXING" - Yes, it is true, I shouted this more than once in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the woods...the shame I'm feeling is more than I can stand. <br/>
&gt; Trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to get the 80 Day boxes, fighting the mosquitoes, the stinging<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;nettle, 600 miles in the car, and the 90 degree temps all were a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;piece of cake....The stamps were so wonderful that I could hardly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;contain myself. We also managed to get a few of the Holy Grail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;boxes including the "Migrating coconuts", but then it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;happened....one of the 80 Day boxes eluded us....Maddening <br/>
&gt; insanity<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;swept over me....We even stayed overnight near the eluding box -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;thinking maybe we had hit a wall (and darkness!) a good night's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;sleep would clear our thinking...back at it in the morning, it <br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;didn't reveal itself....AGHHHHH<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;We had to shake the insanity out of each other - there was talk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;about getting a chain saw and just mowing down the whole area <br/>
&gt; until<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;we found the dog-gone box, but common sense prevailed and the <br/>
only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;damage done was a very heavy trodden trail to where the box <br/>
should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have been!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;We felt it best we move on, after all there were more world <br/>
cities<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to conquer and the clock was ticking...Thankfully more success <br/>
&gt; came<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;in day two - We even ran into Kiss me Kate and Barefeet Ankh (who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;wasn't barefoot at all I might add!) - fellow Illinoians trying <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;show the Michiganders that we too can scoot around the world in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;record time - but then as the sun was setting and the bugs were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;again feasting on our sweaty stinkin' flesh ...it happened <br/>
&gt; again! A<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;second box proved to be our undoing..this time the clues just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;evaporated...there was much swearing...and swating!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;With tears in our eyes, scratches on our legs and fists shaking <br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the sky we headed "back home again to Indiana"...We stumbled into<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Tiptoe's parents cottage bewitched and bewildered just as the <br/>
last<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;vestiges of light for the day gave up it's last spark. Her <br/>
&gt; parents<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;scolded that there must be therapy available for this horrid <br/>
&gt; hobby.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Thankfully it was a holiday, and the Indy 500 was still filling <br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;of the conversation, or else we are certain a <br/>
&gt; family "intervention"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;may have been called to convience us that we just have to give up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;this maddening addiction...at a weak moment Tiptoe promised to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;quit....Again, a good night sleep, (and getting out of hostile<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;territory) led us to clearer thinking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;We have returned home and read all the exciting posts regarding <br/>
&gt; next<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;weekend's gathering...Letterboxing smiles are beginning to <br/>
return <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;our faces...But, if you are missing a few hot dogs and brats, <br/>
know<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;WI hiker &amp; Martini Man - We will gladly bring a couple of <br/>
&gt; packages<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;each of brats/hot dogs and buns - We really appreciate all <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; &gt; hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;work and incredible attention to detail! But I must warn <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I've sworn off letterboxing...Yes it is true, I quit! ....<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hopefully, a week of frantic end-of-the-school-year-crazy <br/>
&gt; teaching<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;will offer a little R&amp;R and I will be fully recovered by this <br/>
&gt; &gt; coming<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;weekend! Let me explain...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We also attempted to do as many of the 80 Day boxes that we <br/>
could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fit in this weekend...That screaming you heard in the state of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Michigan you ask? Tonto is making me confess that it was not <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sonic boom...it was me screaming in moments of frustration, I <br/>
&gt; HATE<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;LETTERBOXING" - Yes, it is true, I shouted this more than <br/>
once in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the woods...the shame I'm feeling is more than I can stand. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to get the 80 Day boxes, fighting the mosquitoes, the stinging<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;nettle, 600 miles in the car, and the 90 degree temps all <br/>
were a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;piece of cake....The stamps were so wonderful that I could <br/>
hardly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;contain myself. We also managed to get a few of the Holy <br/>
Grail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;boxes including the "Migrating coconuts", but then it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;happened....one of the 80 Day boxes eluded us....Maddening <br/>
&gt; &gt; insanity<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;swept over me....We even stayed overnight near the eluding <br/>
box -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;thinking maybe we had hit a wall (and darkness!) a good <br/>
night's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sleep would clear our thinking...back at it in the morning, <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; &gt; still<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;didn't reveal itself....AGHHHHH<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We had to shake the insanity out of each other - there was <br/>
talk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;about getting a chain saw and just mowing down the whole area <br/>
&gt; &gt; until<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we found the dog-gone box, but common sense prevailed and the <br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;damage done was a very heavy trodden trail to where the box <br/>
&gt; should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have been!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We felt it best we move on, after all there were more world <br/>
&gt; cities<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to conquer and the clock was ticking...Thankfully more <br/>
success <br/>
&gt; &gt; came<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in day two - We even ran into Kiss me Kate and Barefeet Ankh <br/>
(who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wasn't barefoot at all I might add!) - fellow Illinoians <br/>
trying <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;show the Michiganders that we too can scoot around the world <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;record time - but then as the sun was setting and the bugs <br/>
were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;again feasting on our sweaty stinkin' flesh ...it happened <br/>
&gt; &gt; again! A<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;second box proved to be our undoing..this time the clues just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;evaporated...there was much swearing...and swating!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;With tears in our eyes, scratches on our legs and fists <br/>
shaking <br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the sky we headed "back home again to Indiana"...We stumbled <br/>
into<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Tiptoe's parents cottage bewitched and bewildered just as the <br/>
&gt; last<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;vestiges of light for the day gave up it's last spark. Her <br/>
&gt; &gt; parents<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;scolded that there must be therapy available for this horrid <br/>
&gt; &gt; hobby.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Thankfully it was a holiday, and the Indy 500 was still <br/>
filling <br/>
&gt; &gt; much<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of the conversation, or else we are certain a <br/>
&gt; &gt; family "intervention"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;may have been called to convience us that we just have to <br/>
give up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;this maddening addiction...at a weak moment Tiptoe promised to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;quit....Again, a good night sleep, (and getting out of hostile<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;territory) led us to clearer thinking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;We have returned home and read all the exciting posts <br/>
regarding <br/>
&gt; &gt; next<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;weekend's gathering...Letterboxing smiles are beginning to <br/>
&gt; return <br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;our faces...But, if you are missing a few hot dogs and brats, <br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that an intervention is going on somewhere in either Indiana <br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Illinois!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Tiptoe &amp; Tonto...stuck someplace around the world!<br/>
