                    <div class="plaintext-content">So today I decided to check on an old box of Goose Chaser.

<br>
My heart sank, the row of bushes the box was hidden in was no more.<br>
<br>
I went inside and there was a worker in the small office. I went up to her and told her, "I see you have a new generator. There used to be a row of bushes, and under one of  the bushes was a camouflage box. It doesn't happen to be in the office here."<br>
<br>
"No," she said, "but the guy out there does."<br>
<br>
She led me outside to another worker and told him to tell me about the box.<br>
<br>
He started to lead me around back of the building and to another bush altogether. He bent over and started to dig around in the leaves and pulled the box out.<br>
<br>
I thanked him and started to open the box, all the while telling him of Goose Chaser and how the box had been there for nearly 5 years. He told me that they actually threw the box away in the trash can and he went and dug around through the garbage, pulled it out and re-hid it under another bush.<br>
<br>
I shook his hand, again thanking him for his time & care in retrival of the box and re-placing it. So, it remains for all to find and enjoy.<br>

So today I decided to check on an old box of Goose Chaser. It's been<br>
more than a year since I last checked on this box and was horrified as I<br>
rounded the back of the rest area building and found a new generator<br>
sitting on a large (4' x 6')cement pad.<br>
<br>
My heart sank, the row of bushes the box was hidden in was no more.<br>
<br>
I went inside and there was a worker in the small office. I went up to<br>
her and told her, "I see you have a new generator. There used to be a<br>
row of bushes, and under one of the bushes was a camouflage box. It<br>
doesn't happen to be in the office here."<br>
<br>
"No," she said, "but the guy out there does."<br>
<br>
She led me outside to another worker and told him to tell me about the<br>
box.<br>
<br>
He started to lead me around back of the building and to another bush<br>
altogether. He bent over and started to dig around in the leaves and<br>
pulled the box out.<br>
<br>
I thanked him and started to open the box, all the while telling him of<br>
Goose Chaser and how the box had been there for nearly 5 years. He told<br>
me that they actually threw the box away in the trash can and he went<br>
and dug around through the garbage, pulled it out and re-hid it under<br>
