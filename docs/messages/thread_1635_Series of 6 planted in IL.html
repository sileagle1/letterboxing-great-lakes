                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey everyone.  I just wanted to post that we have finally planted our <br>
Adult Swim series of letterboxes.  All six boxes are in Romeoville <br>
(Will County) and we've even included a bonus PLB related to the <br>
series.  There is a "secret phrase" in each logbook and once you email <br>
us all six phrases we will mail off the PLB to ya.  All of the boxes <br>
are fairly easy to find but I would definitely bring some mosquito <br>
repellant.  We really got bit up today while planting the boxes.  Good <br>
luck and please let us know how our boxes are doing :)<br>
