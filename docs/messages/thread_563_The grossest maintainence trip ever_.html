                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got back from a quick checkup on my boxes.  Thought I'd start at <br/>
Kensington, since there are three there and it was the farthest <br/>
away.  It also ended up being the single most disgusting trip I've <br/>
ever taken.<br/>
<br/>
Went to check on "Freebird" first, which was located by an area where <br/>
some Detroit Edison guys were doing tree trimming (why I have no <br/>
idea, since there are no lines anywhere to be seen).  Got to see the <br/>
one guy in the cherry picker picking his nose, then spitting on the <br/>
ground far below.  Nice.<br/>
<br/>
At the box itself, I ended up with a slug on my hands that I didn't <br/>
know was there, and only discovered it after I'd smushed it.  Slug <br/>
slime and blood.  Nice.<br/>
<br/>
On to "GOTCHA"! Which hadn't been hidden well, and was consequently <br/>
ten feet away, in plain sight, with animal teeth marks all over it.  <br/>
The same animal (I think) liked the box so much it peed all over it, <br/>
marking it as its own.  Nice.<br/>
<br/>
At least the plastic bags held up.  So now, here I am, slug guts and <br/>
animal pee on my hands, getting a bit grumpy.  But then, what do I <br/>
see in the trees but a small gorup of Cedar Waxwings- so pretty!  The <br/>
baby and I stop to observe them for a little while.  Then one of them <br/>
pooped on the baby's leg.  Nice.  <br/>
<br/>
I no longer find waxwings so agreeable, but the baby didn't seem to <br/>
mind.  She's two, what does she know?  At this point, I realize I <br/>
have no baby wipes and now have to cut the check up trip short, if <br/>
only to throw the baby in the tub when we get home.  However, always <br/>
the model toddler, she gave herself her own bath in one of the oilier <br/>
puddles back at the parking lot.  Nice.<br/>
<br/>
So at least it's good to know the three Kensington boxes are still in <br/>
place.  <br/>
Cheers,<br/>
