                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi I'm Flotilla the Hun and I live in Brighton and work in Ypsilanti, <br/>
Michigan.  I've been boxing since July 2005.  I read about <br/>
Letterboxing in Time magazine in June of '05  right after I returned <br/>
from a trip to Connecticut, where I went to visit my nephew.  My <br/>
nephew took me to Rockyneck State Park during my visit and sure enough <br/>
the article in Time refered to that park!  Unfortunately, I wasn't <br/>
aware of letterboxing at the time we visited the park and I probably <br/>
stepped on the box that was planted there (no I didn't count it as a <br/>
find!) but once I tried boxing I was hooked!  I have not had a lot of <br/>
spare time this year so my F count has stalled at around 120 or so,  <br/>
but I've also planted a some boxes (had a few go missing GRRRRRHHHH!) <br/>
replaced a couple.  I like both aspects of the hobby, but I like <br/>
finding the best (no maintenance).  I've turned a few new boxers on to <br/>
the hobby but mostly I box alone.  I love the secrecy of it!  My trail <br/>
name comes from years ago, as a young man on canoe trips and rafting <br/>
voyages down many of Michigan's fine waterways I "ocassionally" tipped <br/>
a few fellow canoeists and rafters - hence my reputation!  LOL.<br/>
<br/>
well, thats about all - BOX ON!<br/>
<br/>
FTH    <br/>
