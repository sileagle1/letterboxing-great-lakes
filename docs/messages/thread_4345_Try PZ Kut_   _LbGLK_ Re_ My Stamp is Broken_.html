You'll find it.  It's firm, even, and smooth as butter.  Best of all, it doesn't chip, flake, or crack off when attempting to carve the most intricate of details.  PZ Kut changed my life!  I recommend this best kept secret to everyone.  Type it, you'll like it.  It's worth the effort to order it and wait for it to arrive.  Which reminds me...I'm down to my last slab and I need to order more.  <br>

  Oh, but that stuff is my favorite, lol!!! See how everyone is so <br>
  different?<br>
<br>
  I like the Speedball SpeedyCut pink stuff you mention (if that's the <br>
  same stuff; sounds like it.) I used to prefer the white thick block <br>
  MasterCarve, but use the pink stuff exclusively now. I've found it <br>
  holds up real well and carves smoothly too. The white was just a <br>
  little bit too soft.<br>
<br>
  I do back it with a wood block... but not til I'm done with the <br>
  carving. Maybe putting your backing on first... before you carve... <br>
  will help it to feel more firm and hold up better for you while you <br>
  carve.<br>
