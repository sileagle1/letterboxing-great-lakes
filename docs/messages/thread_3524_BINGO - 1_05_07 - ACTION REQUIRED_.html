<br/>
Remember how your BINGO card started without the free space?  So <br/>
today, instead of me calling a word, you get to choose any one word <br/>
to make your free space and thus eliminate it from your Bingo card!<br/>
<br/>
HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART -- you must e-mail me to let me know what <br/>
word you are choosing to eliminate.  In order to be fair, all <br/>
players must choose the word they are eliminating before we move <br/>
forward with the game.  To give everyone time to get in touch with <br/>
me, there will be no new words called on Saturday or Sunday this <br/>
week -- the next new word will be Monday morning.  You have until <br/>
midnight on Sunday night (1/7/07) to e-mail me with the word you are <br/>
eliminating.  Send your e-mail to me at letterbox@comcast.net and <br/>
please include your trailname to help me in matching up with the <br/>
correct card.<br/>
<br/>
If I do not receive an e-mail from you by midnight on Sunday, the <br/>
center space on your card will automatically become your free space<br/>
(*), just like on a traditional BINGO card. <br/>
<br/>
Due to the position of the words already called, there is no <br/>
possibility that this free space could give anyone a win in any of <br/>
the interim games, but you can definitely use it to your advantage <br/>
in conjunction with previously called words, if you have had any of <br/>
those on your card.<br/>
<br/>
So yes, Gooble Gobble, you actually do get to pick one word off your <br/>
card to scratch through ;-)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
(*) In the event that I do not hear from you and the middle space on <br/>
your card is a word that has already been called, then your free <br/>
space would be the one directly above the center space, etc.<br/>
