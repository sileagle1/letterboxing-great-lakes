Lafayette area, as I know i'm not going to get to it<br>
next weekend because it's homecoming. I get to one of<br>
those cruddy towns on SR 43 (I say cruddy because I<br>
used to get pulled over there a lot in the middle of<br>
the night on my way back to school) for a box, find<br>
the box..and yay i'm the first finder. So, I get out<br>
my stuff...and my sig stamp is nowhere to be found.<br>
*insert primal scream here*. I call my mom, Ugler, and<br>
ask...do you have my stamp in your bag? She<br>
looks...nothing. So now i'm thinking, where is that<br>
stamp? It's in Plainfield of course, the last freakin'<br>
box we got *last* Sunday. GRR. I certainly do NOT want<br>
to go back to Plainfield to get that stamp....so I<br>
guess i'll be making a new one. If anyone finds the<br>
old one, let me know...as not only did I lose my<br>
compass on that trip, but apparently my sig stamp as<br>
well. <br>
<br>
As far as the TOTW goes, I am trying a variety of<br>
boxes for my plants to see how they hold up. I have 6<br>
of those blue seal Rubbermaids out there, 4 of those<br>
Gladwear el-cheapo things (which are mostly close to<br>
home), 3 little standard Rubbermaid thingys, and one<br>
plant that I haven't done yet with the Lock & Lock. I<br>
don't have a size preference although I'm trying to<br>
get the boxes as small as possible for the stuff<br>
contained within. I'm hesitant about this Lock & Lock<br>
because it is so freakin' big compared to my other<br>
plants. Then again, the stamp is honkin' big too....<br>

OHHHHH ........dear!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Did you lose it near Our Indiana Letterbox?  It's kinda far and I have that stamp already, <br>
but if no one steps up, I would be willing find that prodigal armadillo.  Got to love and <br>
protect the little one!  Maybe Retiredhavinfun can send some family members to check for <br>
you!  Let me know!<br>

Letterbox. I'm not going to worry too much about it,<br>
because i've already carved a replacement...it's not<br>
as sentimentally cool as the first one...but it'll do!<br>
That box is a little bit of a hike, so I don't want<br>
anyone making any special trips. But if it's on<br>
anyone's list of boxes to get...have a look around,<br>
eh? <br>
<br>
--Armadillo Jo, who just drew some lame looking<br>
armadillos in the boxes she found today. Of all days<br>
to leave the carving stuff at home...and of course<br>
Hobby Lobby is not open on Sunday....<br>
