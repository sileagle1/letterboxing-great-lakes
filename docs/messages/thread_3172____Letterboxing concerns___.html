<br/>
If you would please take a moment to ponder my words it would be <br/>
most appreciated.  During the summer, in the span of 3 weeks I lost <br/>
5 boxes...this was a hard hit  Two were lost due to animal <br/>
interventions and three it appears from human neglect.  Since I have <br/>
invaded the animals rightful territory I can not be dismayed at <br/>
their natural behavior, however, I have become saddened by the <br/>
actions of my fellow boxers.<br/>
<br/>
I replaced all the boxes, and within 2 weeks I found one of my boxes <br/>
totally exposed when I went to check on it, and another kind hearted <br/>
boxer alerted me to the fact that another one of my boxes was just <br/>
left sitting out in the open.<br/>
<br/>
When I have been out boxing I have also found boxes that are not <br/>
well re-hidden, the boxes are not snapped shut, they have zip lock <br/>
bags that are not sealed shut, or have log books that have been <br/>
filled up because one family has each child fill an entire page <br/>
leaving the book with no where to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
I am here simply as a reminder that we all must be considerate to <br/>
the placers.  I know the exhileration of finding a box and wanting <br/>
to move on to the next one before it gets dark, but we are ruining <br/>
the trip for those who come behind us if we are not careful.<br/>
<br/>
For those with families:  if you are letting your kids put the box <br/>
back when all are stamped in, then please double check that they <br/>
have done it correctly, and exactly as the placer had it hidden. I <br/>
box with my grandson and I always check before we leave a site.<br/>
<br/>
Also, please consider having all members of one family stamp on one <br/>
page. It is wonderful to have so many new, excited boxers and young <br/>
families joining us, but that means the pages fill up more quickly, <br/>
and when trying to get a logbook into a small container there is a <br/>
limit to how many pages will fit. It is not always easy to get out <br/>
and change out a log book for the placers. Consider having each <br/>
member stamp only a part of their stamp, or write their names on one <br/>
page. I was recently at a box where the logbook was filled up <br/>
because one family used up 5-6 pages and there were no pages left in <br/>
which I could sign.  Please look ahead and see how close to full the <br/>
logbook is before filling all the pages.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great hobby when everyone does their part...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We can't believe P. Granola beat us to the punch...probably a good <br/>
thing...we weren't as gracious.  I wrote a letter to the boxing <br/>
world at large on Friday evening after finding the last 13 of 15 <br/>
boxes we've found exposed and badly re-hidden, also with many pages <br/>
scribbled on...the last entries in all of them were unfortunately <br/>
children.  I canceled my letter thinking it was a bit harsh and <br/>
afraid we would come across as "family haters" - which we clearly <br/>
are not.<br/>
I think the exposure brought on by national magazines (like the <br/>
recent Family Fun article) has brought many new boxers with small <br/>
children quickly into the hobby without really explaining the <br/>
importance of stealth, care for the environment, and respect for the <br/>
boxes to be left better than when first found.<br/>
<br/>
In all of the cases mentioned above we also found very worn, torn <br/>
and trampled vegetation surrounding the boxes hiding places. It is <br/>
no wonder that park rangers are becoming more and more annoyed with <br/>
our hobby and want to control our activity.<br/>
<br/>
We have boxed with children and it is agreed this is a super family <br/>
affair, but we also have experienced that our very own nieces and <br/>
nephews in their enthusiasm tear into the plant life like opening a <br/>
present at Christmas.  Once they have stamped in they are rearin' to <br/>
get onto the next stop and the last thing they care about is <br/>
rehiding it better than they found it. We have had to stiffle their <br/>
enthusiasm more than once and always insist on either replanting the <br/>
box ourselves or double checking their job.  <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing gives parents an excellent venue to teach about good <br/>
stewardship regarding the environment, as well as, the gift that <br/>
someone gave in hiding a box to find.  It is an opportunity to teach <br/>
that being alert and quiet will potentially reward the child to hear <br/>
sounds and see wildlife that are only possible when watching and <br/>
listening. Far too often we have watched as children are allowed to <br/>
run off trail beating anything in their way with sticks and tearing <br/>
up plant life all to the chuckle of the parents thinking it a fine <br/>
opportunity for their children to be...just children.  Not to sound <br/>
too teachery...it comes naturally to us I'm afraid, but parents <br/>
please make sure you teach your children to letterbox <br/>
responsibly...and still have a great time in the woods!<br/>
<br/>
Another issue that came our way that took us back a bit was an email <br/>
that came via "contact the placer" questioning the availability of <br/>
one of our boxes.  They informed us that they wanted to take a group <br/>
of 20 to look for it next week and was it still active.  Our first <br/>
reaction was...YIKES! Twenty people searching for one box on a small <br/>
property certainly will make sure that everyone for miles will know <br/>
that something is hidden at that spot!  We emailed our concern to <br/>
which they responded they would be careful!  I don't think we've had <br/>
20 people letterboxing in one group at the biggest gatherings!  We <br/>
are concerned that 20 people at once stamping into a box no mtter <br/>
how careful they are is going to compromise the area and the box.<br/>
Having some letterboxing nightmares...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I totally agree with everyone else P. Granola!!  For the past 2 months I <br/>
have been trying to figure out a way to gracefully say what you have <br/>
said and brought up some really valid points that I wouldn't have even <br/>
thought to include like not sharing pages within a family.  I also think <br/>
that folks can always "scoootch" their signature stamp over many times <br/>
to let others share the page even if it takes another month for that <br/>
next person to stamp in.  Sometimes you can even go back and find a <br/>
large enough spot on a previous page to stamp in if the log book is <br/>
becoming full.  I cannot recall if I mentioned this here before, but <br/>
lately we have had some folks (with the best intentions) "propping <br/>
letterboxes up" uncovered so that it was easier for the next person <br/>
(letterboxer or not) to see with almost no effort. <br/>
<br/>
Just as you have mentioned, another kind letterboxing soul came after <br/>
these good-intentioned letterboxers and rehid what they saw.  My hunting <br/>
has really showed down significantly because I have had to recently <br/>
replace so many of my boxes as well...and/or the (nicer and super full) <br/>
logs were ruined because the pouch was propped UP and OPEN.  I was sick <br/>
over a couple of these.  I have lost 12 boxes in the past 2 months--give <br/>
or take a few.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to add the obvious---that we are not talking about the <br/>
things that WILL happen due to nature and animals etc.  Oprah says, <br/>
"People do better when they know better" and I know I have learned from <br/>
others sharing info like this too!  :) <br/>

Thanks PG for starting this off!  :)<br/>

Something I've recently thought to do, which I haven't in the past done,<br/>
is include this group address in the letterbox.  Maybe we can slow down<br/>
the destruction as the hobby continues to grow in our respective areas.  I<br/>
think we've had some new members join this group after the latest round of<br/>
publicity.<br/>

Oh, and Hi!  New here...invited to join by your own Wisconsin Hiker<br/>
after we met as the "folks coming from furthest away" at the DE Games. <br/>
Boxing seems to be less active in the midwest (and almost non-existant<br/>
here in St. Louis) so, looking for a little community, here I am!  Nice<br/>
to "meet" you!<br/>

&gt; boxes we've found exposed and badly re-hidden, also with many pages <br/>
&gt; scribbled on...the last entries in all of them were unfortunately <br/>
&gt; children.  I canceled my letter thinking it was a bit harsh and <br/>
&gt; afraid we would come across as "family haters" - which we clearly <br/>
&gt; are not.<br/>
&gt; I think the exposure brought on by national magazines (like the <br/>
&gt; recent Family Fun article) has brought many new boxers with small <br/>
&gt; children quickly into the hobby without really explaining the <br/>
&gt; importance of stealth, care for the environment, and respect for the <br/>
&gt; boxes to be left better than when first found.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In all of the cases mentioned above we also found very worn, torn <br/>
&gt; and trampled vegetation surrounding the boxes hiding places. It is <br/>
&gt; no wonder that park rangers are becoming more and more annoyed with <br/>
&gt; our hobby and want to control our activity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have boxed with children and it is agreed this is a super family <br/>
&gt; affair, but we also have experienced that our very own nieces and <br/>
&gt; nephews in their enthusiasm tear into the plant life like opening a <br/>
&gt; present at Christmas.  Once they have stamped in they are rearin' to <br/>
&gt; get onto the next stop and the last thing they care about is <br/>
&gt; rehiding it better than they found it. We have had to stiffle their <br/>
&gt; enthusiasm more than once and always insist on either replanting the <br/>
&gt; box ourselves or double checking their job.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing gives parents an excellent venue to teach about good <br/>
&gt; stewardship regarding the environment, as well as, the gift that <br/>
&gt; someone gave in hiding a box to find.  It is an opportunity to teach <br/>
&gt; that being alert and quiet will potentially reward the child to hear <br/>
&gt; sounds and see wildlife that are only possible when watching and <br/>
&gt; listening. Far too often we have watched as children are allowed to <br/>
&gt; run off trail beating anything in their way with sticks and tearing <br/>
&gt; up plant life all to the chuckle of the parents thinking it a fine <br/>
&gt; opportunity for their children to be...just children.  Not to sound <br/>
&gt; too teachery...it comes naturally to us I'm afraid, but parents <br/>
&gt; please make sure you teach your children to letterbox <br/>
&gt; responsibly...and still have a great time in the woods!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another issue that came our way that took us back a bit was an email <br/>
&gt; that came via "contact the placer" questioning the availability of <br/>
&gt; one of our boxes.  They informed us that they wanted to take a group <br/>
&gt; of 20 to look for it next week and was it still active.  Our first <br/>
&gt; reaction was...YIKES! Twenty people searching for one box on a small <br/>
&gt; property certainly will make sure that everyone for miles will know <br/>
&gt; that something is hidden at that spot!  We emailed our concern to <br/>
&gt; which they responded they would be careful!  I don't think we've had <br/>
&gt; 20 people letterboxing in one group at the biggest gatherings!  We <br/>
&gt; are concerned that 20 people at once stamping into a box no mtter <br/>
&gt; how careful they are is going to compromise the area and the box.<br/>
&gt; Having some letterboxing nightmares...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello to all, newcomers and old timers alike!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you would please take a moment to ponder my words it would be <br/>
&gt; &gt; most appreciated.  During the summer, in the span of 3 weeks I <br/>
&gt; lost <br/>
&gt; &gt; 5 boxes...this was a hard hit  Two were lost due to animal <br/>
&gt; &gt; interventions and three it appears from human neglect.  Since I <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; invaded the animals rightful territory I can not be dismayed at <br/>
&gt; &gt; their natural behavior, however, I have become saddened by the <br/>
&gt; &gt; actions of my fellow boxers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I replaced all the boxes, and within 2 weeks I found one of my <br/>
&gt; boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; totally exposed when I went to check on it, and another kind <br/>
&gt; hearted <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxer alerted me to the fact that another one of my boxes was just <br/>
&gt; &gt; left sitting out in the open.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When I have been out boxing I have also found boxes that are not <br/>
&gt; &gt; well re-hidden, the boxes are not snapped shut, they have zip lock <br/>
&gt; &gt; bags that are not sealed shut, or have log books that have been <br/>
&gt; &gt; filled up because one family has each child fill an entire page <br/>
&gt; &gt; leaving the book with no where to stamp in.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am here simply as a reminder that we all must be considerate to <br/>
&gt; &gt; the placers.  I know the exhileration of finding a box and wanting <br/>
&gt; &gt; to move on to the next one before it gets dark, but we are ruining <br/>
&gt; &gt; the trip for those who come behind us if we are not careful.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; For those with families:  if you are letting your kids put the box <br/>
&gt; &gt; back when all are stamped in, then please double check that they <br/>
&gt; &gt; have done it correctly, and exactly as the placer had it hidden. I <br/>
&gt; &gt; box with my grandson and I always check before we leave a site.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, please consider having all members of one family stamp on <br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; &gt; page. It is wonderful to have so many new, excited boxers and <br/>
&gt; young <br/>
&gt; &gt; families joining us, but that means the pages fill up more <br/>
&gt; quickly, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and when trying to get a logbook into a small container there is a <br/>
&gt; &gt; limit to how many pages will fit. It is not always easy to get out <br/>
&gt; &gt; and change out a log book for the placers. Consider having each <br/>
&gt; &gt; member stamp only a part of their stamp, or write their names on <br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; &gt; page. I was recently at a box where the logbook was filled up <br/>
&gt; &gt; because one family used up 5-6 pages and there were no pages left <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; which I could sign.  Please look ahead and see how close to full <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; logbook is before filling all the pages.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is a great hobby when everyone does their part...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for your time and please think about my words before you <br/>
&gt; send <br/>
&gt; &gt; me hate mail!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Trailtracker, I feel your pain.  After our last visit to Hocking <br/>
Hills by Sunday morning I was fuming.  We found one of your boxes and <br/>
the people before us had logged in "This is our first find".  <br/>
Although I was happy for them, my comment out loud was maybe you <br/>
shouldn't announce that you're a newbie (which we knew before we got <br/>
to the log by the way the box was re-hid).  After that every <br/>
improperly closed, poorly hid box had been visited by these same <br/>
folks.  I was ready to fire out a scathing scolding email to them.  <br/>
It made me angry since I truly appreciate how much time and effort <br/>
you have in your stamps and boxes.  My more level headed better half <br/>
said let it go.  Lets just try to find as many as we can and correct <br/>
whats been done wrong.  I have also recently been getting inquiries <br/>
asking if my boxes are still there.  Stating that they don't want to <br/>
waste their time looking for them if they're missing.  It seems that <br/>
this is a new breed of sit behind your monitor boxer instead of <br/>
getting out there and looking.  What crossed my mind was what makes <br/>
their time more valuable then mine.  If every boxer who decided to <br/>
hunt my box or any other placers box emailed the placer expecting an <br/>
answer, all a placer would do is answer email. So as of late, I've <br/>
been answering......but not to the status of the box, but to the <br/>
spirit of letterboxing.  I've also tried very hard to be diplomatic <br/>
and kind since I don't want to be know as The Cattie Boxer instead of <br/>
The Cats Meow........ which also leads me to my final beef I'll get <br/>
off my chest.  It's recently come to my attention that there are <br/>
boxers in Florida going by The Cat's Meow.  The put the apostrophe <br/>
before the s obviously feeling this was enough of a distinction in <br/>
the name.  But as far as I'm concerned it wasn't and I was a little <br/>
put out that someone, when realizing there was another group of <br/>
boxers with that name, wouldn't take the time to come up with someone <br/>
more original.  So if you all begin to get email from The ORIGINAL <br/>
Cats Meow, you'll know its become a problem.  Big breath........ okay <br/>
if feel better now! Thanks everyone.   <br/>

that master key I made for the entire Hocking Hills area, I did include <br/>
some comments basically letting folks know that most of us do not get <br/>

asking for trouble.  I know the last thing I ever want is for a box to <br/>
go missing after I have just been there.  I have also tried to look to <br/>
see if the finder is also a placer and therefore contact them via AQ <br/>
etc., but most often they have not placed a box themselves.  I also <br/>
found out that one of the best carvers EVER has had every single box now <br/>
go missing in at least 3 states where he has placed boxes.  I'm sick.  <br/>
It is mr. bloodhound who is only listed on LbNA and some of his stamps <br/>

Recently, I lost 2 letterboxes too.  But I placed them before the Family Fun Magazine article appeared.  So I tend to think that there is always some degree of risk involved in placing a box.  But I cringe when I read about all the permanent boxes that have dissapeared within the last couple months. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Oprah - 'People do better when they know better."  So ,when the Girl Scout National Office posted a new badge for older girls called Hi Tech Hide and Seek on their Studio 2B web site,  I thought it was a good idea to begin teaching letterboxing workshops for GS adults and older girls.  By teaching them the right way, I thought that would insure that boxes would not be damaged or missing.  And, I have meet some great new friends who have become letterboxing addicts (like the rest of us.)  Now, they place boxes and some of them have an F count greater than mine in only a short time.   <br/>
<br/>
However, after this weekend, I've got a whole new opinion on this subject.  I hide a set of 4 boxes with hand carved stamps at a Girl Scout campout gathering on Friday.  After specific verbal and posted written instructions,  only a few troops went searching for the boxes.  On Sunday morning, I went to collect these temporarily placed boxes.  Two were gone!!!  A third box was not put back properly; it was just left on the ground a few feet away from the original hiding plae.  The fourth one was put back properly too.  But the two of the four boxes I found were a mess inside.  The inky stamps were not wrapped in the paper I provided nor were the baggies sealed not were the boxes closed tightly.  The log book was an inky mess.  People stamped over other previous stamps.  But they did listen when I told them to make room and conserve the pages in the logbook by stamping several people on one page and to use the back side of the sheets of paper.  <br/>
<br/>
Young children just don't get it and neither do some adults. <br/>
<br/>
My thoughts are mixed tonight.  However, I may no longer be conducting letterboxing workshops in the future.  <br/>

I hadn't had a chance to go find your Long Grove boxes yet and was going to<br/>
head out this morning because I want to check on the two I have of Pippi's<br/>
up there in Long Grove plus I need to mosey on over to Geimer's Nursery<br/>
right outside Long Grove, then on my way home down Rte 53/355, I can mosey<br/>
into Animal Feeds &amp; Needs in Arlington Heights.  In other words, I've got a<br/>
great morning planned!<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find your boxes on LbNA anymore but I still have the clues on my<br/>
'pooter, so I figured I'd just go take a look-see anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Just a note about using the back side of the sheets of paper tho for<br/>
stamping.  I'm one placer who would prefer folks *not* do that.   Too much<br/>
likelihood of ink bleed-thru.  Plus when the box is totally finished and<br/>
ready to be retired, if the logbook(s) have survived, I'd like to be able to<br/>
scrapbook the logbook pages.  Much easier if there's stamping on only one<br/>
side of each page, unless the logbook has gotten full and the only option is<br/>
the backsides of pages.   But I might definitely be in the minority as far<br/>
as placers go.  I have no idea how other placers feel about it.  There may<br/>
be very few letterboxers who are also into letterbox scrapbooking.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.:  Don't go looking for the "Black Cat" box in DuPage County unless<br/>
you're either not faint-of-heart or you're not the inquisitive sort if you<br/>
*are* faint-of-heart.  I'd never really been a fan of Edgar Allen Poe.  Just<br/>
too strange a guy for me.  And we always had to read his work in high<br/>
school.  I guess high school was just too young an age for me to appreciate<br/>
Poe.  As an adult, tho, I've become a fan of some of the horror literature<br/>
and flicks that are out there.  But because of my earlier distaste of Poe in<br/>
high school, I'd never gone back to any of his writings.  I wasn't a fan of<br/>
19th century American lit in high school in general.  That taste developed<br/>
much later.<br/>
<br/>
OK, so after finding the box, I had to find out more about the story.  I hit<br/>
the internet.  Read the total story.  Reread the total story.  Ended up<br/>
reading as much critique of it as I could.  Then I ended up feeling the need<br/>
to delve into Poe's life.  And some of his biographers had biographers of<br/>
their own.  Then because of what recently happened at his gravesite, I felt<br/>
the need to try to delve into Poe's thoughts on politics.<br/>
<br/>
So what started out as one page in my scrapbook about a letterbox has so far<br/>
turned into 6 pages on Edgar Allen Poe.  Just in time for Halloween.  :-)<br/>

<br/>
Greetings tonight from Beetle<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I lost 2 letterboxes too.  But I placed them before the Family Fun<br/>
Magazine article appeared.  So I tend to think that there is always some<br/>
degree of risk involved in placing a box.  But I cringe when I read about<br/>
all the permanent boxes that have dissapeared within the last couple months.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Oprah - 'People do better when they know better."  So ,when the<br/>
Girl Scout National Office posted a new badge for older girls called Hi Tech<br/>
Hide and Seek on their Studio 2B web site,  I thought it was a good idea to<br/>
begin teaching letterboxing workshops for GS adults and older girls.  By<br/>
teaching them the right way, I thought that would insure that boxes would<br/>
not be damaged or missing.  And, I have meet some great new friends who have<br/>
become letterboxing addicts (like the rest of us.)  Now, they place boxes<br/>
and some of them have an F count greater than mine in only a short time.<br/>
<br/>
However, after this weekend, I've got a whole new opinion on this subject.<br/>
I hide a set of 4 boxes with hand carved stamps at a Girl Scout campout<br/>
gathering on Friday.  After specific verbal and posted written instructions,<br/>
only a few troops went searching for the boxes.  On Sunday morning, I went<br/>
to collect these temporarily placed boxes.  Two were gone!!!  A third box<br/>
was not put back properly; it was just left on the ground a few feet away<br/>
from the original hiding plae.  The fourth one was put back properly too.<br/>
But the two of the four boxes I found were a mess inside.  The inky stamps<br/>
were not wrapped in the paper I provided nor were the baggies sealed not<br/>
were the boxes closed tightly.  The log book was an inky mess.  People<br/>
stamped over other previous stamps.  But they did listen when I told them to<br/>
make room and conserve the pages in the logbook by stamping several people<br/>
on one page and to use the back side of the sheets of paper.<br/>
<br/>
Young children just don't get it and neither do some adults.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts are mixed tonight.  However, I may no longer be conducting<br/>
letterboxing workshops in the future.<br/>

  I totally agree with everyone else P. Granola!! For the past 2 months I<br/>
  have been trying to figure out a way to gracefully say what you have<br/>
  said and brought up some really valid points that I wouldn't have even<br/>
  thought to include like not sharing pages within a family. I also think<br/>
  that folks can always "scoootch" their signature stamp over many times<br/>
  to let others share the page even if it takes another month for that<br/>
  next person to stamp in. Sometimes you can even go back and find a<br/>
  large enough spot on a previous page to stamp in if the log book is<br/>
  becoming full. I cannot recall if I mentioned this here before, but<br/>
  lately we have had some folks (with the best intentions) "propping<br/>
  letterboxes up" uncovered so that it was easier for the next person<br/>
  (letterboxer or not) to see with almost no effort.<br/>
<br/>
  Just as you have mentioned, another kind letterboxing soul came after<br/>
  these good-intentioned letterboxers and rehid what they saw. My hunting<br/>
  has really showed down significantly because I have had to recently<br/>
  replace so many of my boxes as well...and/or the (nicer and super full)<br/>
  logs were ruined because the pouch was propped UP and OPEN. I was sick<br/>
  over a couple of these. I have lost 12 boxes in the past 2 months--give<br/>
  or take a few.<br/>
<br/>
  I also want to add the obvious---that we are not talking about the<br/>
  things that WILL happen due to nature and animals etc. Oprah says,<br/>
  "People do better when they know better" and I know I have learned from<br/>
  others sharing info like this too! :)<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks PG for starting this off! :)<br/>

And LbGLK letterboxers too<br/>
<br/>
After I lost 2 of 4 temporarily placed letterboxes at a private gathering this weekend, I feel your pain.  I was able to recover only 2 of the 4  boxes which were not replaced properly and the contents were ... let's just say " A MESS!"  I understand your feelings about not wanting to replacing your missing boxes.  I found some of your missing boxes and they are truly a loss.    History Tower was one of my favorite boxes!  It required the utmost of sneakiness to retrieve and replace that box.  That was the challenge.  But some seekers don't understand that.  They only care about finding the box themselves. They are not careful about finding or hiding a box.   And I don't think they would ever think to carry repair parts and replace torn baggies as a way of preserving the box for others.  <br/>
<br/>
Once, you shared with me some excellent advice.  Serious letterboxers need to make the clues a bit more difficult and include at least one compass bearing to steer kids and others away from easy finds.   If finding a letterbox requires a hike or some brain work, most casual letterboxers will skip that box and look for a simpler one.  <br/>
<br/>
This weekend after I conducted a letterboxing workshop, I asked an adult if their group had gone to find the 4 letterboxes I placed.  The boxes were not far apart and didn't require too much walking.  But her reply was: "If we can't drive to the location, the girls aren't going to hike to find it."  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the reason we are having so many problems with our boxes disappearing is that we are making them too easy for non-letterboxers to find.  Many of my first boxes were easy to find or drive bys. But the boxes I have truly enjoyed finding lead me on a relatively long hike to a beautiful location.  The more I hike, the more I enjoy the hiking element of letterboxing.  I am no longer a couch potato.  <br/>
<br/>
Let's challenge ourselves to place boxes with more emphasis on the original focus of letterboxing.  Then, magazines could run front page feature photos and articles on  letterboxing and our boxes would remain relatively safe if they required 'work' to find them.  <br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts today.....<br/>

I have taken my family letterboxing twice, and fortunately, both have been <br/>
to places that didn't have many people around.  That was nice, so I didn't <br/>
have to worry about the kids giving the location away to others.  Also, the <br/>
few that we found, were hidden inside trees, so it was relatively simple for <br/>
my 15 year old son to re-hide.  The one thing I know we need to be more <br/>
careful about is trampling the vegetation.  It wasn't terrible, but could <br/>
have been better.  As for the newbies wanting to find recently hidden boxes, <br/>
that was a suggestion in the magazine article.<br/>

The Family Fun article only makes reference to letterboxing.org.  <br/>
<br/>
I have toyed with the idea of making clues unavailable--at least <br/>
until the weather gets colder. Perhaps these folks with poor finding <br/>
habits won't be inclined to continue boxing in the winter and will <br/>
have forgotten all about this hobby come next spring.  But then the <br/>
other side of me remembers what it was like to be new and excited <br/>
about finding clues--of course, we researched boxing before we <br/>
started out so we knew letterboxing etiquette for the most part <br/>
(although we did our share of filling up logbooks before we switched <br/>
from 4 individual stamps to a family stamp).  <br/>

it, and the poor rehiding job was actually started by an earlier <br/>

<br/>
Maybe, we just need to be more explicit in our clues about how the <br/>

I have been following this thread with great interest and have to say<br/>
that I agree with your thoughts about making the clues a little more<br/>
difficult. It does not bother us in the least to have a hike or clues<br/>
that I might have to actually think about and we have a 5 &amp; 8 yr old<br/>
that go with us.  Nice hikes do not bother us at all.  And I have<br/>
another friend that I brought into LB'ing and her children are in the<br/>
same age ranges with a third that is younger than ours.  They go on the<br/>
long hikes too.  I have to say, my 8 yr old may be better at rehiding<br/>
than some adults we have come behind.  She is extremely concienteous<br/>
about making sure that the box is covered from all angles - that and she<br/>
can get into/closer to some of those spots, thus making it easier for<br/>
her to rehide it.  It simply takes training of the children (as all<br/>
things in child-rearing, LOL!) and unfortunately too many parents are<br/>
unwilling to do that. My children are trained now in guard duty -<br/>
watching the trai<br/>
l for muggles, LOL!  They are our alerts when we are<br/>
retrieving/stamping/replacing, etc.  I will say, that while we do allow<br/>
the 5yr old to put the box back in its place, we (as parents) take the<br/>
responsibility of makingsure it is recovered and not easily seen.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to reassure all of you that there are parents out<br/>
there that teach their children about the stealth involved in this.  We<br/>
do this as great family entertainment when we can squish it in (I will<br/>
not go out on the trail without my husband with us - thus limiting my<br/>
trail time - WAH!). <br/>

<br/>
&gt; CMoon and Kookaburra<br/>
&gt; And LbGLK letterboxers too<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After I lost 2 of 4 temporarily placed letterboxes at a private <br/>
&gt; gathering this weekend, I feel your pain.  I was able to recover <br/>
&gt; only 2 of the 4  boxes which were not replaced properly and the <br/>
&gt; contents were ... let's just say " A MESS!"  I understand your <br/>
&gt; feelings about not wanting to replacing your missing boxes.  I <br/>
&gt; found some of your missing boxes and they are truly a loss.    <br/>
&gt; History Tower was one of my favorite boxes!  It required the utmost <br/>
&gt; of sneakiness to retrieve and replace that box.  That was the <br/>
&gt; challenge.  But some seekers don't understand that.  They only care <br/>
&gt; about finding the box themselves. They are not careful about <br/>
&gt; finding or hiding a box.   And I don't think they would ever think <br/>
&gt; to carry repair parts and replace torn baggies as a way of <br/>
&gt; preserving the box for others.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once, you shared with me some excellent advice.  Serious <br/>
&gt; letterboxers need to make the clues a bit more difficult and <br/>
&gt; include at least one compass bearing to steer kids and others away <br/>
&gt; from easy finds.   If finding a letterbox requires a hike or some <br/>
&gt; brain work, most casual letterboxers will skip that box and look <br/>
&gt; for a simpler one.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This weekend after I conducted a letterboxing workshop, I asked an <br/>
&gt; adult if their group had gone to find the 4 letterboxes I placed.  <br/>
&gt; The boxes were not far apart and didn't require too much walking.  <br/>
&gt; But her reply was: "If we can't drive to the location, the girls <br/>
&gt; aren't going to hike to find it."  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe the reason we are having so many problems with our boxes <br/>
&gt; disappearing is that we are making them too easy for non-<br/>
&gt; letterboxers to find.  Many of my first boxes were easy to find or <br/>
&gt; drive bys. But the boxes I have truly enjoyed finding lead me on a <br/>
&gt; relatively long hike to a beautiful location.  The more I hike, the <br/>
&gt; more I enjoy the hiking element of letterboxing.  I am no longer a <br/>
&gt; couch potato.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let's challenge ourselves to place boxes with more emphasis on the <br/>
&gt; original focus of letterboxing.  Then, magazines could run front <br/>
&gt; page feature photos and articles on  letterboxing and our boxes <br/>
&gt; would remain relatively safe if they required 'work' to find them.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my thoughts today.....<br/>

Since you held the L.E.A.P. workshop I've been going<br/>
gung-ho.  Virtuals, postals, finding, planting...even<br/>
took my ungrateful kids on one romp.<br/>
<br/>
I can't understand how that last group could be so<br/>
inconsiderate, but keep in mind all of us you've<br/>
infected with the LBbug :)<br/>
<br/>
O.K., maybe the _girls_ aren't ready, but keep those<br/>
workshops coming for us leadertypes! You do such a<br/>
great job!<br/>

225 or 250 finds or so (tho actually I might be closer to 300 now that the<br/>
price of gas has gone down to something a little more affordable) but I also<br/>
have absolutely no interest in recording my finds in any way on anyone's<br/>

your boxes.  But it wouldn't "offend" me if someone handled their boxes that<br/>

I prefer to leave my boxes open to everyone but on a private website where<br/>
so it's a little more of a challenge to find my clues but everyone can find<br/>
them who wants to.  When I make new boxes for next year, I'm going to put<br/>
some of them on LbNA but they'll have more difficult clues and/or longer<br/>
hikes and the easier ones and/or more sensitive ones will be on my website.<br/>
That's what I'm comfortable doing.<br/>

&gt;Wouldn't it be nice if you had<br/>
&gt;to read the tutorials and pass a short quiz before you could get<br/>
&gt;access to the clues on LbNA or AQ. At least then, people would be<br/>
&gt;exposed to the necessary info. Not that it means people would<br/>
&gt;follow those suggestions (as Beetle's post demonstrated).<br/>
<br/>
I'm a relative newbie, but apparently from the discussions here, my <br/>
friend and I are the only newbies who read almost everything on the <br/>
site before we went out hunting.  We have gone out every weekend with <br/>
her 5 year old.  We always hide boxes better than found.  We are very <br/>
discreet,  very respectful of the environment, clean and dry out the <br/>
boxes, replace any bags as needed, etc.  I can't believe people <br/>
wouldn't naturally just do these very things without having to be <br/>
told.  But, from what everyone is saying here, it seems like a lot of <br/>
people are just clueless.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about a "quiz", but I think that having it be mandatory <br/>
to access the "how to's" and "tutorials" pages before retrieving <br/>
clues is a very good idea.  The main screens of the websites could <br/>
have links to the how to's, but not links to the clues.  To get to <br/>
the clue links you'd have to wade through a few pages of info first.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of these pages, there could be a link to get started:  Ok, <br/>
now that you know what boxing is, how to do is safely and <br/>
respectfully, let's get started... find clues here!<br/>
<br/>
Newbies would have to read things before finding the clue links, <br/>
veterans would be able to bookmark the clue pages so they don't have <br/>
to go through the tutorials every time.<br/>

Unfortunately for LbNA, Family Fun only mentions that one site.  LbNA doesn't have a minimum number of finds option, so those clues are open to all.<br/>

  It's the one, where you can require that clues are available only to <br/>

  location was more of a risk, I might consider adding the additional <br/>

<br/>
  What are everyone's thoughts on this because I have considered removing <br/>
  the "child-friendly" icon for some of my boxes or simply removing them <br/>

<br/>
I have not used this option.  I would rather not respond to emails asking<br/>
why I put a restriction on my boxes.  But I have, and will continue to<br/>
make my clues more challenging.  I've been grounded for the foreseeable<br/>
future, so my other preventive measure, really long hikes (2+ hours?) will<br/>
be my next deterrent to high traffic.<br/>
<br/>
It's really tough complaining about missing boxes.  I have been fortunate<br/>
to find many in the past two years in our state (lots of first finders). <br/>
Without new boxers' enthusiasm for planting, I would be done finding boxes<br/>
here.  I want to encourage new boxers to plant quality boxes over the<br/>
quantity of easy finds.  Don't get me wrong, there is a place for easy<br/>
finds, but I am coming to the point of wanting more than a higher F-count.<br/>
 I am very jealous of the marathon hiking WIHiker and Martini Man find the<br/>
time to do, and the beautiful scenery of the trails that SpringChick<br/>
photographs (just to name a couple).<br/>
<br/>
My very best carving, The Rose Gardeners, has not been replanted yet. <br/>
I've been watching the potential site, and I have some thoughts.  Right<br/>
now, it is touring at a gathering.  I hate being so protective of this<br/>
stamp.  I have maintained that my letterboxes no longer belong to me once<br/>
they are in the wild.  At the earliest, I think I'll have it out next<br/>
spring, along with a host of new boxes for our new area.  I may hide my<br/>
clues here.<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am personally am not a fan of the "F" count clue option at AQ as there are many people with significant numbers of finds (and plants) who simply choose not to log their finds online, at AQ or letterboxing.org.  My feeling is that clues posted to a *public* letterboxing web site (AQ and/or letterboxing.org) should be available to anyone who visits that site.  But, AQ is Ryan's site and he can do as he pleases with it.  As there are so few people in my area that even use AQ, I really have not been impacted much by it.<br/>
<br/>
All that being said, I am a proponent of WOM (word-of-mouth) clues.  I know there are a lot of people who feel this is exclusionary, but not all boxes are for all people and if somebody plants a box that they feel is best suited to a particular type of letterboxer or letterboxers who are more seasoned or even more familiar with a particular geographic locale, then distributing clues via WOM and selectively via e-mail is a good way to get them to your target audience.  There are plently of publically available letterboxes that nobody is left without something to look for just because they may not be privy to a WOM clue.  Besides, they are fun and in my mind, one of the most intriguing aspects of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
On another note...  I have read the posts regarding missing boxes with interest and just want to throw out a suggestion.  I hate to point the finger blindly at families and people who letterbox with children because I know there are many people who do so very responsibly.  But having letterboxed with my young grandson, it is certainly much more of a challenge to make sure all the bases are covered... and to remain stealthy in the process.<br/>
<br/>
I still believe that the most common reason that boxes go missing is because of poor placement.  And that is not to say anyone is a bad planter because sometimes you have no idea that a hiding spot is a bad spot when you place a box.  I am reminded of one box I planted out in the middle of a woods inside a hollow log and time after time that thing was found laying out in the open, contents exposed.  Apparently the hollow log that was my *perfect* hiding spot, was home to some sort of critter and he just was not going to let that box rest inside that log.  Sometimes I find boxes that are located in places where it is nearly impossible to properly hide because they weren't hidden very well in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
In general (and of course there are exceptions to every generality), the boxes I have found exposed, carelessly repackaged and otherwise mistreated (both my own boxes and those I have hunted) are those that are relatively easy to find, in terms of distance, clues and hiding spot.  Now I'm sure most everyone knows that I am a huge supporter of longer hikes and more difficult clues and I do realize that is not for everyone... but, I have to say that my boxes that require one to solve puzzles, climb sand dunes and hike 2-3 miles very rarely see this kind of mistreatment.  Likewise, boxes that I have struggled for when finding, in terms of clues or hike, are usually in top condition when I find them.  Perhaps it is because of all the effort it takes to get there, that finders treat the box with more respect, perhaps because of the types of people who are doing these kinds of boxes, perhaps it is just because the volume of visitors is less...  But it does seem to provide a level of security against the more typical letterboxing problems we are seeing lately.<br/>
<br/>
So in general, my feelings about improving the odds for your box to survive:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Make the clues a little more difficult than the standard 1-2-3 follow the directions variety<br/>
2)  Put some distance between the parking lot and your letterbox<br/>
3)  Be really, really picky about the hiding spot<br/>
<br/>
(did I mention that you need to be really picky about the hiding spot?)<br/>

taking everything everyone has said into account when<br/>
I do plant. I have spent 30+ hours on a series of 9<br/>
stamps and will be taking the utmost care in the<br/>
placement of them. I am huge fan of cryptographical<br/>
clues. For instance the box somewhere in southern MN.<br/>

Ink's boxes in WI. I would be happy having only one<br/>
person a year find my box if I knew it would be safe<br/>

<br/>
  I think that alot of people are new to this<br/>
addiction of ours and don't quite yet get the<br/>
investment of time and thought that goes into the<br/>
placing of a box. I know I haven't yet placed, but I<br/>
get it, I understand the work that goes into it or how<br/>
satisfying it can be to wrack your brain to figure out<br/>
a clue, or to hike a long ways to get to a box. I have<br/>
a total of 14 stamps that are in some stage of<br/>
completion and/or waiting to be planted and it makes<br/>
me ill to hear of all the boxes that go missing.<br/>
<br/>
  It might even be a good idea to make the clues too<br/>
hard to figure out for all but the keenest thinkers.<br/>
While I have never found a box by Mapsurfer I have<br/>
read the clues to those boxes and some of them seem<br/>
insanely difficult to figure out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks to P.Granola for bringing this issue up. I<br/>
will be planting soon and will be taking alot longer<br/>
to think about spots than I previously had. I also<br/>
will be making the clues as hard as the dickens to<br/>
decipher to keep away the muggles.<br/>

I agree with keeping the LbNA less cluttered and I have archived a few at<br/>
LbNA.  I don't intend to retire any letterboxes.  If and when they go<br/>
missing, I have pictures and images of all my stamps.  I will mark the box<br/>
"missing" at Atlas Quest and insert a stamp image, or in one case, the<br/>
view around the missing letterbox.  Those who want to log finding my boxes<br/>
will be able at AQ. <br/>
<br/>
I have replaced a couple of missing boxes, but unless they are popular, I<br/>
don't intend to replace all boxes that go missing.<br/>

&gt; 3)  Be really, really picky about the hiding spot<br/>
Icouldn't agree with this statement more.  All three boxes I've had <br/>
come up missing I wasn't completely in love with the hiding spot.  Two <br/>
of them were in city parks and at the time of placement I had a "gut" <br/>
feeling that they'd dissapear, and they did.  The third one was because <br/>
a huge tree whose root base was hiding the box fell in a windstorm.  <br/>
When the husband and I went to check on it, there was no way for us to <br/>
retrieve the box.  I posted it missing.  I will say with this one I did <br/>
get notification after that of it being found. I guess the person dug <br/>
it out.  So if you "gut" is telling you it's not a good location, <br/>
listen to it and look elsewhere.  You'll be glad you took the extra <br/>
time.  ~The Cats Meow~ <br/>

  I wanted to thank everyone for the wealth of information on missing boxes, how to plant, being stealthy with kids, etc.  We have been boxing for just a year now and I have been working on a 4 stamp series to place, in fact my 6 year old's idea for my birthday was to buy me the lock n lock boxes, ink pads and logbooks.  We are "planting" our first box as a HH to be released this weekend. <br/>
<br/>
  And as I finish the series, I will take all of the opinions and guidance regarding this ongoing discussion very seriously.  Thanks again to all for the great discussion and suggestions.<br/>

2.  RESECURE THE LID AND REPLACE THE BOX JUST AS YOU FOUND IT, WELL <br/>

3.  If you found this box disturbed or not well hidden, please <br/>
return it to the same spot you found it, hide it better and contact <br/>
the placer to let them know.<br/>

Recently, many boxes have been left undisturbed and we need your <br/>

It had been in place since Oct. of 2003, well hidden at the end of a dead end trail that wasn't used much.<br/>

That's rather disheartening.  <br/>

Good news is that I have heard from so many people that have enjoyed my letterboxes that it almost makes up for the ones that get stolen or inadvertently found because of careless boxers or critters.  I have also had boxers I have never met or spoken with previously help with the maintenance and care of my boxes and that just warms my heart!  And I think it's so cool that most of my boxes have been out since 2003 and 2004.  The spots are good, and most will be open for new boxes if anyone wants to re-use them :-)<br/>

I wholeheartedly agree with these sentiments!  At first it was very <br/>
difficult when a box went missing and it still is a huge <br/>
disappointment when that happens, but I have come to accept that is a <br/>
very real possibility with every letterbox I plant and take joy in <br/>
knowing that other people are enjoying the box while it lasts.  That <br/>
really is the point of planting the box in the first place.<br/>

Spring Chick, I like your advice.  We should enjoy placing the boxes and carving the stamps and writing the clues and hope that others will enjoy them too...while the boxes last.  <br/>

me, that's fine, but I hope you'll hear me out also since the side of<br/>
the people boxing with kids is not represented and under full attack<br/>
from everyone!  Yikes.<br/>
While I understand that it's frustrating to lose boxes, it would be<br/>
great to not start a lynch mob and go after all family letterboxers. <br/>
I'm new to letterboxing (we started in May) and I box with my two kids<br/>
who are 7, I let them stamp into the logbooks, so I'm right in the<br/>
middle of your bullseye target that you're all shooting arrows at.<br/>
Just a couple of thoughts for you and then you can carry on with the<br/>
attack if you'd like....<br/>
1. How do you know that families are losing your boxes?  If the boxes<br/>
are missing and the logbooks are gone, what evidence do you have about<br/>
who or what caused your box to go missing other than your own anti-kid<br/>
hunches?  I've found several boxes that were scattered around and upon<br/>
close investigation in each case, it appeared to be the work of an<br/>
animal, not an irresponsible family who reads Family Fun.  There are<br/>
lots of things that can cause a box to go missing and most of them<br/>
have nothing to do with kids.  Everyone talks about the spirit of<br/>
letterboxing blah blah blah... doesn't the spirit of letterboxing<br/>
include being able to take it when a box goes missing?  Yes, it's<br/>
annoying, and feels like a loss since you put your hand-carved<br/>
masterpieces in there, but it's a tupperware hidden out in the world<br/>
where a million things are likely to go wrong.  The true spirit of<br/>
letterboxing should be enjoying each day that a box you had stayed out<br/>
there for others to find, because going missing is ultimately the fate<br/>
of just about every letterbox.<br/>
2. Is it possible that people who read Family Fun could be responsible<br/>
letterboxers?  Since May, we've found 125+ boxes you may be shocked to<br/>
hear this, but we conscientiously seal the baggies, close the boxes,<br/>
rehide exactly where we find them, use as little paper as possible in<br/>
the logbook, and repair boxes in need of repair whenever we have<br/>
supplies appropriate for the repair job with us (which we try to bring<br/>
each time but don't always realize when something runs out).  We don't<br/>
only do drive by boxes, we also do long hikes (evidence = a three hour<br/>
4 mile round trip in Rocky Mountain National Park that had a 2,500<br/>
foot elevation gain at 8,000 feet which isn't exactly a cake walk), we<br/>
don't kill every piece of plant life in our path, and we try to be as<br/>
discreet as possible.  So, we're in your "boxers we hate" category,<br/>
but we try to be every bit as responsible as all of you.  Based on the<br/>
posts in this group, I see some nasty stereotyping that doesn't seem<br/>
fair... I could start stereotyping all of you and say that all<br/>
experienced letterboxers are crotchety and uptight and think they know<br/>
everything, but that wouldn't be fair, true, or nice, would it?<br/>
3. Why can't kids stamp into the boxes?  My kids work just as hard as<br/>
I do to find each and every box.  If I hike 5 miles, so do they.  Why<br/>
shouldn't they get to participate as fully in the find as I do just<br/>
because they are 30 years younger?  This hobby culminates in leaving<br/>
your "signature" in a logbook in the box that you find -- if a 7 year<br/>
old or a 37 year old or an 87 year old finds the box, why shouldn't<br/>
they all be equally welcome to stamp in?  Are you all really that<br/>
grouchy and mean that you won't allow a child to experience the same<br/>
joy that you experience each time you stamp your image into a book? <br/>
If they use up the book and you can't put your image there, you don't<br/>
like it, so you clearly see the fun in stamping in.  Why can't a kid<br/>
have that same fun?<br/>
Well, thanks for letting me represent the "other side" and you can<br/>
bring on the hate mail if you like.  <br/>

Hi there!  I agree with everything you said.  And being a <br/>
conscientious newbie myself, I agree that we've been largely unfairly <br/>
sterotyped and blamed for problems that could have a large variety of <br/>
causes.  Not all of the newbies suck. ;)  I haven't been at this as <br/>
long as you, and I haven't done a 4 hour Rocky Mountain hike, but we <br/>
don't do just easy drivebys, either.  I like the boxes with harder <br/>
clues and puzzles, intriguing clues that make you think.  The easy <br/>
boxes have their place and we do them too.  Last weekend, we did a 3 <br/>
hour search for a series of 5 boxes and a bunch of smaller hikes that <br/>
weren't quite drivebys, but were able to be done in 1/2 hour or <br/>
less.  So, we found quite a few boxes that day.   We have a 5 year <br/>
old with us, who helps find and hide the boxes.  We always clean the <br/>
boxes up, dry them out, replace baggies as needed and hide them <br/>
better than they were.<br/>
<br/>
My only real response to your email is to #3.  I don't think that <br/>
anyone said that kids shouldn't stamp into the books at all.  I think <br/>
they absolutely should!  That's the "reward" so to speak.  They <br/>
shouldn't be cheated out of that fun!   I think the point is that <br/>
families should try to stamp all of their stamps on one page or maybe <br/>
two if the pages are small and the stamps are big.... not a separate <br/>
page for each individual stamp.<br/>
<br/>
In the series of boxes we did last weekend, the last visitors were <br/>
either a family with a LOT of kids or a class or a troop of some <br/>
sort, there were about 10 small stamps signed in from a whole bunch <br/>
of kids.  Each stamp was on a separate page in the book.  The pages <br/>
were easily big enough to fit 4-6 of these stamps on a page.  But <br/>
there weren't a ton of pages in the book, so almost a 1/3-1/2 of the <br/>
book was filled up with just these visitors stamps.   These log books <br/>
are either going to have to be replaced much sooner than they should <br/>
have been, or future loggers will have to go backwards and stamp on <br/>
some of these pages that are 3/4 of the way empty.  I think that if <br/>
families all stamp in on one page, it's just one added layer to the <br/>
"be conscientious of the box and future boxers rule".<br/>

Now, it may not have been *your* child, but I think people were speaking in generalities about the increase in these types of situations, as well as missing letterboxes, each time letterboxing articles in family-oriented publications bring in a new wave of letterboxing families with young children.<br/>

While on the surface letterboxing appears to be a fun family activity, by nature it is not really conducive to boisterous, impatient children as a very large aspect of the game -- which many people do not immediately understand -- is stealth.  While is is certainly possible to letterbox as families and with children and I know of several families who use letterboxing as a successful teaching tool for their children and *do* letterbox responsibly, there are many who do not.  It is not just about taking a walk in the woods and following some clues to find a letterbox -- it takes extra effort on the part of a parent to teach children how to be *responsible letterboxers* and not all parents are willing to put in this extra effort.<br/>
<br/>
If your family happens to be one of those that takes the spirit of the game to heart and letterboxes responsibly, the letterboxing community welcomes you and appreciates your efforts as a parent to teach your children the importance of respecting nature and other people's boxes, repackaging and rehiding properly and being stealthy while letterboxing so as not to inadventently compromise a box location.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I enjoy reading all the posts each day and either nod or shake my <br/>
head at a lot of the things that are said.  Regarding all the posts <br/>
about letterbox concerns and now reading the arguments on both <br/>
sides, I wanted to post regarding a middle ground.<br/>
<br/>
We were first introduced to letterboxing in the summer of 2005 by <br/>
another family who had only heard mention of it.  They had clues to <br/>
a box and off we went.  Luckily we never found it because we had <br/>
been told to bring trinkets to exchange.  I shudder at the thought <br/>
that if we had found it, we may have taken the stamp or logbook and <br/>
traded it for a matchbox car.  We were interested though and over <br/>
the winter we searched out letterboxing online and read tons of <br/>
information.  In only one hour of learning about the hobby, one can <br/>
learn sooooo much.<br/>
<br/>
We letterbox as a family, not as individuals (we have 3 kids  girl <br/>
12, boy 10, boy 7).  Sometimes not all of us our present.  Quite <br/>
often there is a friend along.  We did about 8 boxes in the U.P. <br/>
with an entire group of 11.  But I don't believe anyone would know <br/>
that prior to this post.  We did it as a team, with one stamp.  Each <br/>
person had a duty, one went in for the box to avoid the "community <br/>
trail".  We took turns stamping their logbook and ours.  I note in <br/>
our logbook with each find who was present.<br/>
<br/>
We had one incident that after we were the last ones to stamp in, <br/>
the box was found scattered and not in its hiding place.  I know <br/>
that we were not the ones who left it in that condition.  I do <br/>
believe that we probably weren't as diligent as we should have been <br/>
in concealing it though and allowed for its discovery to be <br/>
vandalized.  I appreciated the well worded emails from the planter <br/>
and can assure you that I inspect each box now after it is hidden by <br/>
the kids as part of their participation in the event.<br/>
<br/>
We have now planted 8 letterboxes.  My kids aided in planting them <br/>
in places that other kids their age will be able to hike to.  We <br/>
love the fact that other families are finding them and their kids <br/>
are following in the footsteps of mine, but I also don't want the <br/>
logbook filled up with a child's drawing or signature on each page.  <br/>
We are already seeing that happen on our 3 box series.<br/>
<br/>
Get your families involved!! Take kids out and teach them the fun of <br/>
it but also the respect that needs to go along.  My kids love it!  <br/>
They also love that we do it together as a family.  They are all <br/>
working on their own stamps, but those will only be used as personal <br/>
travelers.  So if you want to see all of our individual stamps, <br/>
don't look in the letterbox logbooks as you'll only find one page <br/>
with our stamp, not up to 11, look in your own logbook after you <br/>
meet us.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I started LB'ing by myself but expanded to my girlfriend and her <br/>
kids, my brother and his family and sometimes all of us with my Mom.<br/>
<br/>
I hear things in what people are saying that make me rethink how we <br/>
manage the kids and even the adults.  But, I agree with the last few <br/>
postings about families and new people.  Lets face it: what we're <br/>
doing is pretty child like.  We're playing a game and doing crafts.  <br/>
Families should feel welcome, especially kids.  We've used LB'ing as <br/>
a way to teach respect of nature, about game playing and about <br/>
craft/art.  Its not the "kids" or the "family", its the adults who <br/>
allow it to happen.  I personally will be changing some of the <br/>
things my family does that is not respectful.<br/>
<br/>
But, I would ask also that we question rules that we seem to be <br/>
applying to people that may not be necessary.  For instance, while I <br/>
think my family does try to use multiple stamps on one page, what <br/>
does it hurt if others don't?  Maybe I need to replace a the book a <br/>
little earlier, but if each of those people found the box <br/>
separately, they'd probably use a different page anyway.  Maybe I'm <br/>
just not aware, but my log book has not filled in the three years.  <br/>
Maybe I don't get the traffic or its a larger book, but I'm just <br/>
happy for the visit.  Let's not get stressed about the fact that <br/>
people are playing the game exactly the way we would.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

&gt; From: "SpringChick" <letterbox@...> <br/>
&gt; As indicated in a previous post, I don't think it is fair to <br/>
blindly point at families or new letterboxers as the reason for all <br/>
missing boxes. There certainly are many reasons that letterboxes go <br/>
missing, including animals and poorly planted boxes, and there most <br/>
certainly are many families that letterbox responsibly. However, <br/>
that fact being acknowledged, it is difficult to attribute scribbled <br/>
logbook pages and unbagged letterbox contents to animals. While it <br/>
is true that any letterboxer or muggle *could* have scribbled <br/>
logbook pages, it seems reasonable to assume it was a child. Now, it <br/>
may not have been *your* child, but I think people were speaking in <br/>
generalities about the increase in these types of situations, as <br/>
well as missing letterboxes, each time letterboxing articles in <br/>
family-oriented publications bring in a new wave of letterboxing <br/>
families with young children.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While on the surface letterboxing appears to be a fun family <br/>
activity, by nature it is not really conducive to boisterous, <br/>
impatient children as a very large aspect of the game -- which many <br/>
people do not immediately understand -- is stealth. While is is <br/>
certainly possible to letterbox as families and with children and I <br/>
know of several families who use letterboxing as a successful <br/>
teaching tool for their children and *do* letterbox responsibly, <br/>
there are many who do not. It is not just about taking a walk in the <br/>
woods and following some clues to find a letterbox -- it takes extra <br/>
effort on the part of a parent to teach children how to be <br/>
*responsible letterboxers* and not all parents are willing to put in <br/>
this extra effort.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your family happens to be one of those that takes the spirit of <br/>
the game to heart and letterboxes responsibly, the letterboxing <br/>
community welcomes you and appreciates your efforts as a parent to <br/>
teach your children the importance of respecting nature and other <br/>
people's boxes, repackaging and rehiding properly and being stealthy <br/>
while letterboxing so as not to inadventently compromise a box <br/>
location.<br/>

I did my annual "skip out of teacher's conference to check on my<br/>

Grave and Squished Pennies and found both poorly rehidden and the<br/>
contents not sealed well.  The Watery Grave box had its lid half open<br/>
and exposed up so the rain would collect in the box.  Also, something<br/>
that is supposed to STAY in the box was taken out and relocated to<br/>
another box.  Luckily, I got an email today letting me know where the<br/>
item is now located.  Grrr.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, both boxes are now fine and have an extra logbook in each as<br/>
they seem to be very popular boxes.  I was also able to leave some<br/>
squished pennies in the box from the steam train that came through<br/>
last summer.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that's why we check on the boxes, eh?<br/>
