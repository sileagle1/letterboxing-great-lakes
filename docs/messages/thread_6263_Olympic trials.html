                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today the letterboxing world got a sneak peak at a few of the Olympic teams at the "Dead of Winter" trial games...or is that trail games?  Here is a synopsis of their current training levels...<br/>
<br/>
Those sly GPS toting Aussie's, and that crazy Bahama Mama and her sidekick Martini Mon, paired up with quite a nice showing in their hiking and carving techniques.  Both had to sprint to their boxes at least three times in the course of the day, not to mention, writing up clues on the spot!  Also, the way they were perfectly outfitted they could be on the cover of Sports Illustrated - Oh wait, they can't appear in February!  That's the swimsuit edition!  But then again, maybe under those snazzy pants they wear their swimsuits!  Hmmm?????   Very impressive show for the two pairs.  <br/>
<br/>
The Queen of England and her golden prince showed promise with their stealth and kindness to waiting boxers...affording some helpful hints to the pathetic boxers also known as T&amp;T.  Our hats off to Her Majesty!<br/>
<br/>
Team Guatemala looked impressive in spite of their size.  Some of their team were dragging a bit toward the end...must have been too many PBJ's!  Unfortunately, they may have to send a representative in their stead.  They will be missed as they are always a joy to watch box.  <br/>
<br/>
Two entrants of unknown origin... both froggies...one with a doggie and the other with some great carving skills could pose some threats to the other teams...<br/>
<br/>
Then there was this team from Sweden...uniform malfunction is all we can say!  Gunhild wore the wrong boots and slipped on the icy pavement...while her team mate, Ivor, was caught begging for (and procured) an enhancement drug for a bum knee from other athletes!  However, the drug did allow him to make it through the event...just not in record speed.  We also noted some discourse between the Swedish contingent....Ivor showed Gunhild to the wrong lavatory where she used the Mens room, not once, but twice before realizing he had steered her wrong!  Apparently, she can't read English very well!  They don't seem to be a threat to anyone other than themselves.....<br/>
Keep training everyone!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of Olympic Trials, this froggie is looking for a new country<br/>
willing to accept an immigrating national.  Frogs are happy in many types of<br/>
countries and climes and are willing to hop long distances through snow and<br/>
sleet.  They can even survive accidental falls into streams!<br/>
<br/>
Let me know.  I'd love to help with carving and other country-specific<br/>
matters!<br/>
