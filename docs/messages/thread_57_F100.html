I'm one of the last people on the list to get the F100 stamp.  When <br>
it comes, I was going to let the WI letterboxers know in case you <br>
wanted to meet and stamp it (if you're at F100).  I'd say you might <br>
as well wait until I get it, and I'll let you know when it's <br>
available.  The original stamp was lost in the mail, but the <br>
replacement is now making the rounds.  I don't know how much longer <br>
it will be until it comes my way.<br>

<br>
Just wanted to post that we made our 100th find today <br>
(Squeek's "Softball Anyone?").  Its great to be reaching this milestone <br>
in just under a year of letterboxing.  Now I just need to get more <br>
boxes placed . . . so coming soon will be a six box series dedicated to <br>
the Adult Swim TV programs on Cartoon Network.  The stamps are already <br>
carved and the location is pretty much determined so its just a matter <br>
of getting out there and placing them.  If it's not too hot on Sunday, <br>
we're going to try to get them out there. If it's sweltering out then <br>
we may wait another week.  I will post here with the details once I <br>
have them. <br>
