We decided to "kill 2 birds with one stone" and do a little morel foraging and letterboxing...What better box to go after than Shorty's "The Morel."

I joke that we need to find a rent a kind and rent a dog service for all those boxes where 2 adults look out of place or to help get us in the odd places, or better yet to make a ruckus in the other direction.  Please let us know when you find such a place.<br/>

Be advised about renting out your kids: They are such cutie pies, you might not get them back.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the talk about fishing, awh....a life skill I feel I need to learn.  I want to learn to fish.  Anyone up for teaching me?  <br/>
