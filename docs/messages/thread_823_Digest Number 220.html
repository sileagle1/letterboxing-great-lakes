Appearanly we have the worlds best tenderloins here in ottawa,  il.  People <br/>
from all over the US and abroad order from here!!  I  wouldnt know-I'm not a <br/>
pork eater.<br/>
<br/>
My step dad is from springfirld, IL and he refers to lunch as dinner  and the <br/>
last meal of the day as supper, too.<br/>
<br/>
We live not far from US Rt 30 and my folks ALWAYS called it the  <br/>
by-pass...weird.<br/>
<br/>
When I lived in the suburbs of chicago we called the carpet sweepers  (the <br/>
vacuumes that you push with no electricity-just brushes that rotate  when you <br/>
push) "carpet sweepers"...when I moved to ottawa (which is only  about an hour <br/>
from where I was from) they call them Hokeys. (like-you do  the hokey pokey!)  <br/>
it makes no sense to me!<br/>
<br/>
gotta love it<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh Wick's Sugar Cream pie! Even my crapster IGA-ish<br/>
(it's  IGA-ish because it's small like an IGA, but not<br/>
even cool enough to  be an IGA) grocery has them in the<br/>
freezer...AND THEY ARE YUMMY. By  sight, they are<br/>
foul...a greyish custard on crust...but it's heaven  in<br/>
the mouth. <br/>
<br/>
I think another Indiana thing is the breaded  pork<br/>
tenderloin sandwich (which is usually just called  a<br/>
tenderloin). It's basically a pork fritter, breaded,<br/>
fried and  slapped on a bun with pickles, cabbage, and<br/>
some electric yellow  mustard-like sauce called "Wally<br/>
Sauce". I'm not a fan...but it seems  that people eat a<br/>
lot of them around here. Every dumpster diner has  them<br/>
prominantly on the menu. <br/>
<br/>
Older Hoosiers refer to lunch  as dinner and the last<br/>
meal of the day as supper. They also refer to  US<br/>
highways that became four lanes 30 years ago (such as<br/>
US 30 and  US 31) as "the bypass" even today.  <br/>
<br/>
Isn't it amazing that  in a 5-7 state area there is<br/>
such variation in food, vocab,  traditions? <br/>
<br/>
--Armadillo Jo, who stays off the bypass and  takes<br/>
"Old 30" to work every day. <br/>
