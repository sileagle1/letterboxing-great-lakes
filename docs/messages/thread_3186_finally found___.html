                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lucky you!  I still have 3 boxes that have yet to be found.  One in Mexico<br/>
(19 months old), one in Oregon (13 months old) and one in Florida (5 months<br/>
old).  Not everyone is as gung-ho as the Great Lake boxers!  Although I have<br/>
to admit the Mexican one is not necessarily in an area frequented by many<br/>
boxers and the Oregon one does require a moderate (4.5 miles) hike in the<br/>
mountains.  However the Florida one is EASY and I still haven't heard one<br/>
word about it.<br/>
<br/>
It's always exciting to hear that a box has been found, so congrats on<br/>
getting the word on one that has lain dormant for so long!<br/>
