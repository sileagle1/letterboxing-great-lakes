                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ten cool things we talked about last night as we reviewed the day:<br/>
<br/>
1. What a wonderfully well organized event (we'd like to echo Fungus<br/>
Woman in giving thanks to our Hosts!) and how ideal the location<br/>
was... beautiful park and having the building was super!<br/>
2. How MANY people turned out for the gathering ... way more than<br/>
anyone anticipated! (we really enjoyed getting to meet so many new<br/>
boxers, put names and faces to trail names we've seen online, as well<br/>
as doing exchanges with the chance to see some beautifully carved<br/>
signature stamps ... and even to collect a few personal travelers)<br/>
3. Trail memories by Mrs DogLvrs include the time 3 teams of boxers in<br/>
the woods... one of those moments when the noise level drops ... and<br/>
out of the silence Fungus Womans voice floats back, "Oh look, I found<br/>
some mushrooms! They're so cute."<br/>
4. The huge number of boxes that were available for finding.<br/>
(published, WOM, temporary and same-day placed ones) As I was talking<br/>
with WI Hiker during the day, she said they figured that using a 10<br/>
minute stamp in (not counting any hiking or clue solving time) there<br/>
were enough published boxes to keep a person busy for 7-8 hours!<br/>
5. The potluck food was great ... thanks to all who shared food and a<br/>
big thanks to whoever brought bottled water! (Mrs DogLvrs and I had no<br/>
idea the drinking water in this area was 'hard') (And Tipto ~ thanks<br/>
for giving me the finger! ~Mrs.)<br/>
6. The Group Photo event ... hehhehe .... two shots each with about 15<br/>
cameras but everyone was a trooper and put up with it nicely. (I<br/>
didn't see one single pair of finger 'bunny ears' behind anyones head)<br/>
7. The fun we had watching the Great Altoids Gum Tins Collection Event<br/>
(thank goodness some helpful kids gathered them all up for us so we<br/>
didn't have to go in search of those 12 tins before we could leave!)<br/>
8. How much fun I had teaching the Kids Logbook workshops. I really<br/>
enjoyed watching them learn how easy it would be to make their own<br/>
logbooks. I especially liked when 2 kids from my last session wanted<br/>
to push the learning up a notch and go onto a little more advanced<br/>
level and learn how to make the logs using quatro signatures. I loved<br/>
that Drama Mamma (I know you're out there lurking!)sat in on one of my<br/>
sessions so she could learn and take back the lesson to her groups of<br/>
Cub Scouts. (A special thanks to everyone who brought supplies and<br/>
loaned us class equipment ... what a generous bunch of people!)<br/>
9. How perfect the weather was. Whoever put THAT requisition in<br/>
deserves a huge pat on the back. LOL<br/>
10. And finally ... our own "Adventures in Just Getting To the<br/>
Gathering" (Lake Express ferry was cancelled, rented a car and drove,<br/>
paying for wi-fi at a truck stop so we could download some clues to<br/>
boxes along the way..heheheh) But that's another story. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone for sharing your time with us - and now we have<br/>
to pack everything up to catch the ferry....we hope!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wed like to thank everyone who attended the Haunted Harvest Gathering<br/>
yesterday!  A grand total of 80 people (and 5 dogs) attended the event. We<br/>
had a fantastic time talking with so many boxers we hadnt met before and<br/>
touching base again with those wed met at previous gatherings.  It was nice<br/>
to see so many kids enjoying the activities (boxing, logbook making,<br/>
Halloween crafts, and just running around the beach having fun).  The dogs<br/>
also provided entertainment, especially that funny Scout who DIDNT want to<br/>
walk on the floor in the building.   The food was delicious and we couldnt<br/>
have asked for better weather!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We appreciate the help provided by Merlin &amp; Ardea, Tabby Tales and JAB in<br/>
preparing for the event, Bindle Babe for running the popular kids logbook<br/>
workshop AND for taking the group photos, and Mr. Puddlejumper for helping<br/>
out so much with post-event cleanup.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We owe a special thanks to those who created boxes for the event.  Some were<br/>
by local or regional boxers, a few of whom created their very first boxes<br/>
for this event.  We also had the wonderful Phineas Bochs Traveling Circus<br/>
boxes, and several other boxes generously created by people from other areas<br/>
of the country, including CT, NY, PA, TX, and OR.  There were published<br/>
clues for 38 boxes in the gathering handout.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There were also several boxes with clues distributed by various other<br/>
means.  These included: Boo, Eensy Weensy, Felka Lechsinska, Mr.<br/>
Pumpkinhead, Halloween Letterbox Surprise, Samara, Psycho, Haunted Harvest ,<br/>
personal travelers,  and probably even more!.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The creators of the boxes that will remain as permanent placements<br/>
(approximately 18 boxes) will be posting the clues on the Internet in the<br/>
near future so they will be available for people who were unable to attend<br/>
the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the boxes, there were at least 3 cooties infecting the crowd,<br/>
so those of you who were there may want to check your belongings to see if<br/>
you went home with anything extra.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of something extra -  when we were cleaning up, we discovered the<br/>
following items that were left behind:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Large square Glad storage container<br/>
<br/>
Large rectangular Ziploc container<br/>
<br/>
1 knife (used to cut apples?)<br/>
2 smaller white serving spoons<br/>
<br/>
1 metal serving spoon w/cutout in handle<br/>
<br/>
1 black plastic serving spoon w/red accent in handle<br/>
<br/>
1 compass<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If any of these belong to you, please contact me off list and we can arrange<br/>
something to get them back to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have some photos posted soon (within the next few days) on the HHG<br/>
site.  If anyone wants to send me any photos they took, please do so!  Id<br/>
especially appreciate any family or small group photos and photos taken out<br/>
on the trail, but any and all photos are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who made it such a fun day!<br/>

Miscellaneous Memories:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hubbub of activity at registration area.  Many people were attending their<br/>
very first gathering, so there were explanations of stamping onto event<br/>
poster, stamping a name tag, stamping event stamp, and handing out clue<br/>
sheets &amp; maps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quiet of mid-morning when almost everyone hit the trails.  That gave us time<br/>
to find the 12 Altoid tins!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Group photo and Bindle Babe telling us we had to get a little closer, a<br/>
little closer, a little closer.  This was a bit more of an effort for those<br/>
that were sitting or kneeling in the sand.  Our motivation for getting the<br/>
photo done was lunch!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was Kimono Girls birthday so they brought a delicious ice cream cake.<br/>
After singing Happy Birthday to her, she then announced that anyone who had<br/>
sung to her could stamp into a special box that was out near her car.  Wow!<br/>
Did those kids ever stampede out to look for that one!  (and it was a VERY<br/>
cool stamp).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The pleasure some of the kids got from creating Halloween foam craft<br/>
projects and one girl intently working on the Letterboxing Word Search<br/>
puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Watching the kids play with their glo-sticks out on the beach after it got<br/>
dark.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cigna Cats coming back to report that they had found 29 boxes.  Quite a feat<br/>
since they are expecting their first baby boxer!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LeapinLizards and Dragon returning from the trails at about 8:30 pm to find<br/>
a few boxes in the beach area and then heading out shortly before 9 pm to<br/>
find one more box.  Since it gets dark by 7 or 7:30 pm, they definitely<br/>
were doing some flashlight boxing!<br/>

before this weekend! I came to the gathering alone but planning on <br/>
meeting up with some people I had chatted with. I never did run into <br/>
them but I know they were there. Originally planned on camping out <br/>
but forgot my sleeping bag and altho I could have made 1 out of my <br/>
jackets, I was too pooped! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Bindle Babe, thank you for letting me join your kid's logbook class! <br/>
There will be some scouts that will use these logbooks for all kinds <br/>
of things (altho i do encourage letterboxing every chance I get with <br/>
them!). I loved it and the time after when we visited! Thank you to <br/>
Madame Butterfly and Mr. Conductor for sharing their supplies! They <br/>
also let me tag along later in the day with their mom (i know her <br/>
real name but have forgotten her trail name! LOL) to have a few <br/>
elusive boxes! Thanks to Sophie &amp; me for spending some time with me <br/>
and chatting! Thanks to Jigsaw for drawing me into (whether he know <br/>
it or not, he did!) such a great group of people! A VERY special <br/>
thank you goes to Hyacinth for being my 1st exchange stamp! And last <br/>
but not least thanks to Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man for <br/>
organizing and then answering this 1st timers silly questions!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
We just wanted to add our thanks and thoughts on the gathering as well.<br/>
We had a great time!  The kids had a blast! And Scout is completely wore<br/>
out!  You know he was getting tired when he tired to "cat nap" each time<br/>
we were stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
We approached this gathering with great anticipation and especially<br/>
looked forward to meeting some of the boxers we have never met before.<br/>
We've been boxing for 2 years now, hunting many boxes planted by WI<br/>
Hiker and Martini Man and this was our first opportunity to meet them<br/>
and it sure was a pleasure!  It was nice to see boxers that we met last<br/>
year and it was even more fun to meet other boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a list of highlights and things that stood out for us....<br/>
<br/>
The tremendous amount of effort in putting this gathering together was<br/>
very apparent!  The blowing of the noon whistle, to call us in for the<br/>
photo and lunch, proves WI Hiker thought of everything!  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
The Haunted Harvest web site was very helpful to know what to expect for<br/>
the day.  We informed the kids ahead of time to be on the look out for<br/>
secretly hidden boxes around the pavilion or even cooties.  While we<br/>
didn't get any cooties, Thunder was the first to find the Psycho box and<br/>
then the kids started bringing us all these altoid tins!  Thank You Mrs.<br/>
Doglvrs and Bindle Babe, our kids say finding all the altoids was one of<br/>
the best parts of the day for them.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Doglvrs asked us for our first exchange of the day and it was so<br/>
much fun meeting her.  We discussed later, on the way home, the dilemma<br/>
of wanting to box and yet wanting to use exchanges as an opportunity to<br/>
meet and chat with other boxers.  We found it hard to do both.  We got a<br/>
fair amount of exchanges, but the one regret we had over the day was<br/>
that we didn't get a chance to meet more than we did.  In two years, we<br/>
have only been to two gatherings now and I think we will look at them as<br/>
a rare opportunity to meet and chat in future years.  We can box every<br/>
other day of the year right?  In a sentimental kind of way, we would<br/>
like other boxers to know how much we appreciate their efforts to plant<br/>
boxes, because letterboxing has become our family hobby and the focus of<br/>
most of our weekend recreation and vacation time.  Our kids are young<br/>
and we are building memories and whether you folks realize it or not,<br/>
you and your letterbox plants are going to be forever etched in the<br/>
childhood memories that our kids take with them into adulthood.  Meeting<br/>
the Dragon last year was a larger than life experience for our kids<br/>
because he sent us on that Tunnel No. 3 expedition.  That letterbox hunt<br/>
stretched all of us especially me as a mom, as the kids kept saying<br/>
"mom, I can't believe you are letting us do this" as we walked the top<br/>
of that wall and then bushwhacked our way for what seemed like miles!<br/>
It is just impossible to express or share with you folks all of the very<br/>
special moments we have shared as a family because we were hunting for<br/>
your boxes.  Each of our letterbox finds are scrapbooked with photos,<br/>
clues, journal notes etc.  Okay enough of the sentimental mush....<br/>
<br/>
We were delighted to stumble across Samara without even knowing of the<br/>
clue!  After all those altoid tins, we just didn't have anytime to<br/>
strategize our letterbox hunt, so we just walked across the beach<br/>
thinking we were heading for a trail.  When we met up with the closed<br/>
fence, we decided to circumvent the fence to get to the trail on the<br/>
other side.  If anyone had fallen into the lake, that would have gone in<br/>
the books as a Puddlejumper high adventure event, but we all<br/>
successfully stayed dry.  However, while discussing what we were going<br/>
to do with the fence in our way, I stuck my head in that stone column<br/>
and spied a suspicious looking stack of stones that only letterboxers<br/>
recognize!  We stamped in thinking this day of letterboxing is going to<br/>
be easier than we thought.<br/>
<br/>
We went on to Search for Scaredy Cat and came up empty handed!  That<br/>
burst our bubble pretty quick.  We did meet up with Punxsygal and<br/>
Aimlesst and we found Loser together.<br/>
<br/>
It was about that time I remembered that in all the excitement I plugged<br/>
in the crock pot, but forgot to turn it on!  Our sloppy Joes were cold.<br/>
Thankfully there was a microwave available.<br/>
<br/>
Other highlights?  A police officer pulled over at the side of the road<br/>
seemingly watching us as we were retrieving Beelzebub.  But ,we didn't<br/>
see him until Mr. Puddlejumper, who prefers to stay on wide paths far<br/>
away from any poison ivy, told us after we emerged from the area.  We<br/>
assume he decided a couple of middle aged people with young children<br/>
were not your typical troublemakers and he moved on without speaking to<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
We really enjoyed meeting AJ out on the trail.  We got a chance to talk<br/>
with her personally about our "high" adventure while searching for her<br/>
EZ Calf box.<br/>
<br/>
Little Green Monkey found a woolly worm, adopted her, named her Lily and<br/>
brought her home.  Unfortunately, we had tears when Lily escaped in the<br/>
car before we left for home.  Once at home though, we found her and gave<br/>
her a nice home in a glass jar.  Little Green Monkey plays with his<br/>
woolly worm all the time. He has discovered she can climb up his shirt,<br/>
but can't climb up the window.<br/>
<br/>
The kids really enjoyed working on the crafts and especially enjoyed<br/>
playing on the beach with the other kids and the light sticks. Thanks WI<br/>
Hiker and Martini Man for everything!<br/>
<br/>
Overall, we just had a great time.  The chatter in the car on the way<br/>
home was lots of fun too.  The kids had lots of fun getting exchanges<br/>
and meeting people.  They talked nonstop about this exchange, that<br/>
letterboxer, etc.  I also wanted to mention we really enjoyed meeting<br/>
and conversing with The Cottontails, Sophie and Me, the CC Family, Drama<br/>
Mama and the Cat Herders and others.  A bit of trivia.....Can anyone<br/>
guess what Drama Mama, the Cat Herders, the Frog-a-Nobies and the<br/>
Puddlejumpers have in common? I'll give you a hint.  Personally, the<br/>
Puddlejumpers' letterboxing jaunts have a dual purpose that make a<br/>
perfect fit with this commonality.<br/>
<br/>
We waited until tonight to send this email, because we planned to return<br/>
today to get all the boxes we didn't get on Sat, including Scaredy Cat,<br/>
which still challenged us today!  As always, when we found the right<br/>
spot, the clues made complete sense!   We found another out of place<br/>
evergreen but couldn't make the clues work for that.  .  We completed<br/>
the circus series and all of the other boxes listed in the clue sheet.<br/>
After having time to study the clues a bit before returning today, we<br/>
found the hunt much easier.   We even met JAB out on the trail again!<br/>
After Sat, finding Bluebird at Lake Kegonsa on Sunday and then the rest<br/>
of the Gathering boxes today, we added about 60 boxes to our count!  The<br/>
count doesn't matter so much, but after hunting  boxes placed in close<br/>
range like that, I think it will be hard to go back to regular boxing in<br/>
Wisconsin. It is also going to be hard to get the ink off our hands!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great time everyone!<br/>

one other family that shared (if I am right) about this other common <br/>
interest!  Oh, and after meeting Hyacinth and finding out she has her own <br/>
trail name and stamp, my daughter has requested that her father (mom does <br/>
not do well with sharp things, LOL!) carve a stamp for her - be watching <br/>
for a Chickadee stamp out there!<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had known you were coming - we might have met you there!  We were <br/>
going to go tonight, but I now have this hideous full blown cold - Yuck!  I <br/>
am hoping to get out there tomorrow night after my husband get's <br/>
home!  Otherwise, we will be there on Saturday, LOL!<br/>
<br/>
We were thrilled that even for the short time we were there that we were <br/>
able to meet The Dragon, Leapin' Lizards (must have been pre-fungicide, <br/>
LOL) and Martini Man (we saw Wisconsin Hiker, but never got to actually <br/>
meet her - Wah!).  We were fairly certain there were a couple of <br/>
Letterboxing groups out there yesterday - we kept seeing the same mini-vans <br/>
moving around to the same parking areas we were at!  We are planning to <br/>
locate the boxes that we can when we are in Kenosha on Sunday afternoon (we <br/>
have a CM meeting there later in the afternoon - those with the share <br/>
commonality - again, if I am correct, may well know what a CM is).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again, Wisconsin Hiker, for planning this event for everyone - we <br/>
enjoyed the short time we were able to be there!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We would also like to add our praise to our hosts for the wonderful <br/>
time we had on Saturday at the Haunted Harvest.  The attention to <br/>
detail taken by Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man was amazing!  I've <br/>
been to meetings run by professional meeting planners that ran no <br/>
where near as smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
Of the 37 'published' boxes, we looked for and found ..... <br/>
<br/>
drum roll please.... 2!!<br/>
<br/>
We did however spend a great deal of time:<br/>
exchanging<br/>
chatting<br/>
searching for wom boxes<br/>
running around looking for altoid containers (not once but twice!)<br/>
playing on the beach<br/>
making log books<br/>
eating<br/>
taking pictures<br/>
screaming in the shower (okay, we won't talk about that)<br/>
etc.. etc.. etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to make a special thank you to our hosts, as well <br/>
as Bindle Babe for making all the children feel especially welcome.  <br/>

solidified my addiction to Letterboxing!  I met so many interesting <br/>
and wonderful people and got to see some awesome stamps all in an <br/>
area I had never been before.  The beach house and lake view was <br/>
breathtaking and we couldn't have had better weather for the event.  <br/>
I was able to complete the entire circus that was available, plus <br/>
many many more.  I still need to go back for a few, but not many.  <br/>
The food was great, thanks to all who brought such yummy additions.  <br/>
Even the letterboxing dogs were so well behaved and added a little <br/>
something to the event.  The kids were so adorable and amazingly <br/>
addicted as the adults, which is really cool.  <br/>
<br/>
Most memorable of the event for me....<br/>
<br/>
Meeting Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man.  Both wonderful people who <br/>
outdid themselves with this huge event.  They were extremely <br/>
hospitable and helped this newbie a lot getting aclamated to the <br/>
whole event process.<br/>
<br/>
Meeting Sophie &amp; Me once again and catching up as we spent the whole <br/>
day together boxing.  Both are wonderful trail companinions.  Poor <br/>
Sophie (the dog) was so tuckered out by the end of the day, im sure <br/>
she just passed out on the way home.<br/>
<br/>
Meeting Pico &amp; D' and Jameson at the start of the circus and <br/>
completing the whole thing with them.  Both are great people too, <br/>
and I learned a few things about the community and the hobby from <br/>
them.  I'll have to look you guys up next time i'm in the Chicago <br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
I was so pleased to see Drama momma at the event.  Thank you for the <br/>
kind words in your post too.  It was my first event too, and I'm <br/>
really glad you came.  It is such a great group of people isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
Bindle Babe and Mrs. Doglvrs, my first exchanges for the day.  Also, <br/>
glad to meet Mrs. Doglvrs as we are in the same PLB ring, so we <br/>
could catch up on that too.<br/>
<br/>
Meeting JACKS!  If any of you participates in the Postal <br/>
Letterboxing Community, you know of JACKS.  It was so good to talk <br/>
to her about that aspect of letterboxing and to finally put a face <br/>
to the stamp/name.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing so many intricate and wonderful stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
The Corpse Bride Logbook was just absolutely AMAZING!!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm so glad I decided to come to the gathering, and will be to many <br/>
more I'm sure.  This is a group of people that I just feel at home <br/>
with and I am glad I am a part of it.  It was so awesome to see so <br/>
many people show up.  I was just awestruck by the whole day.  Thanks <br/>
to everyone else too for making it great!<br/>

It sure was great to see you again, too!  Sophie slept all the way home on Saturday night and was very lethargic all day on Sunday.  Very unSophie-like!  I really got a kick out of how she seemed to follow you around and obeyed your every word!<br/>
<br/>
I have an idea for a new stamp.  It's Laverne and Shirley.  I thought I could hide it in a park somewhere near Miller Brewery.  I thought it would be cool because the show was based in Milwaukee, but I have to say that I'm having a really hard time with trying to design the stamp.  Maybe you can help me?  Maybe it can be a Jigsaw-Sophie &amp; Me coproduction?  You can carve the stamp with your outstanding atristry and I'll develop the search.  Are you interested?<br/>
<br/>
I would still like to look into hitting some of the boxes in the Burlington area on Oct. 15th.  That one park where 4 of the chocolate city stamps are hidden will be open then and there are a few others I'd like to hit.  Let me know if you can get off of work!<br/>
