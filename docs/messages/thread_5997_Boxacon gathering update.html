I switched the hosting for the website since I seemed to be unable to figure out how to do anything on the first site that I was using.  The new website is here:<br>

I transferred in any information I found from atlasquest sign-ups.  I did manage to lose some emails this summer when I was having computer issues.  If you emailed me and I don't have information listed, please drop me a line.  Let me know if there is any other information that you need.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<br>
I switched the hosting for the website since I seemed to be unable to figure<br>
out how to do anything on the first site that I was using. The new website<br>
is here:<br>
http://sites. <http://sites.google.com/site/boxacon/home><br>
google.com/site/boxacon/home<br>
I transferred in any information I found from atlasquest sign-ups. I did<br>
manage to lose some emails this summer when I was having computer issues. If<br>
you emailed me and I don't have information listed, please drop me a line.<br>
Let me know if there is any other information that you need.<br>
