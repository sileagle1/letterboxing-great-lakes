  june 18 is in the prime graduation season.  wouldn't more people be <br>
able to participate if it was later in the summer?<br>
  my son graduates this year. his party is on the tenth, so i <br>
probably will not be able to partcipate this year do to the financial <br>
burden.  also, i have several nieces and nephews who are coming into <br>
this age range as well.<br>
just a thought.<br>

This is why we moved it to the 18th.  Most schools are done by the <br>
second week of June, and graduations are usually not held off until <br>
later.  Another reason for the move to the 18th is that us teachers <br>
had a problem making it if it was too close to the end of the school <br>
year.<br>
