  I posted the clues for our first letterbox a few days<br>
  ago.  Then I sent myself a message using the contact<br>
  placer link, and so far I haven't gotten any messages.<br>
  I assumed that they would come to the email I<br>
  registered under.  Is there somewhere else I should<br>
  look?  I couldn't find anything in the FAQs.<br>
  I appreciate any help.<br>

it's not just me having a problem with the contact<br>

We've had sporadic luck at best over the last two years using the <br>
contact the placer feature of the web site.  That's why we place our <br>
email in our box clues, so anyone who wants to can contact us <br>
directly.  We've seen others do this also.  Whenever we find an email <br>
address in the clues, we report back to the placer on the condition of <br>
their box.  We don't trust the contact the placer feature.  Too many <br>
variables.  Is the feature broke?  Is the placer still active?  Did <br>
the placer ignore your message? (I know for a fact that this does <br>
happen)  Does the box have a new owner and is your message still going <br>
to the old owner?  Way too many variables.  <br>

It's good to know that the contact the placer feature isn't completely<br>
reliable.  My husband and I are relatively new boxers.  <br>
<br>
Last week I went looking for a box that was placed just a couple of<br>
days before my search.  I never found the box and used the contact the<br>
placer feature to let the placer know that I had attempted to find the<br>
box but a landmark that (according to the clues) should have been next<br>
to the trail could not be found (by me at least).  I never heard from<br>
the placer.  I might try and use the contact the placer function again<br>
in case my original message did not go through.  <br>
