WELL DUH!!! Isn't that just supposed to be common sense?  I will say <br/>
that for a lot of our boxes we finish the clues with an easier way to <br/>
leave if there is one, but if there isn't we just assume that most <br/>
people can find their way back.  I can just imagine these people <br/>
wandering around in the woods, holding their clues and panicing that <br/>
you didn't tell them how to get back.<br/>

  I can appreciate anyone that does take the time to write in their directions "For Family" or "Easy" then I know that my kids and I can accomplish it together.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe they need a rating scale?  1-5  a "1" easy and "5" hard.  Then people won't<br/>
  be so cranky when they get lost in the woods.. at least they know what they could be instore for in the first place..... *ponders*<br/>

Yikes!  I tried to be diplomatic in response, and then received an apology <br/>

The really funny part is that right after I put a note in the clues about it <br/>
possibly being missing, I received an email from another person saying that <br/>
they had found the box that day.  Hmmmm.....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've thankfully never gotten any rude comments via<br/>
email.  I remember checking in on our (still hasn't<br/>
been replaced) Duck Tape box once, and a few people<br/>
writing things about the clues being hard.  I laughed<br/>
and thought, "They think THIS box was hard to find? <br/>
They should try finding a SpringChick box!!"<br/>
<br/>
I tend not to put ratings on our boxes such as "good<br/>
for kids" or "easy find" or "3 on a scale of 1 to 5"<br/>
because, well, honestly, I don't know how others will<br/>
react.  My easy may be someone else's hard, and since<br/>
we planted the box and knew exactly what we were<br/>
thinking when we wrote the clues of course we think<br/>
that all our plants are easy.  I hope that they'll<br/>
read over the clues and use their best judgement.  Of<br/>
course, if someone were to email me and ask about a<br/>
box's difficulty I'd try to help them determine if<br/>
it's right for them.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one box we found in southern Ohio last year<br/>
(and when we finally found the log others did the same<br/>
thing we did) where it would have been a really easy<br/>
find - had we started on the correct end of the trail.<br/>
 But the clues weren't incredibly specific, and we<br/>
weren't familiar with the park, and what could have<br/>
been a 10 minute hike turned into an hour and 10<br/>
minute hike because we ended up going the way that<br/>
took us 3 miles around the lake.  But we didn't write<br/>
anything rude in the logbook about how the placer<br/>
needed to be more specific - that's letterboxing, and<br/>
it's the placer's prerogative to be as specific or<br/>
vague in the clues as they want.<br/>

The fun part of if it is that it's like a scavenger hunt or a wild goose chase!  We spent 8 hours trying to find the 9 deer, but we just email the placer about where we were and if we were on the right track.  We found out through others that found the box before us that there was a mis direction in there, and after that, we found it no problem.  I had to laugh when we went hunting for the Rodent gets an extreme home makeover.  We were EVERYWHERE on this path, and looking at everything, and finally the kids were gettting tired, so I told my parents I was going to head back to the van with the kids, and that maybe we were missing something.  Well, I sent my oldest boy back to tell Pappa we were heading back, and then 2 things caught my eye.  Well, my parents were heading back with my son, and I pointed them out to my dad.  I asked him could this be what we're supposed to be looking for.  Well, low<br/>
 and behold it was and we found the box.  I laughed and told him after 50 finds I finally figured one out before him!!! =)  If it wasn't for me stopping where I was and just start looking at what others may seem "stupid" little things, we would've found the box.   We like all types, easy to find, some straining your brain power, or to even think outside the box, they are all great to find.  <br/>
