                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to an email from a finder I have had to change the clues to Two <br>
Turtles at Hager Park in Jenison, MI.  If you have the old ones stashed <br>
away for another day..get the new clues.  Seems there has been a kids <br>
fort built almost on top of the hiding place!  Fortunately, it was <br>
still well hidden, but I am sure it would have only been a matter of <br>
time before the poor turtle would have been discovered. He now lives in <br>
another spot...well away from the fort (and hopefully well away from <br>
the kids).<br>
