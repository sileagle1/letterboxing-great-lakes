But we ate the WHOLE way through and had to stop at ALL the wonderful shops.  That BLASTED good food, CURSES on you!!!!  I promise this Sunday, Aug. 3rd, I'm making the utmost effort to control my urges and the calling of that FOOD to find each and every letterbox there, and have tea with the Queen, of course.  =)   Let me know what weekend(s) you would like to do this, and I'll try my best to sneak out of the house, to make it up there.  (I'll tell hubby I have to go to work early.  LOL  Maybe that will work.)  <br/>
