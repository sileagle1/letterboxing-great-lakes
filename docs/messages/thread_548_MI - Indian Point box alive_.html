sleuthing abilities.<br>
<br>
After failing to find this box on not one, but TWO, seperate visits; <br>
I asked Bindle Bum to go with me, in search of this elusive box.<br>
<br>
I didn't want to influence him, so I let him deal with the clues on <br>
his own. Once he surveyed the area, he asked where I had already <br>
looked.  I showed him where I had been mucking around.<br>
<br>
Not even five minutes later, he had the box in hand!<br>
<br>
On one hand, I felt ... YEAH, YIPPIE!!! On the other hand I felt .... <br>
aaarrrrggghhh, I am soooo dumb!! (grin)<br>
<br>
I email Spring Chick to let her know what mistake I had been making. <br>
<br>
I just want all of you to know that the box is alive and, I strongly <br>
suspect, feeling a little smug about being hidden so well that <br>
someone could go TWICE and still miss him. <br>
<br>
ps: I adore the feather embelishments on this logbook, Deb!<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
