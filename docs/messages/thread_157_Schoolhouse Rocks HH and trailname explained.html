--klk/FungusWoman, which BTW refers to the fact that I am a medical<br/>
mycologist....  I work at a VA hospital, and am also involved with the VA's<br/>
infomatics systems, which uses the name MailMan for the email system and<br/>
FileMan for the system's file management routines.  Becoming the FungusWoman<br/>
was only natural!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter's girlfriend made me a nametag in Industrial Arts at school (one<br/>
of those engraved plastic things) that says FungusWoman which I wear on my<br/>
lab coat all the time.  It's funny...I never thought to use it as a camp<br/>
name when we go to GS camp, but here it just fit and I didn't have to think<br/>
twice.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in a nutshell, you just have to call me a Fun Gal...!   (okay, you<br/>
can stop groaning now...)<br/>
