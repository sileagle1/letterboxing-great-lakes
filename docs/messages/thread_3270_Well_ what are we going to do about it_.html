not all bad!  We are very aware and have trained ourselves and our<br/>
children well.  I am a research-a-holic by nature and when I found out<br/>
about letterboxing almost 2 years ago, I read everything I could find on<br/>
it (Yes, I went to both major sites and to Silent Doug's as well). <br/>
There are plenty of families that are here that have the utmost respect<br/>
for the placers, the boxes, etc.  We love letterboxing.  I can honestly<br/>
say I have gone places I would have never gone before (or would have<br/>
cared about).  Thank you to those who make drive-by's AND those long<br/>
hikes (You know who you are, LOL!).  I have to say a big thank you for<br/>
those longer hikes - we had our fall church hike in the Southern Kettle<br/>
Morraine - those 3 miles up and down through there were WAY Easy this<br/>
year because of the letterboxing we have done!  <br/>
<br/>
How many of you have gone by your first find site and mourned its loss<br/>
(to park clean up - it was retrieved by the placers), LOL!  My children<br/>
and I went to our favorite easy place to hike a couple of weeks ago and<br/>
knowing the box was gone, stood and stared at the place where it had lived!<br/>
