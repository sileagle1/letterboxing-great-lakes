clues and in the sign up conditions is reading over the etiquette of <br>
LBing and agreeing to those terms. There is an etiquette page on the <br>
LBNA site, but you as a responsible person have to seek it out. By <br>
doing something like this you would throw it in their faces (they <br>
actually have to press a botton to get rid of it), and some maybe <br>
preturbed because you have to sign in to get clues. Well I don't <br>

We need to work together with the webmasters to assure that this sport/hobby doesn't die at the hands of some weekend family thrill seekers.  One reporter, one family, another reporter, another magazine...we need to get to the root of the problem.  <br>
<br>
<br>
We need to create an "SOB Campaign".....as in who is the SOB who caused another letterbox to go missing?  Maybe an animal, maybe a newbie, maybe an irresponsibly written article published in a magazine or a newspaper.  SOB also stands for SAVE OUR BOXES!!!   <br>
<br>
Starting today, we launch the campaign.  You won't see billboards or TV ads or magazine articles about this campaign.  But it's a movement that we all must promote!   We put so much time and effort into creating boxes.  Clues MUST require more work and thought!  Plain and simple.  We may never be able to put out these media fires as they pop up one after another, but we can do something to protect this sport/hobby by causing the average thrill seeker to work harder to find a box.  More mystery involved.    We are our own best guardians for our letterboxes.  It's come down to survival of the fittest.  <br>

not all bad!  We are very aware and have trained ourselves and our<br>
children well.  I am a research-a-holic by nature and when I found out<br>
about letterboxing almost 2 years ago, I read everything I could find on<br>
it (Yes, I went to both major sites and to Silent Doug's as well). <br>
There are plenty of families that are here that have the utmost respect<br>
for the placers, the boxes, etc.  We love letterboxing.  I can honestly<br>
say I have gone places I would have never gone before (or would have<br>
cared about).  Thank you to those who make drive-by's AND those long<br>
hikes (You know who you are, LOL!).  I have to say a big thank you for<br>
those longer hikes - we had our fall church hike in the Southern Kettle<br>
Morraine - those 3 miles up and down through there were WAY Easy this<br>
year because of the letterboxing we have done!  <br>
<br>
How many of you have gone by your first find site and mourned its loss<br>
(to park clean up - it was retrieved by the placers), LOL!  My children<br>
and I went to our favorite easy place to hike a couple of weeks ago and<br>
knowing the box was gone, stood and stared at the place where it had lived!<br>
