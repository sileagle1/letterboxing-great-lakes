This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

&gt; I found this box last year.  At the time, they had pulled up all <br/>
the markers and it looked like they were redoing them.  I sent an <br/>

The kids and I found the box late last summer.  We realized the <br/>
clues regarding the signposts were no longer accurate since it <br/>
looked like new signage was up, but we were able to find it based on <br/>
the clues relating to natural landmarks.  If we had been brand new <br/>
boxers at that point, I'm not sure if we would have had the mindset <br/>
to look beyond the (now inaccurate)clues--having some experience <br/>
helped us figure out what to do.  I emailed the placer and did get 2 <br/>
responses back.  Said they hadn't had a chance to check the box <br/>
lately because they were in the midst of plannning their wedding.  <br/>
Emailed again to say they were updating the clues to say that they <br/>
were no longer accurate but it was possible to find the clues <br/>
anyway.  Hope the box is still there--the logbook had stamps and <br/>
comments dating back a number of years.<br/>
