                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you to everyone for making yesterday such a wonderful afternoon. <br>
Although we only met many of you last summer at the GLK 2006 gathering, <br>
you are quickly becoming another extended family. We were a bit <br>
overwhelmed by all the warmth and genuine well-wishes we received from <br>
the local letterboxing community. Our expectations for yesterday were <br>
much the same as any other gathering we have attended. However, we got <br>
something a bit different. Rather than just a group of people stamping <br>
in our logbooks and having fun exchanging our little artworks, it seemed <br>
much like our actual wedding engagement party (fun, friendly, and filled <br>
with love). I've posted a few photos from yesterday, and don't worry; <br>
I'll share some photos from the actual big day next spring. Ok, on to <br>
the event.<br>
<br>
People started showing up promptly at noon, and before we knew it, there <br>
were letterboxers EVERYWHERE!!!! There was a wide geographic variety to <br>
our guests. Beachmom and her kids lived only blocks from the park while <br>
Doglvrs, Cherry on Top, and Inky Oiker from MI, Hartx6 from the west <br>
edge of IL, Mrs. Drs. B from IA, the Olsentrio and MM and WI Hiker from <br>
WI, and Tricycle and Grumpy Bear from WA had to travel a bit further. We <br>
were also excited to finally meet some of the newer boxers in our area <br>
such as Questar, Ringmaster (a transplant from upstate NY), RBQ, and <br>
Lock Stock and Barrel. Please check out our group photo on the AQ event <br>
page (http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=381) to see <br>
all of our guests [thank you to everyone for giving me three shots to <br>
take the photo since I had some difficulty working the timer on my <br>
camera] If any of you have pictures, please feel free to upload them to <br>
the album to share with the rest of us.<br>
<br>
The stamps, as usual, were gorgeous. I think everyone had a great time <br>
tracking down all the Registry stamps by Beetle and Fermonts <br>
off-registry Registry Shmegistry stamps (uh, CB what are we going to <br>
do with all these toasters?!!?). Overall, we are counting the day as a <br>
huge success! Thank you to everyone who helped with stamps, food, <br>
supplies, labor and advice. I will also take under advisement all the <br>
keys to marriage that received in particular, the many yes dear and <br>
go letterboxing suggestions. We hope to catch up on all our personal <br>
communications by the end of the week.<br>
<br>
Cool, one event under our belts...hey CB, when are we hosting the next?!<br>

enjoyed talking with many of our "long-time" letterboxing friends and<br>
getting a chance to meet some of the newer boxers that are getting active in<br>
the area.  Food was scrumptious, especially that delicious stew and of<br>
course the Revel Bars!  Also enjoyed the Mexican Wedding Cake cookies - a<br>
perfect choice for the "Wedding" event.<br>
<br>
We spent most of our time yakking, so didn't get a chance to stamp into most<br>
of the wedding-themed boxes.  However we caught a glimpse of some of the<br>
images and they looked fantastic.  We were also able to find the "Lost Dog"<br>
after we left the park.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Atom118 and Coffee beans for hosting a fun gathering and giving us<br>
an excuse to get together with our LB friends AND to wish them well on their<br>
REAL wedding in May!<br>

We had a wonderful time as well, meeting several new boxers and talking  with <br>
others of whom  we have either met before, or it just feels as we knew  each <br>
other all along via the message boards (thanks YAHOO).<br>
 <br>
We found several of FW's boxes yesterday and today and are inching closer  to <br>
the F250 mark (currently 241) and our X count rocketed past the X75 mark and  <br>
we now sit at X83.<br>
 <br>
We look forward to May 3rd, as that is the next date with a gathering we  <br>
will be attending will be (looking forward to all the Dr's B boxes that  weekend).<br>
 <br>
Anyhow, Atom and CB just wanted to let you know that Becki and I ACTUALLY  <br>
received 7 toasters for our wedding... not just stamps, but the real  <br>
put-bread-in-get-toast-out deals!!! We figured we would go into the toast  selling <br>
business and calling our shop, Toast Yur Buns, or Tanning Your Bread or  something <br>
like that.<br>

As I mentioned to the Atomic Beans in a separate message, yesterday <br>
was a more fun than a lot of other weddings I've attended in the <br>
past.  Thanks for sharing your special day with all of us!<br>

I'm really sorry I missed meeting some people I was looking forward <br>
to seeing, but as always, enjoyed seeing old friends and meeting new <br>
ones.  <br>

Can't wait for the next event!<br>

PS:  Dixie Truckers Home (replacement) is now in the hands of Pitties <br>
who is looking for a new hiding place for it.  This time it's a real <br>
letterbox, logbook and all, unlike the first one (magnetic stamp <br>
only).  (Not to put any pressure on you, Pitties, but I happen to <br>
know Petrified Peep Eater is chomping at the bit to find it.  She may <br>
be stalking you to be First Finder...just kidding, but she is <br>
anxious!)<br>

Thanks for the uppercase T! Even though I learned the correct pronunciation in Iowa, I still had it stuck in my head a different way.<br>

<br>
We've been gone for the past two days and were surprised to come back to our computers <br>
and hear about Tonto's day at the wonderful Letterbox Wedding hosted by love birds, <br>
Atom118 and Coffee Beans...So cute!...He certainly did not hate it...Actually, I think his <br>
words were that he really enjoys meeting and greeting other letterboxers at these <br>
doings....the "coloring" part is what he dislikes...OK, he hates it!...But, after a bit more <br>
thought he was overheard saying,...."It sure beats getting poked in the eye with a sharp <br>
stick!"...Whatever!<br>
<br>
At one point during the "wedding" he did whisper to Tiptoe..."Do you think ANYONE here <br>
knows the Illinois/Ohio State score?  Or cares?  A quick scan around the room proved he <br>
might be right..We saw huddling around tables to discuss mystery gatherings, but no talk <br>
of quarterback sneaks.  We saw interceptions, not of a ball, but incognito stamps.  There <br>
were shouts and cheers regarding well-carved stamps, but not over pass completions.  <br>
Photo ops and inteviews with a guy and gal in funny wedding garb, but not with coaches <br>
and star running backs.<br>
<br>
But, he knows the game plan...make Tiptoe happy and all is well with his world! <br>
<br>
 He fought his way through the first quarter of the wedding by eating...a lot!  Second <br>
quarter the game became more interesting as he began to meet new <br>
letterboxers...especially a fellow bench warmer, like himself, the patriarch of the Brat Pack <br>
who shared a same hometown status.  Third quarter, brought him into the game even if it <br>
was only to go for the extra point by getting up his game face and asking Pastor Wife for <br>
her PT...He recited his favorite Bible verse and was able to procure her stamp!  A first score <br>
for him!  But, he made Tiptoe stamp in.  Finishing the game in the fourth quarter led to the <br>
upset of letterboxing history!  So exciting in fact, that we will defer to the play-by-play <br>
transcript by sportscastors Brent Muskberger and Kirk Herbstreit.<br>
<br>
"Kirk, here we are heading into the final few minutes of the game... and what is that we <br>
see down on the field?  Why it can't be!  Yes, I believe we see Tonto coming into the game!  <br>
Is the coach crazy sending in this rookie to stamp into FungusWoman's letterbox <br>
appropriately named..."HIS RED UNDIES"?  He has never inked up before!  Can he do it?<br>
<br>
Next to him at the table Tiptoe coaches him on, "Just do it!," she shouts from the sidelines.    <br>
He appears to be a little apprehensive as if he is trying to recall exactly what he has <br>
witnessed her doing all these years."  <br>
<br>
"Let me interject here Brent.  The stats on this letterboxing couple show that they in fact <br>
have been letterboxing 1,710 days since there debut to this sport...an extra day added for <br>
Leap Year 2004..."<br>
<br>
" Sorry to interupt, but you mean to tell me, Tonto has NEVER inked up ANY stamp in all <br>
that time?"<br>
<br>
"Nope!  Amazing isn't it?...  Oh, wait, I think I see Mr. Cottontail with his camera capturing <br>
this historic moment.  Let's go down to the sidelines and see if we can pick up more on <br>
the action.  Back to you Brent."<br>
<br>
"Kirk, I'm right behind you fighting my way through the stunned fans to see that Fungus <br>
Woman is the first to realize that Tonto has not only stamped into her box, but has added <br>
his signature as well...an alert to Antiques Roadshow....Tiptoe's signature is going to be <br>
worth a dime a dozen...But, Tonto's!  Wow, that could be worth it's weight in PZ-Cut.  It <br>
may be the only one known to exist!"<br>
<br>
"I think we need to call in the paramedics, Tiptoe looks to be a little shook up from that <br>
last play!  Let's see if we can get a few words from her before she heads for the locker <br>
room...."<br>
<br>
Tiptoe, are you all right?"<br>
<br>
"Ohhhh, I'm fine...just a little stunned!  I can't believe it!  I've never seen him ink up a <br>
stamp, let alone sign in!  I've waited how many years for this level of participation from <br>
him?...I knew Tonto had it in him!...I'm glad I didn't give up out on all those trails and <br>
events hoping that someday he'd gain the confidence needed in this sport to grab those <br>
pens and ink pads and kick some..aaa..actual rubber!"<br>
<br>
Kirk, can you get a few words from Tonto...he looks confused as to what to do with that <br>
felt and plastic baggie...I think he's in shock as well...Not sure he even comprehends what <br>
has just transpired...a dream maybe!"<br>
<br>
"Tonto, this has to be the biggest moment of your letterboxing career...Do you think you'll <br>
ever be able to repeat the victory?  Anything you'd like to say to the crowd?"<br>
<br>
"Ahhhh, Does any one know how Illinois is doing?"<br>
<br>
"Brent, he doesn't seem to have a clue to what he has just accoplished.  Tiptoe is now <br>
leading him out the door and it seems that we have just experienced a great moment in <br>
letterboxing history.  The question remains though, if Tonto can continue this level of play <br>
in the future.  For the time being, we'll let them savor today's victory and worry about <br>
future strategies next season."<br>
<br>
There you have it folks!  We'll keep you posted...<br>
<br>
A side note..We have heard that good things happen to those that wait, give of themselves <br>
unselfishly, take risks...or something of that manner...and Tonto was richly rewarded by <br>
an outstanding victory of Illinois over Ohio State!...and he got to see the last quarter of the <br>
game for himself making for a very Happy Tonto...and Happy Tiptoe!<br>
<br>
A very good wedding reception indeed!<br>

Great story!  Loved the play-by-play and we were thrilled to be there to<br>
witness the action in person.  Hope you guys are able to get out boxing a<br>
bit more in the coming year so we can read of your adventures and<br>
misadventures.<br>

I may live in Illinois, but I'm originally from Cleveland ... so though I'll be happy with the Next Iron Chef victory, well ... Illinois over OSU makes Trail Rider happy, and I'll just say "next year!"  I agree with Hartx6 (or is it Hart Times Six?) ... looking forward to a stamp out on the trail carved by Tonto!<br>
