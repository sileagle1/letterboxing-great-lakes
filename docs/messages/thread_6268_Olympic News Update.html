<br/>
When questioned further, Mr. Rogges responded with "no comment", but sources have revealed that Australia, Sweden,  the Bahamas, and possibly Switzerland,  may have violated Olympic rules. Damning evidence can be found at the following;<br/>
<br/>
Sweden: Allegations that Nordic Heroes, Grunhild and Ivor, have relied on "special" food from a beloved Swedish chef,  seen here: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/message/21398<br/>
Now, our sources say that with this supposed broken English and snappy song, this chef has, in the past, has had questionable recipes. As for Grunhild and Ivor, only time will  tell. perhaps they should rely on a more distinguished chef: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwCZbeV96yc<br/>
<br/>
Australia: Apparently, there are some special "AtomicBeans" involved. Australia, of course, have denied all allegations, yet, we question these "so called" beans and their "magical" powers. I guess down under means just that. You be the judge: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/message/21398<br/>
<br/>
Which,  leads us to the Bahamas. It has long been suspected that these Rastafarian's have indulged in "herbal brownies" and such, but apparently there's more. Upon investigation, we have found that their body weight appears to be extremely low, as proven in their self proclaimed dance video (seen here at: http://bahamachampions.homestead.com) Champions? we question you on that. What? with all that, ya mon, non-distinguishable language of theirs...who really understands them anyway?<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, there has been some speculation with Switzerland as they have been requested a place to purchase thermal lederhosen. Why? What are you hiding?<br/>
<br/>
So, we question you. Only your urine tests will set you free. Thank goodness that other countries have stayed honest. God Save the Queen with the British!<br/>
<br/>
So, prove yourselves! We, of course, have suspected doping all along! In the meanwhile, we shall keep you posted with updates. <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; When questioned further, Mr. Rogges responded with "no comment", but sources<br/>
&gt; have revealed that Australia, Sweden, the Bahamas, and possibly Switzerland,<br/>
&gt; may have violated Olympic rules. Damning evidence can be found at the<br/>
&gt; following;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sweden: Allegations that Nordic Heroes, Grunhild and Ivor, have relied on<br/>
&gt; "special" food from a beloved Swedish chef, seen here:<br/>
&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/message/21398<br/>
&gt; Now, our sources say that with this supposed broken English and snappy song,<br/>
&gt; this chef has, in the past, has had questionable recipes. As for Grunhild<br/>
&gt; and Ivor, only time will tell. perhaps they should rely on a more<br/>
&gt; distinguished chef: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwCZbeV96yc<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Australia: Apparently, there are some special "AtomicBeans" involved.<br/>
&gt; Australia, of course, have denied all allegations, yet, we question these<br/>
&gt; "so called" beans and their "magical" powers. I guess down under means just<br/>
&gt; that. You be the judge: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/message/21398<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Which, leads us to the Bahamas. It has long been suspected that these<br/>
&gt; Rastafarian's have indulged in "herbal brownies" and such, but apparently<br/>
&gt; there's more. Upon investigation, we have found that their body weight<br/>
&gt; appears to be extremely low, as proven in their self proclaimed dance video<br/>
&gt; (seen here at: http://bahamachampions.homestead.com) Champions? we question<br/>
&gt; you on that. What? with all that, ya mon, non-distinguishable language of<br/>
&gt; theirs...who really understands them anyway?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Furthermore, there has been some speculation with Switzerland as they have<br/>
&gt; been requested a place to purchase thermal lederhosen. Why? What are you<br/>
&gt; hiding?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, we question you. Only your urine tests will set you free. Thank goodness<br/>
&gt; that other countries have stayed honest. God Save the Queen with the<br/>
&gt; British!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, prove yourselves! We, of course, have suspected doping all along! In the<br/>
&gt; meanwhile, we shall keep you posted with updates. <br/>

G'day mates. We understand there is some rumors about the special <br/>
atomic beans mentioned last week. Most of you are not from down under, <br/>
so we wanted to provide some clarification on these beans, roasted by <br/>
our nearby mates in NZ:<br/>
http://www.atomiccoffee.co.nz/atomic.asp<br/>
<br/>
Certainly NOT to be confused with the following craze apparently <br/>
spreading across our homeland:<br/>
http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/248402/coffee_made_from_catexcreted<br/>

Hope this clears up any confusion -- us Aussies aren't the cheatin' kind!<br/>

these charges are unfounded and worthy competitors will be vindicated. <br/>

Methinks that your second story holds much more credibility and that you Aussies are relying on such 'reheated' beans for that exta 'boost' you need to get going!  Still, that might represent a violation of the doping regulations but we can't find a specific reference to that particular category of drugs....so, you might be safe!<br/>
As for the USA team workout, we took particular interest in the fact that the skis finished ahead of the skier!!!!  Just how would that be judged?  We are particularly interested because our only Winter Olympics medal to date is in Alpine Skiing.....<br/>

Well this lone Finlander has been staying quiet and sizing up the competition. Here are some interesting facts about Finns.<br/>
<br/>
1. Finns consume more coffee than any other country. (Not that type from down under.)  <br/>
<br/>
2. Finns hold interesting competitions on a yearly basis which include: A wife carring championship, A cell phone throwing contest, an Ant nest sitting contest, an ice swimming contest, Mosquito squatting championship, A finnish cattle rolling championship, A milking stool throwing championship,a swamp soccer championship and a Topless winter jogging race. I wonder if any of these will be olympic events...<br/>
<br/>
3. Like the Swedes, Finns enjoy their sauna (sow-nah.)  In fact, it is estimated that there are 1.6 sauna's for every Finlander. <br/>
<br/>
4. We have Sisu! <br/>

Well this lone Finlander has been staying quiet and sizing up the competition. Here are some interesting facts about Finns.<br/>
<br/>
1. Finns consume more coffee than any other country. (Not that type from down under.) <br/>
<br/>
2. Finns hold interesting competitions on a yearly basis which include: A wife carring championship, A cell phone throwing contest, an Ant nest sitting contest, an ice swimming contest, Mosquito squatting championship, A finnish cattle rolling championship, A milking stool throwing championship, a swamp soccer championship and a Topless winter jogging race. I wonder if any of these will be olympic events...<br/>
<br/>
3. Like the Swedes, Finns enjoy their sauna (sow-nah.) In fact, it is estimated that there are 1.6 sauna's for every Finlander. <br/>
<br/>
4. We have Sisu! <br/>
