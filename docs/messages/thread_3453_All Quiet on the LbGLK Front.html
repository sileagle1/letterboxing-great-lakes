Well, we just got home for our hiking club's Holiday Banquet. Now I'll fill<br/>
a few patch orders, try to get our Bingo Booty items ready and we're getting<br/>
some maps &amp; clues ready for a boxing weekend.  (Yeah, gift shopping &amp;<br/>
wrapping will be a lower priority - the weather is so great it would be a<br/>
shame not to be out there boxing!)<br/>

How about you?<br/>

Making Christmas presents!  Tonight I made a "perpetual calendar" <br/>
that you use to write down anniversaries, birthdays, etc.  It's good <br/>
forever, so you don't have to keep transferring the dates to <br/>
different calendars each year.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I made three decorated drop-spine boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Over the weekend, I made a ton of greeting cards and a few small <br/>
photo albums.  The week before, I made 2 bigger albums and a few note pads.<br/>
<br/>
I have one more calendar to make and then I'm done!  I've about <br/>
paper-crafted myself to death, though!<br/>
<br/>
I have not done any letterboxing related activities in 2 weeks!!<br/>

Welcome to the group!<br/>
<br/>
You can get info on the upcoming BINGO game by checking out the Files <br/>
section of this message board.  There are 3 files to look at:  <br/>
Instructions, Word List and BINGO Card.<br/>
<br/>
It's not too late to join in the fun if you're interested, but <br/>
your "booty" prize and BINGO card entry need to be sent to SpringChick <br/>
soon!<br/>

you thought there were no boxes in the South Suburbs.  I did another <br/>
search starting with Oak Lawn, and came up with 96 results within 25 <br/>
miles of that.  So while there may not be any letterboxes in your <br/>
backyard (I have the same problem here in NW Indiana), there are <br/>
plenty within a reasonable distance of you.  Of course, this is <br/>
coming from someone who drives 25-30 miles to work everyday, so maybe <br/>
my perspective is a little skewed. :)<br/>

Anyway, wanted to add to the I-Pod chatter.  We loved ours.  loved <br/>
being the key word.  I bought mr. spartanfans the special edition U2 <br/>
ipod with the entire U2 library (it was not cheap).  and our computer <br/>
got a virus which I think transferred over to the ipod and now we have <br/>
nothing.  Of course the 1-year warranty wass up and the virus on our <br/>
computer deleted our entire library on i-tunes, so now we have nothing.<br/>
We have the car accessory that lets you play the radio/ipod through <br/>
the dc outlet and also the docking station.  I can't really comment <br/>
about the earphones as Mr. spartanfans took the ipod with him to work <br/>
everyday.  <br/>

Oh by the way, the baby is being STUBBORN!!!   I've been on bedrest up til last week and it drove me crazy!!! The doc said I was still dilated to 2.  In my frustration, I decided to do housecleaning to see if that would "help" my condition along.  I scrubbed the bathroom, cleaned the kids' rooms, did laundry, ran up and down the stairs for stuff, until I was exhausted.  I thought Thursday I  was ready.....would you believe nothing changed and all I got out of it was sore muscles!?!?!?!?  Hubby says he hears all the other kids getting into trouble, he's back paddling to stay in as long as he can.  I even tried to "persuade" hubby in helping out, but either he's not doing it right, or it's just not working either.  LOL  I don't know about this baby, of course it's a boy, so that's why he's being stubborn!  =)    Well, he's healthy and that's all that matters, but I would hate to be in the hospital for Christmas.  I'm going to have to convince my parents and my mother in-law to bring <br/>
me up some Christmas goodies if I do.   <br/>
<br/>
I'll be sending out my Bingo stuff this week.  I need to run to the craft store for some Christmas projects for my daughter, and will get everything then.  Being cooped up in a house I miss the outside world.  I'm starting to try letterboxing in the house...now where did I put the inkpad.  LOL  I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas!! (HUGS)  <br/>

This is listed under www.letterboxing.org    It's considered Midlothian, but it runs so close to Crestwood.  =)<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I found a couple in Palos that are relatively<br/>
close by. Do you have or know where I can find clues<br/>
to those in Crestwood?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

&gt; There is I believe 2 in Crestwood that isn't too far<br/>
&gt; from you, and I know there are a few in Palos. (I<br/>
&gt; live in Alsip.) Also, Brookfield area has TONS of<br/>
&gt; them that are really nice as well. Our family, this<br/>
&gt; past summer, would print out a list of them in a<br/>
&gt; certain area and go out hunting all day! =) It is<br/>
&gt; lots of fun! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh by the way, the baby is being STUBBORN!!! I've<br/>
&gt; been on bedrest up til last week and it drove me<br/>
&gt; crazy!!! The doc said I was still dilated to 2. In<br/>
&gt; my frustration, I decided to do housecleaning to see<br/>
&gt; if that would "help" my condition along. I scrubbed<br/>
&gt; the bathroom, cleaned the kids' rooms, did laundry,<br/>
&gt; ran up and down the stairs for stuff, until I was<br/>
&gt; exhausted. I thought Thursday I was<br/>
&gt; ready.....would you believe nothing changed and all<br/>
&gt; I got out of it was sore muscles!?!?!?!? Hubby says<br/>
&gt; he hears all the other kids getting into trouble,<br/>
&gt; he's back paddling to stay in as long as he can. I<br/>
&gt; even tried to "persuade" hubby in helping out, but<br/>
&gt; either he's not doing it right, or it's just not<br/>
&gt; working either. LOL I don't know about this baby,<br/>
&gt; of course it's a boy, so that's why he's being<br/>
&gt; stubborn! =) Well, he's healthy and that's all<br/>
&gt; that matters, but I would hate to be in the hospital<br/>
&gt; for Christmas. I'm going to have to convince my<br/>
&gt; parents and my mother in-law to bring <br/>
&gt; me up some Christmas goodies if I do. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll be sending out my Bingo stuff this week. I<br/>
&gt; need to run to the craft store for some Christmas<br/>
&gt; projects for my daughter, and will get everything<br/>
&gt; then. Being cooped up in a house I miss the outside<br/>
&gt; world. I'm starting to try letterboxing in the<br/>
&gt; house...now where did I put the inkpad. LOL I hope<br/>
&gt; you all have a wonderful Christmas!! (HUGS) <br/>

&gt; &gt; I don't know what you consider very little. I work<br/>
&gt; &gt; in South Holland, <br/>
&gt; &gt; so I did a search on Atlas Quest, and there are 57<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes listed <br/>
&gt; &gt; within 25 miles of South Holland. That seems like<br/>

Hello -<br/>
<br/>
I'm the newbie here! The list of letterboxes at<br/>
letterbox.org - is that the main list?<br/>
<br/>
There is very slim pickins' here in southwest suburban<br/>
chicago where I am. Wish there were more nearby. <br/>
After I get experienced in this, I'll be making my own<br/>
boxes.<br/>

&gt; Yesterday we had our dept Christmas luncheon. It was<br/>
&gt; so much fun. First we had a bingo <br/>
&gt; game, where each square was a "clue" that referred<br/>
&gt; to a person, and you had to walk <br/>
&gt; around asking people questions ot see if the clues<br/>
&gt; applied to them -- like "Did you used <br/>
&gt; to ride with the Hell's Angels?" or "Did you used ot<br/>
&gt; play professional hockey?" I was late so <br/>
&gt; no one got my clue right. Then after lunch we had<br/>
&gt; Christmas Mad Libs. Each table had a <br/>
&gt; Christmas story and had filled it in, and one of the<br/>
&gt; table residents had to stand and read it <br/>
&gt; aloud. Oh there was a LOT of howling laughter at<br/>
&gt; what we came up with!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I came late and left earlier than anyone else -- I<br/>
&gt; am so so swamped at work. We are doing <br/>
&gt; a math program for Texas and everything has to go<br/>
&gt; out in less than a month. And then we <br/>
&gt; have 3 weeks to make changes and send it out for<br/>
&gt; California. I am doing the Teacher's <br/>
&gt; Edition, and they keep making design changes and<br/>
&gt; rewriting parts, so I am REALLY <br/>
&gt; swamped.<br/>

&gt; &gt; some maps &amp; clues ready for a boxing weekend. <br/>
&gt; (Yeah, gift shopping &amp;<br/>
&gt; &gt; wrapping will be a lower priority - the weather is<br/>
&gt; so great it would be a<br/>
