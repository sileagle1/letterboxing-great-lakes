Well, we just got home for our hiking club's Holiday Banquet. Now I'll fill<br>
a few patch orders, try to get our Bingo Booty items ready and we're getting<br>
some maps & clues ready for a boxing weekend.  (Yeah, gift shopping &<br>
wrapping will be a lower priority - the weather is so great it would be a<br>
shame not to be out there boxing!)<br>
<br>
How about you?<br>

Making Christmas presents!  Tonight I made a "perpetual calendar" <br>
that you use to write down anniversaries, birthdays, etc.  It's good <br>
forever, so you don't have to keep transferring the dates to <br>
different calendars each year.<br>
<br>
Last night I made three decorated drop-spine boxes.<br>
<br>
Over the weekend, I made a ton of greeting cards and a few small <br>
photo albums.  The week before, I made 2 bigger albums and a few note pads.<br>
<br>
I have one more calendar to make and then I'm done!  I've about <br>
paper-crafted myself to death, though!<br>
<br>
I have not done any letterboxing related activities in 2 weeks!!<br>

Welcome to the group!<br>
<br>
You can get info on the upcoming BINGO game by checking out the Files <br>

Instructions, Word List and BINGO Card.<br>
<br>
It's not too late to join in the fun if you're interested, but <br>
your "booty" prize and BINGO card entry need to be sent to SpringChick <br>

I was actually meaning around my neighborhood.  For<br>
instance, in the Oak Lawn/Evergreen Park/Mt.<br>
Greenwood/Burbank/Beverly/Merrionette<br>
Park/Hometown/Bridgeview/Chicago Ridge areas which is<br>
close to where I live, there are no boxes.<br>

plenty within a reasonable distance of you.  Of course, this is <br>
coming from someone who drives 25-30 miles to work everyday, so maybe <br>
my perspective is a little skewed. :)<br>

He can now say puke.<br>

Anyway, wanted to add to the I-Pod chatter.  We loved ours.  loved <br>
being the key word.  I bought mr. spartanfans the special edition U2 <br>
ipod with the entire U2 library (it was not cheap).  and our computer <br>
got a virus which I think transferred over to the ipod and now we have <br>
nothing.  Of course the 1-year warranty wass up and the virus on our <br>
computer deleted our entire library on i-tunes, so now we have nothing.<br>
We have the car accessory that lets you play the radio/ipod through <br>
the dc outlet and also the docking station.  I can't really comment <br>
about the earphones as Mr. spartanfans took the ipod with him to work <br>
everyday.  <br>

Hello -<br>
<br>
I'm the newbie here! The list of letterboxes at<br>
letterbox.org - is that the main list?<br>
<br>
There is very slim pickins' here in southwest suburban<br>
chicago where I am. Wish there were more nearby. <br>
After I get experienced in this, I'll be making my own<br>
boxes.<br>
