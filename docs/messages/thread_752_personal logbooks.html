You know, the more I think about it, the more I think I want my mom to make that for me...I'm sure she doesn't have anything better to do that be my test case for new letterboxing obsessions....<br>

Care to try that one for all of us and see how it turns out?  It could become quite a little cottage industry for you.  I think THAT would be the most unique logbook I'd ever seen!<BR><br>

Hmmmm....  I might have to give this some consideration, anyone have any recommendations for stamping onto fabric (no, dummy!  you have too many planned and unfinished quilt projects as it is!!)  Seriously though, I'm not sure how you would go about getting the stamp image onto the fabric.  Maybe scan the images (not that my scanner works anyway) and use printable transfer pages?  I certainly can't imagine tromping through the woods and trying to be discreet while thoroughly cleaning off stamps to use fabric-safe ink on little squares of fabric.  I wonder if pigment-based ink works on fabric (and how easily it washes out)?   <br>
