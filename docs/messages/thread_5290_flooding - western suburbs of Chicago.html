I can't remember the last time I have seen the water this high!  Today, <br>
as we were driving (and altering our route to deal with all the roads <br>
that are closed), we saw a man standing on his street (right by the <br>
zoo) with a fishing pole.  Hope there weren't any letterboxes to snag.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, I was driving through those western suburbs of Chicago and the rivers are almost to the top of the underside of the bridges over the river.  Tree trunks aren't visible and the leaves and branches are dragging in the water.  In addition to the devastating clean up problems facing the homeowners, my thoughts were also of letterboxes that might be floating down the river.  When we hide a box, none of think that the water level would rise 8-12 feet.  But it has!  <br>
<br>
And in addition to the 6-10 inches of rain we got Saturday through Sunday, the weathermen are still forecasting more light showers tonight and through Monday. <br>
Good day to stay inside and....carve new stamps for new boxes.  <br>

No big news here, but we've had some serious flooding in my area (just a<br>
couple blocks from my house is the convergence of Salt Creek into the<br>
DesPlaines). Many roads are closed (don't try going to Brookfield Zoo - you<br>
won't get through). I wouldn't recommend trying for any boxes in the<br>
vicinity of Salt Creek or the DesPlaines. With all the standing water...it<br>
isn't safe (both from the point of pollution and just plain slippery mud).<br>

Unfortunately, it may be a good day to recarve the stamps of boxes <br>
floating down the DesPlaines River  :~(    We have one box that has <br>
always been high enough in previous floods, but perhaps not this one.<br>
<br>
  We are finding it challenging to find a road open over the river--and <br>
both the kids' schools are on the other side of the river.  I don't <br>
think they are going to get a flood day though!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On Sunday, we were driving west on Touhy, but we were redirected around flooded areas.  We were able to cross over the Des Plaines River at Dempster Avenue.  We had no idea how the water was affecting the communities south of us.  Something is seriously wrong with the infrastructure if there is this much flooding and water in basements after two days of rain.  Deep Tunnel - that certainly turned out to be a joke.   <br>
