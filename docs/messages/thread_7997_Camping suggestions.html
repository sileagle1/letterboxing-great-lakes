Ideally, I would love to find another place like Maquoketa that has walk to/hike to sites since I find the drive  in sites of most campgrounds to be inauthentic and lacking in privacy, but I don't want to go so primitive that showers are not on site.

I forget exactly.) from our Great Lake Gathering a few years back. I can't remember precisely about showers, but if there aren't any at the campground I am sure they have them at the pool at another part of the park. It isn't a very large park, but it is letterbox-packed!<div>
