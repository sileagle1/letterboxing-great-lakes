<br/>
Sorry, I can't make the 10th anniversary meet up in Door County this <br/>
year.  I have a quality audit that Thursday and Friday, and I won't <br/>
have time to make the trek up there for one day. :(  Sure sounds like <br/>
fun though!  I had a blast a few weeks ago with the Milwaukee mini-<br/>
meet when Front Range Hiker came into town.  Met some wonderful <br/>
people and learned a ton.<br/>
<br/>
Count me in if you still do your mini meet in February.  If the <br/>
invite is still there, I'd love to come!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great holiday!<br/>

<br/>
Martini Man &amp; I have each created a box and I've got 6 other boxes from<br/>
"guest carvers" so far.  I'll probably have 3-4 more boxes by next weekend.<br/>
So those of you attending the event will have a chance to find some stamps<br/>
created by people in various places in the USA - all commemorating something<br/>
unique about Wisconsin.<br/>
