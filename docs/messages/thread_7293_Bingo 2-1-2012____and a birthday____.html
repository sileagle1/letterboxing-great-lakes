I want to thank EVERYONE who wished me well through cards (the mailman is definitely wondering who "Tiptoe" is  - hehehehe), the email cards and email greetings!  You are the BEST community, and you sure know how to make an ol' gal not feel so bad about the new decade she is facing!<br/>
<br/>
Tonto shared with the family at dinner tonight 60 wonderful memories we have shared together since we were married...which btw... was a hundred years ago!  Everyone started laughing at how many of them revolved around letterboxing or letterboxers!  <br/>
<br/>
You are counted as being very much a part of our joy!  Thanks so much for all of the happy memories. May we have many more healthy birthdays and tons more letterboxing adventures with all of you!<br/>
Tiptoe<br/>
PS...Now if a certain BINGO man would be so kind as to call some general terms maybe Tonto and I will not see our shadow tomorrow and have to go back to that sleepy hole!<br/>
