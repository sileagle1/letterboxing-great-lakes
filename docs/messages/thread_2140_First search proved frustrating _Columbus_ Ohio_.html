                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all.  I just went on my first letterboxing quest and was sorely<br/>
disappointed.  All 3 boxes were supposedly in Antrim park in Columbus,<br/>
Ohio.  The clue titles were "Antrim Animals" and Firstbox by<br/>
OneFishTwoFish, if anyone's familiar with them.  One of the boxes I<br/>
couldn't even find the intended location because the path it was<br/>
supposed to be on was too overgrown.  The other two, I clearly found<br/>
the location where they were supposed to be.  However, thorough<br/>
looking on my part revealed nothing.  Does anyone on here find that<br/>
boxes get moved quite a bit, or am I just doing something wrong in my<br/>
searching?  I thought I was pretty thorough.<br/>

The good news is you will learn something from this experience.  I just<br/>
did a quick clue search for the Antrim boxes.  Hmmm. This box was placed<br/>
in 2003.  While that isn't ancient history, it doesn't take a lot of time<br/>
for terrain and nature to change.  If the box hasn't been checked by the<br/>
placer in a while, he/she may not be aware of these natural changes. <br/>
Animals could have moved them.  Were any of the locations near water? <br/>
Maybe washed away?  I'm suggesting there are a number of reasons why<br/>
someone might not find a particular box.  If you haven't noticed, some<br/>
boxes will indicate the last date found and status.  I haven't searched<br/>
for these boxes, so I cannot speak with any authority about them.  I would<br/>
just suggest trying another box.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Well, one of the boxes was placed near a waterbed.  And yes, in two<br/>
years, it could have washed away.<br/>
<br/>
I am planning on placing my own box tomorrow.  The location is less<br/>
than 10 minutes from my house, so I plan to check on it regularly.<br/>

FirstBox is there or was there that same weekend (same weekend as your <br/>
post); so, you may want to try again.  Also, we found Antrim Animals Box 1 the <br/>
first week of January but have been unable to locate Box 2 and we plan to <br/>
continue searching in the spot we are confident of.  In case you also tried <br/>
Griggs Reservoir--this box had taken in some water and had to be renovated <br/>
and so was not on location for about a week in early January, but it was <br/>
returned to its location a week later.  <br/>
