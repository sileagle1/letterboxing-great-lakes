<br>
Horror of horrors, the beloved Mother of rhymes, along with her <br>
flying goose, has been found dead in the vicinity of Gun Lake, near <br>
Middleville, MI.  Preliminary investigation at the scene indicates <br>
the body was moved to this location from the original location of <br>
the crime.  Detectives S. Chick and A. Zobox have been called in <br>
from regional offices to help investigate and they are asking the MI <br>
letterboxing community for assistance in solving this case...<br>
<br>
If you think you may have any ideas or information regarding <br>
possible suspects, the murder weapon or actual location of the <br>
crime, please do not hesitate to submit all possible leads in the <br>
form of a rubber stamp carving.<br>
<br>
A meeting of detectives and arm-chair mystery solvers has been set <br>
for Saturday, October 22, 2005 at 11:00 a.m. at the Picnic Shelter <br>
located at the Yankee Springs Recreation Area to review the list of <br>
suspects.  At that time, we are hoping to successfully identify the <br>
guilty character, the murder weapon and pinpoint the actual location <br>
of the crime.<br>
<br>
Respectfully,<br>
<br>
