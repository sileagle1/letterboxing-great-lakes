They were used for last year's fundraiser, so now there are only 29 left.  Given the number of people going to the SILO gathering, that doesn't seem like that many! :-)<br>
<br>
As for the Girl Scouts doing some fundraising or contributing as families, I think that's a great idea!  Please let me know how many plan to do this so I can reserve some patches for you.  If anyone wants to send in donations for patches prior to the gathering, you can do that too and then get the stamp at the gather.  I'll send out the patches as I get the donations in.  I hope I have enough! <br>
<br>
The K9vest fundraiser will go till around July or when we get the funds we need.  Any excess funds we raise will be applied toward the purchase of a new Police K9 dog for the Kent OH dept. who recently lost their K9 and don't have the funds to replace him.  A new K9 can cost between $8,000 and $10,000!  I'm going to try to get other Dog Scout troops and members involved in that fundraiser this year. The K9 dog fund will go till we raise enough funds.  Perhaps I'll design a patch for that too :-)<br>

<br>
<br>
  Speaking of patches, have we got an offer for you!<br>
<br>
  You may recall that Scoutdogs is participating in a fundraiser with her Dog Scouts troop to raise money to purchase a bullet-proof police dog vest the same day. She has also graciously carved a special stamp which will be available at the S.I.L.O. if you make a donation (any size graciously and gratefully accepted) to the cause. However, anyone who makes a donation of $20 or more can receive a patch (I posted a copy of it in SD's photo album if you'd like to see it). I will not have the patches with me, but make sure you give me your address (unless you write a check and it's printed there). I will forward them to her (along with the donations) and she will mail them out. <br>
<br>
  A link to her website with a photo of Amigo, the recipient of the vest: www.DogScoutTroop107.com<br>

  SD, would you like to say anything more??<br>

  I think you did a great job of explaining it. Only thing I would add is that there is a limited number of patches left. They were used for last year's fundraiser, so now there are only 29 left. Given the number of people going to the SILO gathering, that doesn't seem like that many! :-)<br>

  The K9vest fundraiser will go till around July or when we get the funds we need. Any excess funds we raise will be applied toward the purchase of a new Police K9 dog for the Kent OH dept. who recently lost their K9 and don't have the funds to replace him. A new K9 can cost between $8,000 and $10,000! I'm going to try to get other Dog Scout troops and members involved in that fundraiser this year. The K9 dog fund will go till we raise enough funds.

And I probably should warn my family and the local volunteer fire department who I know won't be happy to know that they may be called out for another house fire. I'm a great outdoor camp cook. Give me a Dutch oven, an open campfire, even a cardboard box oven covered in aluminum foil and I can cook up a banquet. But get me in the kitchen and there's always accidents. I really should gut that room and turn it into a large craft room! So with the money I'm saving by not eating out once this week, the money can be donated to this worth K9vest cause. Join me! One less meal out, a few less Starbucks coffees, a small donation to help the police and their dogs who are always there to help us when needed. I think this is a great project! <br>
  Letterboxers are special people - they have big hearts!!!<br>
<br>
  See everyone at the S.I.L.O. on Feb. 17.<br>

  I think you did a great job of explaining it. Only thing I would add is that there is a limited number of patches left. They were used for last year's fundraiser, so now there are only 29 left. Given the number of people going to the SILO gathering, that doesn't seem like that many! :-)<br>
<br>
  As for the Girl Scouts doing some fundraising or contributing as families, I think that's a great idea! Please let me know how many plan to do this so I can reserve some patches for you. If anyone wants to send in donations for patches prior to the gathering, you can do that too and then get the stamp at the gather. I'll send out the patches as I get the donations in. I hope I have enough! <br>
<br>
  The K9vest fundraiser will go till around July or when we get the funds we need. Any excess funds we raise will be applied toward the purchase of a new Police K9 dog for the Kent OH dept. who recently lost their K9 and don't have the funds to replace him. A new K9 can cost between $8,000 and $10,000! I'm going to try to get other Dog Scout troops and members involved in that fundraiser this year. The K9 dog fund will go till we raise enough funds. Perhaps I'll design a patch for that too :-)<br>

<br>
  Speaking of patches, have we got an offer for you!<br>
<br>
  You may recall that Scoutdogs is participating in a fundraiser with her Dog Scouts troop to raise money to purchase a bullet-proof police dog vest the same day. She has also graciously carved a special stamp which will be available at the S.I.L.O. if you make a donation (any size graciously and gratefully accepted) to the cause. However, anyone who makes a donation of $20 or more can receive a patch (I posted a copy of it in SD's photo album if you'd like to see it). I will not have the patches with me, but make sure you give me your address (unless you write a check and it's printed there). I will forward them to her (along with the donations) and she will mail them out. <br>
<br>

  SD, would you like to say anything more??<br>

  I still use that old stuff called cash. Fungus Woman and I will mail you a money order or a check for the donations collected at the S.I.L.O. event, plus a list of names of people donating $20.00...or more. <br>
<br>
  This is a good project! <br>

  Thank you Beetle and I hope the cooking goes well :-) If it doesn't get boiled or microwaved, it doesn't get cooked in this house. So I understand your perspective LOL<br>
<br>
  I've put a patch in an envelope with your name on it :-) Be sure to put "Beetle" somewhere on the check/note you send me. LOL<br>

  Re: K9 Vests --- I've decided to make a donation with money that I would have spent to eat out one night this week. I am planning to make the extreme sacrifice and 'try' to cook a meal at home this week. ROFLOL!!! Yes, I CAN cook; but it's not something I do on a regular basis. And I probably should warn my family and the local volunteer fire department who I know won't be happy to know that they may be called out for another house fire. I'm a great outdoor camp cook. Give me a Dutch oven, an open campfire, even a cardboard box oven covered in aluminum foil and I can cook up a banquet. But get me in the kitchen and there's always accidents.
