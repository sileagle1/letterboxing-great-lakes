<br/>
<br/>
As of 8/21 5:30 pm PDT: The system failure that was causing message <br/>
delivery delays has been corrected. While our engineers have <br/>
identified and corrected the root cause of this issue on the Yahoo! <br/>
Groups side, you may still continue to receive messages from your ISP <br/>
over the next few days. We appreciate your patience as we worked <br/>
toward resolution and are sincerely sorry for any inconvenience this <br/>
has caused. We've taken measures to avoid a recurrence of this issue <br/>
in the future.<br/>
<br/>
