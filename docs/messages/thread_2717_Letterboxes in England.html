My letterboxing friend and her husband are leaving for England in a week.  She would very much like to find some British letterboxes while there.  Anyone know where on the internet she can go to find clues?<br>

It seems that boxes are pretty much confined to the Dartmoor area, where letterboxing originated.  I've heard of a few in the North York Moors, but none in the Yorkshire Dales (where I usually stay).    Do you know where your friends are going to be traveling in England?<br>
<br>
Letterboxing seems to be much more popular here in America than it is in England.<br>
<br>
If anyone knows of letterboxes in the Yorkshire Dales area, I'd be interested!<br>
