                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're up in Pugnasties & Papeseed territory this weekend, planning to do some boxes with our bikes. Meandered our way up to Green Bay today. It was HOT HOT!!  We did not do any long hikes, but instead did several short walks and drive-bys.  If anyone is heading through Appleton, be sure to look for any and all of the Cheekee Monkey boxes.  Although they are in very public spots which makes it a challenge to retrieve/replace, they are EXCELLENT carvings.<br>
<br>
I think Dragon and the Leapin'Lizards are (or recently were) visiting the northeast regions of WI.  Perhaps we'll run into them in Door County tomorrow???<br>

P.S.  We met your sister-in-law this morning and had a HUGE breakfast at her place. Everything was delicious and we appreciated the VERY appropriate HH that Dragon left in the box a few days ago.<br>
