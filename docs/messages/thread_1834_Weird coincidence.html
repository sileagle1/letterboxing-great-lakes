This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

When we checked it out, the stump it had been hidden in had been ripped apart by either a bear or a racoon.  By the amount of damage to the stump our guess is a bear.  The funny part was that every passer-by then took the opportunity to write in the logbook and put the letterbox back on the ground next to the trail until SpringChick came by and re-hid the box.  Thanks to SpringChick's email, we hid it further off-trail; but am considering adding a sheet of Bounce to the box.  They claim to deter mice, maybe it works for bigger critters. <br/>

On our eastern U.P. weekend a couple weeks ago, we found 3 of the boxes just laying out in the open alongside the trail/tree also.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Weird is right.  Prior to this summer, I've never found a box "out<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the open" like that ... nor had a box report from another boxer<br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt; reported finding a box left out like that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; However, this summer I personally have found 2 of my boxes simply<br/>
&gt;left<br/>
&gt; &gt; "out in the open" (these boxes are along a trail that I frequently<br/>
&gt; &gt; ride my bike along) plus 3 belonging to other boxers AND also I've<br/>
&gt; &gt; gotten reports from 2 finders that they found my boxes out and open<br/>
&gt; &gt; like you describe.  (One finder did a re-hide, the other simply<br/>
&gt;left<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box out and sent me a note .. yikes!) BTW - these are all MICH<br/>
&gt;boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course the ones I ride by are 'local' but the 2 that I<br/>
&gt;got 'contact<br/>
&gt; &gt; the placer' notes on where NOT local at all. One was up the Lake<br/>
&gt; &gt; Michigan coast and the other was over near Newago/White Cloud.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not sure what's going on. Wondering if either non-boxers are<br/>
&gt;finding<br/>
&gt; &gt; them by accident and not taking time to read the "about boxing"<br/>
&gt;forms<br/>
&gt; &gt; I leave inside or perhaps there are some new boxers who don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand the concept of putting the box back where it was found.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone else have this sort of problem with their boxes?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a very odd, but very happy, coincidence.  Yesterday I<br/>
&gt;went to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; check on a box that I placed in early June.  I found it totally<br/>
&gt;out in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the open - the logbook was outside of the baggie, and I found a<br/>
&gt;page<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from the logbook sitting on the ground several feet away.  But<br/>
&gt;here's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the good part: the stray page was from the day before, and the<br/>
&gt;logbook<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was dry.  Apparently whatever had disturbed my box had happened<br/>
&gt;in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; last 24 hours, so I had the chance to put it all back together<br/>
&gt;before<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it got rained on, or worse.  And the strangest part is that<br/>
&gt;until about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 minutes before I went there, it wasn't on my agenda for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; afternoon!<br/>
