There were some great stamps and the hikes were excellent. Pokagon had much to offer (especially with mosqiotos and poison ivy!) It was great.<br>
<br>
DAY 1 (Friday)<br>
We arrived to pitch the tent and had to watch the kids carefully (since the mosquitos were ferocious! In fact, I think I saw some flying away with a dog!!!) Aftre setting up, we headed across Lake James to Acapulco for Mexican food and then to Tom's Donuts for old fashioned donuts ordered at a take-out window. (If you get back ion the area, you should definitely go!)MMMmmmmm....Back to the campsite and we met Spartnfans and Hicks from the Sticks and drove them to the pre-greet. Anyhow, a big thank you to Atom 118 and Coffeebeans for hosting the pre-greet at their site. Plus, we did some exchanges.<br>
<br>
DAY 2 (Saturday)<br>
We arrived at the Apple Orchard shelter and within minutes our kids had found all of the hidden "egg" boxes in the trees. We didn't even know they were there but that's what you get when you have kids that climb trees. Anyhow, it appeared that everyone was heading fro the first trail near the nature center. We decided on the other starting near the gate house and discovered Mr. Boston Terrorists at Green, Yoda Is and passed him at the next box, to which we found the next six boxes first! It was a great spot to stop at the Spring Shelter for a nice cold drink too! On our way back we ran into Grandvilla, MobiusKlein, Artistamp, and Azobox and had a discussion about grumpy faces. ;) lol. It was a pleasure to see them.<br>
<br>
So then it was lunch and getting the box hidden in the bushes by trail 1, then off to get the last of the boxes at the Nature Center trail. Then, on to Wisconsin Hiker's and Martini Man's box nearby, to which we were first there too (or were we???) We came back to the shelter and discovered Doglvrs, got a bit of joking in with her (like I could resist, right?), and headed to our campsite. The rest of the evening was spent doing exchanges with those coming to our site to get our stamps, roasting dogs and smores, and fighting off more mosquitos. <br>
<br>
Day 3 (Sunday)<br>
Met at the Inn and headed out on the trail to get Minnesota Icon and Sprite of Spring for Speedsquare, back to our site to pack up, headed into Angola for lunch (passing another Tom's Donuts), and then to the Antique Mega Mall to pick up some boxes. Surprise! It appears everybody else were after those stamps too and we met Hicks from the Sticks, Papa and Luna Girl, and Spartanfans, in addition to Leapin Lizards. Then, off toward Fremont to the cemetery then on to Clear Lake, where we met Dartmoor Dreamer at the beach and at Speedsquares parents house. Back to Fremont (and another Tom's Donut's) and back home, stopping in Coldwater for a another box.<br>
<br>
It was a great weekend! Met lots of new boxers, some old ones too, and generally had a fabulous time. Pokagon was the perfect place to host this event. Thanks again Speedsquare!<br>
