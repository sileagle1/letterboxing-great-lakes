asked Yahoo (many times... grrr), and haven't been able to puzzle out <br>
how exactly to rotate a photo in a Yahoo-sponsored album.  That's all <br>
I want to do, just rotate my little photograph by 90 degrees... I've <br>
finally gotten around to finding a photo suitable (perhaps) for a <br>
seasonal scene on the GL Group's home page, but I can't seem to be <br>
able to "edit" my photo now that it's been uploaded (although Yahoo <br>
claims that I should be able to).  I'm thinking that because it's an <br>
album created by SpringChick, that maybe only the Chick can save me?  <br>
Should I have rotated it prior to uploading, and if so, how can I <br>
delete my error and begin anew?  Arggggh! <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I'm just as clueless as you are.  I went to the photo and followed <br>
the directions in the "help" but there is not an "edit" menu for me <br>
either.  There is an edit button, but that only lets me change the <br>
name and description.  I tried it on one of my own photos also <br>
thinking maybe because I wasn't the owner that I wasn't allowed to <br>
edit, but same thing there.  I suspect that Yahoo! does not have all <br>
of the photo options working yet, or else we are both blind as a bat <br>
and it is sitting there right in front of us.<br>
<br>
It is a nice picture and I will rotate it in my graphics program to <br>
put it up on the home page later this evening (OldShoe is doing some <br>
stuff on my computer right now and he does not have a graphics <br>
program on his).  Thanks!  I was hoping we'd see some photos in the <br>
near future.<br>
<br>
I will change them out on the first of each month if there are new <br>
photos that have been submitted.  If you have something you'd like to <br>
submit, just upload it to the Homepage folder in the photo albums <br>
section.  Bigger is better -- I can always reduce as needed without <br>
losing quality, but I cannot make a photo larger without reducing the <br>
quality.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Hopefully we'll have more photos to offer... We like to "document" each <br>

Hey, how's everyone doing with their BINGO luck?  The person we <br>
personally know of with the highest number called (a friend and <br>
relation of Team Rabbit) has 15 - just halfway there.  Anyone broken <br>
twenty yet?<br>
<br>
Good luck & thanks,<br>
