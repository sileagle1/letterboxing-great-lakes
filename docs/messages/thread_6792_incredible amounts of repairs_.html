Flying J's boxes were some of my first finds and she certainly contributed to holding my interest in this hobby.  Glad she's back after her short time off.  It does seem that there are a number of boxes in need of repair this fall or they are missing completely.  Even some new letterboxers have noted this and have been helping with repairs.  And sadly, one box in this general area has been targeted by vandals who continue to revisit the box and leave nasty warning messages.  Best to retire that box till they find better things to do.
