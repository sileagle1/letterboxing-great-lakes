<br>
I think the madness of this Bingo game is that it's a slooooow game; one call per day.  At this rate, with some many people with empty cards, the game could continue through the summer....or longer.  I've got a few spaces marked, but I can't imagine a plank card after 3 weeks plus. <br>
<br>
But there is hope!  If all the words that have been called so far were not on your card, that means the best is yet to come.  How will Tip Toe be able to deal with marking her card each day when her luck suddenly changes?  WAHOO!!!  Yes, the best is yet to come.  <br>

Once Spring Chick calls a few dozen words that are not on Tip Toes' card, that leaves just the winning words left.  That means she'll have a winning streak waiting for her.  Or maybe....her card is filling up and she's just toying with us.  <br>
