<br/>
Thanks to a very kind hearted and potential new boxer named Bonnie, who <br/>
lives just a couple blocks from the site.<br/>
<br/>
She went to the head park ranger and recovered my boxes in her office <br/>
(I figured they were in a dumpster somewhere).<br/>
<br/>
Now, if only the Mississippi goes down so I can see what damage has <br/>
been done to Campbells Island stamp (its been under water for a couple <br/>
weeks now). I will be finding a new location for it once the river goes <br/>
down.<br/>
