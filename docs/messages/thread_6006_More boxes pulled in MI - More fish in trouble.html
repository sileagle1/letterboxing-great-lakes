Must be a bad time for fish! I pulled my Something is Fishy series from<br/>
Hemlock Crossings Park today. They have stripped out the red pines and along<br/>
with it went 2 of my boxes! :-( The other boxes would never have been found<br/>
due the lack of original clues. To say nothing of the lack of red pine<br/>
trees. In places the landscape is all but bare!<br/>
<br/>
I plan to replace them witn new clues....eventually. :-) Stay tuned.<br/>
