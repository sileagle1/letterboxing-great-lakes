Ooh!  Were you able to avoid it?.....I hope!  Was it right near the<br/>
box?  That box has been a bane for us.  We've never left there tick<br/>
free, now there is poison ivy we didn't know about?<br/>
<br/>
The thing with the Ferries box is that we had to gather a bit of wood to<br/>
make our woodpile and Mr. Puddlejumper thinks we encountered the poison<br/>
ivy while doing that.  Chances are there is not poison ivy right around<br/>
the box, but I didn't know for sure.<br/>
