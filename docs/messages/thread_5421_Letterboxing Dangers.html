Hearing about your coyote reminds me of the time I was hiking and doing <br>
a little birdwatching near a marshy area.  I had my binoculars on a <br>
duck, and as I panned around with my binoculars, I saw 3 coyotes <br>
looking at me.  Of course, the binoculars made it look like they were <br>
within striking distance.  They were a little ways away, but I was <br>
wishing I had a big stick--or a nearby tree.<br>
