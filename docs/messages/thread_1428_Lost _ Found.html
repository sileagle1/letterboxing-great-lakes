<br>
I have lost something of great importance and I need your help. The <br>
other day I decided to go out to Bauman Park in Cherry Valley to take <br>
some photos and check on my Cherry of the Valley letterbox. While <br>
walking along the path, I took some photos that could potentially be <br>
some of my favorites. I checked on my letterbox and then went on to <br>
the next wooden gazebo to sit and enjoy the view of the lake. After <br>
taking some photos of a nearby swan, I sat on the right side (as you <br>
are looking at it) of the step into the gazebo to change my film. <br>
Unfortunately, I seemed to have dropped the container that held, not <br>
only my film, but some papers with some very important information <br>
printed on them.<br>
<br>
What I am asking, begging really, is that you check the area for this <br>
container. As I entered the gazebo, I noticed there was a slight gap <br>
between the side of the step and the gazebo itself. Once I got home, <br>
I realized I hadn't searched there quite yet, so maybe you will have <br>
some luck if you try. Please let me know if you have found anything.<br>
<br>
Thank you so much for your help,<br>
