Congratulations Trekkie Gal for "Xing" out in the Bingo-rama Drama!<br/>
<br/>
We need 7 for the perimeter and 9 for the full card!  Looks like we've got some catchin' up to <br/>
do...those Doglvrs prize socks are starting to distance themselves from our cold little/big <br/>
feet!  Only good thing is that as BINGO ends, so does the winter....THAT is the true prize for <br/>
all of us!<br/>

I still need 6 for the perimeter and 10 for a full card, so it's looking <br/>
unlikely for me to win anything... unless all of a sudden we get some <br/>
more "specific" terms instead of the general ones.  Most of my general <br/>
terms have all been called now, so I'm down to exchanges, boxes, and <br/>
events -- let's get more of those called and I *might* have a chance. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with everyone else though: spring just needs to get here soon... <br/>
even if we're too busy for letterboxing right now.  But the winter <br/>
weather has been conducive for staying in and working on my wedding <br/>
quilting project at least.<br/>
<br/>
2 months to go to the wedding and then our boxing extravaganza in Oregon! :)<br/>

I have had just one term called in the past 19.  I finally got my first <br/>
and only straight line Bingo this Sunday and I only have 2 corners <br/>
covered.  I need 7 for perimeter and 9 for a full card.  I'm voting for <br/>
general terms.  By my count, there are only 12 left to be called but I <br/>
have 8 of those still on my card!! I don't think you need to worry <br/>
about me being hot on your heels :~)  <br/>
