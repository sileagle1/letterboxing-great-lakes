It's like Christmas and birthday all rolled into one.<br/>
Today I received the BINGO prize box from SpringChick (courtesy of the<br/>
many BINGO players on the Great Lakes regional list).<br/>
<br/>
Without listing all of the great surprises, let me just say that with<br/>
new Lock `n Lock containers, carving material, carving tools and lots<br/>
and lots of neat stuff to make letterboxing even more fun, I'm ready<br/>
to make some new challenges here in W. Michigan. <br/>
<br/>
The creative and fun things that were contributed by all who watched<br/>
the list for the BINGO words each day through the winter are just amazing.<br/>
<br/>
There hardly seems any excuse for there not to be some new azobox<br/>
plants pretty soon.<br/>
(Although no one included that little slice of *time* that we all<br/>
cherish).<br/>
<br/>
So, once again, Thank you to SpringChick who organizes the annual<br/>
Letterbox BINGO game that carries us through those short, dark days of<br/>
January, February and into March.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks to everyone who sent such cool stuff to be shared among the<br/>
several winners.<br/>
