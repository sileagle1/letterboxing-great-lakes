                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, today was the Mini-Meet, and I think we can call it a success. <br>
We unfortunately lost a few letterboxers due to the bad weather that<br>
suddenly blew through last night.  We did have the honor of being<br>
little Emily (sp?) Cottontail's first event, and as such put together<br>
a small memory book with all those in attendance stamping into it and<br>
writting her a short note, all done without her parent's knowledge. <br>
We also had some great success with our LBNA fundraiser raffle.  We<br>
managed to raise $114 that will now be sent to them to help cover<br>
costs for a service that I'm sure every one of us in attendance use.  <br>
<br>
With this success, we are looking forward to our Gathering at Forest<br>
Glen Park this summer.  Thanks again to all those who came and helped<br>
us to make this happen.  We also extend our gratitude to those who<br>
planned to come but couldn't, we're glad you put your safety first and<br>
know you would have come if it had been safe to do so.<br>

sure did.  Thank you so much to Flying Dragon, Kimono Girl and Katy for <br>
all the organizing and planning that went into the event.  It was great <br>
to put faces with names and collect all the travelers and stamps!  <br>
Being a newbie this was the perfect size gathering to attend for my <br>
first.  I look forward to future meetings with everyone.  I will <br>
definitely use the logbook idea that Kimono Girl taught us today - <br>
thanks for putting that together, as well as, carving the awesome event <br>
stamp.  <br>
<br>
Super job guys<br>

see some familiar faces, and finally meet some new ones who we know <br>
from this board.  Those central Illinois folks really need to move <br>
things closer to Chicago, luckily Emily was willing to do some driving <br>
on the way home.  She was really excited to get to use her new sig <br>
stamp and the lovely logbook Fungaswoman sent her.  Thanks to everyone <br>
for the special log, and your welcome on our arrival made us feel like <br>
celebrities, it was great!<br>
<br>
Hope to see you all soon, and looking forward to S.I.L.O and the Great <br>
Lakes Gathering in June.<br>
