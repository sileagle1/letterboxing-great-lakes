Wow, thanks for the very complete report.<br/>
You know, the reason that "Whose Shoes" (hiking) had an empty logbook <br/>
is that YOU WERE FIRST!<br/>
Yup, I'm sure that no one else had made that trek -- congrats to you <br/>
and Old Shoe.<br/>
And I'm impressed that you found "I Spy" from that location!<br/>
Thanks for the maintenance also.<br/>
<br/>
As you are aware, those boxes will go away when I respond the <br/>
impending state regulations so I'm glad you got into those logs.<br/>
<br/>
While you were greeting the rain/snow/ice pellets on the lakeshore, <br/>
Grandvilla, Mobiusklein and I saw the same while we were doing a bit <br/>
of woodswalking around Kalamazoo. Despite the COLD and wet weather we <br/>
had a good time. They were searching; I was watching and doing a <br/>
little maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
The usually very busy Portage Bicentennial Park Trail was virtually <br/>
empty this afternoon as the icy wind kept the faint-hearted at home.<br/>
<br/>
Now I need to get over to the lake to pick up a few boxes that are <br/>
missing form my logbook.<br/>

&gt; Well, I got the OldShoe to hit the trail with me today and headed <br/>
&gt; down to VanBuren State Park.  The weather was cool but pleasant as <br/>
&gt; we set off in search of "Whose Shoes?"  Richard, I am assuming the <br/>
&gt; log book was lost/replaced on this one at some point and that is <br/>
why <br/>
&gt; it was empty?  Anyway, loved the stamp and the trip there -- do you <br/>
&gt; know anything about the history behind "the rock garden?"  We found <br/>
&gt; it intriguing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From there we figured the way to "I Spy" with a little trial and <br/>
&gt; error (things look different looking down than looking up).  There <br/>
&gt; were 2 others in the log book, one being Artistamp and the other <br/>
&gt; team I didn't recognize, although they did remark that they had <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; unsuccessful at "Your Lucky Day."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Regardless, we headed off in search of "Your Lucky Day" and I guess <br/>
&gt; it was because we found the box easily and quickly, which was a <br/>
good <br/>
&gt; thing because it had begun to rain by then -- little pellets of ice <br/>
&gt; actually.  There had been several more visitors to this box than <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; other two.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All three boxes were in good condition, a little damp from <br/>
&gt; condensation, but we dried them up and changed out a baggie or <br/>
two.  <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the great day Azobox!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; p.s.  Dragon &gt;&gt; Unfortunately the rain kept us from making the <br/>
&gt; planned stop in Holland on the way home, therefore I cannot give <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; an update on that box as you were hoping for.<br/>
