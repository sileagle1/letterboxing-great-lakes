I recovered my three temporary boxes from the Spring FLiNG, so the <br>
Snorkeling Troll, Taz, and the Baron are no longer at Maybury State <br>
Park. Thanks again to those who provided some TLC so my "temporary" <br>
boxes survived the whole month instead of the weekend that I had <br>
planned for. <br>
