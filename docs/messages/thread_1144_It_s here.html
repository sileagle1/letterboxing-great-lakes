We absolutely agree...we do have some boxes...several<br>
that are outside our normal traveling range.  It's<br>
awesome to have people who can check up on boxes and<br>
do any light work on them..changing torn or broken<br>
bags or replacing a box that has been cracked, etc. <br>
We have had people do this for some of our boxes and<br>
it's a great help to not have to drive 100 miles to<br>
replace a bag.  Even when boxes are close, we have<br>
found that it's just better to repair a box...notify<br>
the owner.  We're already there...no sense in having<br>
someone else who's busy have to run around too.  We<br>
tend to think that things will become more like this<br>
in the future...locals who don't really adopt the<br>
boxes, but take care of them as if they had....It<br>
takes a village to raise a letterbox. :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I couldn't agree more -- sometimes people don't realize how important those "found your box" reports are.  As far as maintenance, a found report is just as good as a visit to the box.  Of course I still like to go check in on them occasionally to see the stamp-ins, but that just depends on how much time is available when I am in the area.<br>
<br>
I do routinely check up on other boxes when I am out boxing or checking in on my own boxes.  We need a few more people here in West Michigan so this will be more of an all-around kind of thing.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking over the "box rotation" idea -- I may do that in a couple of places.  I am also retiring a few that are kind of off on their own not real close to home.  I finally got around to picking up the Turkey Day boxes last weekend and had fun looking through those log books.  In the next week or two I will be permanently retiring Surf~ Sand, Blue Lake and Duck Lake.  I think Duck Lake is missing, but the other two were alive and well as of late fall.  If you don't have them -- it is supposed to be a nice weekend so you should have a chance to get out and look for them before they disappear.<br>
<br>
On that note...  got out to Lake Harbor Park in Muskegon to check in on the Sandy Seasons boxes among others -- it was nice seeing all the stamp-ins from the Sweetest Day Gathering in the log books.  All boxes are in good shape and ready for the season.  I did notice that the geocache that has plagued my Winter box for the past two years is gone though.<br>
