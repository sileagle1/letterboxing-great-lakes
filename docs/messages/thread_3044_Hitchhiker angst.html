planted a hitchhiker to commemorate our 50th find.  (I know that  <br/>
doesn't sound like very many but we're occasional boxers so it took  <br/>
us more than a year to do it!)  We're really, really proud of it --  <br/>
it's got a handmade log, a custom box, and a great stamp carved by my  <br/>
husband.  It was really hard to let it go!  I wrote my email address  <br/>
on the log and noted that it is listed on LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I see from LbNA that at least one person has subsequently  <br/>
reported finding the box that I left it in, but no one reported  <br/>
finding my hitchhiker.  Is it common for people to not report finding  <br/>
hitchhikers?  Should I worry?  I would hate to think it's already  <br/>
gone astray.  I guess I'm a little concerned because I know there are  <br/>
a lot of new letterboxers out there right now and I'm afraid that  <br/>
someone might not have known what it was or what to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
This is our second hitchhiker -- the first disappeared off the radar  <br/>
shortly after I placed it (the first person to find it emailed me,  <br/>
but then I never heard from anyone again).  Since it's been well over  <br/>
a year since I last heard from that one, I am sure it's gotten lost.   <br/>

As disheartening as it may be, when you launch a HH, you have to accept the <br/>
fact that you may never hear anything about it and treat the messages you do <br/>
get as nice little bonuses/surprises.  If that isn't something you can do, <br/>
then it's probably better to put your effort into a traditional letterbox <br/>
rather than a HH.<br/>

&gt; : My husband and I (actually, it was mostly his creation) recently<br/>
&gt; : planted a hitchhiker to commemorate our 50th find.  (I know that<br/>
&gt; : doesn't sound like very many but we're occasional boxers so it took<br/>
&gt; : us more than a year to do it!)  We're really, really proud of it --<br/>
&gt; : it's got a handmade log, a custom box, and a great stamp carved by my<br/>
&gt; : husband.  It was really hard to let it go!  I wrote my email address<br/>
&gt; : on the log and noted that it is listed on LbNA.<br/>
&gt; :<br/>
&gt; : Well, I see from LbNA that at least one person has subsequently<br/>
&gt; : reported finding the box that I left it in, but no one reported<br/>
&gt; : finding my hitchhiker.  Is it common for people to not report finding<br/>
&gt; : hitchhikers?  Should I worry?  I would hate to think it's already<br/>
&gt; : gone astray.  I guess I'm a little concerned because I know there are<br/>
&gt; : a lot of new letterboxers out there right now and I'm afraid that<br/>
&gt; : someone might not have known what it was or what to do with it.<br/>
&gt; :<br/>
&gt; : This is our second hitchhiker -- the first disappeared off the radar<br/>
&gt; : shortly after I placed it (the first person to find it emailed me,<br/>
&gt; : but then I never heard from anyone again).  Since it's been well over<br/>
&gt; : a year since I last heard from that one, I am sure it's gotten lost.<br/>
&gt; : I would hate to think that a similar fate has befallen our new one.<br/>
