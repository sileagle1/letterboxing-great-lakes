                    <div class="plaintext-content">Me! Me!  I live in Muskegon, actually only about a mile from the ferry dock.<br/>
We were down there Tuesday evening and met some of the VIP folks from<br/>
Milwaukee that made the inaugural voyage across to the east shore.<br/>
Interesting bunch...  OldShoe and I are hoping to make a trip to Milwaukee<br/>
on the ferry during the summer also.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in regards to your questions...  As I understand is the case in<br/>
Milwaukee, the ferry dock is not conveniently close to the downtown area.<br/>
It is on the south shore of Muskegon Lake, actually in the midst of a<br/>
Muskegon neighborhood known as "Lakeside".  Furthermore Muskegon, being only<br/>
a fraction of the size of Milwaukee, does not have much in the way of<br/>
cabs -- and the two we do have concentrate their efforts at the airport,<br/>
which is on the completely opposite side of the county from the ferry.<br/>
There are rental cars in the city -- the standard companies, but not near<br/>
the ferry.  Now it is possible that if you arrange a rental ahead of time<br/>
that perhaps they deliver to the ferry docks -- we found this to be the case<br/>
when we took the Ludington/Manitowoc ferry to Wisconsin a couple of years<br/>
ago.  It certainly is worth checking out.  Other than that, your only other<br/>
transportation option disembarking the ferry is our around-town trolley<br/>
shuttle, which does stop right near the ferry dock, and makes the rounds to<br/>
all the major attractions and areas of the city.  If you are planning to<br/>
stay for a few days and get around to do letterboxing, it may be more<br/>
practical to take your car on the ferry.<br/>
<br/>
As for hotels -- there are a couple of nice places in the downtown area.<br/>
These are the closest to the ferry docks (about 3 miles), but they tend to<br/>
be the priciest also.  My recommendation downtown would be the Shoreline<br/>
Inn, a very nice hotel on Muskegon Lake.  There is also a very cute little<br/>
motel on the north side of Muskegon Lake, very near Muskegon State Park,<br/>
called the Snug Harbor Motel.  It is just a small strip motel, but very<br/>
quaint and pleasant.  If you are looking to position yourself convenient to<br/>
some boxes and not necessarily intent on being in "the city," this would be<br/>
perfect.  While on that side of the lake, you must stop at the Bear Lake<br/>
Tavern for a perch dinner -- it is a local legend.  There are also hotels in<br/>
various areas around the city and on the south end of town near the<br/>
airport -- when making a reservation, try to avoid anything in the Muskegon<br/>
Heights area.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the case, wherever you stay, would love to try and arrange an<br/>
impromptu meeting with anyone who does come across to Muskegon on the ferry.<br/>
<br/>
Can talk more at the gathering...<br/>
