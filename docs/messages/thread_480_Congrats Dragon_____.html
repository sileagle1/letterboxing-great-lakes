Seeing you do the Happy Happy Joy Joy Dance in a still shot on the photo page <br>
was hysterical!  Way to G0!!!!!!  500+ boxes!  That is truly amazing.<br>
Congratulations and keep up the good work.  You must be the King of LBing~!<br>
<br>
Lipstickchick and I (Dumpster Diva) just returned from Ft Myers, FL from a <br>
weeks vacation celebrating our birthdays!  We placed 3 boxes while there and <br>
found 1 and saw real live manatees not 3 ft from us!~  They are amazing <br>
creatures.  Could hardly prevent Lipstick Chick from jumping right in with them!  Since <br>
FL is a ways away for checking the status of our boxes, we put them in places <br>
where a warm body is available to hand the box to you upon completing the <br>
clues and asking the right questions!  The clues are as much fun and the finding. <br>
 And for Lipstick Chick, after 2 unsuccessful searches, the one find was her <br>
first!  Way to go Jo!<br>
