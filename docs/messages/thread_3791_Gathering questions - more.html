Kimono Girl and Doodle Bug,<br>
Thanks for you information about the gatherings!  I appreciate the help!<br>
<br>
I have more questions.  If I thought of a box to plant and wanted to <br>
bring it to plant for that day only... how would I disseminate the <br>
clues?  I don't live in the area, so I couldn't really plant it ahead <br>
of time to post clues on LBNA.  I wouldn't have computer access once <br>
there to do so, and wouldn't be able to run copies of a clue sheet once there.<br>
<br>
Is it really feasible to think of planting a box like this?  How do <br>
you let people know about it?  Do you just give verbal clues to <br>
people? Maybe hand write a few clue sheets, hand them out and tell <br>
people to pass on the clues once they've found it?<br>
<br>
Can you tell I'm new at this? ;)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You can do any of those!  You could also make one copy of the clues <br>
to post in a central area (taped to a wall or table) and people could <br>
write down their own copy if they wanted to look for the box (best <br>
not to have clues that are too long for this approach).<br>
<br>
We've also been to a gathering where people had temporary "tatoos" on <br>
their arms that were actually clues to a box.  Of course these were <br>
really short clues!<br>
