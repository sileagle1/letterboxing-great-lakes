Thanks for all the great ideas, Mosey!  Flowers and pebbles are great <br>
ideas!  The cemetery was pretty small.  And it's very old.  Michigan <br>
doesn't seem to have any listings on the graveyards.com site, but I <br>
did find information elsewhere about the local cemeteries.  It <br>
probably would have been a good idea to print that stuff out to have with me.<br>
<br>
The RAOGK thing sounds pretty cool.  I probably wouldn't say that's <br>
why I was there, but it's a really nice thing for you to do.  Maybe <br>
I'll check into the site.  If I'm going to be hanging out in these <br>
places anyway, it may be something to do while I'm there.<br>
<br>
I was carrying a small clipboard, and didn't look too grungy.  I <br>
don't look like the vandalizing type, and it was broad daylight, in <br>
the middle of the day.  So, hopefully, I didn't give them a bad impression!<br>
<br>
I kind of had a generic "I grew up in this city (true), and I think I <br>
have some relatives buried here (not true)" story lined up in case I <br>
was questioned by anyone!<br>
<br>
This box is actually part of a series.  I have 4 more ready to plant <br>
in the near future, so your information may end up being very <br>
helpful!  I think this cemetery is the most visible of the places I'm <br>
planning on planting and would be the most "paranoia inducing"!<br>
