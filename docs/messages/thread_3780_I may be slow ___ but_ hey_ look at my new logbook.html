time clock would have to be reset over and over.<br>
<br>
So I started my GLG 2007 logbook about 10:45am.  I liked the size of my shamrock book, <br>
so I thought 5.5x7.5 inches would make a good standard size.  Plus, I still have my <br>
template from last night that will work again.  I decided to cut all my scrap cardboard the <br>
same size, and I have enough to make 16 more logbooks.<br>
<br>
Okay, that's done.  Now let me see, let's start with the covers.  I went back to Hobby Lobby <br>
this morning and found some bigger needles and waxed linen thread and a large pad of <br>
paper.  Oh, and more PAPER!  Being the Cluez-In will feature 50's icons, I knew I had to <br>
have the Dick and Jane paper.  Bought several sets.  You know, in case of goofs.  I had to <br>
reverse the inside and outside sheets because the layout would look aweful.  Not a <br>
problem.<br>
<br>
The Strathmore pad of paper was a good choice.  After thinking about all the PT's, event <br>
boxes, exchanges, et al, I decided 48 sides of paper probably wasn't going to do.  So I <br>
spent  considerable time cutting 96 (out of 100) sheets to size.  My fingers are really sore <br>
right now.    Each sheet had to be cut twice, and if you've ever made a book, you want the <br>
sheets to be as close to the same size as possible.  Tedious.<br>
<br>
Then my better half started opening the refrigerator and looking for Girl Scout cookies.  <br>
Lunch break.<br>
<br>
Back to work.  Woo-hoo.  I decided on 16 signatures of 6 sheets of paper.  Group them <br>
and fold them.  Done.  Mark them with pencil before piercing, done.  Pierce them.  Yeah, <br>
we're almost ready to assemble!<br>
<br>
Okay Signature one and cover are attached, looking good.  Whoops!  At the end of <br>
Signature 2, I notice a BIG boo-boo.  I forgot to make the second cut on the paper before <br>
lunch.  This doesn't look good.  If I pulled it all out the holes would weaken the book and <br>
make a mess.  But we can't have pages sticking out of the book!  So what did I do?  I <br>
continued on and figured I would cut the edges when I was done.  Easier said than done.  I <br>
think 16 signatures is almost too many for my logbooks.  My hands almost could not hold <br>
the expanding stack as I assembled it.<br>

I checked out your logbook photos too!  Wow.  When you dig in, you <br>
really do!  Very impressive.  And you're on your way to making 16 <br>
more?!  :)  Do you know how that sounds?!  :) We all have those same <br>
traits expressing them in many different ways.  How many boxes can we <br>
find in one day, one weekend, one event, one vacation?  I'm gonna buy <br>
TEN pieces of the Grade B white stuff AND use my Hobby Lobby 40% off <br>
coupon to buy the pink stuff!  I'm gonna get all my finds logged onto <br>
AQ---all 400 today (or at least before the winter ends).  What is NOT to <br>
love! <br>
<br>
Thanks so much for sharing.  I don't know whether to jump into this head <br>
first too and hold back for fear I'll have yet another table covered in <br>
letterboxing stuff!  Good thing we're all in good company!!!  We are, <br>
aren't we??<br>
<br>
It's all good, right?!  Right??? :)<br>

I found a couple of images I want to try for my June boxes.  I'm not sure how they'll turn out, <br>
