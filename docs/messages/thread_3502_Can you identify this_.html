Dragon, I think the things you describe are called aerial patrol<br>
markers and they're used to mark pipelines. <br>
<br>
I did a google images search and came up with a couple of hits that<br>
look like your description. Maybe you could use the images results<br>
link or something like that in the clues you're working on.<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>

324, there's an overpass where every time I've gone through there in<br>
the past year there has been an unmarked cruiser.  He then relays<br>
which cars are speeding to the 6-8 marked cars 1/4 mile down the road.<br>
   My last trip up there, I saw at that spot 20 cars pulled over by 6<br>
cruisers, cause they knew they were caught.<br>
