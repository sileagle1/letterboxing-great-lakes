come across a microbox or other small box with a likewise small logbook<br/>
(scroll of paper, etc.).  You might find that if everyone stamps in, you<br/>
take up much of the capacity of the log, not leaving a lot for others to<br/>
stamp in.  It may not be convenient for the placer to promptly replace it,<br/>
either.  In such a case, suggest that each member stamps in, but just with a<br/>
fragment of their image (ie, if it is an animal, just stamp in the head).<br/>
Enough to be recognizable, but to not take up as much room.  And stamp<br/>
images close together, for the same reason, to conserve space.<br/>
