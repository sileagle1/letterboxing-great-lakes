Is it just me, or maybe I just need to practice more on it and get<br/>
used to it. But I'm having a lot more difficulty working with the<br/>
orange stuff. It seems .... hmmmm ... how to describe it? More stiff<br/>
and seems to be more "brittle" than the old kind. It just feels like<br/>
it's made with a whole different chemical composition to me. Kinda a<br/>
little bit, in a weird sort of way, reminds me of wax crayons or<br/>
something like that.<br/>
<br/>
I use the iron transfer method. Could the heat of the iron be<br/>
affecting the PZ material in some way? I personally don't think so,<br/>
because I've tried carving on a piece that wasn't exposed to heat and<br/>
had pretty much the same problems. It kind of breaks off or ... oh, I<br/>
know  I'm not doing a good job describing this, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
We're not likely going to see a return to the old, white PZkut, (in my<br/>
next post, I'll copy and paste Justin's' reply to my question about<br/>
the switch to the orange stuff)  so I'd like to know if anyone has<br/>
tips, tricks, hints or ideas on using this new orange PZKut they'd<br/>

Sorry, I  can't help.  When they switched to orange I decided to order Grade<br/>
B material because I wasn't sure how I'd like carving on BRIGHT orange<br/>
media.  I've read some posts from people on other message boards that are<br/>
pleased with it and believe it is similar to the "original"(?) PZ-Cut.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Like BindleBabe, I use the iron transfer method exclusively.  You <br/>
will have to experiment a bit with your particular iron as far as <br/>
the heat setting and the timing, as all irons are different, but <br/>
once you used to it, you should get a nice crisp result every time.<br/>
<br/>
You need to start with an image printed with a laser printer or <br/>
copied on a toner-based copy machine.  I have heard people get <br/>
decent results with an ink-jet printer, but I have not ever been <br/>
able to get it to work.  Maybe it depends on the brand of ink-jet <br/>
printer you are using?  I have both an HP and a Canon and neither <br/>
have been successful for me.<br/>
<br/>
So, print or copy your image at the size you want it, leaving plenty <br/>
of white space around the printed image.  Lay the image side down <br/>
onto your carving material, making sure that all of the carving <br/>
material is covered with paper (the reason you want to leave extra <br/>
paper around the image).  I use medium heat on my iron -- it has <br/>
temp settings from 1 to 10 and I us 5 for transfers, but like I said <br/>
that will vary -- not hot enough and the image transfer will be <br/>
light, too hot and you will damage the carving material.<br/>
<br/>
Place the iron over the entire design and firmly hold it down.  I <br/>
don't use any steam and I don't move it around, just leave it in one <br/>
place, holding it down rather firmly.  After about a minute (again, <br/>
it will take some experimenting to get the time right), remove the <br/>
iron and lift up the paper from one corner slowly -- it will have a <br/>
bit of "stick" to it.  Don't remove the entire piece of paper all at <br/>
once because if it didn't transfer well, you can't get it back down <br/>
in the same place, so just peel it back a little at a time.  If the <br/>
image is not dark enough or you reach a place where it did not <br/>
transfer good, lay it back down and apply some more heat to the <br/>
areas in need of attention.<br/>
<br/>
Once it looks good, finish peeling back the paper and you're ready <br/>
to carve!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck -- sounds like a neat stamp!<br/>

Bindle, its not you. The material is different.  I sat down  tonight to carve <br/>
something and it took me 2 tries to get it right.   It seems like its hard to <br/>
judge how deep something will carve, or at times  like a large area wants to <br/>
peel back.  It does have a waxy feel to it  that I don't recall with the white <br/>
material.  I know I'm presently  searching for a new source of material to <br/>
carve on.  ~The Cat's  Meow~<br/>

You can also take a piece that has been copied with a "toner" based  material <br/>
and transfer it by rubbing nail polish remove to the back of it  as it's <br/>
laying on the carving material. But I only do this when I don't  have my nails <br/>
done.  <br/>
