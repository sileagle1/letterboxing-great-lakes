<br>
We won't have regular access to email next week, so I figured I'd <br>
send another reminder now to those of you who volunteered to make <br>
boxes for the event.   I have already received 10 boxes from "out of <br>
towners" and clues for one box planted by a local boxer. I'm <br>
estimating that there are probably about 16 more boxes that will be <br>
sent to us from those that live further away.  I just wanted to <br>
remind you that if we will be planting the box, we'd like to have it <br>
in our hands by April 30 (10 days away).  That will give us several <br>
weekends in May to get out and hide those boxes.  When you're ready <br>
to send the box, just contact me for my mailing address.  If for some <br>
reason you will NOT be able to create the box, please send me an <br>
email message so I can remove it from the list.<br>
<br>
If you're planting your own box, please email me the clues by May 26 <br>
or sooner if you want them included in the clue booklet.<br>
<br>
As the event gets closer, let me know if you decide on what you'd <br>
like to bring for the potluck.  You can check the website<br>
<br>
http://2006greatlakesgathering.homestead.com/potluck.html<br>
<br>
to see what people are already planning to bring and see some general <br>
suggestions for additonal items.<br>
<br>
Happy boxing (and carving)!<br>

   <br>
  I've been looking at the gathering site and I'm getting so excited!  As far as the pot luch goes, I think what I'm going to do is bring a couple 24 packs of bottled water and soda.  That seemed to go over well at the gathering last fall.  That way, people can just brab a bottle and take it with them on the trail. You can just put me down for bringing bottled beverages.<br>
   <br>
   I've decided that I probably won't bring Sophie along to the gathering.  With so many people attending and with the stringent leash laws at the state parks, I don't think it would be the best idea.  She'll be crushed, but maybe I can make it up to her by giving her a ham-bone to chew on while I'm out and she's stuck at home!<br>

  Hello again!<br>
<br>
We won't have regular access to email next week, so I figured I'd <br>
send another reminder now to those of you who volunteered to make <br>
boxes for the event.   I have already received 10 boxes from "out of <br>
towners" and clues for one box planted by a local boxer. I'm <br>
estimating that there are probably about 16 more boxes that will be <br>
sent to us from those that live further away.  I just wanted to <br>
remind you that if we will be planting the box, we'd like to have it <br>
in our hands by April 30 (10 days away).  That will give us several <br>
weekends in May to get out and hide those boxes.  When you're ready <br>
to send the box, just contact me for my mailing address.  If for some <br>
reason you will NOT be able to create the box, please send me an <br>
email message so I can remove it from the list.<br>
<br>
If you're planting your own box, please email me the clues by May 26 <br>
or sooner if you want them included in the clue booklet.<br>
<br>
As the event gets closer, let me know if you decide on what you'd <br>
like to bring for the potluck.  You can check the website<br>
<br>
http://2006greatlakesgathering.homestead.com/potluck.html<br>
<br>
to see what people are already planning to bring and see some general <br>
suggestions for additonal items.<br>

Happy boxing (and carving)!<br>
