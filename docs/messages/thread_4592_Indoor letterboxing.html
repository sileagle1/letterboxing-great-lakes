 Someone has planted a box in every library, with their permission, in the Greenville, SC. That is 12 including the bookmobile. Would suggest contacting the main library here to see how they worked it. One of them, it kept falling off the tape so they just put in on the desk. All use they same stamp but just change the name of the unit. I assume from that, they made up their own stamps. Pretty neat. Hope this might help.<br/>

We have placed one indoor box.  I wrote down a little description of <br/>
letterboxing, both to help me explain it and also to leave with the <br/>
owners so they could look it over.  When we went in to talk to one of <br/>
the owners, we brought our logbooks in to show them some of the <br/>
stamps.  I also pointed a few stamps from indoor locations/businesses <br/>
(thanks FungusWoman! for those boxes).  They OK'd it and they put the <br/>
letterbox behind the counter--people have to give a password to get the <br/>
box.  We were just in that store last week, and the owner said she <br/>
really likes having the letterbox there--she enjoys hearing where <br/>
people are from and what other letterboxes they have been at nearby.<br/>

When I asked permission of the business owner, and explained a little about letterboxing, he was intrigued and immediately grasped the fact that it would bring some new customers into his shop.  The two of us discussed possible hiding places in the shop, but ended up having the box be kept behind the counter.  My clues tell the seeker what to ask for.  <br/>
<br/>
I have received a couple emails from successful finders, telling me they liked the idea and had bought some of the shop's goods, and one boxer was even inspired to do the same and plant a box in a friend's business herself.  Of course hubby and I had to run right out and find THAT one :)<br/>

I have several indoor boxes in local library branches. I did NOT seek  <br/>
permission before planting them as I was afraid it would be denied.  I  trusted that <br/>
letterboxers would be discreet and rehide them without issue  since that is <br/>
what we do.<br/>
<br/>
I got an email from one of the library branch managers telling of how the  <br/>
box had been left out on a table and was brought to the desk (Busted!) but she  <br/>
thought it was such a neat idea she asked if I could email her the clues so <br/>
she  could put it back in place.  I think the fact that it was based on a  <br/>
children's book character helped her see it as something that was acceptable to  <br/>
have in the library, and she no doubt also realized it could bring in additional <br/>
 patrons.  I just got another FOUND email on that box so apparently she did  <br/>
a good job rehiding it and all is well.<br/>
<br/>
My indoor boxes are in little metal tins (think Altoids) with a business  <br/>
card magnet attached to the box bottom. I usually hide them under the next to  <br/>
bottom shelf and always toward the back.  I have not been back to check on  any <br/>
of them as I didn't want to draw attention to them.  I put some basics  on <br/>
letterboxing onto a business card, trimmed the corners and taped it inside  the <br/>
lid. Then I have another business card that tells about LbNA and Atlas Quest  <br/>
and shows their logos and it is taped into the bottom of the tin. I also  <br/>
included some little 1" x 3" slips of paper with the URLs for both sites so  <br/>
visitors could take them with them. The log books are of course rather limited  in <br/>
size and the stamps should be of thinner material. I also bend the front  <br/>
center lip of the box bottom out a bit so the latch holds tighter as they will  be <br/>
upside down on the shelves.  Hope that helps!<br/>
<br/>
We had a blast in Metamora, IN looking for Jabber &amp; JoBob's indoor  boxes. <br/>
One was in a candy store, so of course we had to sample to treats there!  They <br/>
were so cute and I loved the great choices of containers too.  That is  one <br/>
thing about the boxes being indoors...it opens up a whole new plethora of  <br/>
containers that will work!  I just love seeing how creative some LBers are  when the <br/>
boxes don't have to be hidden outside in the wild!<br/>
<br/>
We also found several by dream a dream in libraries and asked her  permission <br/>
to use the idea for our own before we planted them.  Then there  was another <br/>
great box by Toadfrogs in a coffee shop in a cut out  book...very nice!  I <br/>
have a book and the stamp is even carved to go with  the book title, but have yet <br/>
to cut out the book or figure out where to plant  that one, so must get back <br/>
to that.  With this cold weather and all that is  yet to come indoor boxes are <br/>
likely to be the ONLY ones we find for a  while!<br/>

Has anyone out there planted boxes inside? I'm wondering how you go <br/>
about it?  I'm assuming you ask permission, but then how much detail do <br/>
you give - I tend to get excited and then give a full lesson on <br/>
letterboxing and carving.  Or do you go for places where you can hide a <br/>
mini without permission (university campus perhaps).  I have a great <br/>
idea for one but I'm not sure how to go about it.  Enough rambling. <br/>
