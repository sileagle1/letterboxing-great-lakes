comments in the main list, the newbie list, and this list. It's  <br/>
rumored that there are 2 or 3 of these same stamps in circulation:  <br/>
perhaps one real, and the others copies.  I'm totally in doubt that  <br/>
the stamp(s) are anything BUT a fake... simply gags that people have  <br/>
put out there for fun. I just can't see Martha Stewart making her  <br/>
"signature stamp" a tie-in with K-Mart! I mean, wouldn't she do  <br/>
something totally unique and personal... not an ad for K-mart? I know  <br/>
she has a product line there... but still..... she does have more  <br/>
taste than that(!?!?)<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents worth!<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: Martha Stewart's hand carved letterboxing sig stamp<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, does anybody know the story on this stamp? People on the LBNA list<br/>
&gt; seem to remember it as either a HH or at a gathering...? I am  <br/>
&gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; how this came to be up for sale on E-bay...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just curious,<br/>
