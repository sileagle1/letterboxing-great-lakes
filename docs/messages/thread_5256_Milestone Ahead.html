I love the idea of leaving behind a hitchhiker in the box.  We may have <br/>
to do that but we'd have to do it every 150 or 200 boxes since we're <br/>
already beyond 125.  Or maybe we'll celebrate by planting regular <br/>
boxes.  I had considered a patch that shows the find count but it <br/>
changes often enough that I decided I didn't want to spend time sewing <br/>
on patches that few people besides me ever see.<br/>
<br/>
We did pick a particular box to visit when we were going to hit 100 but <br/>
it wasn't a huge decision.  If we had been in a different area, we <br/>
wouldn't have stopped letterboxing to wait for that particular <br/>
letterbox.  We also picked a particular box (one of Spring Chick's <br/>
mystery boxes) for #101.  Other than those two, we haven't concerned <br/>
ourselves with which box we found and what F number a box is.<br/>
<br/>
I have considered creating a special stamp for our find count and then <br/>
using the special stamp in conjunction with our personal stamps in the <br/>
logbook being visited as well as our own books but I haven't done that <br/>
yet...  (I think it was someone on this list who gave me the idea, when <br/>
he or she suggested a special "first finder" stamp.)<br/>
