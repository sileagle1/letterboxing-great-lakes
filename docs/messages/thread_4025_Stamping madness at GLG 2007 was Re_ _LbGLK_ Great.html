                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very good questions, Bali.  When I started 3 years ago, I bought a large<br/>
Strathmore book.  Not practical and so I cut out my stamps and laminated<br/>
them.  Then that got to be a hassle (and an expense), so I bought 2<br/>
smaller journals, one for exchanges and my plants, another for Finds. <br/>
Then I went to a gathering in Louisville (the first one, 2006).  Then,<br/>
again I carried 2 logbooks to the GLG 2006 last June.  Trying to keep<br/>
track of two books, not stamping in your sig stamp in your own book, and<br/>
making each look "just right" was too much of a burden for me, but I<br/>
marvel at the work others have done to make scrapbooks.<br/>
<br/>
So my newest solution (and a nod from Spring Chick) is to create a new<br/>
logbook for each gathering I attend.  I did this in March and it worked<br/>
out great.  Of course, come June there will be many more letterboxers and<br/>
lots of boxes to find in one day.  Come look for me and fill up my<br/>
homemade, 96-page logbook.  I hope I have enough room, but not too much<br/>
room.  I will retire the book and start another right afterwards.  Stamp<br/>
upside down, right side up, whatever suits you.  It's quite a relief not<br/>
to stress over this now.<br/>
<br/>
My finds and exchanges will occur anywhere and everywhere in the book;<br/>
random acts of stamping.  I think I'll have much more fun going back and<br/>
reminiscing about the day.  Chaos reigns.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Spring Chick ... those logbooks I've been making fit<br/>
seredipitously in my built-in desk's cubby holes.<br/>
