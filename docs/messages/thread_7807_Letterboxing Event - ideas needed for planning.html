I have contacted the local Girl Scout Council to put a note in their newsletter for leaders, placed posters at a few of the Forest Preserves in the area, and am spreading the word as best I can.

I have one letterbox planted inside the library and am thinking about adding one or two more. I wondered if something like this invites an event stamp-- I have never attended an event and am not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Your ideas would be appreciated and welcomed! If any of you live near theEast Central Illinois or West Central Indianaarea and are interested in attending, I will be glad to share more information. It is a very small library so 20 people would be the limit and it is on a Monday evening.<br/>

Thank you!<br/>

which will be held on September 16 in Central Illinois.  If any of you have<br/>
