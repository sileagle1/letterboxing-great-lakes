Okay, the votes are in and the poll is closed on a theme for the <br/>
letterbox exchange project, but we don't have a winner -- not yet <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It was a tie between Weird U.S. and Hometown Landmarks.  I have set <br/>
up a run-off poll with just these two themes.  Everyone gets one <br/>
vote and the poll will close on Wednesday at midnight.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone who suggested themes and to those who cast their <br/>
vote in the original poll.  I am looking forward to getting this <br/>
thing off the ground!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is a good idea and I did consider that before posting the 2nd poll.<br/>
But for ease in naming and identifying the series, I decided to stick with<br/>
the original plan of having one central theme.  I would hope that nobody is<br/>
stuck enough in one theme that they wouldn't not play because the other was<br/>
chosen, but that is each person's choice.  Actually the two that are up are<br/>
close enough to one another that if you really wanted to do the one and the<br/>
other was chosen, you could probably make it work -- after all, most of the<br/>
"Weird U.S." type things could be considered local landmarks, and many<br/>
landmarks could loosely fit into the "weird" category.<br/>
