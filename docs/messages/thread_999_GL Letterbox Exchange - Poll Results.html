Okay, the votes are in and the poll is closed on a theme for the <br>
letterbox exchange project, but we don't have a winner -- not yet <br>
anyway.<br>
<br>
It was a tie between Weird U.S. and Hometown Landmarks.  I have set <br>
up a run-off poll with just these two themes.  Everyone gets one <br>
vote and the poll will close on Wednesday at midnight.<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone who suggested themes and to those who cast their <br>
vote in the original poll.  I am looking forward to getting this <br>
thing off the ground!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is a good idea and I did consider that before posting the 2nd poll.<br>
But for ease in naming and identifying the series, I decided to stick with<br>
the original plan of having one central theme.  I would hope that nobody is<br>
stuck enough in one theme that they wouldn't not play because the other was<br>
chosen, but that is each person's choice.  Actually the two that are up are<br>
close enough to one another that if you really wanted to do the one and the<br>
other was chosen, you could probably make it work -- after all, most of the<br>
"Weird U.S." type things could be considered local landmarks, and many<br>
landmarks could loosely fit into the "weird" category.<br>
