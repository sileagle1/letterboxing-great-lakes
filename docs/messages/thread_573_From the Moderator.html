                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I have see enough of this topic.  There are obviously <br>
differences of opinion, which is fine.  But there is no need for <br>
blatant disregard for tradition or the way letterboxing is currently <br>
done in the U.S.<br>
<br>
Everyone seems to agree on one thing -- letterboxing offers <br>
something for everyone.  So take what suits you and try to do so <br>
without disrespect for the person next to you or the way that they <br>
choose to play the game.<br>
<br>
This has until now been a peaceful group, a nice respite from the <br>
flames and discontent on the big list, and I would like to keep it <br>
that way.  I would appreciate no more posts on this thread and will <br>
delete any that do come through.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

You disagree. <br>
