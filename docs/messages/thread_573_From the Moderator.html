                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I have see enough of this topic.  There are obviously <br/>
differences of opinion, which is fine.  But there is no need for <br/>
blatant disregard for tradition or the way letterboxing is currently <br/>
done in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone seems to agree on one thing -- letterboxing offers <br/>
something for everyone.  So take what suits you and try to do so <br/>
without disrespect for the person next to you or the way that they <br/>
choose to play the game.<br/>
<br/>
This has until now been a peaceful group, a nice respite from the <br/>
flames and discontent on the big list, and I would like to keep it <br/>
that way.  I would appreciate no more posts on this thread and will <br/>
delete any that do come through.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes!  That's exactly what I thought when I hit the various <br/>
websites <br/>
&gt; reading <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; about the history of letterboxing.  Hey, this was geocaching, <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; letterboxing!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; And I really like the calling card idea.  Wish they hadn't <br/>
changed <br/>
&gt; *that* <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; part of it.    <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Sounds like you took up the wrong hobby.  Perhaps geocaching <br/>
would be <br/>
&gt; &gt;more suitable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do orienteering and give orienteering seminars and classes, I do <br/>
&gt; geocaching, and now I also do letterboxing.  I check and do <br/>
whichever is going on in <br/>
&gt; whatever area I'm going to be in at a particular time.   Of the <br/>
three, I <br/>
&gt; definitely prefer orienteering, and as old as I am, I can still <br/>
kick plenty of butt.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I read on one of the websites that in Europe, commercial stamps <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; considered the way to go and hand carved are kind of looked <br/>
down <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;on?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;Not sure where you read that, but it certainly is not consistent <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; &gt;anything I have ever read or heard.  Actually from what I <br/>
understand <br/>
&gt; &gt;in the U.K. carved stamp images are often much more intricate and <br/>
&gt; &gt;detailed, and letterboxers who are not comfortable carving <br/>
usually <br/>
&gt; &gt;design a stamp to have custom made.  Just as in the U.S., store <br/>
&gt; &gt;bought commercial stamps are generally not as sought after.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Answered in another post.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Yep, bring back the calling cards!      <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;You're kidding right?  The [hand-carved] stamp is such a core <br/>
part of <br/>
&gt; &gt;letterboxing in the U.S. (today and always).  Why would you even <br/>
take <br/>
&gt; &gt;up this hobby if you feel this way?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, I'm not kidding.  Y'see, I don't really care that "the [hand-<br/>
carved] <br/>
&gt; stamps is such a core part of letterboxing in the U.S."  and all <br/>
that rot.  I was <br/>
&gt; giving my own personal opinion because my personal feelings would <br/>
go back to <br/>
&gt; the actual inception in Dartmoor.  I would have preferred the <br/>
calling cards, I <br/>
&gt; like that idea better and it seems closer to the history to me.  <br/>
You disagree. <br/>
&gt;  So be it.   Most of the letterboxes I'm finding have at least 2 <br/>
or 3 entries <br/>
&gt; in them now with individuals or families that have left <br/>
thumbprints, <br/>
&gt; "natureprints", etc.   To me, those people are just as much in the <br/>
spirit of it, <br/>
&gt; because they're still going thru the clues, making the treks, <br/>
finding the boxes, <br/>
&gt; and then finding a way, even if they don't have a stamp, of <br/>
saying "I was here." <br/>
&gt;  I take it you would disapprove of them then?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There's one box in IL that we're going to try to get to later this <br/>
week or <br/>
&gt; the next that's a box planted in honor of schoolteachers.  And <br/>
each person's log <br/>
&gt; entry is supposed to include a short remark about the finder's <br/>
favorite <br/>
&gt; teacher.  I think that's going to be a blast to read the entries <br/>
and add our own.  <br/>
&gt; And that makes that box a little "different" from the traditional <br/>
that I've <br/>
&gt; found.  But is it going to take any "intelligence" to find the box <br/>
other than <br/>
&gt; Stealth Bomber Tactics because of where it's hidden.  No, not <br/>
really.   Is it an <br/>
&gt; "adult" letterbox?  Yeah, probably.  How many kids are going to <br/>
admit in <br/>
&gt; public to having liked a teacher?  I would think it'd be more of a <br/>
nostalgia trip <br/>
&gt; for adults.  Cool.       <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why would I take up the hobby?  It's something that can be done <br/>
outdoors, and <br/>
&gt; horror of horrors, it can actually involve children from time to <br/>
time, who <br/>
&gt; can learn things from it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From what another poster just stated tho, it seems like <br/>
letterboxing is <br/>
&gt; supposed to be for mensa candidates? only the intelligent need <br/>
apply?  not families <br/>
&gt; with 4 year olds?  Well, if it becomes a bit mainstream because <br/>
the hobby <br/>
&gt; begins to offer more things for more people, well so be it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is it the fear that the "underground" flavor will be gone?  <br/>
Similar to if <br/>
&gt; they legalize marijuana it won't be such sneaky fun to grow it in <br/>
the basement <br/>
&gt; anymore?  Is it the fear that if a person slyly tells another <br/>
person that <br/>
&gt; they're into letterboxing, they won't be given that look <br/>
of "oooooh, you must be <br/>
&gt; soooo intelligent to go figgerin' out all them clues all da <br/>
time"?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can understand the fear that finders might become negligent and <br/>
that either <br/>
&gt; the box or the environment that it's in might become damaged.  <br/>
(Yep, I'm one <br/>
&gt; of those that would consider abandoned letterboxes to be litter -- <br/>
the plastic <br/>
&gt; of a rubbermaid letterbox container is no different than the <br/>
plastic of a <br/>
&gt; tossed 2 litre bottle to me -- so, to me, unless it's being cared <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; responsibly, it's litter.)  But that's the only fear I can <br/>
understand.  Other than that, <br/>
&gt; it's evolution.<br/>
