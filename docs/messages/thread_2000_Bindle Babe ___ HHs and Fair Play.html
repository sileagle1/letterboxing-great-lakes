                    <div class="plaintext-content">The bottomline here seems to be that:<br>
 <br>
(1)  We are talking about ordinary HHs that are placed and found in LBoxes registered with LBNA and AQ. We are not talking about treasures of painstaking artisan craftsmanship. The journals themselves may be ordinary, mediocure or even crappy with owners often referring to them as just logbooks.<br>
(2)  Atlas Quest only records "finds" not where the HH is placed. NO harm done. In fact when I place my first HH it will be nice to track it's progress at AQ. What would be the harm in allowing you to track other member finds just as does www.geocaching.com <br>
(3)  These ordinary little HH "surprises" may be viewed as treasures to their author/owners who are concerned that others abide by their pre-disposed ridgid orthodoxy. Yet, because of "personal reasons" or inconvenience they won't take 2 minutes to register an ordinary or mediocre or crappy HH with LBNA and AQ for the interest of others.<br>
(4)  I would like to track my ordinary HH finds over my lifetime of LBoxing, and would appreciate a team spirit of mutual reciprocity between the owner/author and the finder. The current mindset of some is equivalent to someone trying to convince you that it isn't necessary to be recording your normal LBox finds at Atlas Quest.<br>
(5)  I have decided that I will not replace "Christmas Swish Tree" in my redesigned crappy, mediocre and ordinary "Paul Bunyan's Baby Blocks" LBox or another's until "C.S.T." is registered by its ownere/author as a HH with both LBNA and AQ. If the owner does not get it registered by Thanksgiving then I will remove my stamped impression, and God forbide that I tell anyone where it is located or it might be found too soon instead of hibernating all winter in an out of the way ordinary LBox or worst yet in one that is virtually inactive.<br>
(6)  The irony is that we are suspose to believe that the whereabouts of WOM Hitchhiking "artisan treasures" are never ever leaked to another member without permission from its owner/author.<br>
