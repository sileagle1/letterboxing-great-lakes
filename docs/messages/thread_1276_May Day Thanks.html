I just wanted to put in Team Rabbit's thanks for such a fun day at <br>
the May Day Mini-meet!We had the most wonderful time getting to meet <br>
everyone face-to-face, exchanging stamps and travelers, and of course <br>
for the awesome time letterboxing! We got quite the workout at CJ's <br>
Loathing!! We really needed it to break us in for the season! Thanks <br>
so much Doglvrs.....for everything!!!!! :-)  <br>
Thank you everyone who was there for your patience and help as we <br>
were letterboxing with Rainy Day Rabbit! We know that boxing with a <br>
baby takes a bit more time than most of you are probably used to so <br>
we just wanted to say that we appreciate you waiting up for us and a <br>
special thanks to the guys for helping carry the stroller in some of <br>
those sandy areas! :-)  <br>
Also, just wanted to share the good news that the Man in Black box <br>
was Rainy Day's 100th find!!! Woo-hoo! Darn, if we had known at the <br>
time we could have had a special celebration with everyone there!!<br>
After this mini-meet we are extra pumped for the Great Lakes <br>
Gathering next month! It'll be so fun to see all of you May Day folks <br>
again and to meet even more of our fellow boxers!! As I can now <br>
picture "A" of Doglvrs saying, "IT'LL BE TOTALLY AWESOME!!"  :-)<br>
Thanks so much again Doglvrs!! Maybe someday we will host a mini-meet <br>
of our own on the East side........although our side of the state is <br>
definitely no where near as scenic as your side!<br>
Have a great day everyone!<br>
