I am not so sure putting the exacto knives in your carry-on would be a good<br/>

other stuff inside them that they were so heavy that the seams started<br/>
ripping out.  Instead we now each have the largest allowable wheeled<br/>
carry-on suitcases and we put our backpacks INSIDE the suitcases.  We are<br/>
also able to fit our boots and other things inside the suitcase without<br/>
stressing the pack itself.  We always carry-on the REALLY important things -<br/>
LB stuff, clues &amp; boots.  Everything else, such as clothes or toiletries,<br/>
could be replaced fairly easily.<br/>

By the way, you are usually allowed 2 carry-on items if one is a purse or briefcase.  You can put a lot of stuff in a briefcase!<br/>
