Funny coincidence - I had stopped by last week to ask the owner, Paula,<br/>
permission to place it.  She didn't quite understand, but was willing to<br/>
give it a try.  So today I went back to show her, and who was there talking<br/>
to her but the former manager of The Paw, home of Sit-Sip-Stay-Box.  "Oh,<br/>
no, she's back with more letterboxes!"  Actually, he gave her a nice<br/>
endorsement of boxing - saying some weekends they saw about $100 worth of<br/>
business at the Paw just because of letterboxers coming in for the box.<br/>
Needless to say, now she's all set for you guys to come looking for the new<br/>
one!<br/>
