Thanks to Midnight Visitor for a wonderful clue, awesome hunt and <br/>
great stamp.  I highly recommend "Untitled".<br/>
We saw several parks that we would never have known were even there.  <br/>
On one trail, we saw a very well preserved (and very clean) skeleton <br/>
of a small mammal.  We haven't ID it yet, but know it is bigger than a <br/>
squirrel, but not as big as a racoon.  Our 7yo daughter declared that <br/>
it was totally worth becoming a burr-ball to see it.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
