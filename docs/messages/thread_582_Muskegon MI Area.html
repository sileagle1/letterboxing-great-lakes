                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  What a great decision to take the ferry across to Muskegon over <br>
the Labor Day weekend.  More and more boxes have been added since we <br>
booked our ferry tickets.  The current count for Muskegon county is <br>
40 boxes with more in surrounding counties.  We'll certainly have a <br>
full 3-day weekend, and will probably need to plan a return trip <br>
given the number of boxes in southwestern MI.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We in West Michigan are certainly looking forward to your visit!  <br>
Same goes for anyone else who decides to pay a visit to this side of <br>
the Great Lakes state -- we are more than happy to have you come <br>
visit and hunt down some of our boxes.<br>
<br>
Fall colors are breathtaking in Michigan, and there are some very <br>
nice color routes mapped out here, so make your plans for some <br>
autumn letterboxing in Michigan...<br>

<br>
Within the Muskegon/Battle Creek/Grand Rapids triangle, I bet there <br>
are close to 100 boxes with additional ones not too far outside that <br>
area.<br>
<br>
We've been busy ;-)<br>
