                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was out at Muskegon State Park yesterday doing a little last-<br/>
minute letterbox stuff before the Lazy Days Gathering on Saturday.  <br/>
The good thing is that the trails there are still as gorgeous as <br/>
ever and the lake is crystal clean -- it even had that wonderful <br/>
blue-green tropical look to it yesterday.  I hiked for a little over <br/>
3 hours and never ran into another person on the trail, although I <br/>
did see lots of wildlife, lots of swans in the Muskegon Lake area -- <br/>
one lonely swan in particular interested me, and I thought I even <br/>
saw traces of a bear up in the sand dunes!  I didn't see any poison <br/>
ivy at all and there were virtually no bugs (could change by <br/>
Saturday though, so bring bug spray just in case).<br/>
<br/>
The bad thing is that the road to get to the park is closed due to <br/>
bridge work.  There is a posted detour, but only 1-2 of the detour <br/>
signs mention this is the way to the State Park.  You will need to <br/>
follow the signs for the Ruddiman Ave. detour. (Ruddiman turns into <br/>
Memorial Drive which may be the road named in directions you have <br/>
for the park).<br/>
<br/>
So, in short...  coming off U.S. 31 north or south, take the M-120 <br/>
(North Muskegon) exit -- this is signed for the State Park.  Head <br/>
west to Whitehall Road.  At Whitehall Road head north.  Normally you <br/>
would then turn onto Ruddiman, but instead you are going to continue <br/>
north to Giles Rd.  At Giles, follow the detour signs and head <br/>
west.  Take this to Buys Rd., where you will follow the detour signs <br/>
and go south.  Buys Rd. ends at Ruddiman/Memorial Drive (actually <br/>
this is the point where the name changes).  You are now back on <br/>
course and should head west to the park.  It is a couple of miles <br/>
from this point to the Snug Harbor entrance -- if the road ends and <br/>
you are staring at Lake Michigan, you've passed Snug Harbor -- turns <br/>
around and come back about 1/4 mile.<br/>
<br/>
This detour also turns the "4 miles back to restaurants and grocery <br/>
store" to about 10 miles back, so if you were planning to grab a <br/>
bite at one of the local places, you may want to rethink and pack a <br/>
picnic.<br/>
<br/>
The forecast is looking good for Saturday -- sunny to partly <br/>
cloudy.  You should be able to catch a splendid sunset while there --<br/>
 who knows you may even see a mink while checking out the sunset!  <br/>
And there is an awesome view of the lighthouse from here, so bring <br/>
your camera!<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning to attend and have not already, please drop me <br/>
an e-mail to let me know you will be coming so I have an idea how <br/>
many folks to expect and we will know who to wait for before hitting <br/>
the trail as this is primary a "go look for boxes" kind of day and <br/>
we will only be at the park for a short time before we get going in <br/>
the morning.  Alternately, I will have my cell phone on me while we <br/>
are hiking and I get pretty good reception there.  If you show up <br/>
later in the day and are looking to meet up with us, you can give me <br/>
a ring (e-mail me privately for the number if you think this may be <br/>
the case for you).<br/>
