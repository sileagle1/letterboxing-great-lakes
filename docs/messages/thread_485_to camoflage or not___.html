                    <div class="plaintext-content">Generally, I think it's better to camouflage, particularly when the <br/>
letterbox is not near an athletic stadium, major skyscraper, <br/>
suspension bridge, or other potential target.  In natural areas, it's <br/>
unlikely there would be a threat, so it's less likely that someone <br/>
might jump to that conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen some pretty clever camouflage in urban areas lately <br/>
where, of course, camouflage tape would defeat its own <br/>
purpose.  Urban boxes tend to be microboxes, and would be <br/>
less often suspected of harboring something dangerous (this <br/>
may not be the reality, but it may be the perception if someone <br/>
comes across it).<br/>
<br/>
In the woods, I always camouflage tape my boxes and when I <br/>
check on them, there's often a moment of panic when I can't spot <br/>
them right away. :-)<br/>

I was surprised to note when I purchased my camouflage tape at Gander <br/>
Mtn that there atr least three different variations (hardwood <br/>
forests, softwoods, etc -- I can't remember the specifics).<br/>
Anyway, it's fun to try to match the environment where the box is <br/>

My daughter, Enders Angel, has painted up some of our boxes and geez <br/>
oh pizza do they ever blend in! The paint stuff is wearing off, <br/>
though so we'll try the cammo tape routine next.<br/>
<br/>
I have only camouflaged a few of our boxes so far and only the ones <br/>
in areas where I thought the heavy foot traffic might put them at <br/>
higher risk for going MIA or mischief.<br/>
<br/>
I've come across just a couple of boxes that have been camouflaged.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta tell you, there are soooooo many times that I've been glad <br/>
that the boxes I'm looking for are NOT camouflaged because that tiny <br/>
peek of plastic was EXACTLY what I need to zero in on the find. <br/>
Bindle Bum and I might still be out looking for the Inerlochen box <br/>
if it hadn't been for that glimpse of plastic. (grin)<br/>

I suggest that you should do whatever makes you most comfortable.<br/>

I might think twice about camoflaging them for just that reason.  Some folks <br/>
are so paranoid these days, and ya add some melodrama to that, and you might <br/>
have the CIA videotaping everyone who stops and visits the box.  :-)  And that <br/>
would be after they soaked it in water or tried to blow it up or something to <br/>
make sure it was "dead."   Imagine their surprise when they open it and find a <br/>
homemade rubber stamp.  But then.................<br/>
<br/>
Then the government will see the homemade stamp as some sort of terrorist <br/>
symbol and stake out the box.<br/>
<br/>
In the ones I've found, most of them were very well covered by rocks, stones, <br/>
or leaves and twigs, in their hiding places. A couple were surprisingly right <br/>
out in the open but not in a way that anyone would ever see them, and they <br/>
were where they'd receive no sun so there'd be no glint of plastic.  <br/>
<br/>
And a couple of others, I hid a little bit better than I found them because <br/>
it seemed to me that the plastic *was* just too noticeable.  But I have a <br/>
question about that.  How does one know exactly what the person who owns the box <br/>
meant for the box?  I hated to just leave them how I found them, but on the <br/>
other hand, I didn't know that that wasn't what the original placer intended.  I <br/>
just assumed it wasn't.  Is hiding it better than I found it always an OK thing <br/>
to do?  Should I notify the placer afterwards?  Right now, all the boxes I'm <br/>
searching for are within a couple of hours drive of my house, so it wouldn't <br/>
be a big deal to go back and redo it if the owner of the box wanted it left the <br/>
way I'd found it.  Or isn't it really all that big of a thing anyway?  I <br/>
mean, hiding them a bit better didn't goof up any clues or anything.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This reminds me of a funny story... my 9-year-old son and I were <br/>
searching for a box recently and, after following the clues without <br/>
much trouble, we came to the spot where the box should be.  We both <br/>
start looking around the area and he says "Hey Mom, what's this <br/>
thing?"  Preoccupied, I glance over and say it looks like a piece of <br/>
garbage.  He puts it down and we search for at least another half <br/>
hour (I hate giving up!).  Finally, after hearing my limit of <br/>
complaints from my son and 7-year-old daughter who was also with us, <br/>
I sat down on a log in frustration, looked down and saw this odd <br/>
shaped camouflaged container.  My son says "That's the thing you said <br/>
was garbage.  I tried to open it, but I couldn't."  Of course it was <br/>
the letterbox, but it was such a clever container that I couldn't be <br/>
too angry at myself for being so narrow-minded!  All of the boxes we <br/>
had found previously were the Rubbermaid box-type - nothing like <br/>
this.  Moral of the story: I'm a lot more open-minded (and I listen <br/>
more closely to my son!).<br/>

&gt; Well, Deedle and I are very close to finally planting our first <br/>
box.  We've got several pieces-parts of boxes lying around...a <br/>
location for one, but no stamp carved yet.  A stamp carved, but now <br/>
we need to scout where to plant it in the park we want to plant it.  <br/>
Ideas and half-written clues for another box...you get the picture.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Anyway, we had decided that we wanted to camoflage our boxes, so we <br/>
bought a roll of camy duct tape from Wal-Mart the other day, and I <br/>
set about taping up one of our containers to see what it looked <br/>
like.  The rational for camoflaging this box in particular is that <br/>
the woods where we want to place it are behind some houses, where <br/>
we've seen kids roaming the woods before.  The thought being that if <br/>
there's no gleaming plastic it will be relatively safe from curious <br/>
non-participants, in the event that it's dislogded from its hiding <br/>
place.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Once I was done, I looked at our camy-covered container, scratched <br/>
my head, and thought, "Found by the wrong person, they're going to <br/>
think this is a Trenchcoat Mafia thing or something..."  I mean, _we_ <br/>
all know it's innocent, but to someone who's not in-the-know, with <br/>
terror alerts what they are, are they going to think the worse?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So, fellow letterboxers, I ask for your opinions.  Is it better to <br/>
camoflage or not?<br/>

&gt; Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not <br/>
scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to <br/>
go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to <br/>
hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug <br/>
spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
