                    <div class="plaintext-content">As we told Eagle Eyes & M&8X a few times in person,<br>
they did an awesome job putting this gathering<br>
together.  Where to begin?  <br>
<br>
First, let's not forget Rosemarius and the Friday<br>
night sock hop.  We loved having the opportunity to do<br>
some exchanges beforehand in a more relaxed (and<br>
indoor air conditioned) setting!  Thank you, Rose, for<br>
organizing that!  And if anyone took a photo of Perdu<br>
and her red glasses, email it to me! :)<br>
<br>
When I first learned that the potluck was going to be<br>
around dinner time on Saturday, I thought that was<br>
odd, but it really worked out well.  Like someone else<br>
already posted, this gave us more time to spend<br>
dedicated to box hunting and not worry about missing<br>
out on food or other things (like the group photo we<br>
missed in 2005 :).  And it was a nice way to reunite<br>
everyone who was still there in the evening.  Whoever<br>
had the bagpipes, that was amazing!!!<br>
<br>
Now, during the day we did stop back at the shelter<br>
around the time of the "cooling summer rain" to<br>
regroup and get a few more exchanges before heading<br>
back to the trails.  There were still so many people<br>
we wanted to meet but missed - hopefully we'll get to<br>
meet another time!  That reminds me - TrailTracker,<br>
did we ever meet back up with you to finally do an<br>
exchange?  I don't remember if we did.<br>
<br>
The placement of the boxes was also great.  Like<br>
someone else said, there wasn't a lot of bunching up<br>
since the boxes were spread around the park in<br>
different areas.  And the few times we did start after<br>
the same box as another group it was nice meeting some<br>
more people and getting a few more exchanges, but we<br>
never felt like there were other boxers right on our<br>
tails.  Well, except for the Burma Shave series.  Mrs.<br>
Doglvrs, hope you get a kick out of the comments we<br>
wrote in the logbooks!<br>
<br>
Now, I do have a confession to make about the<br>
placement of the Memphis Drive-In box.  Although we<br>
created The Memphis Drive-In box, we did not plant it;<br>
we had sent it to M&8X ahead of time for planting.  So<br>
the credit for the unique hiding that we heard so much<br>
about goes to her and her planting crew, and if<br>
someone who took a photo of the hiding spot can email<br>
it to me I'd really appreciate it!!!<br>
<br>
And this leads me to our most memorable moment of the<br>
weekend - we fell victim, and fell hard, to the "Oh,<br>
we have time for one more box!" syndrome.  We decided<br>
to stop for the The Christmas Elves' Mr. Potato Head<br>
box en route back to the potluck dinner, since we were<br>
driving right past that trail anyway.  We were the<br>
first finders.  At around 6:30 at night.  Were we the<br>
only ones at the gathering who didn't get the memo<br>
that this hike was long enough to sing "99 Bottles of<br>
Beer on the Wall" in its _entirety_ on the hike to<br>
this box??  :)  What a way to end the boxing day!!<br>
<br>
I do believe, though, that between Friday afternoon,<br>
Saturday and Sunday morning we found all but 3 boxes<br>
placed for the event (Wisconsin Hiker & Martini Man,<br>
we never did make it to your boxes Sunday morning -<br>
our feet were just too tired after all the walking<br>
Saturday and then the '50s Jukebox series).  <br>
<br>
Oh, and don't let me forget the raffle prizes - wow! <br>
And I'm not just saying that because we won one of the<br>
backpacks (hey, we deserved it after the Mr. Potato<br>
Head hike!! ;).  The pack we won had some handmade<br>
logbooks, a block of MasterCarve, a Great Lakes logo<br>
bandana (perfect for me who's always wearing one on<br>
the trails!), a water bottle, a few bottles of water,<br>
a couple containers for new letterboxes, some Ink<br>
Dots, and I forget what all else - it was just great. <br>
And, in addition to singing 99 Bottle of Beer in its<br>
entirety this weekend, I also learned that Deedle<br>
Bug's arm is one ticket length shorter than Eagle<br>
Eye's :)  <br>
<br>
Thanks also to everyone Saturday night who shared<br>
their campfire with us as we went campfire hopping for<br>
a few more exchanges before calling it a night.  We<br>
cleaned the Jeep out when we got home Sunday, and I'm<br>
happy to report that it arrived home cootie-less.  Not<br>
sure about our letterboxing bag, though....<br>
<br>
Now back to work & the real world.  Thanks again to<br>
everyone for such a wonderful weekend!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">NO!!  We did not Doodle and Deedle Bug!  We did not exchange after all <br>
that.  There were several key folks I wanted to get exchanges in with <br>
that I missed.  I'm so sorry.  I hope to exchange with you both sometime <br>
in the future for sure!<br>
<br>
I also have a couple more things to add to the post-gathering posts.  <br>
Thank you so very much to all of you who donated yet more money and <br>
postcards for our troops!  I am just this morning opening envelopes and <br>
adding up the cash donations that were given to me on Friday and <br>
Saturday as I just kept putting them in my "safe place".  I am so <br>
grateful and humbled one more time.  Letterboxers are the best.  I <br>
cannot say this enough.  I have felt more support from our letterboxers <br>
than in any other organization that I am heavily involved in---no <br>
contest.  This means the world to me and most importantly to our <br>
soldiers who are really feeling the burden right now.  I promise you <br>
this money is going to good use!!  Right now the top two requests are <br>
beef jerky and those Crystal Lite To Go packs.  They are not getting <br>
enough protein and drinking water temps for those on the front lines in <br>
undisclosed locations reaches 110!!!  Using evaporation tricks, they <br>
are able to get water temps down to 80 in the wee hours but having the <br>
Crystal Lite to add is like heaven to them.  So any money that was not <br>
specifically designated to go to the St. Barbara medals, will go toward <br>
the Crystal Lite in this next round of care packages for June!<br>
<br>
***So my big question is---who is the VERY generous letterboxer who gave <br>
me cash that was put into an envelope-- taped shut and made from a cute <br>
piece of stationary paper with a blue house and blue picket fence on <br>
it?  On the outside it simply said, "For care packages! and a smiley <br>
face" ???  Please, please, let me know either here or off post---which <br>
ever you prefer.  I don't believe you got ANY stamp for this and I want <br>
to be sure to take care of that---but I also  would like to thank you <br>
more appropriately!!!  Everyone's generosity is amazing.  Congrats to <br>
Scoutdogs too for inching ever closer to being able to buy that K-9 <br>
vest!!  Gunner has his patch on his bandana---granted it is only stapled <br>
so far.  I will sew it on very soon!  :)<br>
<br>
My congrats to speedsquare as well on her 500th find!! Dr Watson just <br>
had her AQ anniversary cake yesterday AND I wanted to throw in some <br>
special cudo's to a few first time campers who did REALLY well!  <br>
Primitive Cin and TrailStomper and her daughter Emerald Frost and <br>
friend, Carrot Top!  Congrats and we celebrate this with you as well!<br>
<br>
Trail Troll---I never got to meet you!  TrailStompers and I were hoping <br>
to have a grand meeting of the Trail-people but we will have to put it <br>
on the agenda for another event!  I heard your campsite was a hoot with <br>
all the trolls you hung!  I will be checking out the photo posted in the <br>
album!<br>
<br>
Last, if you did not see, Mrs. Doglvrs' stamp for the collection of <br>
items in honor of Hartx6's Vietnam Vet father going to Grand Rapids, MI <br>
---was STUNNING!!!! <br>

Oh boy!  I can't wait!!!  : )  I owe M&8X & Eagle Eyes<br>
a debt of gratitude for placing these boxes -- I heard<br>
from many people that they were placed just the right<br>
length apart and were a pure pleasure to hunt up!<br>
I owe the poetic verse choice to Daddy's Girl -- I had<br>
it narrowed down to about 5 - and she's the one that<br>
picked the winner!  : )  <br>
Oh course it was a song that lead me to carve that<br>
series...<br>
<br>
We had so much fun at this year's gathering -- we<br>
didn't hunt many boxes, but we did get a few...of<br>
course "Great Balls of Fire" was first on our list,<br>
and it was awesome!!!  We also made it to the 50's<br>
Jukebox series -- Safari Man, YOU ROCK!  <br>
I'll bet you're sensing a theme here...  ; )  <br>
We got a few more too -- including Memphis Drive-In,<br>
which Mr. Doglvrs definitely was impressed with the<br>
hiding spot!<br>
<br>
We were back at the shelter - so I could chat and<br>
exchange, while Mr. & Daddy's Girl went to hunt the HH<br>
Hostel.  They got absolutely soaked in the<br>
down-pour...and since I had a terrible headache, we<br>
headed back to relax at the campsite.<br>
<br>
We were very impressed with the entire gathering --<br>
loved the dinner at the end idea, and the group photo<br>
time slot, which we just made!<br>
I'm hoping that next year, there will be less Poison<br>
Ivy (shudder) and that we get out boxing a few<br>
different times with different folks!  I missed that<br>
the most this year.<br>
<br>
Thanks again to our fantastic hosts!!  You guys are<br>
awesome!!!  : ))<br>

We will send you one too if you'd like....  Missy's e-mail is on AQ <br>
under DrWatson if you'd like to send your address there.  She'll see <br>
to it that you get it...  Most of the temps will only be there until <br>

them....<br>
