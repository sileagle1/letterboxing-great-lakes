                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
I'm new to the group.  Thought I'd come out and introduce myself.<br>
<br>
I heard about the Dartmoor letterboxes a long, long time ago and <br>
longed for the idea to come to the U.S.  I finally got around to <br>
checking on letterboxing again in 2001.  That was way back when there <br>
was only one lonely letterbox in the northern Illinois area.<br>
<br>
My first adventure in letterboxing was a mixed bag.  A few hits <br>
peppered with a lot of frustrating misses made my interest fade a bit <br>
(I started out with searching for most of the old missing Door County <br>
letterboxes in 2001 and a bunch of now missing Mount Desert Island, <br>
ME letterboxes in 2002).<br>
<br>
Luckily, I found myself a wonderful trail partner who is very <br>
intrigued with the concept of letterboxing.  Rebrab is one of those <br>
wonderfully cheerful, patient people that you just love having on the <br>
trail with you.<br>
<br>
So, just this last weekend we went down to Starved Rock and found <br>
eleven stamps including our very first hitchhiker!<br>
<br>
We found five of the six Starved Rock Lodge boxes.  Posts and Posts <br>
is definitely missing.  We found the correct site, searched around <br>
and came up with nothing.  Someone at the lodge confirmed the missing <br>
status of the box.<br>
<br>
Illinois Canyon is alive and well.<br>
<br>
I told Rebrab to finally stop poking around for Starved Rock Buffet.  <br>
We can't really confirm if that box is still there or not.  I was <br>
more concerned about not brushing up against all the poison ivy in <br>
the area.<br>
<br>
Three of the letterboxes we found were Funguswoman's.  Those <br>
definitely brought us to parks that we might not have thought to <br>
visit but were well worth the trip!<br>
<br>
Our last box was A Step Above the Rest.  We were ALMOST first.  We <br>
tried for it on Friday, but it was getting dark and I asked Rebrab to <br>
stop and try for it again the next day.  If only ;).<br>
<br>
Wellhow was that for a long-winded intro? :)<br>
<br>
I can't wait for our next letterboxing outing.  You'll be seeing more <br>
of our stamps out there soon.<br>
