only 2 teams to find it since it was planted over a year ago.  These <br>
are not difficult clues and no puzzle involved ;-)  It is a bit of a <br>
hike, but not difficult terrain and thoroughly rewarding as this is <br>
one of the most awesome trails I've been on this spring.  It is so <br>
varied -- from deep, dark, mossy woods to bright, open meadowland.  <br>
Many wildflowers in bloom and also a great place to do some bird-<br>
watching!<br>
