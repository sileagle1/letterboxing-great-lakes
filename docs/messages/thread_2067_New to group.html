family have been doing occasional letterboxing for<br/>
about 2 years and we are wanting to do more.  It is<br/>
really surprising to see how this hobby has taken off<br/>
in the past two years.  There were only abut 20 boxes<br/>
in northern Ill. when I started.  We have only found<br/>
21 boxes so far and are looking foward to doing more. <br/>
I hope it is now easier to post boxes we hide.  I hid<br/>
one when we first started but had a hard time getting<br/>
it posted on the sight.  It came up on the new list<br/>
but never got over to the Ill. list.  After that I got<br/>
discouraged.  A few boxers did find it then one<br/>
e-mailed that it had been destroyed.  By that time I<br/>
was unable to hike out to replace it because of a bone<br/>
spur in my foot.  Thats all better now and we are back<br/>
on the trails.  I know changes have been made and am<br/>
looking forward to placing some boxes.<br/>

Look forward to chatting with all of you.  Thank you<br/>
