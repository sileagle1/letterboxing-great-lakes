Remember how your BINGO card started without the free space? So<br>
today, instead of me calling a word, you get to choose any one word<br>
to make your free space and thus eliminate it from your Bingo card!<br>
<br>
HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART -- you must e-mail me to let me know what<br>
word you are choosing to eliminate. In order to be fair, all<br>
players must choose the word they are eliminating before we move<br>
forward with the game. To give everyone time to get in touch with<br>
me, there will be no new words called on Saturday or Sunday this<br>
week -- the next new word will be Monday morning. You have until<br>
midnight on Sunday night (1/13/07) to e-mail me with the word you are<br>
eliminating. Send your e-mail to me at letterbox@comcast.net and<br>
please include your trailname to help me in matching up with the<br>
correct card.<br>
<br>
If I do not receive an e-mail from you by midnight on Sunday, the<br>
center space on your card will automatically become your free space<br>
(*), just like on a traditional BINGO card.<br>
<br>
Since there have been 4 "G" words already called, one might surmise<br>
that a free word could give somebody a straight line Bingo, but not to<br>
worry as I don't believe that anybody had all 4 "G" words.  As far as<br>
I can tell, the free space choice will not give anyone a Bingo of any<br>
sort, although some could move themselves very close ;-)<br>
<br>
There is no right or wrong choice -- just whatever works best on your<br>
card in light of the words you've already crossed off.  Of course if<br>
you are WI_Hiker or Martini Man you'll probably need to come up with<br>
some other kind of strategy for picking your free word since using the<br>
words you already have crossed off as a cue can only be of help if you<br>
have words crossed off ;-)  Look at it this way, at least you have<br>
lots of choices!<br>
<br>
SpringChick<br>
<br>
<br>
(*) In the event that I do not hear from you and the middle space on<br>
your card is a word that has already been called, then your free<br>
space would be the one directly above the center space, etc.<br>

<br>
I picked the "g word" that gave me three in a row in the g column and <br>
two in a row in a different direction.  Let's see if that helps at <br>
all!  My luck, that'll be the next word called for real, so it'd be a <br>
wasted pick! LOL<br>
