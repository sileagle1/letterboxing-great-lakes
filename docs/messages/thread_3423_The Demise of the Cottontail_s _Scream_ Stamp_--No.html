I hibernate for the winter :-)  The photo from the bridge looks like it <br>
could be on a calendar!  Isn't there a letterboxers calendar with area <br>
photos?  You should submit that one!<br>

AQ does have a letterboxing calendar that people are invited to submit <br>
photos for inclusion.  I didn't buy the calendar, but I did check out <br>
the photos for the coming 2007 calendar.  Some pretty cool shots--I <br>
really liked the one by our very own SpeedSquare!<br>

just point and shoot.  I have an absolutely gorgeous photo of the area<br>
around Corbeau.  I'll send that to Ryan for consideration in 2008!  I put<br>
it on my new flash drive and I am going to see if I can make it into a<br>
puzzle or large photo for my living room.  I really surprise myself<br>
sometimes.<br>
