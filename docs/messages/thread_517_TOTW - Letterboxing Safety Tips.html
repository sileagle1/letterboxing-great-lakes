1)  Take the time to put together a basic first aid kit for your <br/>

bandaids, first aid ointment, ace bandage, aspirin, tweezers, etc.  <br/>
Sounds so common-sense, but easy to overlook in the excitement of <br/>

2)  Never post to this or any other online location the specifics <br/>
about an upcoming letterboxing adventure.  It may seem innocent <br/>
enough, but posting that you will be at XYZ park looking for the ABC <br/>
box on Sunday afternoon is too much information to make public, <br/>
especially if you are letterboxing alone.<br/>
<br/>
3)  If you do letterbox alone...  let somebody know where you are <br/>
going either by leaving home an itinerary or checking in while you <br/>
are out.  When I am out alone, I take my cell phone with me, not only <br/>
to have along for an emergency situation that may arise on the trail, <br/>
but also I use it to leave a record of where I am.  When I get to a <br/>
letterboxing destination, I call home and leave a message on the <br/>
answering machine of the park I am at, the box(es) I am seeking and <br/>
the time.  Same thing when I get to the next location.  This way if I <br/>
don't show up at home at the end of the day, somebody will be aware <br/>
of the last place I was at.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, as one letterboxer told me, those hats with the mosquito <br/>
netting over them make letterboxers look fierce enough to scare <br/>
off anyone with bad intentions :-).  The hiking staffs are good, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I do a lot of letterboxing on my own, and security is a big issue <br/>
for me.  I used to have to walk through very rough parts of the <br/>
mean streets of Chicago and often had to take good care of <br/>
myself there to ward off trouble.  It was a couple of years, <br/>
however, before I could get comfortable by myself on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
The way I began to gain confidence was by applying what I had <br/>
learned in the city as a lone woman pedestrian. In the city, I <br/>
walked with my keys in my fist and a whistle close at hand.  On <br/>
the trail, I don't use the keys because I'm juggling a compass <br/>
and a camera and the clues and my water bottle, etc.  I do carry a <br/>
whistle that can be heard if I hurt myself or if I need help.<br/>
<br/>
In the city, I learned to walk with more confidence than I <br/>
sometimes felt--always look like you know where you're going.  <br/>
On the trail this is less easy if you're looking for a letterbox, but <br/>
you can walk tall until you get to the general area, then take out <br/>
your camera as if you're searching for the perfect shot.<br/>
<br/>
My mother told me not to talk to strangers for good reason. <br/>
Letterboxers are a friendly, trusting lot. Women, in particular, are <br/>
taught to always be polite. If you're alone, particularly if you're <br/>
female, you can't afford to indulge in friendly conversation with <br/>
others.  This is against our natural inclination, but it's necessary <br/>
to keep yourself safe.  You've got to be tough and you've got to be <br/>
rather cold.<br/>
Just one example: some of you may recall that when I was <br/>
planting boxes for the Great Lakes Gathering this year, I locked <br/>
myself out of my car.  First safety tip: don't lock yourself out of <br/>
your car; carry an extra car key in your pack.  Second safety tip: if <br/>
you are so foolish as to lock yourself out of your car, please have <br/>
your cell phone with you so you can call for help.<br/>
<br/>
Other than standing next to the car in the pouring rain, there was <br/>
no place to wait and still see the car and the arrival of the <br/>
locksmith.   You'd think I had a neon sign flashing over my head: <br/>
POTENTIAL MARK HERE.  Two different creepy guys--no they <br/>
weren't being helpful, they were being creepy--drove up while I <br/>
was waiting for the locksmith (who only took 20 minutes from the <br/>
time I called).<br/>
<br/>
One backed off quickly when I narrowed my eyes and coldly said <br/>
my husband was simply using the facilities.  Safety tip: avoid <br/>
letting people know you're alone.  The next guy wasn't taking go <br/>
away for an answer.  My first instinct was to run to the outhouse <br/>
and lock myself in;  that did not sound very pleasant, I might <br/>
miss the locksmith or other sources of help, and I wouldn't be <br/>
able to tell if the creep went away.  So I just began walking <br/>
briskly to the road in and toward the park exit.  There were a few  <br/>
cars going by, the locksmith or ranger might be coming that way, <br/>
so it was relatively safe.  As I walked I said some really creative <br/>
curses ( I never swear, but I rehearse them before setting out so <br/>
I don't stumble over the words) and made rude gestures I never <br/>
otherwise make, and generally acted like a volatile, dangerous <br/>
crazy woman, and the guy took off.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is, just think about what you would do in certain <br/>
situations before you get into those situations.  Think about how <br/>
you will act, what you will say, and what you will do.  Visualize it in <br/>
your head ahead of time, and it will be easier to make safe <br/>
choices when you need to.<br/>

And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

Cell phone.  And no amount of  "American Gods" paranoia is going to convince me that a cell phone isn't a godsend on solo boxing trips.  Of course, if you're out of range, fat lot of good it does you then, right?  In which case, I suggest a big fat stick.<br/>
<br/>
And just be aware of your surroundings.  I know that half the time I look like an airheaded bimbo, fluttering from fiasco to fiasco, but I'm always aware of my surroundings.  If there's someone who's giving you the heebie-jeebies, studies conducted have shown that making a direct comment to the person reduces chances of becoming a victim.  <br/>
<br/>
Or, as Azobox can attest, a frosty tone and frigid glance can keep even the nicest people at bay.<br/>
<br/>
And those are the safety tips from Delirium, TRIATHLETE EXTRAORDINAIRRE (that never gets old *grin*)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

&gt; So for this week's TOTW, share with us your letterboxing safety <br/>
&gt; tips, both in terms of personal safety and basic hiking safety.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SpringChick<br/>
<br/>
This is an important TOTW, especially with so many new letterboxers <br/>
joining the ranks.<br/>
Obviously, a short, urban box letterboxing jaunt is not the same as <br/>
an out-in-the-wild box search but sometimes a letterbox trek turns <br/>
out to be more strenuous than the clues might have suggested.<br/>
<br/>
A common thread among hikers is "hope for the best and plan for<br/>
the worst", hence the general agreement on The Ten Essentials.<br/>
(This list is adapted from many references).<br/>
<br/>
1. Flashlight and spare batteries. If you're delayed getting off<br/>
the trail, it's easier with a light source.<br/>
2. Map. Websearch for maps of the letterbox area. Consider using <br/>
Terraserver or USGS maps.<br/>
3. Compass<br/>
4. Food &amp; water. `Nuff said. (A chocolate mini Hershey's is a<br/>
regular reward for us when letterboxing).<br/>
5. Appropriate clothing (rain gear?)<br/>
6. Sunglasses<br/>
7. First-aid kit<br/>
8. Pocket knife<br/>
9. Waterproof matches<br/>
10. Candle or firestarter<br/>
<br/>
The important comments already shared by others on this list about <br/>
personal behavior, especially when `boxing solo, can't be overstated.<br/>
Cell phones, whistles,  notification of locations being visited, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Above all, common sense.<br/>
