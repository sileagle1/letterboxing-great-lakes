                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've spent my first 45 minutes of work today reading all of your event stories...keep them coming!  I wish Deedle &amp; I could have made it, but our month of June was practically completely booked by the end of April!  If you did next year's gathering in Ohio, we'd really have no excuse to miss ;) .... but the Michigan slogans everyone have come up with are too good to pass up....and we've got fair warning to not let anything get in the way next year, even old college friends--we met up with some of my old college friends over the weekend, one who I hadn't seen since '97.  And trust me, they got an earful about this new hobby, and even helped Deedle &amp; me scout out a location to plant a box sometime in the near future.  I also got moquito bites aplenty on that walk, so it's _almost_ like I was with you guys? ;)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, if you'd like to see a picture of Deedle &amp; me since we were't there to meet in the flesh, visit www.geocities.com/doodle_n_deedle  We're (ok, me, because Jeff's learned that it's better to just let me be when I'm in front of the computer creating ;) slowly putting together a letterboxing website to share our stories &amp; plants.  We will be planting some boxes soon...as soon as we get a free weekend....<br/>
