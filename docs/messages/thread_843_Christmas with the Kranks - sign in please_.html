Hey, since its so nearby, would you mind if I stamped in while it <br/>
was here?  I'll send SpringChick a note re: meeting up, if you <br/>
approve. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; It was sent out to SpringChick last week.  Not sure where it is <br/>
right<br/>
&gt; now.  It is scheduled to go across the lake to Czeltic Girl on the <br/>
8th<br/>
&gt; to pay a visit to the WI mini-gathering.  I'm sure it won't be <br/>
able to<br/>
&gt; make the rounds to everyone before Christmas, but we'll do our <br/>
best to<br/>
&gt; get as many visits as possible beforehand, and then continue<br/>
&gt; afterwards.<br/>

&gt; &gt; How is this PLB coming along?  Haven't heard anything about it <br/>
for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; while and I was wondering if it had been sent out yet, seeing as<br/>
&gt; it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; November and all and the holiday postal rush is about to start.<br/>

Please, everyone...if you hear this is nearby and can arrange to stamp in,<br/>
please do!!!  That's the idea...I'd like to get as many Great Lakes boxers<br/>
in this one as possible!!<br/>

Dooouh! Sorry everyone. That was supposed to go private. I forgot<br/>
to change the drop down destination menu.<br/>
