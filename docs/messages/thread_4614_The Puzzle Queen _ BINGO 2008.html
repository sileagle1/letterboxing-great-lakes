Speaking of fun and games...  Bingo is on the way, just taking me longer to pull it together than I thought it would!<br>
<br>
This I can tell you...<br>
<br>
-  Bingo will begin January 1<br>
-  The format and games will be the same as last year but the list of terms will be different -- this is what I am still working on...<br>
-  To play, you will need to complete a card and send it to me along with an item for the Bingo Booty and $1 to go toward the cost of mailing prizes<br>
-  Entries will need to be received by me by December 28th, so don't let it catch you by surprise!<br>
<br>
The list of terms, the card template and complete instructions to follow.  Just wanted to let everyone know where things stand so you can pick up your booty item as you are out and about doing your Christmas shopping.<br>

  Anyone who knows me knows that I'm the puzzle queen (see, here's proof <br>
  http://gramatrickletterboxing.blogspot.com/2007/09/puzzle-<br>
  queen.html )...just joined the great lakes group and I hear there's a <br>
  puzzle in the offering. <br>
<br>
  Hoping to sniff out that sweet and sour treasure!<br>
