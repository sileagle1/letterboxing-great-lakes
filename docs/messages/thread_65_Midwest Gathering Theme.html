I think "cooler near the lake" is a very good one.  However, if it's<br/>
anywhere near Chicago and it's durn tollway, "It's takes it's toll"<br/>
is a possibility :)  Supposedly, I will have moved by then, so I<br/>
won't get to meet all of you delightful people in person, but I am<br/>
surprised that you don't keep the location secret and provide clues<br/>
to get there ;)  Or has that been tried and failed?<br/>
