I think "cooler near the lake" is a very good one.  However, if it's<br>
anywhere near Chicago and it's durn tollway, "It's takes it's toll"<br>
is a possibility :)  Supposedly, I will have moved by then, so I<br>
won't get to meet all of you delightful people in person, but I am<br>
surprised that you don't keep the location secret and provide clues<br>
to get there ;)  Or has that been tried and failed?<br>
