                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK everyone....the winner with Saturday's (1-22) 50 Boxes of Springchick is none other......drum roll please....SPRINGCHICK! She effectively took a whack and chopped the head off with Lake Michigan Chicken in her special space. We are all expecting chicken and dumplings at Deb's place. So, that brings the winners up to 3 with the 50 Boxes of Springchick game. Last week we had Socks3 and Wisconsin Hiker go to zen status with Serendipity. The game goes on until the BIG win. I wonder who'll be next? Congratulations Springchick...although the real winners are anyone who has found your boxes. If you haven't, make it a letterboxing goal!<br>
