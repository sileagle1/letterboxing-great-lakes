<br>
Its been nearly a year since the Chicago Underground<br>
box disappeared. It took me a long time to make<br>
another stamp, logbook and box, but its finally ready<br>
and hidden in place. My apologies for being so<br>
sluggish about replacing the box.<br>
<br>
I'm also ready to replace the Magic Hedge box tomorrow<br>
morning, but I'll need to rewrite the clues a bit for<br>
the new, improved hiding place. We'll see how long<br>
this one lasts. I found such a great hiding spot, oooh<br>
its perfect, you'll all love it!<br>
<br>
Also, as FungusWoman alerted me to, the Chicago<br>
Portage box is definitely gone. I guess they've been<br>
cleaning up brush at the park and discovered it. I<br>
took it off the clues list.<br>
<br>
Matt the Rat<br>
