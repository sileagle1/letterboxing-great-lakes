<br/>
Its been nearly a year since the Chicago Underground<br/>
box disappeared. It took me a long time to make<br/>
another stamp, logbook and box, but its finally ready<br/>
and hidden in place. My apologies for being so<br/>
sluggish about replacing the box.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also ready to replace the Magic Hedge box tomorrow<br/>
morning, but I'll need to rewrite the clues a bit for<br/>
the new, improved hiding place. We'll see how long<br/>
this one lasts. I found such a great hiding spot, oooh<br/>
its perfect, you'll all love it!<br/>
<br/>
Also, as FungusWoman alerted me to, the Chicago<br/>
Portage box is definitely gone. I guess they've been<br/>
cleaning up brush at the park and discovered it. I<br/>
took it off the clues list.<br/>
