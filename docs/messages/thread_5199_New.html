<br>
We just started letterboxing last weekend.    My husband 2 daughters and I <br>
found 2 boxes on our first day out! Was so fun. The girls 8 and 6 can't wait to <br>
go again! We do live somewhat near Afton State Park. Is it best to hold off on <br>
looking there for the time being?   Thanks for any help!<br>

I would advise holding off on boxes at Afton until all is sorted out.<br>
 At least you have plenty of other boxes in the area to look for in<br>
the meantime.<br>
<br>
Did you find out about letterboxing from the recent article in the<br>
newspaper there?<br>

Gee, just go to the Ranger Station and you can find many many MANY boxes all at one spot. <br>
<br>
Though on your PFX count it may only count as ONE find with many boxes to enjoy.<br>

 Yes we did discover letterboxing from the Pioneer Press article. Thanks for the Afton advice.? We have been gone. Now we are ready to begin letterboxing again. We have a few in mind. Hopefully Afton will be up again soon!? Thanks!<br>
