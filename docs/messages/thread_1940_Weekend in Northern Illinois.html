FungusWoman, Snoozer, Nature Nerd, and Jar the Ladybug for providing a <br>
really great weekend of letterboxing in the La Grange/Brookfield area <br>
of northern Illinois.  Also, a big thanks to Martini Man and Wisconsin <br>
Hiker for "clueing" us into this lode of letterboxes.  Perfect weather, <br>
great hikes, leaves swish-crunching underfoot, Pumpkin Ice Cream <br>
at "Sit..Sit..Stay, and excellent stamps all made for a much <br>
appreciated re-creational time.<br>
  And to top it off (Wonder of Wonders!!) we got our first "on-the-<br>
trail" exchanges with Cottontails, Cake Baker, and K8E.  How much <br>
better can it get???  <br>
  Again, thanks to all.<br>
  Merlin and Ardea  <br>
