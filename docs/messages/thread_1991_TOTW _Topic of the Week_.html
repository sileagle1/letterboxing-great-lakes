reviving the TOTW.  This was a fun thing we did for several months (a <br/>
year?) when we first got the list going.  It kind of fizzled out <br/>
because we ran out of topics and we were all so busy with <br/>
letterboxing...  But a lot has changed in letterboxing since then and <br/>
we have so many new members that it might be fun to revisit some of <br/>
these topics, particularly as we head into winter and outdoor 'boxing <br/>
trips kind of slow down for many people.<br/>
<br/>
I personally do not have the time right now to facilitate the TOTW -- <br/>
we have two weddings in planning in my family for 2006, but if there is <br/>
interest in starting this back up again and there is somebody who would <br/>
be willing to facilitate it, please e-mail me.<br/>
