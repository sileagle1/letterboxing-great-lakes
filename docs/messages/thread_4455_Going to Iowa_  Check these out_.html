in need of someone to check out the Iowa boxes that are in the <br>
letterboxing basement.  A number of us found them years ago, but <br>
don't live nearby, so haven't been able to check on them.  So, if you <br>
head over that way, please consider giving them a try and let us know <br>
if they are still active.  If you do live nearby, please consider <br>
adopting them.  If any are missing, and you'd like to replace and <br>
adopt, a number of us do have the stamp images to re-create the stamp <br>
from.<br>

IA Hosper's Furniture Store - I went to check on this in the summer <br>
of 2005, but the store had just closed by the time I go there.  I <br>
left a note on the door, but haven't got a reply.  Although the town <br>
is still small, it is bigger now, so one WOULD notice a person <br>
driving backward down Main St. !!! :-)<br>
<br>
IA Turkey Creek =<br>
IA Iowa Image - I think was reported missing<br>
IA Effigy Mounds - most likely still in place - great place and stamp<br>
IA Mount Hosmer - ditto<br>
IA McCloud Run <br>

Thanks!<br>

Thanks for pointing my attention to this site. I haven't come across it  <br>
before.<br>
 <br>
We will be going up to Guttenburg area either a week from today or late Oct  <br>
(more probably Sept. 29th). Anyhow, I see there are a couple Iowa boxes listed <br>
 for the area and thought I would check to see if we could find them.<br>
 <br>
Then I saw one was a 4 mile hike -- way to long with 4 youngins and the  <br>
other is in Lansing. We decided years ago to drive up to Lansing and it just  <br>
added to much time to our day (at the time my oldest daughter was just born....  <br>
well, I guess she was more like 6 months). <br>
 <br>
Anyhow, don't think we will have time the go around. Perhaps next year (as  <br>
this is an annual trek we make when the leaves start changing colors).<br>

I have to check out scrapbook to be sure, but I'm *pretty* sure -- like,<br>
say, 80% sure -- that we found this box early this spring, when we did some<br>
boxing while tooling thru Iowa.<br>
<br>
It's always fun to check out the basement before we go when we're heading<br>
for the great lands of Never-Been-There-Before.  Most we never find but have<br>
found a few.<br>
