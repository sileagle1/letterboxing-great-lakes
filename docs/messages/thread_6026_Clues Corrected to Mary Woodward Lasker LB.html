                    <div class="plaintext-content">My apologies go out to any boxers who tried to solve the clues to my Mary Woodward Lasker box.  Someone tried to gently clue me in about one of the problems.  But when I was asked today about a specific part of the clue, I tried to solve it myself.  There were at least four errors or clarifications that needed to be made.  And they have been.  Once again, I am sorry.<br/>
