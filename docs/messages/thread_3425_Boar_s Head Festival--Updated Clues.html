                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've just updated the clues on LbNA and AQ for our Boar's Head Festival <br>
Series.  Boxes 1-4 are still out in the woods of River Forest.  Box #5 <br>
will only be available at the church on the 2 days of the performance--<br>
and that is this weekend (Dec 9 & 10)!!  More info on the Boar's Head <br>
Festival in general and the clues to this last box are in the posted <br>
clues.  <br>
<br>
If you can find time in your busy December schedules to come, I think <br>
you would really enjoy it.  We had one of our big rehearsals last <br>
night, and we are really looking forward to the performances--so much <br>
fun and also a wonderful way to personalize the birth of the Savior.<br>

We got the first 4 Boar's head boxes a few weeks ago with our son who <br>
was suffering from what we had been told by the doc was two broken <br>
ribs...turns out they are just badly "traumatized"....he was REALLY <br>
bored to have gone with us....<br>

We're so glad you're coming!!--which performance?  I'll try to keep <br>
an eye out for ink-stained guests, when I'm not serving cookies <br>
during the performance.  <br>

Some of us will be easier to spot than the others.  Do-Re-Mi Gal is <br>
the only one of us who is a "solo" performer--she is the Star of the <br>
East.  Ball Magnet is one of the many singing waits, although he is <br>
the taller little boy who is front and center during their dance.  <br>
Money Man is one of many shepherds--he is also up front during their <br>
scene (green robe with a big furry vest).  During the dress <br>
rehearsal, he put on a pair of shades to protect his eyes from the <br>
brilliant light of the angels--the director got a big chuckle out of <br>
that, but I don't think he'll be repeating that little stunt for the <br>
performances :~)  We serving wenches all look pretty much the same--<br>
my dress is drab blue with pink sleeve inserts and with a hot pink <br>
shift underneath.  You may see me lurking at the back of the center <br>
aisle during the performance as I am the stage manager in charge of <br>
sending people in at the right time.  I really think you'll enjoy it!<br>

Hey, maybe you could try Sunday afternoon.  Our shows are Saturday (4 <br>
and 7 pm) and Sunday afternoon at 4pm.  What an odd fluke that 2 <br>
Boar's Head Festivals are occuring in 2 connecting suburbs--and its <br>
not like there are loads and loads of Boar's Head Festivals (I know I <br>
had never heard of it until our church first did it a few years back)<br>
