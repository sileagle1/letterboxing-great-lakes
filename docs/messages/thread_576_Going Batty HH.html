Vampire boxes to send to the Monster Mash, and I notced that the Going<br>
Batty HH wasn't in any of the boxes.  I'm hoping that it wasn't in one<br>
of the last two boxes which were destroyed by animals, and that<br>
someone picked it up thinking it was a "normal" HH. If you have the<br>
Going Batty HH or know of its location, pleae email me off list.  I'd<br>
like to get it back with the series it belongs in.<br>

Thanks!<br>
