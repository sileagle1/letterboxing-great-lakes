I have a small 1.5 x 3" piece of Mastercarve that I'd like to cut in <br/>
half so that I have 2 thinner 1.5 x 3 pieces of Mastercarve.    I've <br/>
never carved anything on this medium, but the thickness seems like a <br/>
waste to me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure some one hear has done that.   I was just wondering anyone <br/>
had any suggestions.  Is it a bad idea?  Will I end up destroying the <br/>
whole piece?  If it works, what'd you use to cut it in half?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help you can provide.<br/>

breaking in half because there was no backing on them.<br/>
I have run into this same problem with a couple stamps<br/>
I cut in half. Next time, I'll make sure I use a<br/>
backing on them.  <br/>
