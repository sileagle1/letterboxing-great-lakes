As the weather gets (sometimes) nicer, I thought I should go check up on my boxes.  Here's the scoop:<br>
<br>
Ken Sings series: Unfortunately, this whole series had to be yanked, due to the fact that the entire site of the first box (upon which the other boxes referenced for clues) was cut/mowed/generally destroyed.  Shockingly, whoever cut the tree was nice enough to put the box in a nearby low hanging bough, and I salvaged it.  So bad news, it's temporarily yanked, good news is as soon as the school year's done, I'll be able to recarve, reclue, and replant.<br>
<br>
Coyote is a Trickster:  Alive and well.  With all the spring growth though, it's imporant that people don't make a beeline to and from the box, otherwise there will soon be a very obvious trail to the location.  <br>
<br>
The Nose Knows:  Will check on this one after work today.  Stampin' Pam checked on it for me a while ago, and all was well, so I'm assuming that it's still ok.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
So there you go.  Two out of three ain't bad, right?  And with the weather maybe getting better, it's always as fun for me to plant boxes as it is to find them...<br>
