We have room for 3 more teams of two.<br/><br/></div><div>Also, we have a lovely pavilion in Creve Coeur Park all that day, and are planning a potluck. There will also be boxing opportunities that are non-race related. So please feel free to sign up for the non-racing event too. All are welcome to that. Still trying to convince my honey to have his band play (classic rock), but I haven't gotten too far yet. <br/>
