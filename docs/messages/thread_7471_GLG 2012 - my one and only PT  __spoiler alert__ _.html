If you think you know the answer, you should cross-check your work.  All good students do that.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did the same thing about a month ago with Caveman's sig stamp.  I carved it years ago, I thought it was perfect for him.  As a caveman, he goes back about 300 million years, so I thought a nice pteridophyte was right on target.  He didn't think so.  And personally, I think I did a really good carving job.  He also will not admit to letterboxing.  So last month I began to carry the stamp as a personal traveller.  <br/>

What ya gonna do?<br/>
