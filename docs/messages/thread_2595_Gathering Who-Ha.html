Wisconsin!<br/>
Thank you, thank you, thank you Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man - You ROCK!<br/>
<br/>
First I must say that I will now have a new appreciation for all cars I see <br/>
in Michigan that have a Wisconsin license plate - dang that was a long <br/>
drive!<br/>
<br/>
We were able to hunt up a few more boxes on Sunday morning before heading <br/>
home.  The stamps we hunted were phenomenal!  Thank you for letting me add <br/>
them to my logbook!<br/>
<br/>
Exchanging is my favorite part of gatherings - I love meeting new people and <br/>
chatting.  So - thank you to all the folks that brought along a boy "the <br/>
skull's" age - you are a blessing to me!!!  ; )  I was able to chitty-chat <br/>
all I wanted!<br/>
<br/>
Also - thank you to all who of you excellent Great Lakes letterboxers!  I <br/>
just love this hobby and the community it creates!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, to everyone who took the time to speak my love language to me - <br/>
Thank you!!!  I feel famous!  ; )<br/>
