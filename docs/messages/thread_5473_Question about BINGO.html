to fill out my card.  I read all of the directions in the files, etc.  The<br>
one things that confuses me is that I'm supposed to have "found the box," <br>
exchanged with the person," "attended the event," etc.  What if none of the<br>
boxes I have found or people I've exchanged with are on the BINGO list??? <br>
And what if I have never gone to an event???  <br>
<br>
Does that mean I can't play this time around?  I don't mind waiting, but I<br>
just didn't understand this.  <br>
<br>
Another question is, I understand that the columns have to stay in order,<br>
but does all of the top row have to have the letterbox names, all of the<br>
second row have to have the trail names, all of the third row event names,<br>
and so on, as in the directions?  Or do we jumble up the locations of them? <br>
<br>
<br>
And to have exchanged the signature stamps with a person means I would've<br>
had to have met the person, right??<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Anyone can play. You don't have to have found any of the boxes, done any exchanges, or attended any events at all! If you haven't found any of the boxes listed (and there are so many boxes to choose from in the Great Lakes region that many of us who have been letterboxing for years only have one or two boxes on that list...I myself don't have any I don't believe) or done any exchanges or gatherings on the list then you simply use general terms instead. <br>
<br>
The words you pick can go anywhere in the column, you could put a general term in the upper left corner or a letterbox in the lower corner if you like as long as they stay in the same column. If they had to stay in the same row (top row letterboxes, second row exchanges, and so on) not only would people who didn't have any of those terms not be able to play, but the game would be over pretty quickly indeed and there would be a lot of multiple winners because there would only be a few ways to organize the card.<br>
<br>
And yes, in order to exchange signature stamps with someone you would have had to meet them in person.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, you can still participate in Bingo by sending Springchick<br>
$1, a booty bingo item (prefereably something a letterboxer would<br>
use), and a copy of your completed bingo board.<br>
<br>
In response to your questions: Yes..in order to use a letterboxer's<br>
name on your card you must have personally met that boxer and did an<br>
exchange with them of some sort. For an event, you must have<br>
personally attended the event. To use a letterbox, you must have<br>
physically gone out and found that box and stamped in (and no....I'm<br>
not sure it counts if a friend did it and you weren't there). So, if<br>
none of these apply to you then you will need to move on to the<br>
general items and fill your card in with those. Just remmber to only<br>
fill in the B column words in the B column, and etc. or else you will<br>
never win. Don't worry though...these words are called too jst as much<br>
as the others, if not more. I suggest rereading the FAQ about BINGO<br>
that SC has posted to clarify.<br>
<br>
So, in regards to your other questions: No, the top row is not all<br>
letterboxes, the 2nd row is not all trail names, the 3rd row is not<br>
allevents, etc. So yes, jumble it up.<br>
<br>
And if I may say so, welcome to the BINGO game. This is also my first<br>
year playing, although I've closely watched and played off wager for<br>
the last two years. It is definitely the SLOWEST bingo game you'll<br>
ever play, but I think everyone will agree that it's more social than<br>
anyhthing. <br>
<br>
Check the boards daily...these people are nuts!(LOL) Hey, aren't we<br>
all though. I mean really, we do all this to find a rubber stamp and<br>
logbook, fighting the weather, deciphering clues, and fending off<br>
other crazy letterboxers and wild animals (no pun intended, Mrs.<br>
Doglvrs...lol).....and it sure is FUN!!!!!<br>
<br>
Furthermore, you should definitely attend an event and meet some of<br>
these people (especially a SC event!) Welcome aboard!<br>

Kimono Girl and Familyof6 did a great job of answering your questions so I won't repeat what was already said.  If you still are unclear after reading their responses and the FAQ, please feel free to e-mail me with any additional questions.  Glad to have you playing Bingo with us this year!<br>

  Subject: [LbGLK] Question about BINGO<br>
<br>
<br>
  I'm not quite understanding this BINGO thing. I made a booty item and went<br>
  to fill out my card. I read all of the directions in the files, etc. The<br>
  one things that confuses me is that I'm supposed to have "found the box," <br>
  exchanged with the person," "attended the event," etc. What if none of the<br>
  boxes I have found or people I've exchanged with are on the BINGO list??? <br>
  And what if I have never gone to an event??? <br>
<br>
  Does that mean I can't play this time around? I don't mind waiting, but I<br>
  just didn't understand this. <br>
<br>
  Another question is, I understand that the columns have to stay in order,<br>
  but does all of the top row have to have the letterbox names, all of the<br>
  second row have to have the trail names, all of the third row event names,<br>
  and so on, as in the directions? Or do we jumble up the locations of them? <br>
<br>
<br>
  And to have exchanged the signature stamps with a person means I would've<br>
  had to have met the person, right?? <br>

letterbox, you must have<br>
physically gone out and found that box and stamped  in . . ."<br>
 <br>
This is true, however, you can also use a box that you have planted -- not  <br>
just found.<br>
