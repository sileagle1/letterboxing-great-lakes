                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many of the other posts mentioned most of the key items in our<br/>
letterboxing backpack.  Instead of a ground cloth, we carry a couple<br/>
of stadium cushions that have been retired from regular season use. <br/>
These are the rectangular variety, which help the pack keep its shape<br/>
without adding too much weight or bulk.  The extra padding is<br/>
appreciated by the knees or backside when the ground is wet, the rock<br/>
is pointy, or the stump is crumbly.  We pack out whatever we pack in,<br/>
but were also adding a bag to pack out the litter we see along the<br/>
way.  <br/>
<br/>
We learned about letterboxing when Wisconsin Hiker e-mailed the local<br/>
hiking group about it.  We checked out some of the LbNA materials and<br/>
decided to give it a try.  One of the local boxes is close to home<br/>
and we had a commercial stamp on hand that was just right for us, so<br/>
we matched the stamp with a name and off we went.  Our first find<br/>
included an Azobox hitchhiker, which encouraged us to continue<br/>
letterboxing.  In the future, our letterboxing adventures may inspire<br/>
us to carve our own signature stamp or design a custom stamp.  Were<br/>
not ready to replace our signature stamp, but we have carved a couple<br/>
of stamps, adopted a couple of boxes, planted one box, and have plans<br/>
for a few more stamps and boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to SpringChick for starting the regional group and the great<br/>
logo stamp!<br/>
