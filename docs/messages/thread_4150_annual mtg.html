So far every state except Indiana and Minnesota have hosted, so it should be one of those two states next year.<br>

Welcome!<br>
<br>
It is likely that next year's regional event will be held in Minnesota <br>
or Indiana, since the goal is to have it rotate among the 6 states in <br>
the region. <br>
<br>
However each state may have other events throughout the year.  <br>
Tentatively there is talk of an event in Milwaukee area around AUG 25, <br>
central IL on SEP 8/15. northwestern IL late SEP or early OCT and <br>
northeastern IL on NOV 18.  Hopefully several of these will occur and <br>
you might be able to make it to one or more!<br>
<br>
Stay tuned to this board for more info...<br>
