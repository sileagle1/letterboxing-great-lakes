<br/>
My own "protocol" is to email the placers directly both when we find AND<br/>
don't find a box.  As a planter of boxes I like updates on the box status<br/>
("in good shape", "needs new book", "box is cracked", etc) so assume other<br/>
people may appreciate the same feedback.  If a box is in good shape, I don't<br/>
necessarily need to go check on it for a while.  If it is in bad shape<br/>
and/or possibly missing, it alerts me to go check on things.  [Note:  I<br/>
didn't initially have this protocol, but after we started placing boxes I<br/>
realized how nice it was to get feedback, so then started emailing even when<br/>
a box was in good shape.]<br/>
<br/>
I also email the creator of a hitchhiker when we find one since they<br/>
normally like to track the HH travels.  I usually copy "Pete" on the info so<br/>
he can update the HH tracking page.<br/>

&gt; that point? I did not. I did, however, posta bout it a lot in my online<br/>
&gt; journal, which Dagonell reads. So I hooked him on it, and HE folloewd up,<br/>
&gt; and now he's dragging me around (ok, he didn't have to twist my arm very<br/>
&gt; far at all), and I'm re-hooked. So fair's fair. :-&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After all, when I've only been a real letterboxer for a single<br/>
&gt; weekend and my count stands at P0F7X1, that's a sign of something, isn't<br/>
&gt; it? To be a bit more detailed (and because I know you're all interested),<br/>
&gt; my Found list is as follows, to date:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hurray for Hollywood<br/>
&gt; Historic Chicago Box #2: Columbian Exposition<br/>
&gt; Chicago Underground<br/>
&gt; Grosse Point Light<br/>
&gt; Fish Out of Water 4<br/>
&gt; History Tower<br/>
&gt; Schoolhouse Rocks!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In no particular order. We also tried for, and couldn't find,<br/>
&gt; several, and we wonder if perhaps they're missing. What's the protocol on<br/>
&gt; that, post it here and expect people to read about it, or email the<br/>
&gt; placers directly?<br/>

<br/>
I see Eloise has already posted.  I knew she was well and truly hooked<br/>
when I pulled out the first hitchhiker and she squealed like a school<br/>
girl! :D  <br/>
<br/>
Da Chicago Report:<br/>
<br/>
Clark House: We couldn't find it.  I would have said it was missing,<br/>
but I read the placer's post that it's still there.  I guess we just<br/>
missed it.<br/>
<br/>
Columbian Exposition: Present, but not safe.  The "hedge" has been cut<br/>
all the way down.  We tried to re-hide the box better than we found<br/>
it, under grass clippings and leaves, but it really should be covered<br/>
in camo tape. If the groundskeeper had been a little more diligent, it<br/>
might have been disposed of as litter.<br/>
<br/>
Forest Goblin: We couldn't find it, however the clues needed<br/>
re-arranging.  When we got to the field, we discovered a *large*<br/>
family celebration taking place.  I decided if I couldn't be discrete<br/>
I would pass it up rather than reveal its location, however the point<br/>
was moot because the outhouse was gone!  We tried to extrapolate, "If<br/>
it was here, then we would go..." but it didn't work.  We couldn't<br/>
find it.  I see the placer will be updating the clues shortly.<br/>
<br/>
Planes, Sand and Stars: Without giving too much away, I could never<br/>
have checked the hiding place if I had been solo.  Working together,<br/>
we still couldn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
River Trail: We got to the site just as it was closing and couldn't go<br/>
on the trail.  Could the placer please insert into the clues that the<br/>
park closes at 4:30?  We were tackling boxes from outside into<br/>
Chicago.  If we had known of the time limitation, we would have hit it<br/>
earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Grosse Point Lighthouse: Safe and sound.  Nice site, cool hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
Schoolhouse Rock: Wonderful site.  The logbook was so busy, we hung<br/>
around for a short while to see if we could spot anyone counting steps<br/>
up the trail! :D  <br/>
<br/>
History Tower: Safe and sound<br/>
<br/>
Hooray for Hollywood: Safe and sound.<br/>
<br/>
Fish Out of Water #4:  Very cool stamp, nice historic site.  The<br/>
letterbox was actually out in the open, plainly visible!  We put it<br/>
back where it belonged and spent a minute with a bark chip making a<br/>
cover that exactly fit the hole!  It's there, but you can't tell it's<br/>
there!  You have to feel around for it.<br/>
<br/>
Chicago Underground:  Possibly THE COOLEST urban letterbox hunt I have<br/>
ever been on!  The trail was wonderful, the clues were great, the<br/>
hiding place was boss!  When I read "something to eat, something to<br/>
eat, something to eat and something to drink" I started looking for 3<br/>
fast food joints and a bar!  When I realized what the clue actually<br/>
meant, it was a genuine forehead slapper!  Matt the Rat deserves a<br/>
medal for this one!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, The Great Serpent Mound HH and E. Tuttle HH?  Well, I could tell<br/>
you, but then I'd have to make you walk the plank! :D<br/>

When I read Eloise's post yesterday, I commented that I'd have appreciated a private <br/>
message before having my boxes reported "missing" to the larger group on this board. <br/>
She did immediately write me to describe the problems you two had, and I went last night <br/>
and checked all the boxes before writing back to her and posting an update that they're all <br/>
safe and sound and had several visitors over the weekend. So, though I admit I'm probably <br/>
just a bit sensitive about my boxes, I guess I don't quite understand why you decided to <br/>
post about your problems in finding them again.<br/>
<br/>
Until recently there weren't all that many boxes in the suburban Chicago area, and even <br/>
now there aren't nearly as many as we'd probably all prefer. I think it's safe to say that I <br/>
and everyone else who plants boxes around here for everyone to enjoy feel protective of <br/>
them...and to be called out for the second time on "missing" boxes that are right where <br/>
they should be, especially without the courtesy of a private message or even the use of my <br/>
name (I'm Pico, not "the placer"), feels kind of like an undeserved slap in the face.<br/>

I have already apologized privately, but let me do so again publically.<br/>
I enjoy reading of others adventures while letterboxing and thought<br/>
people would like to hear of our adventures.  I did not mean to offend<br/>
anyone, or make accusations.  I said that we couldn't find several<br/>
letterboxes, that is not saying they're missing.  If being referred to<br/>
