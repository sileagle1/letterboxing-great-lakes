lost.  Did he ever return home?  Clues have been posted.<br>
<br>
His mate, however, was blown over a great lake and onto a pleasant <br>
peninsuala.  She found herself in the northern portion of this <br>
peninsula with an injury that prevented flight.  Longing for her mate, <br>
she decided to bravely hitchhike around the great lake on her way back <br>
home.  If you find her, please advance her a toward Stoughton, WI.  <br>
But don't take her too far at once (no more than 50 miles per leg of <br>
the journey).  Her injury means that lengthy travel is impossible and <br>
dangerous, but over time - and with your help - she hopes to be able <br>
to see her partner on the shores of Lake Kegonsa again.<br>
