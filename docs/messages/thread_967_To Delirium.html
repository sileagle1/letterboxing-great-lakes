Subject: Re: Re: June 18 - GL Gathering - Location?<br/>
Before I left in exile (oops, it doesn't help to think of the move like<br/>
that), I arranged with Team Rabbit to plan the Gathering. And I HAD been<br/>
planning on coming, but seeing as how the doctor keeps telling me that the<br/>
newest member of the Donaldson family is due on June 16th, it doesn't seem<br/>
likely that I'll make it to the Gathering. I'm pushing for the baby to be<br/>
born on Michigan soil, but my husband tells me that's just freaky and sort<br/>
of like how people from Texas speak. Go figure. So it seems unlikely that I<br/>
will be able to con my way to the Gathering this year, as much as it breaks<br/>
my heart to admit. Something about those maternal sacrifices....?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
