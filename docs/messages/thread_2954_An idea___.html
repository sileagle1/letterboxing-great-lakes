Im debating on planting a "Geocache Letterbox" A box that has both <br/>
clues, AND Coordinates. (Along with a logbook, and trinkets) My <br/>
intent is to place a PROMINENT writeup ON the logbook to explain to <br/>
local Geocachers WHAT a letterbox is, and to NOT ever remove the <br/>
stamps IF they should come across any others. What does everyone <br/>
think?? (Obviously the letterboxers will know what it is before they <br/>
head out - it would be in the clues!)<br/>
<br/>
I know that I have read MANY times about stamps being 'traded' <br/>
accidentally and perhaps, if everyone who HAD the ability to plant <br/>
a 'Geocache Letterbox' would, we could prevent it from happening, at <br/>
least on a small local level.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, we just discovered that we have a plant in the same <br/>

there already.  We found one in Michigan one summer. <br/>
I think there were actually two logbooks - one for the<br/>
geocachers to sign, and another for the letterboxers<br/>
to stamp, and like you suggested, there was a<br/>
statement on the logbook explaining not to take the<br/>
stamp.  Another idea would be to spell out in the<br/>
clues that it's a Geocache/Letterbox hybrid and<br/>
explain what letterboxing is and that the stamp is to<br/>
be left in the box.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=286f64a1-ff2d-4808-8203-5eeacd46165e<br/>
<br/>
I've been doing this for over 2 years and have never had a stamp traded out and very rarely do I find something in the box when I do maintenance visits - usually if something is left in the box it's a signature item.<br/>
<br/>
I ask geocachers to get creative, if they don't have a stamp I ask them to try a nature stamp, or a drawing or some other creative things. So far geocachers have left lots of cute stick figure drawings and simple line drawings. Some have made custom signature stamps, a couple have carved their own and some use store-bought sig stamps. You'll get a real mix. Go for it. :)<br/>

one geocacher suggested that I post on the geocache site with the <br/>

only find the box by solivng the clues).<br/>

- We weren't the first to find it as a cache or letterbox, and the finders<br/>
did seem to understand not to take the stamp and letterbox items, as they<br/>
were clearly identified.  It was cleverly planted in a large rural mailbox<br/>
spray painted as camouflage.<br/>
<br/>
I would have a separate logbook for each activity and mark the logs IN<br/>
LARGE PRINT.  Having an adequate size container to house both activities<br/>
will probably help.  You might not want to encourage HH's to this hybrid<br/>
box, because all the explanation in the world will go out the window if<br/>
they confuse the box stamp and the HH's.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know the members of the local geocaching community?  How<br/>
aware/respectful are they of letterboxing?  You might want to get some<br/>
feedback from them.<br/>
<br/>
Just some on the spot thoughts,<br/>
