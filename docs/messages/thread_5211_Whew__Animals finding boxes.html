Oh, how neat is that? Quite often while letterboxing Deedle & I will beseech <br>
a frog or a bird or a butterfly or a squirrel to help lead us to a box, but <br>
so far no wildlife has yet to aid us on a hunt.<br>

Kimono Girl and I used to joke that we would teach the dogs to do this, back<br>
when we only had one dog each. Particularly when we thought we were close<br>
to the box but just couldn't find the right tree. My girl dog has no nose<br>
