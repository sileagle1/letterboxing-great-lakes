As most of you know, part of our winter fun is playing the Great Lakes Letterboxing
BINGO game started by SpringChick back in 2006. The illustrious Mr. Familyof6 then
took the reins for two years and now I'm honored to be hosting the BINGO game
for a second time. We're hoping to have a lot of participants for the 2014 game,
so spread the word. You sure wouldn't want to miss experiencing the slow motion
thrill of victory and agony of defeat that this game is famous for!<br/>

I wanted to get the files posted early enough so you could still get out to
find some of the boxes on the Word List, if you haven't already found them. It
will give you a few more choices for filling your grid and, more importantly,
you'll get to find more great letterboxes! I'd much rather be out letterboxing
this weekend than venturing to a store filled

involved in any planning for the game and won't be involved in any aspects of
pulling words, etc.  He is hoping he does better than last year!<var id="yui-ie-cursor"></var></font></p><p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">

    Ok, now I understand the confusion!  I logged onto the file section
    last week and got the BINGO grid and words, and even signed up in
    the database (I think).  Then today, while going back to check
    things, I can't find any of this stuff again...yahoo seems to be
    having issues loading it! (sadly, seemingly only in the GLK
    section...not the other LB groups...)<br/>

                              fun is playing the Great Lakes

                              BINGO game started by SpringChick back in
                              2006. The illustrious Mr. Familyof6 then
                              took the reins for two years and now I'm
                              honored to be hosting the BINGO game
                              for a second time. We're hoping to have a
                              lot of participants for the 2014 game,
                              so spread the word. You sure wouldn't want
                              to miss experiencing the slow motion
                              thrill of victory and agony of defeat that
                              this game is famous for!<br/>

                              I'd much rather be out letterboxing
                              this weekend than venturing to a store
