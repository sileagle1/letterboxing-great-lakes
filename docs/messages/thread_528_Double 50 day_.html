<br/>
We raced againtst the thunderstorms yesterday doing Keltic Kara's <br/>
boxes and before we were washed out, we reached P52!!<br/>
<br/>
Then we drove up to replace a box which had been chewed on by <br/>
animals. And during the day, somewhere along the way, we placed a <br/>
Mystery Box .... which was our P50!! (clues coming soon)<br/>
<br/>
Got pictures of us doing the Happy Dance at both.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
