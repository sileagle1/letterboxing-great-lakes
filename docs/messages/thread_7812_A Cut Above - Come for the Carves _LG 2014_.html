Above - Come for the Carves</span></p><p>
<span>Great
Lakes Gathering 2014</span></p><p>
<span>Saturday,
June 28, 2014</span></p><p>
<span>9 am – 6
pm</span></p><p>
<span>Wild
River State Park</span></p><p>
<span>Center
City, Minnesota</span></p><p>
<span>hosted by
the Minnesota Carving Consortium (MCC, formerly the Minnesota Camping
Contingent)</span></p><p>
</p><p><span>Come to
Minnesota; Come for the Carves!  The 2014 Great Lakes Gathering will
feature the best stamps that each letterboxer can submit.  </span></p><p>
</p><p><span>The
naturalist at Wild River is excited about letterboxing because seekers do not
destroy an entire area when out boxing.  We have been given permission to
permanently plant 6 boxes at the park.  We are allowed to temporarily
plant 24 boxes at the park.  Wild River SP has 35 miles of trail along the
St. Croix River.  Minnesota state parks have very strict rules about
letterbox placement and we want to continue the excellent relationship that
we've started at Wild River.  All permanent boxes will have to be planted
by the MCC.  We can and will plant boxes outside the state park in a
nearby county park, along a bike trail, etc. </span></p><p>
</p><p><u><span>Donate
Stamps</span></u><span>: So, sharpen your carving
tools!  We would like stamps submitted by March 1st (so we have time to
make fabulous logbooks to go with them).  All ability levels are
welcome.  There will be a special carved-by-kids section, too.  Carve
any image, but keep the images family-friendly.  Send the stamps to Dartmoor
Dreamer; 2887 Lake Blvd; St. Paul MN<span> 
</span>55109-1620.  </span></p><p>
</p><p><u><span>Donate
Cash</span></u><span>: At Great Lakes Gatherings in the
past, there has been a donation bucket available (to help defray expenses for
shelter rental, printing, containers and mailing).<span>  </span>For this event, the MCC is suggesting a
donation of $10 or more per adult letterboxer.<span> 
</span>The MCC is offering an incentive to those that send their donations before
May 1st.<span>  </span>What kind of incentive, you
ask?<span>  </span>(packet available on Friday night
and a special WOM clue).<span>  </span>Any money collected
beyond 2014 expenses will be donated to the 2015 GLG organizing <span> </span>group.<span> 
</span>Contact Dartmoor Dreamer for payment options <a href="mailto:DartmoorDreamer@hotmail.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DartmoorDreamer@hotmail.com</a>.</span></p><p>

</p><p><i><u><span>Important
Info</span></u><span>: This event and the positive
interaction with the Wild River SP naturalist are the first steps in educating
all Minnesota State Park personnel about the low environmental impact and
family-friendly nature of letterboxing.  We are counting on everyone to
make this a great experience at the park and for the park staff.  We want
to continue to expand letterboxing legally in Minnesota State Parks.</span></i></p><p>
