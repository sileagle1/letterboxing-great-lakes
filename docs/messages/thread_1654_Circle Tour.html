<br>
We're planning a trip with our RV in October (weather permitting)<br>
to do the circle tour around the lake. We're hoping to have about 12<br>
days and end up at the gathering in MI on the 22nd.<br>
<br>
We have 2 small children (boy 5, girl 2). Does anyone have any<br>
HAVE TO boxes that fit into the area?? Any suggestions of places to<br>
visit or things to see?<br>
===================<br>
<br>
Here are a few quick thoughts:<br>
<br>
1.  "Sweet Praireland" box in Pleasant Prairie is near your route, an easy<br>
box for kids and you'll go right by a candy distribution center that offers<br>
free tours almost every day of the year.  They don't make the candy there,<br>
but you ride around the warehouse watching videos about how the candy is<br>
made.  There are also seasonal displays and free samples at the end.  A<br>
fairly quick tour, no walking involved.  Check out the great deal on "Belly<br>
Flops" in the retail store before or after the tour.<br>
<br>
2.  "Sailing the Great Lakes" box in Kenosha is also easy for kids and right<br>
on the lakefront, near a small interesting museum with free admission.<br>
<br>
3.  If you stop in downtown Milwaukee, the Betty Brinn Children's Museum<br>
(admission fee required) is great for kids that age.  Easier boxes nearby<br>
are "Happy Days" and "Harbor Island".<br>
<br>
4. In Sheboygan, "Danger on the Great Lakes" would be good with kids.<br>

Your planned trip sounds like a lot of fun and should beautiful at that time of year.  Funny you should mention the Circle Tour...  Not sure if you are aware or not of the list being compiled of letterboxes that are along the Lake Michigan Circle Tour.<br>
<br>
Check out this project, including a list of boxes that are currently listed, here:  <br>
<br>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/projects/lmct.asp<br>
<br>
It is a relatively new project, just getting off the ground and response has been quite limited -- not sure if there just aren't as many boxes along the route as I thought there were or if people just aren't interested in seeing a composite listing like this, but it is a start.<br>
<br>
In Lower MI there are quite a few boxes along your route, primarily concentrated between South Haven and Montague, but scattered boxes at other points south and north of here.  They vary in difficulty and length of time required and the best thing is just to read through the clues to get an idea of what meets your needs.<br>
<br>
Sounds like a great trip!  Have fun!<br>
