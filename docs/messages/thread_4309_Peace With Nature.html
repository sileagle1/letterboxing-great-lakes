box has been archived.  This is a box that was abandoned, which I <br/>
adopted last year.  It's still there, but the landscape has changed <br/>
dramatically and the clues don't make sense.  Also, there have been "No <br/>
Trespassing" signs posted, and I don't approve of directing people onto <br/>
private property.  I won't remove the box, since it wasn't mine to <br/>
begin with, but I will no longer be supporting it.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. to BNL BaliGrl - how the heck did you find this one?  With the <br/>
bridge open, the clues don't make sense, and yet you still found it.  <br/>
Great nose for letterboxing!<br/>

We are pretty good at diving our way to places even when the clues <br/>
don't all make sense!  I meant to tell you that things had changed, <br/>
but we actually didn't follow the clues to start with and got there <br/>
from a different box. So, I wasn't sure exactly what was <br/>
different.  It did take a while to figure it out, but we got it eventually.<br/>
<br/>
We thought that no trespassing sign was for the area next to the <br/>
trail, but not where the box itself was.<br/>

That should say "divining", not diving.  Big difference! LOL<br/>
