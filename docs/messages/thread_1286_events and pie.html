gathering. I believe that Team Rabbit was looking for<br>
some traveling event boxes...so there ya go, eh?<br>
<br>
I actually have found better a better sugar cream pie<br>
than Wicks (I know, this can't be true!). If ever<br>
traveling down US 31 in between Plymouth and<br>
Rochester, IN (Flagbearer is on a planting frenzy, so<br>
you *might* end up this way searching for some of<br>
hers)there's a diner on the west side of US 31 (the 4<br>
lane "bypass" as the locals call it) near the town of<br>
Argos called the Logcabin. Fabulous food, and probably<br>
the best sugar cream pie ever! Amazing! You will<br>
rethink the whole Wicks thing...trust me, I did!!!<br>
<br>
A reminder to everyone: There will be a small<br>
gathering in Plymouth IN on May 21st hosted by The<br>
Sisters Act. For more information:<br>

I think someone told me once, but it was my first exposure to letterboxing and in trying to soak up all of the absolutely necessary information that bit of trivia has been lost in the cluttered files of my mind.<br>
