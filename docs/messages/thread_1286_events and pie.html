gathering. I believe that Team Rabbit was looking for<br/>
some traveling event boxes...so there ya go, eh?<br/>
<br/>
I actually have found better a better sugar cream pie<br/>
than Wicks (I know, this can't be true!). If ever<br/>
traveling down US 31 in between Plymouth and<br/>
Rochester, IN (Flagbearer is on a planting frenzy, so<br/>
you *might* end up this way searching for some of<br/>
hers)there's a diner on the west side of US 31 (the 4<br/>
lane "bypass" as the locals call it) near the town of<br/>
Argos called the Logcabin. Fabulous food, and probably<br/>
the best sugar cream pie ever! Amazing! You will<br/>
rethink the whole Wicks thing...trust me, I did!!!<br/>
<br/>
A reminder to everyone: There will be a small<br/>
gathering in Plymouth IN on May 21st hosted by The<br/>
Sisters Act. For more information:<br/>

&gt; Another productive day!  I have discovered the joy<br/>
&gt; of carving on pink pearl erasers and <br/>
&gt; white speedy cut!  I am in love.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the pink pearls I carved 1) Pickle Chiffon Pie<br/>
&gt; and 2) my first attempt at lettering -- ARE <br/>
&gt; WE THERE YET?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the larger speedy cut, I carved a limited time<br/>
&gt; stamp for the Tom Otterness in <br/>
&gt; Indianapolis art expo.  Have to find a good spot for<br/>
&gt; that one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Haven't decided what to do with the pink pearls ....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dragon, would you like to have the Pickle Chiffon<br/>
&gt; Pie?  It's not a wedge and doesn't have <br/>
&gt; any PI notation on it (yet).  If you don't want it,<br/>
&gt; I will place it near a pie shop in Randolph <br/>
&gt; County, IN -- for those of you who remember -- Mrs.<br/>
&gt; Wick's makes the best Sugar Cream <br/>
&gt; Pie!  MMMMMM, good.  They have other pies, too, and<br/>
&gt; a restaurant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ARE WE THERE YET?  What to do with this little<br/>
&gt; stamp?  I am thinking it might make an <br/>
&gt; interesting travelling event box.  What do you<br/>
&gt; think?  I am going to the 5/21 Joy in the <br/>
&gt; Journey gathering in Plymouth, IN.  Perhaps it could<br/>
&gt; make its debut there, and then, maybe <br/>
&gt; Armadillo Jo or someone else could carry it to the<br/>
&gt; Great Lakes Gathering in June, then <br/>
&gt; someone could take it to the next gathering, and so<br/>
&gt; on.  I would provide a large logbook <br/>
&gt; for exchanges.  I didn't want to make it a<br/>
&gt; hitchhiker since I have 4 in the wilderness now.<br/>
&gt; Please provide feedback.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On another note --Grandvilla-- your GL Exchange box<br/>
&gt; has a First Finder!<br/>

I think someone told me once, but it was my first exposure to letterboxing and in trying to soak up all of the absolutely necessary information that bit of trivia has been lost in the cluttered files of my mind.<br/>
