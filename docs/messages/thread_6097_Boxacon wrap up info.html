                    <div class="plaintext-content">This may be very long.  Perhaps I should make several messages to try and organize thoughts.  First off thanks again to everyone who helped out on organizing, carving, planting, and helping out at the shelter during the day.  Thanks for the contributions.  Several people were concerned about that and checked with me, I pretty much covered all of my expenses, thanks again.<br/>
A big thanks to my bookcrossing crew who had a carving party with me and did many walks with me planting boxes.  And for being oh so patient as I went hobbling along oh so slowly.  I'm really looking forward to having the knee operation next week and being able to do a lot more boxing.  <br/>
About a year ago I was musing about planning a gathering, but had no idea where would be a good place, so give Wisconsin Hiker an extra thanks for suggesting Minooka Park.  It was a fabulous location and I think helped make the event a success.  I also want to thank Wisconsin Hiker for being a resource for me.  I lost track of how many times I emailed her with questions on organization, she was a great help in organizing. <br/>
A couple of people mentioned organizing a gathering to me, so I want to add a couple of comments about that here.  There are a ton of people who will help out if you are thinking about planning a gathering.  There are a number of people who have planned gatherings that are resources you can depend on for advice also.  Someone else mentioned the expense of putting on a gathering, like I said above, people were generous with donations so don't let that be a stopper if you are considering hosting.  Plus that if you host a gathering it will be another one for me to attend, so go ahead and do it.<br/>
