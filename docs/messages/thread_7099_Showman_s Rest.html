                    <div class="plaintext-content">"A circus tragedy lost to history" is the way the front section in the live! section of the Chicago Tribune reads this morning.  Guess what we were immediately thinking about???  Why letterboxing of course!  Reminding us of the wonderful cemetery stroll boxes by Waltzing Pigs! (#1 to be exact)<br/>
In the text one reads that it is "one of the Chicago area's great FORGOTTEN entertainment tragedies"...not for all of us!<br/>
Articles like this remind us of one of our favorite aspects of the hobby - how letterboxing is the vehicle that brings us to places of interest that otherwise might be off the general radar.  This box was planted in July of 2005...It took the journalist at the Trib more almost six more years to bring us the details!  Glad we have the Dancin' Piggy's to lead us to these discoveries way ahead of time...This now can be added in our "excuse arsenal" for our naysayer friends and family -  the clear fact that when we are out and about it has much to do with educational pursuit!<br/>
Thanks again fellow boxers for making us much wiser than we would've been without letterboxing!  Although, Dragon is going to have to come up with some VERY remedial Math boxes for us!<br/>

Agreed, Tiptoe &amp; Tonto.  That cemetery is a sobering place, where people who are nameless are buried.  But, wasn't it fun to discover it before the news media, and to know far more details than they do?  Thanks, Waltzing Pigs!!  Love that series, though we have a few more of them to find!  Thanks, T&amp;T, for the link to the story.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the link to the article on the Showmen's Rest.  I may need to adjust my clues a little and add the bit about Buffalo Bill Cody.  The kids were both involved in the spring musical--Annie Get Your Gun--and Buffalo Bill was one of the main characters.  <br/>
<br/>
I think he might have gotten one fact wrong--I don't think that there are any unidentified females.  When I was writing the clues, I think I was going to say unidentified males and females, but couldn't find a grave saying unidentified female.  I'll have to check that out next time I am there.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with T&amp;T--I love the local history or hidden gems that so many boxes bring us too. <br/>
