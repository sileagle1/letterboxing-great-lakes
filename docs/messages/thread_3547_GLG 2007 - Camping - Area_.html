looking for an excuse to use. What area and/or sites<br/>
is everyone looking at? It would be great to be<br/>
camping next to each other.<br/>
<br/>
The Friday night gathering would be awesome, great<br/>
idea. We had a pre-gathering gathering last year in<br/>
Delafield and it was very cool. I'd much rather make<br/>
my dinner over a campfire than order it in a<br/>
restaurant. MMMM cheesy brats over a campfire : ) Also<br/>
I was planning a gathering here in MN. that nevver<br/>
came to fruition last year and it would have been a<br/>
camping event as well and I had the idea of doing a<br/>
HUGE oatmeal breakfast. Whaddya think? A nice piping<br/>
hot bowl of oatmeal would give us a good start to the<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so excited now, the wait is going to be terrible.<br/>
Like a kid waiting for Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
Let this be the official declaration of me cancelling<br/>
my plans for a friday gathering at Cedar Point<br/>
amusement park. I've recently re-thought the idea and<br/>
deemed it a waste of precious boxing time seeing as I<br/>
live about 14 hours away from the gathering. So if<br/>
anyone was looking forward to going to C.P., sorry but<br/>
I've got some serious boxing to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see you all in June!<br/>
