It's kind of sad, especially since that particular stamp was the first I had carved after carving my signature stamps.  <br>

But it's an easy enough stamp to carve, and I have plenty of erasers left to recarve it.  And I already know where I'll be moving it to when I replace the box.  Quite frankly, it's a much better location all around...just not quite as close to the landmark.  But the best part about it is that I don't have to completely rewrite my clues...just change a few parts.  <br>

It's sad when you lose a box, especially when it's your first... <br>
that's experience speaking.  I recarved my stamp, put together a new <br>
box, adjusted the clues to a better location and the box has had many <br>
new visitors.  Here's hoping things stay that way!  Don't give up!<br>
