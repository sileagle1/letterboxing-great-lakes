its resting place, it is extremely lonely as there have been no <br>
finders since it was planted in August 2004.<br>
<br>
I made a few slight changes on the clue page to accommodate the <br>
renaming of a landmark and also to help in the correct placement of <br>
words in the clue.  There is one other helpful addition to the clue <br>
page, but you'll have to hunt around a bit for it.<br>
<br>
Note: The puzzle grid and the 35 words that fit into it have not <br>
changed.<br>
