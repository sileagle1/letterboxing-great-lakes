                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone!  I am not really an active geo-cacher, although since <br/>
there are many more caches than letterboxes near me, I have <br/>
considered embracing them also, however I do lurk at the MiGO <br/>
(Michigan Geo-Caching Organization) web site from time to time <br/>
because they have a finger of the pulse of environmental and land <br/>
usage issues throughout the state.<br/>
<br/>
So, even if you are a plain vanilla letterboxer, you should check <br/>
out the site.  There is a link over in the left-hand sidebar that <br/>
deals with Land Usage -- where it is okay to places caches (i.e. <br/>
same rules generally would apply to letterboxes) and where there has <br/>
been a specific ban on caches/letterboxes.  Very helpful when <br/>
planning your next box placement if you want to avoid the <br/>
disappointment of having the box confiscated.<br/>
