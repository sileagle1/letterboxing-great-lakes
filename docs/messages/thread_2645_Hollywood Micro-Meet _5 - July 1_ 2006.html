                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spoke with one of the managers of the Paw Caf today. She loves having us<br/>
letterboxers stop by for our micro-meets, and told me she would be willing<br/>
to open up on a Saturday if we were interested in meeting there.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, my weekend schedule totally sucks from now until August.  The<br/>
only Saturday I am not working or otherwise committed is July 1st.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ive created a poll  please indicate if you can attend and how many in your<br/>
party.  Since shed be opening especially for us, Id like to be able to<br/>
commit to tell her the number so she can plan her staffing and stocking<br/>
needs.  If you say you can make it but later change your mind, please change<br/>
your vote(s).   If there isnt enough interest (I realize this is leading<br/>
into the holiday), I will reschedule for later in the summer.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Paw and Cyberdog Cafs are located at 8420 Brookfield Avenue in<br/>
Brookfield, Illinois, across the street from the Hollywood/Zoo Stop on<br/>
Metras Burlington Northern-Santa Fe line.   As Ive been known to mention<br/>
before, the Metra runs a $5 unlimited riding program on weekends (heck, you<br/>
can ride in from Kenosha (but must get from one station in the city to the<br/>
other) for five bucks  such a deal in these days of $3+/gallon gas!).  Make<br/>
a day of it and visit the Brookfield Zoo afterwards  its walking distance<br/>
 and see the new carousel.  We can even go as a group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let the voting begin  I hope to see you guys on the 1st!<br/>

  It was so nice finally meeting you at the Gathering.<br/>
  Alas, we will be in Iowa for the holiday weekend, so I won't be able to make the July meet.<br/>
  My weekends are pretty much booked until August.<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
