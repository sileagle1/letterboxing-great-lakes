                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some of my event boxes for the "Birds of a Feather" event have had their status changed on Atlasquest from "event" to "traditional", as they will be remaining out in the wild permanently.  With Ryan's help, this was managed without losing the find history.   <br>
<br>
The six "When is a bird not a bird" boxes have been consolidated into two three-box series.  These six boxes will eventually be placed permanently and clues updated - when I've caught up with a few things.<br>
