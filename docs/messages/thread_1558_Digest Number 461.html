Jeez...let's see, she posted at 7:35 this morning - Howling Coyote probably found them at around 9 am - am I right???  (-:  (Poor HC - I tease her all the time!)<br>
<br>
Congrats, JACKS & company!  Not used to seeing you posting on this list!<br>
<br>
Happy fourth, everyone - time for me to go home.  Hope the rain doesn't spoil the fireworks tonight.  Any Chicago burban boxers looking for a good show, check out North Riverside.  First you can see Berwyn from less than a mile away, and then the NR show is awesome.  Bring your earplugs.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

I did place a box out here this morning though!<br>
It is the Frank Lloyd Wright Stockman House Letterbox in Mason City.  I<br>
have to post my clues later tonight.<br>
Only I hope someone will come look for it way out here in the boonies!<br>
LOL, my husband is saying "Hey! it's not that far out!"  His family is<br>
here.<br>
Hope everyone is having a great holiday!<br>
