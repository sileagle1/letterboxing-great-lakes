                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, I have uploaded my updated webpages.  Some may enjoy the new<br/>
background music on my homepage, and there are new dragon pictures,<br/>
etc. there too.<br/>
<br/>
You'll also notice that I've added a couple new boxes today.  The<br/>
Vampire Hunter Series is back up and available in WI.  I had to delete<br/>
the IL listing from LbNA because it wouldn't allow me to change the<br/>
state.  There is also a new Mathman (#30) ready to go as well as one<br/>
of the Cowculus (#2) boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If you actually take the time to look at my homepage, you will find<br/>
links to other boxes than these. I need to check the accuracy of some<br/>
of the clues and verify the boxes are in place on some boxes yet.  I<br/>
know that the boxes for Cowculus 1, Mathman 26, and Mathman 32 are not<br/>
in place.  If you really want to try the others, go ahead, but the<br/>
clues may have problems.  I will host the clues on LbNA and AQ when<br/>
they are truly ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
All of the boxes in my database are now also on AQ and all the LbNA<br/>
listings of these boxes directly link to the AQ page.  I will only<br/>
update AQ as far as the status of my boxes along with any first aid<br/>
and commentary.  The link from AQ goes directly to the clue page on my<br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
If you notice anything amiss, please let me know.  It is a massive<br/>
undertaking and I probably made mistakes along the way.<br/>
<br/>
(In case anyone is wondering there are 310 boxes in my database that I<br/>
am in some way responsible for.  Officially I am P222.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
