                    <div class="plaintext-content">Huge thanks to FungusWoman for collecting so MANY drink mix packages and <br/>
than you all so much for being so VERY generous!  I will be sure to let <br/>
everyone know when these guys deploy and when the drink packets go into <br/>
the mail to them.  It will be a while yet---but this is a really great <br/>
feeling to know so many jumped at the opportunity to support these guys <br/>
(there aren't any women in their unit) when at times, it's hard to <br/>
remember we still have troops out there struggling. <br/>
<br/>
Big honkin' hugs to you all!<br/>
I sure wish I could have been at this event but am glad to know everyone <br/>
had a super great time!<br/>
(No surprise with speedsquare at the helm!!)<br/>
