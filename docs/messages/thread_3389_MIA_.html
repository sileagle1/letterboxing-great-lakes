stamp and the logbook with names back several years, and the red metal <br/>
tin can container are all missing in action.  It was last seen at the <br/>
post gathering dinner.  Did anyone accidentaly pack it into a bag of <br/>
supplies to be taken home not realizing that it was suppose to be <br/>
returned to Beetle?  It happens.  Please contact me if you find it <br/>
mingled in with your supplies and bags.  Thank you!<br/>
