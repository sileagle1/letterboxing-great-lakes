learn some bookmaking techniques that can be used for logbooks?  <br/>
People willing to teach a bookmaking technique?<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about hosting a spring mini-meet that would be a <br/>
series of bookbinding/logbook making workshops.  I know that a <br/>
similar event has been successfully done in CT and possibly in other <br/>
areas.  I am not committed to any specifics yet, but here are some <br/>
rough ideas I've been contemplating:<br/>
<br/>
-  This would be a day long event on a Saturday<br/>
-  Event would be held inside<br/>
-  Would try to find location in SW MI or perhaps northern IN, etc. <br/>
to make accessible for more people<br/>
-  This would not be an event with many letterboxes to hunt for, but <br/>
there would be an event stamp and possibly a few other event-related <br/>
stamps/boxes, as well as a period set aside for personal stamp <br/>
exchanges with other attendees<br/>
-  There would be 4 one-hour workshops, each teaching how to make a <br/>
different type of book or a different type of bookbinding that would <br/>
be suitable for letterbox logbooks.  These would be hands-on <br/>
workshops in which participants will make a book in each session.<br/>
-  All project materials will be supplied<br/>
-  Attendees could sign up for either morning or afternoon or full <br/>
day (2 workshops in morning, 2 in afternoon)<br/>
-  Most likely there would be limited attendee spots to keep class <br/>
size manageable and make it easier to secure a meeting room (maybe 12-<br/>
15 people maximum?)<br/>
-  Lunch would be either "bring your own sack lunch" or "order food <br/>
in" (attendees to cover cost of their own lunch)<br/>
-  There would be a small charge for attendance to cover project <br/>
materials and building fee<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm looking for feedback... What do you think?  Might you be <br/>
interested in attending something like this?  Is there anyone who <br/>
might consider leading one of the workshops?  Thoughts on my ideas?  <br/>
Your ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to post feedback/ideas/questions/comments either to <br/>
the list or in private e-mail.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

and enjoyed the one workshop at GLG.  Depending on the date chosen, I<br/>
would be very interested in attending and could do a workshop on Japanese <br/>
book binding.  Having it in the middle of the day sounds good because it<br/>
would give us all time for travel.  <br/>
<br/>
My only suggestion is that we might be able to get an auditorium or room<br/>
at a public library for free, but this would limit our food options.<br/>

I suspect you'll get a huge response of people wanting to attend. If<br/>

volunteers, why not make it as easy on them as possible?<br/>

If you decide to offer workshops in more than one location, and would<br/>

&gt;People willing to teach a bookmaking technique?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I've been thinking about hosting a spring mini-meet that would be a<br/>
&gt;series of bookbinding/logbook making workshops.  I know that a<br/>
&gt;similar event has been successfully done in CT and possibly in other<br/>
&gt;areas.  I am not committed to any specifics yet, but here are some<br/>
&gt;rough ideas I've been contemplating:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-  This would be a day long event on a Saturday<br/>
&gt;-  Event would be held inside<br/>
&gt;-  Would try to find location in SW MI or perhaps northern IN, etc.<br/>
&gt;to make accessible for more people<br/>
&gt;-  This would not be an event with many letterboxes to hunt for, but<br/>
&gt;there would be an event stamp and possibly a few other event-related<br/>
&gt;stamps/boxes, as well as a period set aside for personal stamp<br/>
&gt;exchanges with other attendees<br/>
&gt;-  There would be 4 one-hour workshops, each teaching how to make a<br/>
&gt;different type of book or a different type of bookbinding that would<br/>
&gt;be suitable for letterbox logbooks.  These would be hands-on<br/>
&gt;workshops in which participants will make a book in each session.<br/>
&gt;-  All project materials will be supplied<br/>
&gt;-  Attendees could sign up for either morning or afternoon or full<br/>
&gt;day (2 workshops in morning, 2 in afternoon)<br/>
&gt;-  Most likely there would be limited attendee spots to keep class<br/>
&gt;size manageable and make it easier to secure a meeting room (maybe 12-<br/>
&gt;15 people maximum?)<br/>
&gt;-  Lunch would be either "bring your own sack lunch" or "order food<br/>
&gt;in" (attendees to cover cost of their own lunch)<br/>
&gt;-  There would be a small charge for attendance to cover project<br/>
&gt;materials and building fee<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So, I'm looking for feedback... What do you think?  Might you be<br/>
&gt;interested in attending something like this?  Is there anyone who<br/>
&gt;might consider leading one of the workshops?  Thoughts on my ideas?<br/>
&gt;Your ideas?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please feel free to post feedback/ideas/questions/comments either to<br/>
&gt;the list or in private e-mail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks!<br/>
