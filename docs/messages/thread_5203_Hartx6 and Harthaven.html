I got my parents (who live in Oregon) into letterboxing a year ago. My mom is a strange one indeed as she prefers planting boxes rather than finding them. In the year since we last saw eachother Mom planted 40 boxes!! Compared to her 3 finds!!!!!<br>
<br>
So I challenged (forced) her to find some boxes during their visit here. Happy to say she more than doubled her F count. She did, BTW, hide one box here in Moline for all to enjoy.<br>
<br>
One thing I really like about my mom's carvings is that they are all original drawings of hers . . . she had no concept of transfering images. So, the box is 100% original.<br>
