                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fungus Woman was at GS camp, and so was Beetle...but different camps.  Great weather!  I taught a letterboxing course and set up several temporary traditional boxes.  HH, Bonus Boxes, and Cooties were also present.  There are now several new enthusiastic letterboxers among us.  I taught compass usage because the clues contained compass bearings, and some cryptic information.  They did a great job replacing the boxes.  I guess they listened well to 'the rules.'  I discourage this activity with younger GS; older girls only.  Also, I stress being sneaky and breaking up a large group which can draw too much attention.  Hopefully this advice will help protect boxes.  If the members of LBGLK see a new series of boxes called LEO 2007; ignore them.  These were 4 temporary boxes placed for the past three days as part of the workshop.  Participants will be signing up on AQ and listing their finds.  I will retire these boxes in a couple weeks.  Thanks for understanding.  <br/>

  Well, I only had time to nab two boxes on my way to GS camp this morning ("Joliet Junior College" and "Got Dog?"), but I was able to do spring maintenance on my US 52 - IL 71 boxes. "Whispering Oaks", "MPHG: I'm not dead yet", "Duane's Motel", "FOOW2" and "FOOW6" (yes, contrary to reports, #2 is alive and kicking...and I even carved a replacement and had it with me ready to go in case I needed it), and "Lutefisk out of Water" are all ready for visitors. CMoon's "Rev. Elling Eilsen" is also in good shape.<br/>
