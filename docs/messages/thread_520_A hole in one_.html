planted in. So most of the challenge lies in finding the correct area. <br/>
Clues after that aren't difficult. I requested that the person who placed <br/>
the box list it as a mystery box as that is truly what it was. I don't want <br/>
to spoil it for him by disclosing which box as Azobox pointed out to me <br/>
that people could locate it by other things I might have said.<br/>
Weird stuff like that always seems to happen to me..<br/>
