our Dog Scout troop had it's annual picnic and I did a commemorative stamp <br>
for the occasion. I located the park I wanted to plant it in and set out <br>
for the perfect hiding place. I meandered past a couple walking the trail <br>
and then an older man who wanted to chat with me as he saw me scoping <br>
things out. I am just thinking "ok you can leave now". Finally they all <br>
left and I had spotted my ideal location. Looking around to make sure <br>
everyone was gone, I set off into the woods just off the trail to hide my <br>
box. When low and behold, another letterbox was already hidden there!! Now <br>
what is the chances of that? My husband likens it to a hole in one for <br>
golf. Me, I feel more like I found a needle in a haystack... I guess great <br>
minds think a like. Wouldn't you know it.. I didn't have any of my stamping <br>
stuff with me..<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can't say as the clues do not tell you which recreational area it is <br>
planted in. So most of the challenge lies in finding the correct area. <br>
Clues after that aren't difficult. I requested that the person who placed <br>
the box list it as a mystery box as that is truly what it was. I don't want <br>
to spoil it for him by disclosing which box as Azobox pointed out to me <br>
that people could locate it by other things I might have said.<br>
Weird stuff like that always seems to happen to me..<br>
