                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since biking is still not feasible due to my arm injury (I'm the one <br/>
in a sling in the Gathering photo), we decided to spend the holiday <br/>
weekend LBing.  We planned a large circuit that incorporated a hike <br/>
with our hiking club.<br/>
<br/>
We started out after work on Friday and headed to Norwalk and the <br/>
Tunnel #3 box.  We discovered that while it is possible to find this <br/>
box by starting at 8:15 pm, we HIGHLY recommend searching for this <br/>
box earlier in the day!  The route is somewaht challenging and the <br/>
fading light made it more treacherous.  We found the box at 9:00 pm <br/>
and made it back to our car by 9:45 pm.  As our friends said later in <br/>
the weekend - we are two SUPPOSEDLY intelligent people, but going for <br/>
the box at that time of day was probably not the wisest decision...<br/>
<br/>
We spent the night in La Crosse, then began our Saturday searching in <br/>
a nearby county park.  We planned this section of our circuit to take <br/>
us north along the Mississippi River, then hook back east and south.  <br/>
We were very happy to find all the boxes we searched for:<br/>
<br/>
Goose Island<br/>
Daisy Deer's Birthday Party (3) - First Finders!<br/>
Trout Creek - First Finders!<br/>
Red Wing<br/>
Elk Mound<br/>
Bell Mound<br/>
<br/>
We stayed in Black River Falls on Saturday night.  On Sunday morning <br/>
we joined members of our hiking club for a hike in the state forest.  <br/>
During the hike we planted a new box (clues will be posted soon).  <br/>
After the hike we looked for the 2nd box of Dragon's WI Mystery box.  <br/>
This was our 2nd attempt, but no luck!  We then headed to Wausau and <br/>
found the following in good shape:<br/>
<br/>
Rib Mountain - First Finders!<br/>
Edgar Allen Hippoe - First Finders!<br/>
45-90<br/>
<br/>
After spending the night in Wausau, we headed further north on Monday <br/>
morning and were successful in finding the Timm's Hill box.  We then <br/>
headed south to return home, stopping in Baraboo along the way to <br/>
find the Man Mound box.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun visiting places we'd never been to before and learning <br/>
some interesting tidbits along the way.  All in all, a great weekend!<br/>

Hopefully you were wearing long pants on Monday.  We weren't and some sort of stinging nettles really had us itching as we were in the woods near the box.<br/>
