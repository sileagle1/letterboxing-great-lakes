Oh where or where are the generic words?  LOL  All these "people, <br/>
places and boxes" weren't available to me and are leaving me in the <br/>
dust.  <sigh>  I'm just as unlucky at real bingo, so I don't know why <br/>

Well, don't think we're in any better shape, just because we may have <br/>
had a bigger selection of words!  We were "qualified" to choose 68 of <br/>
the words on the list (the 35 generic words and 33 of the other <br/>
words).  However I only have 3 squares "X'd" on my card, one of which <br/>
was the "free space" I got to choose myself!  Martini Man has 4 <br/>
squares but they are not all in the same line.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just because the "must be qualified" words are being called, <br/>
doesn't mean they are on many people's cards.  <br/>
<br/>
Just for fun, and since we won't have any new words this weekend, I <br/>
created a temporary poll that will be open until JAN 29.  It asks the <br/>
question:  Did you have "Column B - Lazy Day Walk (MN)" on your BINGO <br/>
card.  There are 58 BINGO players, so we'll see how many responses we <br/>
get over the next few days.<br/>
<br/>

Oh, I know.  I'm not complaining, or upset, FOR REAL.  Just <br/>
whining.  I know it's not a benefit to have the extra options and <br/>
it's completely random.  I'm just feeling bummed about never seeing <br/>
anything getting crossed off!  I actually DO have 4, one being the <br/>
one I picked, and three in a row.  So, really, I'm not doing all that <br/>
bad, I guess!<br/>

&gt; Oh where or where are the generic words?  LOL  All<br/>
&gt; these "people, <br/>
&gt; &gt; places and boxes" weren't available to me and are<br/>
&gt; leaving me in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; dust.  <sigh>  I'm just as unlucky at real bingo,<br/>

&gt; I created a mini-meet as soon as I saw my name on<br/>
&gt; the bingo clue sheet <br/>
&gt; so as many who wanted to meet me could. Tricky,<br/>
&gt; right before the <br/>
&gt; holidays, but I tried to give others an edge.<br/>
