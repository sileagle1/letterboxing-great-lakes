<br>
I used to do the iron transfer with fantastic results, but in the past few years it has been really, really hard to get the image to transfer. What I understand is that the newer inks used today in most printers have "bonding" qualities that don't allow them to transfer to the rubber like they used to.<br>

Acetone transfer isn't working either -- I suspect for the same reasons.<br>
<br>
I prefer to create my images using photoshop and so I really do need to transfer my image rather than trace or draw it out.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any sure-fire method of doing a clean, dark, and smudge-proof transfer? What carving material do you use with your method (as I'm sure that matters as well.)?<br>

Ditto to A118's comments.  We had the same progression - started with pink &<br>
MasterCarve w/gouges and really liked MC.  Moved to blades and really<br>
preferred white Grace B PZ-Kut.  (Luckily I still have a good supply -<br>
bought a bunch JUST before it disappeared!).  Never bought orange since it<br>
didn't seem like we'd be able to see the image transfer as well while<br>
carving.<br>

<br>
Image transfer<br>
<br>
I never had much luck w/iron transfer (tried twice) but have good luck with<br>
acetone.  As you said, you need to have the right toner, which is generally<br>
found in older laser printers and older copy machines.  Perhaps you can<br>
print your image at home and take it somewhere that has an old copy machine<br>
(at a school or library??).  Luckily Martini Man's laser printer still has<br>
the "good" toner, so I'm still getting good transfers.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are probably instructions on some website or another for acetone<br>
transfer, but here's a simple description of what I do:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
1.       Print image from computer on laser printer.<br>
<br>
2.       Cut image out from paper.<br>
<br>
3.       Place paper w/image onto carving media with image facedown.<br>
<br>
4.       Put a small amount of acetone (very cheap at a drugstore) on a<br>
small area of an old washcloth.<br>
<br>
5.       Firmly pat the washcloth w/acetone onto the back of the paper.<br>
Don't rub, just repeatedly pat/push firmly down, rewetting with acetone as<br>
needed.<br>
<br>
6.       Peel back a corner to see how well image is transferring.  If good,<br>
peel off.  If not good, try more acetone and pressure.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
You can do the same thing with an inkjet printer IF you take the printed<br>
image to an older copy machine and make a copy.  Then use the photocopy for<br>
Steps 2-6.  The key is that you need to have toner.<br>
