lot of traditional letterboxing. :( My favorite had to be going back <br>
to Starved Rock with Manic Mechanic and finding the Illinois Canyon <br>
box I missed with Wiener Mouse on the previous trip. We only found <br>
that box, but the hike was a ton of fun. Especially trying to put the <br>
box back when a group of 8 or 10 hikers came down the trail and <br>
stopped very close to the area. We had a chance to do a lot of hiking <br>
and I got a few really beautiful photos.<br>
<br>
If I could do one series in the coming year I would go find the two <br>
Shipwrecked boxes by Agent Ink in Milwaukee. Manic Mechanic and I sat <br>
at his kitchen table for quite a long time until we figured out those <br>
clues. It has been over a year since then and I think by now I have <br>
actually lost the decoded version, but I don't want them to go <br>
missing before I get the chance to find them! :) Doing any <br>
letterboxing at all would be good, though. ;)<br>
