Hi all,<br>
<br>
I just booked us a conference room for the '07 ART BASH!  (Nov. 3rd and 4th with an optional shopping day on the 5th. -  in Southwest Ohio)<br>
<br>
It's more expensive than last year for the room ($149/day) but it's also a bit larger 20x30 instead of the 13x 15 we crammed into last year :-)  I'm hoping that by advertising this earlier, we can get more people to help off-set the cost of the conference room (so spread the word to all your friends and email lists!)  I haven't figured out the fee that needs to be charged to cover it yet, but I'll do my best to keep it as low as humanly possible.  The more people that give me a commitment in advance, the lower the rate can be for each person.  I may do a $100 early deposit and then figure the remainder from the number of pre-registrations.  It's still early, so I'm not sure.<br>
<br>
So what I need to know is if you think there's a good chance you'll be able to make it to Cincinnati for even more fun and learning than last year!  (If that's even possible, last year will be hard to beat! See below for the review)  Also let me know if you are willing to teach a session. Once I have a ball park figure of how many attendees are expected, I can work out how much needs to be charged to cover the room. My email address is: DogScouts@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
The BASH will be one exit south of the  I-275 and I-75 intersection in S.W. Ohio.  Room rates are under $100 and may be reduced further if several rooms get booked.  There's no reduction on the conference room rate, but it will help lower the cost of the individual rooms if multiple hotel rooms are booked by us.  Everyone will be responsible for their own reservations, but mention that it's for the ART Bash when you register.<br>
<br>
It will be at the Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Cincinnati/Sharonville: http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ex/1/en/hotel/cvgsv?&  (Not sure why the last two symbols aren't attaching to that web address, but they are part of it, so you'll probably have to add them in the address bar of your web browser.)<br>
<br>
Other costs will include class fees for supplies and this is set by the instructors.  Last year, the classes were under $12 each and some were free or only a few dollars.  And your own food.  There's a few fast food places close, but the restaurants are farther away then last year, so we'll need to decide if we want lunch brought in again or just a bit longer lunch hour.<br>
<br>
I'll set up the schedule and figure the final registration cost once I get an idea of how many plan to attend and who is willing to teach (& how much their class fee will be.)  I'm hoping to keep the cost of the bash and classes (as well as costs of coffee, drinks, snacks and maybe lunches, plates, cups, etc.) per person under $150, but it depends on how many attend.  Last year it was $100 per person, but we didn't end up with as many as originally thought so we didn't fully cover the costs.  I don't want to be short again, so it might need to be $175. <br>
<br>
REVIEW of the '06 ART BASH:<br>
First and foremost, I want to thank each and every one of the people that attended (in person and in flat form)!!!!  It was SO AWESOME to meet everyone and as someone said, the chemistry between everyone was like we have been friends for years and years.  It was such a great atmosphere for sharing and learning.<br>
<br>
I got home this afternoon and the only thing I unpacked was my pillow so I could get some sleep! :-)  Here's my recollections on the BASH events:<br>
<br>
Pre-BASH-<br>
I arrived early at the hotel and got settled in.  I was using the internet in the lobby when Pat Wiley Shafer arrived.  She didn't even get to her room because we started talking and kept talking as others arrived :-)  Also arriving early was Wanda Hentges with warm hugs for everyone, who made excellent time all the way from Iowa (and ended up being awake nearly 24 hours by the time we finally hit the pillow that night.)  We were also joined by Cindy Cade with a contagious bubbly and happy personality and a great sense of humor.  We chatted for awhile and shared some of our projects until we were too hungry to continue.  Some of the project sharing was permanent and I already have Wanda's fish card up on the wall in my craft room!  Thank you!  The Cracker Barrel front porch was PACKED with people waiting to eat, so we went to Olive Garden with the 45 minute wait.  On the way, I got a call from Pat Thomas who had gotten a bit turned around in trying to find the hotel.  She gave up on that and decided to join us at the restaurant instead!  The meals were great, the dessert (eaten later) was superb, the waitress was a hoot and the conversation and camaraderie was fantastic!  After dinner, we went back to the hotel for more conversation and sharing before getting to bed after 11pm!  Wanda got started on taking photos for her book before we went to our rooms too.<br>
<br>
Saturday-<br>
    Carving Class by Moi- This day started early for me because I had to get all set-up for my carving class which was the first of the day.  Thankfully the class didn't start till 10am, so I didn't have to get up too early :-) (I'm not a morning person.)  I set-up a camera that looked through my magnifying glass and fed the image to a TV.  This way, everyone could see on the TV as I was carving.  I was able to borrow some magnifying lights for folks to try, but because they were meant for reading, the focus point of the glass wasn't very large, so that may have made them harder to use than the store bought type designed for crafts.  Everyone did really well and seemed to enjoy themselves.<br>
While I was teaching, more arrivals poked their heads in the door and got warm greetings. GG, Lorraine and Jacqui all arrived about the same time.  I was so impressed that Jacqui came all the way from GA for just the one day and went back home that night!  It was so wonderful to meet her after I had spent so much time emailing her behind the scenes :-)  And I'm so glad GG was feeling well enough to not only attend, but participate so much!  I can say it about everyone, it was so great to meet you all!!!<br>
    Lunch- My husband was nice enough to come to KY to pick up the pre-ordered subway sandwich lunches and deliver them to the bash room by noon.  He also picked up the birthday cake for Amiee and we had a little celebration.  Almost everyone had arrived by lunch time, so the sharing and conversation during lunch was even more animated and fun.  (and the cake was actually pretty good! :-)  Flat Deby arrived in my mailbox on Friday after I had left for the hotel, so my husband brought her along too. Not only did she arrive looking good, she also brought a quick and fun little craft with her that will also be available at the next bash! (so I won't spoil the surprise.)  Wanda got more photos of each person for her book and had people start signing it.  Her book is sure to be a treasured piece for her and everyone that gets to see it!  While my husband was still there, GG had me open her gift to me. It was a Beautiful tile with a photo of all 5 of my dogs on it!!  Thank you SO much GG!<br>
    Nancy Curry arrived to teach her ATC class which was a big hit!  New techniques for several folks and fun playtime with the techniques for those more seasoned with the effects.  Nancy is such a nice person and great teacher!  I think I had her a bit befuddled trying to use my camera/TV set-up to demo the techniques, but she handled it well and had us laughing :-)  I sure wish she had known about her husband's travel plans too so she could have stayed and played!!  Even though she could only attend for her class, I think she was able to sign most of the books, trade ATC's and trinkets and get to chat with a few attendees.  We all appreciate her lugging all that STUFF to and from the BASH to share her talents with us!<br>
    Sumi-e painting-  I think I found a new art!  A big thank you to Pat Wiley Shafer for teaching us all about the art form of Sumi-e (pronounced Sumi - A.)  Lots of fun and I'm looking forward to trying more of this and learning and playing with new strokes and forms.  Pat is a great person with a warm smile and had lots of knowledge to share.  Everyone was creating beautiful masterpieces in just a short amount of time!  I plan to post one or two of mine and I'm hoping others will do the same. Aimee (sorry if I have the person wrong), you HAVE to post the bird you did! and Lorraine, please post the bamboo you were doing in green and black!  Everyone else was doing great too, so I hope to see multiple examples for everyone to Ohh and Ahh over :-)  Thank you Pat for the gift that I now have sitting out on my craft table just waiting for me to play!<br>
    Cigar box checkers - Thank you to Sarah for teaching us some cool techniques for transforming simple wooden boxes (& other items) into works of art!  It was late in the day and everyone's brains were full, but we keep on trying and learning and creating wonderful pieces thanks to excellent and patient instruction.  I still need to finish mine, but I'll post a photo when I get it done.  I know there were lots of WONDERFUL checker boxes made (& even a domino board!)  so get those photos posted!<br>
    Dinner- Again we had trouble finding a place to eat that didn't have really long wait times. We ended up at a steakhouse with a 45 minute wait.  As we were about to order appetizers, Kevin (the manager?) came by to see how we were doing and Cindy shared her idea that maybe we should order our food to go.  Kevin was really great and said he would find us a table right away.  He put us in the back dining room area because he said he could tell we needed to be in an area by ourselves!  LOL  We had some fun with banter back and forth with him throughout our meals.  Again, the food was great and the stories, laughter & even singing! was fabulous.  A great time was had by all!  <br>
    After dinner- We came back to the hotel and gabbed and laughed in their breakfast room just off the lobby till late into the night again.<br>
<br>
Sunday- <br>
    I slept in till the last possible moment, so others will have to share what happened this morning :-)  The day started early enough though!<br>
    The AMAZING Wizard- Cindy was not kidding when she said this little machine can do it all!  It can use several types of dye cutters and embossers, make cool backgrounds, flatten and/or emboss charms into paper and other material, and (drum roll please...) Cindy suggested I try to use it to transfer printed ink onto PZ Kut using the acetone method (because the Wizard adds way more pressure than a person's finger can) and IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!  I got a really BLACK and crisp image transfer!!  I was literally jumping for joy over this! I have been struggling with light grey image transfers ever since the ink companies changed the formula for the ink. NOW, I can get the really dark transfers I used to get!!  Other than the ART BASH attendees, this list is the first place I have shared this news.  I can't wait to tell the other carving lists I'm on and I'll be sure to give Cindy Cade the credit for this idea!  That alone was worth the price of my new Wizard! :-)  I also had lots of fun creating textured backgrounds on the paper and there was lots of Ohh's and Ahh's during this class as people tried different things.<br>
    Lunch- We went out to lunch. Some went to Wendy's and others went to Cracker Barrel. We converged back on the hotel for the next class.<br>
    Demo of Ruffled Plastic by Wanda Hentges.  This is such a COOL and easy technique!  I didn't understand it completely till Wanda helped the "light bulb" come on for me during our shopping trip, but even if I didn't understand how it all worked, I still had great fun making beautiful little ruffled plastic pieces!  Wanda was even kind enough to buy me some shrink plastic during our shopping trip!  Thank you again!!  <br>
    Paper Marbling by Pat Thomas gets the award for generating the most Ohh's and Ahh's :-)  As Pat said, instant gratification was the standard for this class (after Pat did loads of prep work so we could all enjoy our play time!)  We first learned how to create beautiful patterns on paper using special inks and plain water.  Then we moved on to a special mixture (the ingredients are escaping me at the moment) that was more gel like and held the patterns as we moved objects through the ink/gel to move the ink into amazingly intricate patterns.  I know there will be loads of uploads of these amazing papers!  This being the last class of the day, we decided to take a chocolate break and enjoy seeing examples of some of the Awesome papers Pat had created and brought to show.  <br>
    Break- We had checked with the front desk to see if we could have the room later than 6pm and were told twice it was not a problem.  So we decided to go to the front breakfast area to share our creations and workshop projects before a few folks needed to leave.  Our plan was to continue marbling after the break.  While doing this (and thoroughly being amazed at all the different creations!) we had our only glitch in the form of a hotel staff person with "issues".  This person informed us that we were supposed to be out of the conference room by 6 and it was now 6:30 and she had people checking in that had to get their stuff into the conference room.  She made it sound urgent that we get out of the room immediately.  Well, THAT threw a wrench in works because we still had ALL our craft stuff ALL OVER the room and it was still set up to do paper marbling with tarps all over the floor, buckets of water, etc.  I can only imagine her face when she opened the door to the room to see if it was empty and saw the chaos! :-)  But we were nice and did our very best to get packed up and out of the room as fast as possible.  Everyone pitched in and I think we HAD to have set new records for getting that much chaos clean up!  Unfortunately, that meant the end to the marbling for most and the folks that had planned to do more before leaving for home had to leave without doing more marbling.  However, those of us staying over till Monday were NOT going to be deterred!  Myself, both Pat's, Wanda and Cindy actually moved ALL the marbling equipment (two luggage dolly's worth) into my hotel room!!  We laid down the tarps again and set up my table in there and used the tub to rinse the papers!  It was a first for Pat T. and we got several pictures to prove it CAN be done! :-)  We were laughing the whole time over the condition of my room.  Thankfully, by the end of the evening, there was no trace of what we had done.  Wanda, the only remaining stubborn marks in the sink and tub came right up with an alcohol face wipe! Lol  We ordered pizza for dinner (except for Cindy who was true to form and was doin' her own thang) and we ate in the lobby (because there wasn't anywhere to sit or set anything in my room :-)    We were up till after 1am by the time everything got cleaned up (for a second time) and packed into Pat's car.  As we went by the conference room after 11:30 pm, we were more than a little peeved that NOTHING had been changed in the room from when we rushed out of there 4.5 hours earlier!!  Grrr.<br>
<br>
Monday- <br>
    We had completely worn out Pat Wiley Schafer who was a real trooper and participated in almost everything throughout the weekend.  We all gave her goodbye hugs Sunday night when she went to her room at a much more reasonable hour than we did :-)  On Monday morning, we said goodbye's to Cindy who had to get home to her kids.  That meant that only myself, Wanda and Pat Thomas remained to go on a shopping spree.  Even though we were up so late, we decided to leave the hotel at 7:30am so we could be at Marco's paper when it opened!  Even though we stopped for gas and ran into a bit of traffic, we still made great time getting up there.  We Ohh'd and Ahh'd over all the many varied items inside Marco's.  Purchases were made and photos of future projects are expected :-)  We got fast food (with some minor difficulty) on our way to Stamp Your Art Out.  Again, lots of Ohh's and Ahh's and cool finds in this store.  After this, we were all pretty wiped out and we headed back to the hotel.  I said my goodbye's and headed home for a nap :-)  Pat was headed out shortly after we got back to the hotel and Wanda was smart to plan on staying another night before her 10.5 hour drive home!<br>
<br>
I'll say it again, just as everyone else has... IT WAS A BLAST!!!!!!!!  I would love to plan another here for next year if folks are interested.  Perhaps we can pick the dates soon so everyone can save up and plan.  We missed you Sandi and missed everyone else that wasn't able to attend.  Please plan to attend a BASH if at all possible next year.  Then you won't have to be feeling sorry about not being able to take part in all the fun!  :-)  I am SO BUMMED I'm not able to attend the BASH down south, but I'm sending my flat self and hoping for lots of photos!<br>
<br>
OK, now I need to work on a few projects with looming deadlines and then I can post my BASH photos.  Thank you again to EVERYONE that helped make this BASH such a BASH!  I will be marveling over the traded trinkets, gift bag and gift box items and everyone's ATC's for a long time!  And I can't wait to get a chance to play with my new toys!!  <br>
<br>
Thank you everyone!!<br>
<br>

We all appreciate her lugging all that STUFF to and from the BASH to share her talents with us!<br>
     Sumi-e painting-  I think I found a new art!  A big thank you to Pat Wiley Shafer for teaching us all about the art form of Sumi-e (pronounced Sumi - A.)  Lots of fun and I'm looking forward to trying more of this and learning and playing with new strokes and forms.  Pat is a great person with a warm smile and had lots of knowledge to share.  Everyone was creating beautiful masterpieces in just a short amount of time!  I plan to post one or two of mine and I'm hoping others will do the same. Aimee (sorry if I have the person wrong), you HAVE to post the bird you did! and Lorraine, please post the bamboo you were doing in green and black!  Everyone else was doing great too, so I hope to see multiple examples for everyone to Ohh and Ahh over :-)  Thank you Pat for the gift that I now have sitting out on my craft table just waiting for me to play!<br>
     Cigar box checkers - Thank you to Sarah for teaching us some cool techniques for transforming simple wooden boxes (& other items) into works of art!  It was late in the day and everyone's brains were full, but we keep on trying and learning and creating wonderful pieces thanks to excellent and patient instruction.  I still need to finish mine, but I'll post a photo when I get it done.  I know there were lots of WONDERFUL checker boxes made (& even a domino board!)  so get those photos posted!<br>
     Dinner- Again we had trouble finding a place to eat that didn't have really long wait times. We ended up at a steakhouse with a 45 minute wait.  As we were about to order appetizers, Kevin (the manager?) came by to see how we were doing and Cindy shared her idea that maybe we should order our food to go.  Kevin was really great and said he would find us a table right away.  He put us in the back dining room area because he said he could tell we needed to be in an area by ourselves!  LOL  We had some fun with banter back and forth with him throughout our meals.  Again, the food was great and the stories, laughter & even singing! was fabulous.  A great time was had by all!  <br>
     After dinner- We came back to the hotel and gabbed and laughed in their breakfast room just off the lobby till late into the night again.<br>
 <br>
 Sunday- <br>
     I slept in till the last possible moment, so others will have to share what happened this morning :-)  The day started early enough though!<br>
     The AMAZING Wizard- Cindy was not kidding when she said this little machine can do it all!  It can use several types of dye cutters and embossers, make cool backgrounds, flatten and/or emboss charms into paper and other material, and (drum roll please...) Cindy suggested I try to use it to transfer printed ink onto PZ Kut using the acetone method (because the Wizard adds way more pressure than a person's finger can) and IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!  I got a really BLACK and crisp image transfer!!  I was literally jumping for joy over this! I have been struggling with light grey image transfers ever since the ink companies changed the formula for the ink. NOW, I can get the really dark transfers I used to get!!  Other than the ART BASH attendees, this list is the first place I have shared this news.  I can't wait to tell the other carving lists I'm on and I'll be sure to give Cindy Cade the credit for this idea!  That alone was worth the price of my new Wizard! :-)  I<br>
 also had lots of fun creating textured backgrounds on the paper and there was lots of Ohh's and Ahh's during this class as people tried different things.<br>
     Lunch- We went out to lunch. Some went to Wendy's and others went to Cracker Barrel. We converged back on the hotel for the next class.<br>
     Demo of Ruffled Plastic by Wanda Hentges.  This is such a COOL and easy technique!  I didn't understand it completely till Wanda helped the "light bulb" come on for me during our shopping trip, but even if I didn't understand how it all worked, I still had great fun making beautiful little ruffled plastic pieces!  Wanda was even kind enough to buy me some shrink plastic during our shopping trip!  Thank you again!!  <br>
     Paper Marbling by Pat Thomas gets the award for generating the most Ohh's and Ahh's :-)  As Pat said, instant gratification was the standard for this class (after Pat did loads of prep work so we could all enjoy our play time!)  We first learned how to create beautiful patterns on paper using special inks and plain water.  Then we moved on to a special mixture (the ingredients are escaping me at the moment) that was more gel like and held the patterns as we moved objects through the ink/gel to move the ink into amazingly intricate patterns.  I know there will be loads of uploads of these amazing papers!  This being the last class of the day, we decided to take a chocolate break and enjoy seeing examples of some of the Awesome papers Pat had created and brought to show.  <br>
     Break- We had checked with the front desk to see if we could have the room later than 6pm and were told twice it was not a problem.  So we decided to go to the front breakfast area to share our creations and workshop projects before a few folks needed to leave.  Our plan was to continue marbling after the break.  While doing this (and thoroughly being amazed at all the different creations!) we had our only glitch in the form of a hotel staff person with "issues".  This person informed us that we were supposed to be out of the conference room by 6 and it was now 6:30 and she had people checking in that had to get their stuff into the conference room.  She made it sound urgent that we get out of the room immediately.  Well, THAT threw a wrench in works because we still had ALL our craft stuff ALL OVER the room and it was still set up to do paper marbling with tarps all over the floor, buckets of water, etc.  I can only imagine her face when she opened the door to the<br>
 room to see if it was empty and saw the chaos! :-)  But we were nice and did our very best to get packed up and out of the room as fast as possible.  Everyone pitched in and I think we HAD to have set new records for getting that much chaos clean up!  Unfortunately, that meant the end to the marbling for most and the folks that had planned to do more before leaving for home had to leave without doing more marbling.  However, those of us staying over till Monday were NOT going to be deterred!  Myself, both Pat's, Wanda and Cindy actually moved ALL the marbling equipment (two luggage dolly's worth) into my hotel room!!  We laid down the tarps again and set up my table in there and used the tub to rinse the papers!  It was a first for Pat T. and we got several pictures to prove it CAN be done! :-)  We were laughing the whole time over the condition of my room.  Thankfully, by the end of the evening, there was no trace of what we had done.  Wanda, the only remaining stubborn<br>
 marks in the sink and tub came right up with an alcohol face wipe! Lol  We ordered pizza for dinner (except for Cindy who was true to form and was doin' her own thang) and we ate in the lobby (because there wasn't anywhere to sit or set anything in my room :-)    We were up till after 1am by the time everything got cleaned up (for a second time) and packed into Pat's car.  As we went by the conference room after 11:30 pm, we were more than a little peeved that NOTHING had been changed in the room from when we rushed out of there 4.5 hours earlier!!  Grrr.<br>
 <br>
 Monday- <br>
     We had completely worn out Pat Wiley Schafer who was a real trooper and participated in almost everything throughout the weekend.  We all gave her goodbye hugs Sunday night when she went to her room at a much more reasonable hour than we did :-)  On Monday morning, we said goodbye's to Cindy who had to get home to her kids.  That meant that only myself, Wanda and Pat Thomas remained to go on a shopping spree.  Even though we were up so late, we decided to leave the hotel at 7:30am so we could be at Marco's paper when it opened!  Even though we stopped for gas and ran into a bit of traffic, we still made great time getting up there.  We Ohh'd and Ahh'd over all the many varied items inside Marco's.  Purchases were made and photos of future projects are expected :-)  We got fast food (with some minor difficulty) on our way to Stamp Your Art Out.  Again, lots of Ohh's and Ahh's and cool finds in this store.  After this, we were all pretty wiped out and we headed back to<br>
 the hotel.  I said my goodbye's and headed home for a nap :-)  Pat was headed out shortly after we got back to the hotel and Wanda was smart to plan on staying another night before her 10.5 hour drive home!<br>
 <br>
 I'll say it again, just as everyone else has... IT WAS A BLAST!!!!!!!!  I would love to plan another here for next year if folks are interested.  Perhaps we can pick the dates soon so everyone can save up and plan.  We missed you Sandi and missed everyone else that wasn't able to attend.  Please plan to attend a BASH if at all possible next year.  Then you won't have to be feeling sorry about not being able to take part in all the fun!  :-)  I am SO BUMMED I'm not able to attend the BASH down south, but I'm sending my flat self and hoping for lots of photos!<br>
 <br>
 OK, now I need to work on a few projects with looming deadlines and then I can post my BASH photos.  Thank you again to EVERYONE that helped make this BASH such a BASH!  I will be marveling over the traded trinkets, gift bag and gift box items and everyone's ATC's for a long time!  And I can't wait to get a chance to play with my new toys!!  <br>
 <br>
 Thank you everyone!!<br>
 <br>
 So, are you ready to sign up for this year's BASH?  Let me know if you are. :-)  DogScouts@hotmail.com Photos of last year's bash and the projects made during the bash can be found on my Picture Trail website: www.PictureTrail.com/scoutdogs<br>

  Just wondering what you pay for the cups. I can get cups for cheap through my mother's company Fabri-kal. Let me know how many you need and I could price them!<br>
