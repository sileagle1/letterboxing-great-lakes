status of the Magic Hedge:<br/>
<br/>
Last night on the way home I rode my bike down to the lake to check on<br/>
the box. I thought it'd take just a few minutes and I'd be on my way.<br/>
Walking closer it was amazing how the landscape has changed in just a<br/>
few months since I placed the box. Tall weeds and seedling trees where<br/>
there had only been sand, a huge permanent puddle where there had been<br/>
dry land. When I got to the hole where the box was hidden, there was<br/>
someone else there! A big ol' mama raccoon, staring at me. It didn't<br/>
run away, no, instead it retreated to the hole where the letterbox was<br/>
hidden. <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering how I would ever check on the box now, when suddenly I<br/>
saw 3 more little raccoon faces peeking out. The perfect hiding spot<br/>
for a letterbox was now a cozy raccoon home. Its not at all the place<br/>
where you would expect to see raccoons living, but its also not the<br/>
first time I've encountered raccoon families living in letterbox<br/>
hiding places! These raccoons were adolescent, nearly grown, so they'd<br/>
probably been living there a while.<br/>
<br/>
I waited a long time, the raccoons would come out of their house, poke<br/>
around in the puddle for a while, play/fight each other, and then race<br/>
back to the hole at the slightest sound. Finally they all went off<br/>
into the bushes and I dared approach. It was pretty frightening to put<br/>
my hand into the dark space to feel for the box in case there was one<br/>
little critter left behind, but better my hand than stick my head in<br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
Well, the end of the story is that the Magic Hedge letterbox is gone,<br/>
again. If you want to find a cute raccoon family, however, follow the<br/>
clues in the evening and stand very still until they come out of their<br/>
house.<br/>
