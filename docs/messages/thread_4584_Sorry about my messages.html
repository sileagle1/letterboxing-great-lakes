Hotmail just "fixed" a server problem and I guess it's finally spitting out what it has been saving up for about a YEAR!  The emails I'm getting are either really bizzare or bringing back memories :-)   Hopefully it will be done soon. Of course it hasn't fixed the problems I'm having getting my messages to send!  Still getting "Hotmail is unable to send your besage, The server is busy.  Try again later."
