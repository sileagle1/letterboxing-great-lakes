it's time to catch up on our thank you duties . . . .<br/>
<br/>
Bingo Booty - Thanks to SpringChick for organizing, keeping the game<br/>
going, and sending out the prizes.  Thanks to all of our fellow<br/>
players for the bountiful booty to keep us boxing in all seasons. <br/>
Each drawing added drama to our day.<br/>
<br/>
Gathering - We add our public thanks to M&amp;8X, Eagle Eyes, and<br/>
Rosmarinus for organizing the Cluez_In and Sock Hop.  Another to all<br/>
of the folks who carved, planted, attended, donated prizes,<br/>
contributed to the potluck, joined us on the trail or at the picnic<br/>
area, and otherwise helped to create an excellent event.  The raffle<br/>
was fun and the prizes will keep us busy.  Yes, the grand prize was<br/>
grand.  <br/>
<br/>
The storage area for our letterboxing supplies is overflowing.  It's a<br/>
good thing the grand prize came in a bag.  We will enjoy using the<br/>
practical, creative, handmade, and unusual booty and prize items that<br/>
will help us create our future boxes, shed light on our finds, and<br/>
keep us comfortable during our adventures.  <br/>
