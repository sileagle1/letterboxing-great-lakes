  Woo hoo again! I'm out of town on a business trip, so can't update the <br/>
  info yet, but I'm excited to announce that 3 more Wisconsin counties <br/>
  now have a box: Ashland, Forest and Marqeutte!<br/>
<br/>
  Special thanks to ChickenNStars (Ashland county) and The Fellowship <br/>
  (Forest county)! I'll be posting clues soon for the box I placed in <br/>
  Marqwette county this weekend (am currently on a business trip to CA, <br/>
  so am limited in access to maps, etc). However the good news is that <br/>
  we have 3 more counties with boxes which only leaves 18 to go in <br/>
  Wisconsin. When I get back home this weekend I'll update the map and <br/>
  post another message.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Beetle!  Your thought has gone through my head many times as well.  <br/>
Like when I'm driving down the road with all kinds of camo-taped <br/>
containers sitting on the front seat beside me.  I often wonder how I <br/>
would handle it if I got pulled over for speeding (to another letterbox) <br/>
or something. <br/>
<br/>
On top of that, a week or so ago, I went down to visit my son in NC <br/>
before he deploys for the 3rd time.  There was a box placed at Fort <br/>
Bragg where he is based, on the day he deployed the last time.  My son <br/>
and his wife and I finally got a chance to go hunt for that box---again, <br/>
this is ON post and you have to go through a complete inspection to get <br/>
on Fort Bragg property.  The box is gone...and I can't say any of us was <br/>
surprised.  In fact, I think it made us feel better that someone removed <br/>
it for obvious reasons, and yet, we still pressed to find it just in <br/>
case!  :)  The placer is a member of Special Forces and he or she is <br/>
most likely deployed right now themselves.  What we won't do for <br/>
letterboxes?!<br/>

&gt; If US Homeland Security and the Governor of the State of Wisconsin <br/>
&gt; and the National Guard only knew what was hidden inside fallen <br/>
&gt; hollow trees and under bridges throughout the state they would be <br/>
&gt; in shock!    However, at this rate, Wisconsin will soon be the <br/>
&gt; letterbox capital of the USA! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Beetle <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Oh ho!  You MUST know what the true LB capital of the USA is, right?  <br/>
It is definitely Connecticut which has almost 3,500 boxes.  Based on <br/>
square miles,  WI is almost 12 times larger than CT.  If we had the <br/>
same proportion of letterboxes to square miles, we would have over <br/>
41,000 boxes in our state!!!  However we actually only have 632 boxes <br/>
based on checking the letterboxing.org site tonight.<br/>
<br/>
DISCLAIMER:  I know not all boxes are listed on the LBNA site and I <br/>
also know that not all boxes listed on LBNA are publically accesible or <br/>
active boxes.  I'm just using it as the most popular box listing site <br/>
for a point of comparison.<br/>
<br/>
Given the disclaimer above, I was interested in how the 6 states in the <br/>
Great Lakes region compared to each other in terms of how many boxes <br/>
were listed.  Here are the results based on a look tonight (based on <br/>
number of boxes, not just number of listings, since some listings are <br/>
for a series with multiple boxes):<br/>
<br/>
1,318  Ohio<br/>
  691  Illinois<br/>
  632  Wisconsin<br/>
  521  Michigan<br/>
  423  Indiana<br/>
  158  Minnesota<br/>
<br/>
So you can see that not only is WI not the letterboxing capital of the <br/>
US, it isn't even that high in our region.  I have to admit I was quite <br/>
surprised to see the large count for Ohio because it doesn't seem like <br/>
this list has many Ohio representatives.  I guess we'll have a chance <br/>
to find lots of boxes when we head to the Great Lakes Gathering in Ohio <br/>
next year!<br/>

P.S.  Can you tell I am a geeky engineer who loves statistics??<br/>

Thanks for sharing those stats!!  Recently there was an article here in <br/>
Ohio written about letterboxing and the article mentioned that Ohio was <br/>
the first or second in the country?!  Believe me, we were all suprised <br/>
by that as well, but I think the TON of boxes in the Cincy area have a <br/>
lot to do with it.  I would have bet money it would have been Georgia.  <br/>
There are 200 boxes in the Stone Mtn area alone from what I've been <br/>
told. We don't have boxes in every county here yet either so there is <br/>
still room to grow!  :)<br/>

Actually, if the governor knew, he'd either put a tax on letterboxes<br/>
