I have found a great ruse for when letterboxing: I carry a bag of<br>
aluminum cans I collect along the way, makes me look a bit like a crazy<br>
bag lady but keeps suspicion away. :)<br>
<br>
anyway, Skootching dog and I were checking out plants to make sure they<br>
wintered well in MN.  I had my bag of cans with me, and was merrily<br>
picking them up as we went along.  We were homeward bound when SD found<br>
an old bums' nest from last fall, and in it (wait for it...) was the<br>
TREASURE TROVE of abandoned aluminum cans!<br>
<br>
fortunately, I had a second bag in my hoodie, so I swiped all the bums'<br>
cans.  Later I remembered how many letterboxes get defaced by bums et<br>
al.  So, I took one back for the letterboxing community.  SD was lookout<br>
for any errant bums, and we got away safely.<br>

Just wanted to share a Sunday story of LB adventures.<br>

cheers!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oooh, I am so jealous of you finding the aluminum can stash!  Deedle & I are regular aluminum can scavengers, making our trip to the scrap yard every few months to turn our cans in.  Every time I see a can on the side of the road that we can't pick up I wimper, "But that's money lying there!"<br>
<br>
I'm, um, making us sound kind of desperate for cash, aren't I?  But we do NOT raid curb-side recycling bins; evidently earlier this week, on the day of the weekly trash pick-up, someone took all the aluminum cans out of a friend's recycle box!<br>
