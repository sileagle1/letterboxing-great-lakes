<div>I think you should absolutely record your old finds on AtlasQuest if you're so inclined. The main purpose of your virtual logbook on AQ is for you to have a record of your finds. It's true that each find you record will trigger a message to the planter, but I don't think anyone will mind. I know I don't when I receive a find notice from the past. You might copy and paste a brief note when you're doing this, something like "Just getting caught up on recording old finds."<br/><br/>At any rate, congratulations on 14 years of letterboxing and the memories made!<br/><br/>Dawnkey</div><div><br/></div>
