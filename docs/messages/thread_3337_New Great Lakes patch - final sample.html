<br/>
I've posted the final sample of the new patch in the photos section <br/>
and have oredered a quantity of 200.  There was more interest than I <br/>
anticipated and I really appreciate everyone entering their requests <br/>
in the database so I could easily get a handle on the amount to order.<br/>
<br/>
The other good news is that with the larger quantity and final <br/>
pricing, the price per patch will again be $1.50.<br/>
<br/>
Now we'll have to wait for them to actually arrive (probably mid-<br/>
December, but no guarantees).  You can send me a check and self-<br/>
addressed envelope now, and I'll hold onto it until the patches <br/>
arrive, then get them immediately in the mail to you OR you can wait <br/>
to send in the check and SASE until after I announce that I've <br/>
received them.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a link to see the final patch and get ordering info:<br/>

<br/>
(Please don't forget the self-addressed envelope)<br/>
<br/>
I'll repost this same info when they actually arrive.<br/>

So what do you think is next - will the NY contingency be petitioning <br/>
