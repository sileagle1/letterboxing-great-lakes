                    <div class="plaintext-content">Someone noted that Matt the Rat's boxes included commercially created<br>
stamps. As I recall, Matt designs the image himself and then has the<br>
stamp prepared by a commercial firm.<br>
Matt, correct me if I got that wrong.<br>
Anyway, here is a source to have your own drawings or copyright-free<br>
art made into stamps. There are two links. The first describes the<br>
main site and the second tells you how to prepare your images.<br>
What you'll get: a 7" x 9" sheet of ready to cut apart and mount<br>
rubber stamps. Obviously it's most cost effective to squeeze as many<br>
images onto that 7 x 9 sheet because the price per image naturally<br>
drops. It's in the neighborhood of $35 per sheet. But it's certainly<br>
cheaper than paying $5 - $10 per stamp.<br>

www.polyclay.com/ready.htm<br>
<br>
Of course, I strongly encourage you to carve your own stamps. You CAN<br>
do it.<br>
But, if you'd rather transfer your own images onto good quality<br>
rubber, try these links. BTW, the people who do the work at this firm<br>
are especially in need of rewarding employment and they do a great job!<br>
I am not in any way connected with these businesses.<br>
<br>
Good luck,<br>
