hopefully they will be able to provide us with a concrete answer.<br/>

from opening it.  Make sure also that your Anti-Virus, Anti-Spy, Firewall<br/>

e-mails is also necessary.<br/>

<br/>
Description: Received this forwarded message - is it true???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My virus program (Avast) has found that all of the mail being sent<br/>
from Yahoo with the subject line (new graphics program) is a virus. <br/>
<br/>
You don't have to open any files you only have to view it on Outlook<br/>
express mail to be infected. <br/>
<br/>
The name of the virus is (VBS:Banker-b) (Tri) I would advise anyone<br/>
that has "auto forword" mail to their personal mail box to turn it off<br/>
until Yahoo can get this cleared up and if you have received this mail<br/>
please run a virus scan on your systems.<br/>
<br/>
