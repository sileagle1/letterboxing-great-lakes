I hope that others weigh in on this one too, but here's my two <br>
cents...<br>
As far as I know, if the box is in a MI State Park, the annual <br>
visitor pass will get you into *any/all* of the parks. I think the <br>
annual fee is $24. (others help me out if I've got it wrong).<br>
Of course, as you may have read, there are policies in place which <br>
reportedly require the boxes to be registered and placement fees to <br>
be paid to the Michigan State Parks folks.<br>
<br>
County parks vary from place to place.<br>
I'm sure if you post a list of where you're headed, the MI placers <br>
will help out with specifics.<br>

Welcome!<br>
You're in our neck of the woods (SW, lower MI).<br>
And you've come along at a good time with more and more boxes and <br>
boxers on the scene.<br>
We look forward to having more to hunt around here, too.<br>
Fort Custer has at least five, I think. And there's another not too <br>

Good luck,<br>

If you need help determining which parks are metroparks or what in my neck of the woods, I'd be happy to help.<br>
 <br>
I don't know if those SW Michiganders have metroparks, since they're a heap of hayseed country bumpkins with no metropolis to speak of.  *grinning and ducking*  And mostly they'll take payment in trade.  Chickens and calico and such.<br>

visitor's pass we could buy for those few days?  It looks like <br>
several of the parks are in different park districts, there probably <br>
isn't any sort of universal state-wide pass, is there?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Michigan State Parks have raised their fees this year, although it has been<br>
several years since an increase, so I can't complain.  A daily non-resident<br>
pass is now $8.  That is good for all state parks on any one particular day,<br>
unlike some states where it is good only at the park where purchased.  The<br>
non-resident annual pass is now $29.  Most counties in Michigan charge an<br>
entrance fee to County Parks -- this ranges anywhere from $3 to $6 per day<br>
and is good for all County Parks in that particular county on the specific<br>
day it was purchased.  As Delirium mentioned, the Metroparks in the SE part<br>
of the state charge fees similar to County Parks.  Other than that, most<br>
local parks do not charge an entrance fee, although there are exceptions<br>
here and there.<br>
<br>
If you have a route in mind and post to the list, I am sure we can all<br>
provide you with not only fee information, but also options for boxes that<br>
may be placed in non-fee parks.  One thing to keep in mind concerning the<br>
State Parks...  as the state parks instituted a charge for placement of<br>
letterboxes this year, if you do happen to run across boxes in those parks,<br>
please be especially discreet.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you to everyone who's answered so far.  Here's<br>
the list of the boxes I've found clues for that we're<br>
taking with us in August.  Like I posted for the TOTW<br>
Travel Plans, I found clues for 42 boxes, and since<br>
we're only going to be there for a few days and have<br>
this wedding I know we won't hit them all (but I can<br>
dream, can't I?).   <br>

 <br>
(I'm a geek & made a list up in Excel)<br>
<br>
Here's our route:  Friday the 13th of August we leave<br>
in the morning to drive out.  My thought was we'd hit<br>
the western Ohio boxes on the way out (the last 7 on<br>
the list), but we might skip those since we could do<br>
most of those as a day trip and visit the counties<br>
surrounding Adrian instead (Hillsdale, Jackson,<br>
Monroe, Washtenaw).  Saturday's the wedding, but the<br>
ceremony doesn't start until 2 so I'll probably drag<br>
Deedle to find the Adrian letterbox in the morning :) <br>
Sunday we're heading to Dearborn & the Henry Ford<br>
Museum by way of Livingston (I know, a real direct<br>
route) because we must visit Hell!  If we survive<br>
Hell, we'd then visit Oakland & Macomb on the way to<br>
Dearborn, and/or try to find some of the Wayne county<br>
boxes.  Monday we're hanging out at Greenfield<br>
Village, and my trusty AAA guide book says to set<br>
aside an entire day for that, so I don't think there<br>
will be any boxhunting going on.  Tuesday we head back<br>
to Ohio, hopefully stopping for a box or two on the<br>
way (but Deedle needs to go to work on Wednesday, so<br>
I'm not sure how much time we can deteer from the<br>
drive home).<br>
