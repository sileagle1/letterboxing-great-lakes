I hope that others weigh in on this one too, but here's my two <br/>
cents...<br/>
As far as I know, if the box is in a MI State Park, the annual <br/>
visitor pass will get you into *any/all* of the parks. I think the <br/>
annual fee is $24. (others help me out if I've got it wrong).<br/>
Of course, as you may have read, there are policies in place which <br/>
reportedly require the boxes to be registered and placement fees to <br/>
be paid to the Michigan State Parks folks.<br/>
<br/>
County parks vary from place to place.<br/>
I'm sure if you post a list of where you're headed, the MI placers <br/>
will help out with specifics.<br/>
<br/>
We're waiting to help you enjoy your Michigan letterboxing trip.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In SE Michigan there are a lot of "metroparks".  You can buy a day pass, which is valid at all parks for the duration of the day, or an annual pass.  Day passes are about three bones.<br/>
If you need help determining which parks are metroparks or what in my neck of the woods, I'd be happy to help.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if those SW Michiganders have metroparks, since they're a heap of hayseed country bumpkins with no metropolis to speak of.  *grinning and ducking*  And mostly they'll take payment in trade.  Chickens and calico and such.<br/>

I hope that others weigh in on this one too, but here's my two <br/>
cents...<br/>
As far as I know, if the box is in a MI State Park, the annual <br/>
visitor pass will get you into *any/all* of the parks. I think the <br/>
annual fee is $24. (others help me out if I've got it wrong).<br/>
Of course, as you may have read, there are policies in place which <br/>
reportedly require the boxes to be registered and placement fees to <br/>
be paid to the Michigan State Parks folks.<br/>
<br/>
County parks vary from place to place.<br/>
I'm sure if you post a list of where you're headed, the MI placers <br/>
will help out with specifics.<br/>
<br/>
We're waiting to help you enjoy your Michigan letterboxing trip.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Michigan State Parks have raised their fees this year, although it has been<br/>
several years since an increase, so I can't complain.  A daily non-resident<br/>
pass is now $8.  That is good for all state parks on any one particular day,<br/>
unlike some states where it is good only at the park where purchased.  The<br/>
non-resident annual pass is now $29.  Most counties in Michigan charge an<br/>
entrance fee to County Parks -- this ranges anywhere from $3 to $6 per day<br/>
and is good for all County Parks in that particular county on the specific<br/>
day it was purchased.  As Delirium mentioned, the Metroparks in the SE part<br/>
of the state charge fees similar to County Parks.  Other than that, most<br/>
local parks do not charge an entrance fee, although there are exceptions<br/>
here and there.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a route in mind and post to the list, I am sure we can all<br/>
provide you with not only fee information, but also options for boxes that<br/>
may be placed in non-fee parks.  One thing to keep in mind concerning the<br/>
State Parks...  as the state parks instituted a charge for placement of<br/>
letterboxes this year, if you do happen to run across boxes in those parks,<br/>
please be especially discreet.<br/>

we're only going to be there for a few days and have<br/>

(I'm a geek &amp; made a list up in Excel)<br/>
<br/>
Here's our route:  Friday the 13th of August we leave<br/>
in the morning to drive out.  My thought was we'd hit<br/>
the western Ohio boxes on the way out (the last 7 on<br/>
the list), but we might skip those since we could do<br/>
most of those as a day trip and visit the counties<br/>
surrounding Adrian instead (Hillsdale, Jackson,<br/>
Monroe, Washtenaw).  Saturday's the wedding, but the<br/>
ceremony doesn't start until 2 so I'll probably drag<br/>
Deedle to find the Adrian letterbox in the morning :) <br/>
Sunday we're heading to Dearborn &amp; the Henry Ford<br/>
Museum by way of Livingston (I know, a real direct<br/>
route) because we must visit Hell!  If we survive<br/>
Hell, we'd then visit Oakland &amp; Macomb on the way to<br/>
Dearborn, and/or try to find some of the Wayne county<br/>
boxes.  Monday we're hanging out at Greenfield<br/>
Village, and my trusty AAA guide book says to set<br/>
aside an entire day for that, so I don't think there<br/>
will be any boxhunting going on.  Tuesday we head back<br/>
to Ohio, hopefully stopping for a box or two on the<br/>
way (but Deedle needs to go to work on Wednesday, so<br/>
I'm not sure how much time we can deteer from the<br/>
drive home).<br/>
