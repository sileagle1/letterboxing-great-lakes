I think that my strategy next time is to have the little members of Team Rabbit pick the words for my card. They do well every year....and me...usually not so much! <br>
<br>
With that being said....we are all having a great time with the game! Looking forward to seeing what "Bingo words" February brings! <br>

Keep up the good work. I'm very curious for you to draw the name of the box I planted that's on the bingo card, so I can see what you've come up with for it. <br>
