                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been informed that there seems to be a change in policy about hiding boxes in the Milwaukee County Parks.  Apparently we need to complete forms and have the boxes approved ahead of time now.  (We also have to clearly mark them in large letters as a "geocache"..., but I digress.) I know I checked on their policy not too long ago, and there were no restrictions at that time.  I haven't decided what to do about all my boxes yet, but thought others should know.<br>
<br>
As a side note to the veteran letterboxers - I found out about the new policy b/c our friend from the Wehr Nature Center found my note about him on the Antiquity site and emailed me.  Apparently he is a minor geocacher now, and didn't take too fondly to my rant about him (guess I don't blame him).  That said, he says that as long as the MCP policy is followed, boxes can be hidden at Wehr and at the park down there, and that he didn't remove the old boxes.  Not sure if he's looking for the Wehr's Waldo box or not... :-)<br>
