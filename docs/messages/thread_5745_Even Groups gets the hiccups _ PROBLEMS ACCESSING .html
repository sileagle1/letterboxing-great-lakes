Subject: [moderatorcentral] Even Groups gets the hiccups<br>
<br>
Over the past three weeks we know that some of you have experienced a few hiccups while using Yahoo! Groups. For this, we're sorry– we're in the process of moving to new data centers, a move which should enable us to deliver faster page loads, a more stable system, and an all-around better user experience.<br>
<br>
Currently, about 75% of Yahoo! Groups have been moved over to the new data centers and the remaining 25% of groups will be moved over in phases between now and March 31st.<br>
<br>
As is the case with any move, however, issues sometimes arise, which in this case have resulted in temporary delays or bugs. As a result of this, some of you may be experiencing a temporary issue accessing your files and we're working to resolve that now.  We're sorry about any inconvenience caused by these problems; and we appreciate your patience, as we work through these issues in an effort to improve your experience on Yahoo! Groups.<br>
