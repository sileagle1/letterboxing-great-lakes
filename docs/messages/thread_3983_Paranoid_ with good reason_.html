yesterday.  I received a status update today from someone who <br/>
actually went out today to find the box that I planted yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
That's not the bizarre part.  The bizarre part is that this first <br/>
finder just so happens to be friends with the neighbors of my <br/>
cemetery.  They went over to talk to them, and the lady WAS watching <br/>
me and DID think I was being suspicious!  I guess I wasn't being as <br/>
attentive to the stones as I thought I was.   I guess I need to work <br/>
on my acting skills.  I gotta remember to bring my camera tomorrow <br/>
for my next plant.   Thanks for the pointers and advice that Mosey <br/>
and others offered.<br/>
<br/>
Still... What are the odds of them actually knowing the neighbors?  I <br/>
can't get over it.  LOL   It's a small world, after all.  ;)<br/>

their friend, that's partially what kept their attention on you.  Those <br/>
ignorant of letterboxing/geocaching might not notice or pay as close of <br/>
attention to random wandering -- but I don't know.  At least for us, now <br/>
that we know about letterboxing, Atom and I are constantly watching <br/>
"suspicious" looking people because we're trying to figure out if they <br/>
are boxers or not!  That's what happened when we stumbled upon With a <br/>
Cherry on Top, Music Nerd, and their mom a month or so ago out on the <br/>
trail. :)<br/>
<br/>
Although bending over and looking inside logs/stumps is a little more <br/>
obviously "suspicious" than walking around a cemetery.<br/>
