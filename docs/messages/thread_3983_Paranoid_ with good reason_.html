yesterday.  I received a status update today from someone who <br>
actually went out today to find the box that I planted yesterday.<br>
<br>
That's not the bizarre part.  The bizarre part is that this first <br>
finder just so happens to be friends with the neighbors of my <br>
cemetery.  They went over to talk to them, and the lady WAS watching <br>
me and DID think I was being suspicious!  I guess I wasn't being as <br>
attentive to the stones as I thought I was.   I guess I need to work <br>
on my acting skills.  I gotta remember to bring my camera tomorrow <br>
for my next plant.   Thanks for the pointers and advice that Mosey <br>
and others offered.<br>
<br>
Still... What are the odds of them actually knowing the neighbors?  I <br>
can't get over it.  LOL   It's a small world, after all.  ;)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Or maybe since they (perhaps?) already knew about letterboxing from <br>
their friend, that's partially what kept their attention on you.  Those <br>
ignorant of letterboxing/geocaching might not notice or pay as close of <br>
attention to random wandering -- but I don't know.  At least for us, now <br>
that we know about letterboxing, Atom and I are constantly watching <br>
"suspicious" looking people because we're trying to figure out if they <br>
are boxers or not!  That's what happened when we stumbled upon With a <br>
Cherry on Top, Music Nerd, and their mom a month or so ago out on the <br>
trail. :)<br>
<br>
Although bending over and looking inside logs/stumps is a little more <br>
obviously "suspicious" than walking around a cemetery.<br>
