  Spring Chick, what are the chances of us seeing pictures or at least <br>
  reading about all of the wonderful prizes we might have one if only you <br>

Hard to believe there were so few words left before a full card was <br>
called.  I echo the thanks to SpringChick for Bingo and Azobox for <br>
SideWagers.  However, now that Bingo is over--shouldn't it start <br>
feeling like spring?!<br>

I'm glad to hear I didn't miss you -- I was up at the shelter in the morning and then out on the trail in the afternon and was afraid we had just missed one another.  Sorry to hear about your neck -- hope it is feeling better today.  I will mail your prize package, along with the others, this week.<br>

This year there were 9 words left when the game ended, last year there <br>
were 14 words left.  The game ended this year on APR 24 and last year <br>
on APR 23.  Although the game lasted only 1 day longer, there were <br>
more words called this year due to leap day, more "extra call" days <br>
and fewer "no call" days.<br>
