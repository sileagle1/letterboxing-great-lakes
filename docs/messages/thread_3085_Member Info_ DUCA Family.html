  <br>
I originally read about letterboxing in Family Fun magazine I think around 2000. It was literally one or two lines about treasure hunting and the website. I would think of it every once in awhile but never even checked out the website -when I think of all those years we missed out :(<br>
   <br>
  In April of 2004 Jeff was being sent up to Ansul Fire School for Training. I was looking for something to do while in the area and for some reason FINALLY checked out the letterboxing site. I called Jeff told him all about it and had I think every page printed off from every website I could find about letterboxing for both of us to read.<br>
   <br>
  Before we left for the trip I printed off clues for 2 boxes. E-way Trail and Red Arrow Park. We actually didn't find our first attempted box. Well not a complete box. We found chewed up plastic some scattered papers but we weren't really sure what we were supposed to find. A few days later we went searching for Red Arrow Park. We followed all the clues, found the box and left immediately for the nearest store. We HAD to buy a stamp, ink pad and cardstock so we could go back. The next day I went to the library and printed off clues for us for the entire trip home. After Jeff got out of training we rewalked Red Arrow Park and stamped in.<br>
   <br>
   <br>
  So far we have found close to 200 boxes (Not bad with so few near us and taking almost a year off because of the fire  lol) and boxed in 7 states. We now combine all of our travel plans with letterboxing. <br>
   <br>
  We've been to 2 gatherings and have really enjoyed getting to meet other boxers. <br>
   <br>
  We have some plans to actually start planting in our area. We're finally feeling ready. Plus we're hoping if we start planting we might get more local boxers to plant for us to find too. :)<br>
