Sunday was a wonderful day!! <br>
 <br>
Saturday night Becki suggested we head up to Rockford for some letterboxing <br>
 -- isn't she the best!! :-)<br>
 <br>
So, in a flurry I printed up clues to several new boxes in the  <br>
Rockford/State Line area.<br>
 <br>
Our first stop was a series of 3 boxes based on Arcades of the 1980's --  <br>
talk about memories! Walking to the first box, I notice a man at the tree <br>
line  right where the first box was. Hmm, he had a backpack on . . . could it <br>
be, only  the second or third time since we've been boxing, running into <br>
other boxers on  the trail?<br>
 <br>
By the time we got to the first box, the couple was well on their way to  <br>
box #2. I didn't want to shout anything, what if they weren't boxers to begin <br>
 with? So, I hurriedly opened the logbook..... Tat2Bob & Kimberly!! I <br>
ditched  Beciki & the kids and went running to catch up.<br>
 <br>
It was the first time we had met Bob & Kimberly, been keeping up on  their <br>
exploits for nearly a year now. So what a thrill it was to finally meet  <br>
them. <br>
 <br>
We went back to box #1 & finished the series together. Talking and  sharing <br>
tales along the way. It was so refreshing to meet boxers just as crazy  as <br>
I am -- I mean that in the kindest way possible Bob & Kimberly :-)<br>
 <br>
We went our separate ways.... Tat2Bob & Kimberly to their next box....  us <br>
to the McD's drive through. <br>
 <br>
We then hit the trails again and found a few more nice boxes  by  <br>
SweetEllGee. And then, who do we run into again? Yup, you know it. <br>
 <br>
We attempted a box with our friends and then went on to a very nice spot on <br>
 the river front where we found another. The kids loved the cool playground <br>
there  and we enjoyed visiting some more with Tat2Bob & Kimberly.<br>
 <br>
After this, we went our separate ways again. We headed to the Wisconsin  <br>
Welcome Center Rest Area and found a couple boxes there...... and I was first  <br>
finder of a Geocache that was just placed the day before -- I didn't write <br>
my  name or exchange any junk. I warned Pastors Wife of her box.... I hope <br>
the  Geocachers don't take the awesome stamp carved by Krait!!!<br>
 <br>
Then we hit the Illinois Welcome Center Rest Area for another box.<br>
 <br>
We then found 2 great boxes located near a stone bridge built in 1882 . . . <br>
 very impressive. Without the boxes, we never would have visited that site. <br>
We  ended our day at dusk with one more find and a playground to burn off <br>
the last  of the kids energy before the long drive home.<br>
 <br>
We pulled into the driveway at 11:30 that night and went straight to bed. I <br>
 am still recovering from the day -- but was it worth it!!  We found 12  <br>
boxes and met Tat2Bob & Kimberly -- all in all, it doesn't get much better  <br>
than that!!!!<br>

Yes, Becki is the best to suggest some letterboxing.  On a similar note, recently my daughter actually suggested that we go in search of some new boxes in the Gurnee area and I almost fell over.  She's the poster child for anti-letterboxing.  Still trying to figure what she's up to.  ???  Then, my husband agreed to attend two meet and greets.  Shock!  They are up to something.  I just haven't figured it out yet.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Matt, you've got it bad.  Now you're ditching the wife and family to chance strangers in the woods.  LOL!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I've met the notorious tat2bobandkimberly several times, and I've gone boxing with 'tat' too.  If anyone ever needs a boxing buddy, just call 1-800-boxingbuddybob, and he will be there.  Standard charges apply, $10.00 for the first minute and $1.00 for each additional minute. Worth the price!   <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Loving this cool summer weather.  Not too many bugs either.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Happy Boxing!<br>

What you must have thought.  Makes you wonder why a couple suddenly turns and runs away?  What did they see in the woods...maybe a skunk!  Then, you return to the parking lot and there they are....waiting....ploting....to stuff your bodies in the trunk.   No, bob and kimberly wouldn't do that.  tee hee (sinister laugh).   <br>

  my name or exchange any junk. I warned Pastors Wife of her box.... I hope <br>
  the Geocachers don't take the awesome stamp carved by Krait!!!<br>
<br>
  Then we hit the Illinois Welcome Center Rest Area for another box.<br>
<br>
  We then found 2 great boxes located near a stone bridge built in 1882 . . . <br>
  very impressive. Without the boxes, we never would have visited that site. <br>
  We ended our day at dusk with one more find and a playground to burn off <br>
  the last of the kids energy before the long drive home.<br>
