                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just thought I'd let you all know that I spent the day checking on <br/>
and replacing some missing boxes from this series.  I updated all the <br/>
clues on Atlas Quest. The Alaska stamp (part 5) has been replaced. (The <br/>
box and logbook were there, just the stamp was missing.) Missouri(part <br/>
2) is replaced and in a new location. Rhode Island (part 7) had been <br/>
reported missing but was actually there.  Massachusetts (part 3) and <br/>
Michigan (part 6) are both missing and will be replaced soon.  <br/>
Hopefully I'll get to carve the stamps for the last 15 states soon!<br/>
