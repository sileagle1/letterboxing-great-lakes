Sure!  Flying Dragon and I did a lot of talking about this on the way<br>
home from the Cluez In and we'll go ahead and host!  The date will be<br>
either September 8 or September 15 and the theme will be the '80s.  If<br>
anyone wants to contribute a box (or suggest a less generic theme, I<br>
have to admit that what I remember from the 80s is mostly the Sat.<br>
morning cartoons) you can email me at ainawgsd@yahoo.com.  The<br>
location has yet to be determined as we are still looking into that. <br>
As soon as we settle on one date for sure we'll post this information<br>

I was all set to do a Ms. PacMan box (since I do love that game--even <br>
got it for Christmas 2 years ago), but I may have to seriously think <br>
about doing "Where's the Beef!"--since it has a connection with one <br>
of our boxes and because I have such funny memories of that phrase <br>
(so I can't believe I forgot that phrase in my list of 80's stuff). <br>
<br>
In the early 80's, I was working as a nurse in one of the big <br>
teaching hospitals in Chicago (still am--just a different hospital <br>
now).  One of the interns with a warped sense of humor told one of my <br>
very demented patients that if she needed her nurse, she should just <br>
yell "Where's the Beef". Well, I was sitting in the conference room <br>
doing discharge rounds when I hear this voice in the hallway <br>
bellowing "Where's the Beef! Where's the Beef!".  I go out into the <br>
hallway and see that it is my patient doing the yelling--and the <br>
intern is REALLY rolling on the floor laughing when he sees my face. <br>
Frankly, I can't believe that she remembered what he told her.  We <br>
medical folk do tend to have a sick sense of humor about our <br>
work :~)   <br>

Yeah - that would be something I would do...maybe that<br>
