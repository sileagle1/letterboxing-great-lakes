                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you BristolStitch for taking the lead on getting letterboxing<br/>
rolling at the Bristol Ren Faire this year, as both Dragon and I are<br/>
going on long vacations this summer.<br/>
Boxes are planted and clues are live!  There are 7 new boxes in the 2013<br/>
series, and the boxes from 2012 and 2011 have also been replanted.  The<br/>
6 "permanent" boxes are back in place and there are many letterpeople<br/>
wandering about as well.<br/>
Bristol Ren Faire Boxes<br/>

<br/>
Most of the boxes can be stamped in black or another single color.  Two<br/>
of the new boxes require specific colors. NO EXCEPTIONS!!  One is all<br/>
blue, the other needs red, green, yellow, and black markers.  If you<br/>
don't have or didn't bring markers, stop by Mockingbird Studios and ask<br/>
BristolStitch to borrow some.<br/>
Enjoy your day at the Faire! Get some letterboxes, watch a show, see the<br/>
Queen and her Court, do some shopping!<br/>
