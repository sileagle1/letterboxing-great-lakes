Also, for eating, I meet up with TwoFreeTimers before the MO event in September at a place called One World near Bradley University(parking can be found across the street at Starbucks) and it was really good I thought. There *was* a box there from the Locksmiths, but unfortunately it went missing. However there are quite a few in that neighborhood.<br/>
Or if you want some good Italiano-Avantis Ristorante is your destination. I too *had* a box there before I started working there(Pizza Boy I am!) but there food is yummy!<br/>
<br/>
And if you go farther south to Springfield-they have loads of boxes(pitties did quite a few a few months ago and didn't get them all!) so youll stay busy there too! As far as eating, Im not that familiar with the area, but a family favorite is always a crackerbarrel :) and what do you know? A box is there!<br/>

Any Q.s you have Im here!<br/>
Have fun,<br/>
