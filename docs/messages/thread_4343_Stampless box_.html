I tracked down a newly placed box today only to discover there was no <br>
stamp inside, just a logbook and an inkpad.  My first thought was "Wow, <br>
that stamp was stolen quickly", but as I read into the logbook I found <br>
a note from the placer which suggested "using your thumbprint to log <br>
into your own logbook as a momento of finding this letterbox."  <br>
<br>
I know there's been a lot of discussion on the Big List about the <br>
necessity of logbooks in letterboxes, but isn't a stamp kinda the <br>
essence of a letterbox?  Or am I just being too picky?<br>

<br>
Yeah, that's lame.  I'd be very irritated if I found that without <br>
warning.  Was this a box with a clue to another box in a series, or <br>
that was it?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm curious to know how the folks who think a letterbox does not have to have a logbook would feel if they found a box without a stamp.  I got the impression that for them is was all about collecting the stamps and logging into the books was just too time-consuming and bothersome.  So when somebody plants a box without a stamp, they are in essence saying they are only interested in collecting the stamps of the finders and to carve a stamp for their box is too much of a hassle.   That kind of puts the shoe on the other foot...<br>
<br>
It is certainly strange and uncanny timing given the recent discussions...  and I just shake my head and wonder what is next...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've seen this recommendation listed in some of the magazine and newspaper feature articles about letterboxing.  However, traditional letterboxes usually have a hand carved stamp inside.  Now I have found some letterboxes with custom made stamps produced at a print shop, but that's usually indicated on the posted clue and it's usually an indicator that this is a special stamp that was made specifically for the location.  That's OK in my book.  I've even found store bought stamps inside a letterbox.  Hmmm...well store bought stamps are considered by some as not the 'artistic' goal behind letterboxing, but some boxers just like the hike.  Recently, I went hiking and found a series of three small rubber stamps that were not mounted on wood, just foam backed children theme stamps.  But it was just what the location and the series dictated so I didn't have a problem with it.  I got out of the house and hiked around an area I may not have otherwise visited.  <br>
<br>
I think some readers who are new to letterboxing may misread the information about thumb print stamps.  Thumb prints (add some details to create something unique or funny) are sometimes requested when you discover someone planted a 'cootie' on you.  I've seen a cootie box shoot around a room at a gathering and people stamp their fingerprint, doodle, and pass it on to many, many, unsuspecting others.  No time to ink a stamp in multi-colors; just thumb print and keep it moving....quickly.  <br>
<br>
But to find a planted letterbox with no stamp inside....???   The stamp is not the number one reason to seek a box...but in my book,  the second reason is way way way down on the list....if you know what I mean.  <br>
<br>
Everyone has opinions on this subject because there are not rules when it comes to letterboxing.  That's what everyone says, but there ARE rules.  The number one rule is about replacing a box - put all the items back correctly, seal the box, and hide it properly.  The second rule is...this is a secret hobby so mentor someone into this hobby but don't necessarily blab the location of a letterbox or the website information to the world.  Hmm....maybe rule two should move up to be the number one rule.  That might help ease some of the problems we all encounter, but certainly not solve all the problems.  <br>
<br>
Just my thoughts for tonight. I think I would melt if I were outside on the trails this week.  So, instead, I'm working indoors on new boxes.  And yes, the stamps will all be hand carved.  <br>

Is the "letterbox" in an area that is off-limits?  Maybe the authorities<br>
are collecting fingerprints?<br>
<br>
**just joking, folks**<br>
<br>
If I found a thumbprint box, I would draw a thumbprint in each logbook,<br>
but I wouldn't use my own.<br>

It was placed by a geocacher who thought they'd give letterboxing a<br>
try.  I politely wrote them that a letterbox needed a stamp and then<br>
stayed there a while and carved a stamp for the box for them.  It was<br>
such a nice day and a nice spot I didn't mind just relaxing and<br>
spending time carving there.<br>

I'd be upset either way if there were no stamp or no logbook. I see <br>
this treasure hunt like I'm collecting passport stamps. that's like <br>
going to a country and having no proof I was there. and if the box <br>
didn't have a book that would be just as irritating to me, after all I <br>
put time (well a little time) into carving my signature stamp and then <br>
would have nowhere to put it to show it off. LOL I'm actually yelling <br>
at the computer over this. <br>
<br>
I found a box with a storebought stamp and although it wasn't my first <br>
storebought find I was quite upset cause it was boring. it didn't go <br>
with the box and was just a very cheap stamp. I actually scratched off <br>
the other 2 boxes from that planter from my list of boxes for that <br>
weekend. I was surprised at how strongley I felt about the hand <br>
carving atristic side of this at this point. (I also surprised how <br>
upset I get over the amount of storebought stamps being logged in as <br>
personal stamps, boring! Some are mice and go with the team/person but <br>
others I just don't get.)<br>

Is the "letterbox" in an area that is off-limits?  Maybe the authorities<br>
are collecting fingerprints?<br>
<br>
**just joking, folks**<br>
<br>
If I found a thumbprint box, I would draw a thumbprint in each logbook,<br>
but I wouldn't use my own.<br>

I have a couple of boxes with store stamps in them -- the very first boxes I planted and one planted while on vacation -- found an awesome spot that screamed for a letterbox and didn't have materials for carving.  In each of these instances the location and the hike are worthy in themselves and I've never felt the need to sweeten the pot by replacing the original stamps with handcarved versions.<br>
<br>
I never considered that by finding one of these store-bought stamps, some people might cross me off their list for future boxes.  Oh well, their loss.<br>

way too, after all I loved the park, walk, and time with the two <br>
older kids. I have been very happy with others boxes with store <br>
bought stamps and in general I wouldn't have been upset but I sure it <br>
didnt' help that my husband was not happy with me cause I left him <br>
with the 3 year old for this box. So when I got back he was mad at me <br>
and that's when I decided to scratch this persons boxes off my list, <br>
mostly due to time. I droped two boxes by that planter but droped <br>
probably 10 others too, some were from a few of you on this board. It <br>
was a time thing. I just wasn't as upset over the idea of not being <br>
able to see these boxes, not that I didn't like this persons box. But <br>
those others I'm still itchin' to get back up there to find. This <br>
Michigan wildfire is making me even more anxoious to get up there <br>
soon, only 9 more days. (and this time we are going without any <br>
children!) <br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know that a lot of people will post about how happy they are that a box<br>
was placed in such-&-such a location because they just loved the<br>
hike/scenery/fill in the blank and never would have gotten to that place if<br>
the box clues hadn't taken them there.  And that's absolutely great!  That's<br>
a large part of what letterboxing is for them.  Emphasis on the words "for<br>
them".<br>
<br>
I think in the time I've been letterboxing, I can honestly say I've only<br>
found two boxes (three really, but two in the same area by the same placer)<br>
that I was glad that we'd gone after the box and had the chance to see that<br>
particular area, because it turned out to be an area that in my 55 years in<br>
this neck of the woods, I'd never seen.  I think I'm outdoors far far more<br>
than the average person and probably see more "nifty" places than the<br>
average person or family.  So only in those two instances has it been "about<br>
the hike" for me.  And I probably would have gotten to those spots at some<br>
point also even if there hadn't been letterboxes planted there.<br>
<br>
I'm an artist -- on the side -- it's not like my art is good enough to pay<br>
the mortgage or anything.  And letterboxing is all about the art for me.<br>
Letterboxing to me is like one giant humongous outdoor art fair spread out<br>
all over the county/state/country.  So "unique" stamp images ARE very<br>
important to me.  It's the number one reason I letterbox.  They can be<br>
hand-carved or they can be commissioned, doesn't matter to me, but I find<br>
boxes to find unique stamp images.  And that's why, when I find a box in bad<br>
shape, I try so hard to remember to carry replacement items like baggies,<br>
lock'n'locks, camotape, etc. in case the box needs first aid because I want<br>
the next searcher to really enjoy that little part of this country-wide art<br>
fair that I've just enjoyed.  I don't care if they enjoy the scenery.  :-)<br>
I want to assure they can enjoy the art in the box, if that's their<br>
pleasure, the way I just did.<br>
<br>
So when folks hide boxes in great locations, it's probably a place I'd been<br>
going to on and off or at some point anyway I'll go there, with or without<br>
the box, but if I know the stamp is store-bought, I just honestly feel no<br>
incentive to bothering to find the box.  That's just me.  It's not my "loss"<br>
because I feel absolutely no loss because there is no loss at that point<br>
since I'm not letterboxing for a great hike or a great view.<br>
<br>
And I think putting it somewhere in the clues that a stamp is hand-carved or<br>
store-bought or commissioned is really just a polite acknowledgement that<br>
people box for different reasons.<br>
<br>
That's why my sig stamp is always hand-carved.  Just in case the placer of<br>
the box I'm searching for cares about that sort of thing.  If they were nice<br>
enough to do the artwork to either hand-carve or commission a unique stamp<br>
for the box, I figure I should give that much back in return if I find the<br>
box, since I have no way of knowing if that's important to them or not.<br>
<br>
I guess I just wanted to say that not everybody letterboxes for the hike.<br>
There are some letterboxes around here in northeastern Illinois that are in<br>
places I already know I really don't want to visit again.  Been there, done<br>
that, was bored the first time, don't really want to go back another time.<br>
Or that are placed in a location that, frankly, is downright ugly.  But no<br>
matter how poorly a person's carving skill is (and my own sure ain't much<br>
but I definitely give it my best shot each time, and yes, it's only my<br>
opinion, but I definitely think I've improved quite a bit), the person took<br>
a stab at doing some of their own artwork and I'm going to try to find the<br>
time to go search for that stamp image.  I then come home and build an<br>
entire scrapbook page, and sometimes 2 or 3 or 4 pages, around that stamp<br>
image.  Someone had asked me at one time to post some photos of my scrapbook<br>
pages, but I realized I really can't, because to look any good it would have<br>
to show the stamp image since the page is built around the stamp image, and<br>
that, to me, is a no-no without the carver's permission, so I never did do<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Second on my list -- quite a ways down from first, but still second -- are<br>
the clues.  I love imaginative clues.  They don't necessarily have to be<br>
totally "challenging", my brain's not all that good anyway. :-) But I love<br>
imaginative clues.  I love storytelling clues.<br>
<br>
So I search because of the stamp first, the clues second, and "the hike" is<br>
waaaay down on my list to the point that, for all practical purposes, one<br>
could say it doesn't really exist anymore.  But if the hike is first on<br>
someone else's list, that's great!  I think there's room enough for all<br>
reasons for boxing.  Excepting, of course, the thrill that some folks get<br>
out of vandalism or theft.  :-)  Can't see either vandalism or theft as a<br>
legitimate reason for boxing.  And vandalism and theft seem to be a growing<br>
problem in this neck of the woods lately.  To me, damaging a letterbox is as<br>
bad as walking into the Art Institute and intentionally damaging a Renoir.<br>
<br>
When I go out on the trail with other boxers, then I'll give a backseat to<br>
MY reasons for boxing.  They may want to search for a store-bought stamp or<br>
they may think that a hike I think is mediocre is really cool.  And I go out<br>
with them for THEIR reasons.  I think it's great that a sport exists where<br>
the idea of "winning" against another individual or some other team doesn't<br>
generally exist.  That a bunch of people can be out there doing the same<br>
thing, each for a different reason.  Even my cave man has his own reason for<br>
letterboxing.  I go for the stamp, he goes to protect me.  As much as<br>
possible.  Because he knows that I don't scare easily, and sometimes that's<br>
not a good thing on the trail.  Sometimes fear is a good thing.  He hates to<br>
drive, he leaves that to me.  He hates to navigate, he leaves that to me.<br>
He can't read a map worth a darn.  Hiking is "OK" to him but he'd much<br>
rather we be out playing softball if we're going to get exercise, or if<br>
we're going to "sweat in the sun", he'd much rather we be gardening.  But he<br>
swiped some of my Mastercarve and dutifully carved his own stamp and heads<br>
out on the trail with me for the sole purpose of "having my back."  :-)  So<br>
he doesn't box for the hike or the stamp or the view OR the creative clues.<br>
He hikes so that the person who cooks the meals and washes the clothes and<br>
who doesn't yell at him if some of his dirty clothes get left on the floor,<br>
will be there tomorrow.  :-)  And he DOES enjoy it.  He enjoys knowing that<br>
I left in one piece and came home in one piece and it might not be today, or<br>
it might not be tomorrow, but SOMEday I might be returning in one piece<br>
thanks to the cave man.<br>
<br>
So, obviously, HE doesn't care in the least if the search is for a<br>
hand-carved stamp or one of Hobby Lobby's cheapest.  :-)<br>
<br>
And should any placer really CARE whether or not I'm going to come searching<br>
for their box? Of course not!<br>

Very good point J.  I have a couple of boxes with store stamps in them --<br>
the very first boxes I planted and one planted while on vacation -- found an<br>
awesome spot that screamed for a letterbox and didn't have materials for<br>
carving.  In each of these instances the location and the hike are worthy in<br>
themselves and I've never felt the need to sweeten the pot by replacing the<br>
original stamps with handcarved versions.<br>
<br>
I never considered that by finding one of these store-bought stamps, some<br>
people might cross me off their list for future boxes.  Oh well, their loss.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My comment of "their loss" was in reference to those who dismiss a particular planter because they find a box with a store-bought stamp.  I was pointing out that I, and many other wonderful carvers that I know, have on occasion placed a box or two with a store-bought in a pinch, so in ruling out a planter based on finding one of their boxes with a store-bought stamp you may be missing out on many other wonderful pieces of hand-carved stamp art.<br>
<br>
It is interesting that one of the boxes I had planted with a store-bought stamp in Delaware was probably the box I received the most positive mail about because of the location.  Countless person made comment in the logbook or to me personally that this was such a neat place that they would never have even known was there.  Likewise on an early series of boxes I planted -- my Words in the Woods series.  Awesome set of trails, hand-made logbooks, crafty clues, but store-bought stamps (for a purpose, on a theme)...  received many wonderful and positive comments.  It wasn't all that spectacular in any one sense, but the overall letterboxing experience made it enjoyable and memorable for many people, even some people who are pretty intent on finding hand-carved stamps.  I don't like finding the little 1/2" x 1/2" store-bought ladybug stamps any more than the next person, but I do feel that if you just judge a book by its cover, you may miss out.<br>
<br>
As you said, people letterbox for different reasons.  For me it is not the stamp, or the location, or the hike, or the clues, rather it is the overall experience, encompassing all of these things.  But even though I have this overall expectation for a worthwhile letterbox, I don't necessarily expect that every box I seek will meet that expectation -- some do, some don't, that is part of the wonder of setting out for a letterbox -- what will I find?<br>
<br>
If I only ever ate foods I know I like based on previous experience or never ate any green foods based on a negative experience with spinach, it would certainly be my loss. <br>
