<br/>
Glad to hear you were successful with your stamp and looking forward <br/>
to seeing your box posted soon!<br/>
<br/>
You present some good points in your post.  It is true that there <br/>
are many similarities between letterboxing and geocaching, so much <br/>
that many people were actually taken in by last week's April Fool's <br/>
prank -- after all, marrying of the two hobbies is a conceivable <br/>
notion.  I know that in this area of the country especially, where <br/>
letterboxing is not as prolific as it is on the East coast or the <br/>
Pacific NW, many people participate in both LB and GC.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise the pros and cons of web forum vs e-list can be debated and <br/>
there will always be those who prefer one over the other.  I think <br/>
they both have advantages and disadvantages.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, while I certainly think it is advantageous for both <br/>
the LB and GC to take a united stance on land-usage issues and other <br/>
areas of concern that ultimately effect both hobbies, it is my <br/>
opinion that the two are distinct, and neither hobby is at the point <br/>
where it is ready to embrace the other and form one homogeneous <br/>
activity, particularly if you are a purist to either hobby.<br/>

<br/>
The geoboxing prank raises a good point.  On a corporate level, if<br/>
Groundspeak were to buy out LBNA and try to control letterboxing the<br/>
way they try to control geocaching, most people would find it<br/>
abominable.  The Groundspeak site can get very political.  You may<br/>
have noticed how unfriendly their forums can be at times.  Yet many<br/>
geocachers have taken a step back from that and recognized that<br/>
geocaching.com is basically just a newspaper for advertizing geocaches<br/>
(and even absense-of-geocache "virtuals").  They have their rules to<br/>
define what constitutes a geocache, and even rules that define<br/>
"letterbox hybrids", a kind of cache that strips all the letterboxness<br/>
except the stamp out of letterboxing.  Yet those rules exist mostly to<br/>
cover them from legal trouble.<br/>
<br/>
So my hope is that letterboxers don't associate the picture of<br/>
geocaching painted by Groundspeak with the sport itself.  There are<br/>
lots of geocaches that don't fit the mold set in place by the<br/>
corporates.  My dad and I placed Stegabox One, which can be found with<br/>
or without a GPS, and with or without a stamp.  Not to spoil anything,<br/>
but another stegabox is in the planning.<br/>
<br/>
To emphasize the sameness of the two sports again, I understand that<br/>
back in Dartmoor, it was several years before stamping was part of<br/>
Letterboxing.  I see the same thing happening with geocaching.  First<br/>
people traded just curious items.  Then you started to see more<br/>
signature cards, and now, a lot more stamping.  And while there are<br/>
differences between the two sports.. chiefly that geocaching requires<br/>
the GPS receiver, the differences are trivial, and anyway, I think<br/>
strength is in diversity.<br/>
<br/>
In reading this list, there have been several posts about the Parks &amp;<br/>
Rec policy situation that I thought contained really good ideas.  Yet<br/>
I wish that those ideas were in the Migo forums too, because then they<br/>
would more easily reach Sandrich, who already has a dialog going with<br/>
Parks &amp; Rec about the treasurehunt policy.<br/>
