                    <div class="plaintext-content">I used the bonus box idea for my Harry Potter series.  I told people in the clues to the first box to bring something to write with (but assumed people would have a pen/pencil to make log book entries and their log book to write in) and I laminated the sheet that had the clues to the next box.  Although the "story on the laminated page was long, the actual clues were contained in a single line of text that I thought was obvious.  Well, after replacing the laminated sheet twice (It even said in big letters at the bottom "do not remove this clue sheet from box 1!" I decided to just post the clues to the second box.<br>
<br>
I hope your bonus clues last longer than mine! :-)<br>
<br>
On a side note: almost all my boxes have been pulled.  I just didn't have the time to check on them on a regular basis, even when there were reports of wet log books and damaged containers.  Most had easy clues and were not more than 2 steps off the trail.  Most lasted several years in the woods, but there seemed to be more disappearing on their own lately.  Even one that became just an empty container rehidden in the hiding spot.  Now I'll be using the stamps for other forms of art (ATC's, cards, etc.)  I had great fun when I was able to get out and do regular letterboxing (as opposed to postal letterboxing) and saw many places and wonderful sights than I EVER would have if I hadn't been out hunting for little plastic boxes and stamps.  I agree that sharing the hobby is important as long as the general "rules" and safety practices are shared along with the fun.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">  We're really sorry to hear you're "pulling out".  The Harry Potter <br>
Series and the boxes in Medora (the one in the "bench" is a great <br>
memory) are some of the best stamps in our first logbook. Of course, <br>
most of the other "best stamps" in it are yours as well and did much <br>
to fuel our fever.<br>
  Thank you.<br>
