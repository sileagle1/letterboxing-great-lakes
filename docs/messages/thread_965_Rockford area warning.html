Just a quick heads-up.<br>
There was an article in the paper the other day that sharpshooters <br>
will be out hunting deer in many of the Rockford parks. Most of my <br>
boxes are located in the parks that this will be happening in. Though <br>
they aren't far off the beaten path, you may not want to venture out <br>
to find them without bright clothing on! Plus, there is quite a bit <br>
of snow on the ground...staying home for the time being to carve <br>
sounds like the safest plan...but I'm a wimp when it comes to the <br>
cold. :)<br>

Thanks for the heads up!  Although you don't look like a deer and<br>
don't sound like a deer, sharpshooters are more likely to actually hit<br>
you if they accidentally shoot at you.  I take it the deer populations<br>
in the Rockford area are sky high?  Although I don't personally like<br>
the idea of killing, it is probably better than starving to death or<br>
getting hit by a car.  Good luck hunting with hunters out there!<br>
