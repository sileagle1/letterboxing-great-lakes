                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah yes, a good mystery.<br>
And what makes the mystery a good one?<br>
Mystery letterboxes are indeed a special breed and need special <br>
attention  by both the placer and the seeker. As Acorn suggests, the <br>
personality of the placer can come even stronger to the surface with <br>
a good mystery box. How are the clues presented -- puzzles? very <br>
cryptic text clues? graphic images only? vaguely described locations? <br>
total minimalism? they all certainly contribute to the complexity <br>
and the allure of a good mystery box.<br>
I've planted easy mysteries and difficult ones. Some have sat for <br>
awhile before they even had a nibble. Some were solved in a flash. As <br>
the placer I'm always interested in what tipped off the finder. Where <br>
in the clues did he/she "get it"? Sometimes I think I'm being very <br>
clever with a mystery box clue and then I discover that the seekers <br>
never gave it much thought, or they figured it out right away. Or <br>
maybe they moved on in the clues to something else they could get <br>
their teeth into. I like to give hints that *may* reveal something. <br>
Or may not.<br>
Oftentimes the only mystery may be the location of the park. I recall <br>
an email I got from a seeker who demanded that I tell her where to <br>
start her hunt for a mystery placement of mine. She was mighty <br>
unhappy when I didn't comply. (I sent her a link to Silent Doug's <br>
glossary: Mystery Letterboxes). She was not assuaged, and she let me <br>
know it.<br>
<br>
On the very practical side, I'm frustrated when I'm aware that <br>
another boxer has (perhaps inadvertently) given away a glimpse into <br>
my mystery's location by either their online boxing reports or by <br>
their own box placements. Landmarks or identifiable attributes of a <br>
place given by another boxer as part of their clues to another box <br>
may reveal a key element of *my* mystery. I guess the only way to <br>
avoid that is to carefully research boxes in your area and make sure <br>
you don't shed light on another's stealth. Experienced placers know <br>
how much thought, time and energy goes into creating a successful <br>
letterbox. I've discovered that it may take even more to create a <br>
good mystery box.<br>
I do offer hints to seekers who are stuck if I sense they have put <br>
some thought and energy into the search. Not all placers will offer <br>
help<br>
<br>
I quote from a section of Mapsurfer's site:<br>
--------------------------------<br>
"Please do not e-mail me asking for hints and help<br>
[Snip]<br>
 (Despite this gentle request, I still get plenty of these request-<br>
for-help e-mails, so please don't be offended when I don't respond -- <br>
it's nothing personal, just the way the game is played)."<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
So you see, the mysteries range from here to there and the spinners <br>
of those mysteries can hold the answers pretty close to their vests.<br>
The really good ones require the legerity of a good puzzler and the <br>
tenacity of a determined tortoise.<br>
And *that* could be a clue. Or not.<br>
<br>
I recently corresponded with a letterboxer whose clues I admire. She <br>
admitted the joy in discovering a mystery box after *seven hours* of <br>
search through prickers, gorse, and knee-high rushes. The good ones <br>
are worth it, but you have to want it.<br>
And sometimes a regular letterbox holds those same challenges. Just <br>
because you can't find it doesn't mean it isn't there.<br>
