<br>
We are planning on attending the Letterboxing Wedding gathering on <br>
Nov. 10th.<br>
<br>
We are nearing the milestone F-250 (currently F-213)! Not bad for a <br>
young family of 6 where the most boxes we ever found in a day is 11 <br>
(9 of which were on one trail in Oregon!).<br>
<br>
We are also to celebrate our one year anniversary (of letterboxing of <br>
course!) on Nov. 25th. <br>
<br>
I would LOVE to hit that F-250 by Nov. 25th. Counting all the new <br>
boxes in the area for the Wild Goose Chase gathering just held we <br>
will still fall short.<br>
<br>
So, are there any easy drive-by boxes and/or series of boxes that we <br>
could hit in the Lake/Cook County area of Illinois?<br>
<br>
I was born and raised in Lake County <br>
(Waukeegan>Grayslake>Libertyville) would be nice to find several up <br>
there . .. we will be attending the gathering on the 10th and going <br>
to Brookfield Zoo on the 11th.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your suggestions.<br>

Yes, I have placed several boxes and a few series of boxes in the Lake Bluff area.  Others in Lake Forest, Rondout, Mundelein, Deerfield, and most are easy to find.  Some are drive bys...for when you just 'need' to find a box on a rain day and you don't want to get drenched.  Even drive bys have a purpose.  Flying J has some boxes in the Mundelein and Libertyville area too.  And of course, if you are anywhere near the Brookfield Zoo area, you have to find as many of Fungus Woman's boxes as possible.  There are lots of boxes in Lake County.  Come on over and look around!<br>
