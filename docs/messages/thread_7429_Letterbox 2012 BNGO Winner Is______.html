Congratulations! (and she won with ONLY general terms!)<br>

However, don't throw your cards out just yet because we are still looking for the 2nd and 3rd place winners....and we all know that booty is pretty darn good.<br>

I: cootie catcher, Douggerware, e-count, clitter, questing<br>
N: flea, leg, planter's pouch, plumber's pouch, cairn<br>
G: spoiler, strike-out, reserved box, drain drip, pathtag<br>
O: thumbprint signature, treasure hiker, true north, PMO, blue diamond<br>

I hope you have all been keeping track of the sidewagers guesses.  If <br>
not, I'll give you another few days to figure it out before I <br>
congratulate the winner. ;-)<br>

I have only three words left, but seeing that one of them is Coffee Beans, which I think 95%* of the remaining players are also waiting for, I'm pretty sure my chances of taking 2nd or 3rd are slim.<br>
