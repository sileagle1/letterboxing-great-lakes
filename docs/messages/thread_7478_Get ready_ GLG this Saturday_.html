                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear all,<br>
<br>
I am sending this out to the list as well as posting on AQ.  Sorry for the<br>
repeat (and for those unable to join us)!<br>
<br>
We are so excited to have you join us this Saturday for the 2012 Great<br>
Lakes Gathering: Drawn to Letterboxing at Blue Mound State Park outside of<br>
Madison!  Clue packets will be available at the shelter starting at 9 am.<br>
There are bigger parking lots near both the west and east towers of the<br>
park, and the main shelter is located near the east tower, right when you<br>
come up the hill. Every car will need a Wisconsin State Park annual or<br>
daily pass, available from the Ranger Station when you enter. (Annual is<br>
$25 WI or $35 non-resident plates. Daily is $7 WI or $10 non-resident).<br>
<br>
Lunch is potluck style, and thank you in advance to all of you who have<br>
already signed up for something on the AQ Event Listing. We will be<br>
providing brats and hotdogs and ask for your help in filling out the menu.<br>
Please also set your watches, as we would like to take a group picture of<br>
everyone at NOON at the shelter.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, the day is yours. There will be food, exchanges, and likely a<br>
few table tops at the shelter and more than 80 boxes to keep you busy in<br>
the park!  (Make sure you have enough space in your logbooks for all these<br>
incredible images.)<br>
<br>
Only a few mosquitoes have been spotted so far, but you will want to keep<br>
your eyes out for poison ivy in some areas.  Trails can stay muddy for days<br>
after rain too.  If you really want to get wet, though, be sure to bring<br>
your suit, because the pool will be open! ($1-2 fee, children and adults).<br>
If plans are made for dinner after, details will be left at the shelter.<br>
<br>
Also, if you are in town early, the Minnesota Camping Contingent is kindly<br>
planning a Friday evening get-together, details at<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2530 .<br>
<br>
See you on Saturday!<br>
