I have more photos from SILO #4 and I plan to  post them on LbGLK and AQ.  Fungus Woman is coaching me through that process.  But tonight, I've got to get some rest.  Morning comes early and tomorrow is a work day for me.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
SILO #4 was a great event!  Thank you to all the talented letterboxers who contributed event stamps, especially Lock (Lock Shock & Barrel) for the magnificent, detailed SILO #4 event stamps, and to everyone who came and added to the 'comic relief.' <br>
