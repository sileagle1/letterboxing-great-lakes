I've come up with the next best thing.  I've got a postal that's been<br/>
wandering the country entitled "Happy Birthday to Me", in honor of my<br/>
(dum-dum-dum.) 50th birthday this coming October (those of you on the PLB<br/>
list have already heard about it).  Anyway, I have the box in my possession<br/>
right now, and will be sending it to Detroit for you guys to all stamp in.<br/>
