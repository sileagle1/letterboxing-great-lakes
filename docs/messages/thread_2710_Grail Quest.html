Flagellating Monks,  took an epic turn as fire rained from the sky.  Fortunately, Golden Boy <br>
and I survived fire and flood, and will live to continue the quest.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My faithful, intrepid squire and I continued the quest on Independence Day.  Perhaps the <br>
forces of evil were on holiday, but we encountered few obstacles at the waypoints of our <br>
quest.  Our greatest trial was the cost of fodder for our steed.<br>
<br>
The shades surrounding Bring Out Your Dead lay at peace; although there were some giant <br>
beech trees in the vicinity that looked like knight-eaters, we passed unscathed. <br>
<br>
A foul miasma warned us of the vicinity of The Three Headed Knight before we reached <br>
him, but did us no lasting harm.<br>
<br>
Sojourner ghosts were resting, despite the damp cries of "Bring Out Your Dead."  Water <br>
had insinuated itself into the wrappings, but the book and image remained dry as dust.<br>
<br>
While battles with fire from the sky and giant caterpillars enhance a knight's fame, I must <br>
say that sometimes a glorious day with few struggles is a great blessing to this humble <br>
and grateful knight,<br>
