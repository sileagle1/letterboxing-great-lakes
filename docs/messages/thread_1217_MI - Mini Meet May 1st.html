Sunday May 1, as in 5 days from now?<br>
<br>
Darn, I really would have liked to come -- kind of a nice season-<br>
opener, a get-together before the get-together, but I will be in <br>
Philadelphia for a bridal shower this weekend.<br>
<br>
Actually had I not been out of town, I probably would have already made <br>
plans to scoot over to Milwaukee and meet up with the Silent Doug <br>
gathering...<br>
<br>
I hope you have a great time and I'm really looking forward to seeing <br>
everyone at the GL Gathering in June.  I am also tossing around the <br>
some ideas for a fall gathering in MI this year -- more details to <br>
follow.<br>

I'm also thinking of planning a fall gathering, but in Wisconsin.  <br>
Possible dates might be SEP 24 or OCT 1, but nothing definite yet.  It <br>
might be good to coordinate dates in case some people might actually be <br>
able to make both a MI and WI event.  Keep us posted on your plans...<br>
<br>
For anyone in WI or vicinity, do you have a preference for either SEP <br>
24 or OCT 1?  Would you prefer a location that has camping available or <br>
doesn't it matter?<br>

That's a good idea.  I was looking at later in the month -- most <br>
probable date to be Oct. 22.  Other possibilities Oct. 15 or 29.<br>
<br>
Let me put in my vote for Oct. 1st for the WI gathering because we <br>
are headed up to the Porcupine Mountains in MI U.P. for the first <br>
week of Oct. and could be easily convinced to take the ferry over and <br>
then head up through WI instead of MI if there was a gathering en <br>
route.<br>
<br>
While we are talking about gatherings...  I was also toying with the <br>
idea of an informal summer LB get-together (I guess that would be a <br>
mini-meet?) at Muskegon State Park on July 23.  We will be camping <br>
there that weekend so we would have a home base and there are tons of <br>
boxes in the North Muskegon, Whitehall/Montague area.  This would be <br>
VERY INFORMAL -- meet in a.m. for greetings and exchanges, then off <br>
to box however you wish and meet back in the evening at our campsite <br>
for a bonfire.  Any interest?<br>

  I'm also thinking of planning a fall gathering, but in Wisconsin.  <br>
  Possible dates might be SEP 24 or OCT 1, but nothing definite yet.  It <br>
  might be good to coordinate dates in case some people might actually be <br>
  able to make both a MI and WI event.  Keep us posted on your plans...<br>
<br>
  For anyone in WI or vicinity, do you have a preference for either SEP <br>
  24 or OCT 1?  Would you prefer a location that has camping available or <br>
  doesn't it matter?<br>
