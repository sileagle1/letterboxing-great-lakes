                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for your kind welcome.  I grew up in Snyder...lived there for 27<br/>
yrs!  I have not looked for the boxes you mentioned yet, but I have<br/>
downloaded the clues and they are on my list.  So far, I've done 2 in North<br/>
Tonawanda, as my kids take music lessons there and it was convenient.  For<br/>
my first box, I tried to pick one that seemed like you just really couldn't<br/>
miss it.  I didn't want to build this all up to the kids and then not find<br/>
the box.  As it turned out, there was a hitchhiker in there too, so it was<br/>
really a thrill (although at that point, I didn't know what a hitchhiker<br/>
was....).<br/>
<br/>
On your advice, I will try to get to the Burchfield (not Butterfield) one<br/>
SOON.  There's only about 10 boxes in our area, so I'm trying to set a pace<br/>
of about one per week.<br/>

Oh!  Kaycee!  Did you find the "Buffalo Wings", "In Search of Charles<br/>
Butterfield" (that might be the wrong title), and "Monsters of New York" in<br/>
Como Park yet?  My cousins live in Amherst/Snyder, and those were the three<br/>
I found while visiting there.  That Charles one is a great stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers and Welcome!<br/>
