<br/>
Cheese Blossom<br/>
<br/>
1 (8 oz) package sliced provolone cheese<br/>
2 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, at room temperatire<br/>
20(or more)pistachios, shelled and chopped<br/>
1 cloves garlic<br/>
1 jar green pesto<br/>
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br/>
3 oz oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes<br/>
<br/>
Line a medium bowl with plastic wrap, leaving enough overhang to cover <br/>
the top. Reserving 3 slices of provolone line the bottom and sides of <br/>
the bowl with remianing provolone, overlapping the slices. For the <br/>
cream cheese layer, process the cream cheese, pistachios and 1 of the <br/>
garlic cloves in a food processor until blended; scrape the mixture <br/>
into a bowl and set aside. <br/>
<br/>
For the tomato layer, drain the tomatoes, reserving the oil. puree the <br/>
tomaoes with a small amount of reserved oil in the food precessor. <br/>
<br/>
Spread a layer of cream cheese mixture over the cheese slices lining <br/>
the bowl. Layer the pesto, half of remianing cream cheese, all the sun-<br/>
dried tomatoes, then top with the rest of the cream cheese. Cover with <br/>
remaining provolone cheese slices. Bring edges of plastic wrap together <br/>
over the top and secure with twist tie. You can freeze this up to 3 <br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
When ready to serve, open plastic wrap, invert bowl over platter, then <br/>
remove plastice wrap. Serve with crackers (my favorite being Carr's <br/>
wheat!) <br/>

at freezing it for up to 3 months...If I make this for the 4th of <br/>
July (which I'm planning to do) it won't last 3 minutes with my crowd!<br/>
