<br/>
Based on an earlier recommendation from Gooble Gobble, the location <br/>
of this year's Great Lakes Gathering will be at Afton State Park.  <br/>
It's right on the beautiful St. Croix River and is about 30 minutes <br/>
away from St. Paul.  Their website is:  <br/>
http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/afton/index.html  <br/>
<br/>
We are penciled in for the Vistor's Center (they won't consider <br/>
it "reserved" until they cash my check, but we have first dibs).<br/>
<br/>
Just a note, if you do plan to camp, you'll have to buy firewood in <br/>
Minnesota.  There's a notice on the website that will give you more <br/>
details.<br/>
<br/>
As far as theme goes, I'm open to suggestions.  You can email me <br/>
suggestions off list and I'll open it to a vote.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if any Minnesota 'boxers want to help, please let me know!  <br/>
I'll take any help I can get!  <br/>

<br/>
<i>Located just forty minutes east of the Twin Cities, the park offers excellent opportunities for hiking, crosscountry skiing, swimming, picnicking, and hike-in camping in a quiet, natural setting. To preserve the natural character of the park, development has been kept to a minimum. The campground, swimming beach and interior of the park are accessible only by trail.  <br/>
<br/>
The steep terrain offers challenging hiking and skiing plus the promise of a rewarding natural experience. Afton State Park lies on the bluffs overlooking the St. Croix River. The park is cut by deep ravines which drop three hundred feet to the river. Outcrops of sandstone jut from the side of the ravines. The rugged terrain affords spectacular views of the St. Croix Valley.</i><br/>

"C'mon, Afton". When I opened this email and saw I was<br/>
right I loudly said "YES" and pumped my fist in the<br/>
air, almost waking up my sleeping 2 year old : )<br/>
<br/>
Afton is an AWESOME state park with miles and miles of<br/>
trails and hills so huge and punishing even Wisconsin<br/>
Hiker and Martini Man will be begging for mercy : )<br/>
(I'm not kidding, some of the trails are downright<br/>
brutal. I guess I know where I'll be planting, he he<br/>
he he). <br/>
<br/>
I was and am sooo excited that the gathering is here<br/>
this year. I missed out last year due to finances and<br/>
this year I couldn't have traveled because we're<br/>
expecting baby #2 in July. I am really looking forward<br/>
to seeing everyone I met in Delafield again and<br/>
meeting all the other boxers I haven't yet.<br/>

I need to go and call The Red Cat right away, help is<br/>

one huge hill isn't enough, try going up and down, up<br/>
and down, a few times. I'm going to start training<br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
For those less masochistic, don't worry, the terrain<br/>
is quite varied and I'm sure the boxes will be planted<br/>
all over the place. There are 20+ miles of trail after<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
The views of the river valley are beautiful, and it<br/>
makes all those climbs worth it. Even getting to the<br/>
trail head is very scenic. You walk down past<br/>
playgrounds and picnic tables at a meandering slow<br/>
decline. There is a great scenic outlook and then<br/>
down, down, down you go to the main trails and the<br/>
beach area. You'll find picnic tables right on the<br/>
river and trails going everywhere. There's a really<br/>
cool old bridge made of R.R. ties that oozes tar when<br/>
it's hot out and fills the air with a wonderful pine<br/>
scent on your way. All in all it's the perfect place<br/>
to have a gathering. It has everything you could want<br/>
in a park and then some.<br/>
<br/>
I want to start carving right now, but we don't have a<br/>
theme yet. So..... ideas anyone? <br/>

As far as a theme goes, someone has suggested "Loony Letterboxes"<br/>
since the state bird is a Loon and well, we're all just a little bit<br/>
crazy.<br/>
<br/>
I have one that I got kind of excited over at work (I was a little<br/>
bored today).  The theme I came up with was "Westward ho!" Minnesota<br/>
is the western-most state in the Great Lakes area, so most people<br/>
would have to head west to come to the gathering.  The park is located<br/>
on the St. Croix River, just a few miles north of where it meets the<br/>
Mississippi and both rivers were instrumental in the development of<br/>
the state.  Minnesota also turns 150 this year (May 8th I think). <br/>
Laura Ingalls Wilder lived just across the border in Wisconsin and<br/>
later in the western half of the state. The last stand of the James<br/>
Gang was in Minnesota. You can still see paddleboats on the rivers. <br/>
The letterboxes could be prairie/frontier/Old West themed. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any other ideas? <br/>

I, while particularly not fond of the old west/cowboy<br/>

stamp ideas. Oh hey, wait a minute, a ghost town stamp<br/>
would be cool, or maybe a big six shooter aimed at<br/>
you, etc. I rescind the previous statement about not<br/>
liking the idea. I think it should be in the running<br/>
for people to vote on unless the response to your idea<br/>
is unanimous. <br/>

At the moment I have no ideas for themes. I do<br/>
however, have some great ideas for some new and fun<br/>
games.<br/>

Well, I've gotten your name wrong for over a year now... thanks for the  <br/>
correction.<br/>
<br/>
Theme ideas? Since we are all brain storming here... how about a play on  <br/>
10,000 lakes and have it be the gathering of 10,000 letterboxes?? <br/>
<br/>
We ALL better get carving to meet that goal!!!<br/>

Ingalls Wilder and how she was from that general area and how it <br/>
would be cool to do a "Little House" theme of some sort. Your idea <br/>
sounds perfect! Lots of possibilities!<br/>

&gt; I have one that I got kind of excited over at work (I was a little<br/>
&gt; bored today).  The theme I came up with was "Westward ho!" Minnesota<br/>
&gt; is the western-most state in the Great Lakes area, so most people<br/>
&gt; would have to head west to come to the gathering.  The park is <br/>
located<br/>
&gt; on the St. Croix River, just a few miles north of where it meets the<br/>
&gt; Mississippi and both rivers were instrumental in the development of<br/>
&gt; the state.  Minnesota also turns 150 this year (May 8th I think). <br/>
&gt; Laura Ingalls Wilder lived just across the border in Wisconsin and<br/>
&gt; later in the western half of the state. The last stand of the James<br/>
&gt; Gang was in Minnesota. You can still see paddleboats on the rivers. <br/>
&gt; The letterboxes could be prairie/frontier/Old West themed. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone have any other ideas? <br/>

Gooble Gobble?? <br/>
<br/>
Well, I've gotten your name wrong for over a year now... thanks for the   <br/>
correction.<br/>
<br/>
Theme ideas? Since we are all brain storming here... how about a play on  <br/>
10,000 lakes and have it be the gathering of 10,000 letterboxes?? <br/>
<br/>
We ALL better get carving to meet that goal!!!<br/>

  Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
  Based on an earlier recommendation from Gooble Gobble, the location<br/>
  of this year's Great Lakes Gathering will be at Afton State Park.<br/>
  It's right on the beautiful St. Croix River and is about 30 minutes<br/>
  away from St. Paul. Their website is:<br/>
  http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/afton/index.html<br/>
<br/>
  We are penciled in for the Vistor's Center (they won't consider<br/>
  it "reserved" until they cash my check, but we have first dibs).<br/>
<br/>
  Just a note, if you do plan to camp, you'll have to buy firewood in<br/>
  Minnesota. There's a notice on the website that will give you more<br/>
  details.<br/>
<br/>
  As far as theme goes, I'm open to suggestions. You can email me<br/>
  suggestions off list and I'll open it to a vote.<br/>
<br/>
  Also, if any Minnesota 'boxers want to help, please let me know!<br/>
  I'll take any help I can get!<br/>
