you that I am not known for grace or twinkle toes.  It was with great trepidation that I <br>
followed my faithful squire's lead over no fewer than three shifting and unstable bridges of <br>
death on our quest to place Witch & Duck.<br>
<br>
It was on the third rolling ford that Golden Boy came to grief while chivalrously extending <br>
a hand.  While I crossed unscathed, dry socks and a picnic lunch went a long way to <br>
console him. <br>
<br>
Don't worry, faithful knights, you need not attempt these bridges to fulfill this portion of <br>
your quest, and the limestone outcroppings in the area are well worth seeing.<br>
