                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today was a great day.  I called my friend Jake and told him that I<br/>
would meet him for a hike.  I headed out and came to the perfect spot.<br/>
 In front of me was a meadow teaming with life.  A brook ran through<br/>
it feeding the plants and wattering the animals.  <br/>
<br/>
I paused for a moment and watched the animals of the prairie play<br/>
their games with each other.  As I headed out looking for Jake my<br/>
heart was beating so hard it felt like two hammers pounding against<br/>
each other.  I crossed over a bridge and after passing through the<br/>
Southern passage I went anonther 55 steps or so before I noticed a<br/>
path leading off the main trail to my left.  This path headed straight<br/>
back until I spotted something reminding me of one of my favorite<br/>
books/movies, the Princess Bride.  It was the six fingered man.  The 5<br/>
fingers went skyward and the thumb out to the side.  Nestled in the<br/>
palm I found Jake waiting for me.<br/>
<br/>
Jake and I headed back down the main path for a while.  As it had been<br/>
a swift journey we thought we should pause for a moment, step of the<br/>
path, and take a moment for reflection and some time to center<br/>
ourselves.  It was about 20 degress out, yes that is in Celsius, and<br/>
we enjoyed the sun and the breeze.  While looking around we spotted an<br/>
intesting clump of trees.  On our return to the main path we stopped<br/>
and looked more closely.  Amongst the four trunks were a pair of flip<br/>
flops.<br/>
<br/>
Back on the main path we relished every moment, enjoying the wild<br/>
flowers on the way.  Eventually we found a resident of the area from<br/>
Beloit, WI.  At this point we sensed a call from the South.  The<br/>
Prairie was calling to us.  We followed its call but for some reason<br/>
continued South instead of going East as it beckoned.  We heard a<br/>
strang noise from under the bridge in front of us.  We checked under<br/>
the South  West corner and found a very playful dog.<br/>
<br/>
The dog accompanied us on our journey.  We recrossed the bridge and<br/>
headed out past the dancing fire flies in their circle and the large<br/>
pine cone.  We found ourselves on the main path once again and headed<br/>
off down the hill.  All of a sudden we spotted a rabbit.  He darted<br/>
across our path and ran straight into the woods.  We looked closer and<br/>
found a small path that followed the river.  We took this path until<br/>
we came to an unconventional bridge leading across the water over to<br/>
an island.  We carefully crossed the bridge.  Sending something<br/>
special we looked down, and hidden amongst the gnarled roots of a tree<br/>
was a four leaf clover.<br/>
<br/>
We scurried back along the river bank to the main path and crossed the<br/>
bridge.  After another short hike we found a bench upon which we could<br/>
rest our weary legs.  As we sat on the bench, directly behind us we<br/>
heard the sounds of someone crying.  We turned around and there she<br/>
was, weeping over the loss of her flower.  We made our way across the<br/>
creek to her feet and were able to find the flower nestled in the<br/>
creases of her dress where it had fallen.<br/>
<br/>
Making our way back to the main path we followed it until we saw<br/>
aomething that startled us.  We were forced to avert our eyes and<br/>
decided to take an alternate route rather than walk past and pretend<br/>
we were not looking.  The path we took twisted and turned until it cam<br/>
to a junction.  Here out in the midst of things we paused and looked<br/>
around.  Night was coming so it was a cooler 60 degrees now and more<br/>
enjoyable without the humidity of earlier in the day.  We picked our<br/>
path and headed along it.  The path took us out into the opening from<br/>
which we could see our starting point.  Instead of returning home,<br/>
however, we followed the fence to the East.  At the end of the fence<br/>
we decided to head South.  We were treated to a wonderful view.  Then<br/>
at the bottom of the hill we were given a final choice, and, as<br/>
always, we chose the path less travelled.  We followed the path and<br/>
mangaed to bump our heads and trip twice before we realized we were<br/>
approaching private property.  We stopped at the boundary marker, a<br/>
wooden pole.  And thought back on our day.  LIFE IS GOOD.<br/>
