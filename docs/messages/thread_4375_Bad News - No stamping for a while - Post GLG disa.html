<br>
You might not have seen my post 3 months ago or so---but that is exactly <br>
what happened to me.  Someone HAD to have thought they were stealing my <br>
purse---but they got all of my letterboxing stuff instead---including my <br>
logbook.  It also had my signature stamp in there too.  It actually made <br>
me a bit sick every time I thought about it for a while.  I am glad I <br>
record my finds online now, because for the longest time I kept a <br>
running total IN my logbook but at times had gotten lazy about logging <br>
my finds.  Now I have an accurate back up both ways. <br>
<br>
Please let me know if any of my stamps are ones you are now <br>
missing---and the next time I go back to check---I will make you another <br>
copy of the stamp!!<br>

I looked around the apartment complex but not really any further, <br>
didn't find it.<br>
<br>
I prolly did lose a few of your stamps, my logbook was in there and <br>
had everything from GLG including some extras like the Naughty stamp <br>
and some postals.<br>
