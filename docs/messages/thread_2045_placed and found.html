We also got into the holiday spirit by finding the Waltzing Pigs' "Christmas<br/>
Around the World" series.  Very nice!  Another case of "I've lived in this<br/>
area all my life and never explored those woods."  #3 was out in the open,<br/>
but is back where it belongs.  Oh, and the vines covering that tree are<br/>
poison ivy, but the box is not near any.  Thanks for placing them!  We<br/>
wanted to find Cemetery Stroll #3, but BIT was developing a blister in his<br/>
new boots.  Next time!<br/>

Thanks for tucking #3 back into its hiding place!  The woods where <br/>
that series is located is very popular with dog walkers.  When we <br/>
were placing the boxes, we had to wait several times for dogs &amp; <br/>
owners to move on down the path.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the vines go, I guess I need to get more acquainted (from <br/>
a distance of course) with poison ivy. You would think--after <br/>
getting the rash numerous times as a kid--that I would know what it <br/>
looked like.  Or then again, maybe that's why I got it numerous <br/>
times as a kid :)   I didn't know the vines could get so thick!!  <br/>
Either Ball Magnet is immune or very lucky, because he loves to go <br/>
swinging around on big vines like that.  <br/>
