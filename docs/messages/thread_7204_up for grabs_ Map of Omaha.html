    <br>
  Hey all!<br>
  Skootching Dog and I did a fantastic trip to Omaha this last spring. <br>
  Did you know there are over 100 active letterboxes in the Omaha area?<br>
<br>
  Anyway, after trial and tribulation, I finally got a street map of<br>
  Omaha. They're not popular in Mpls area bookstores. When I'd ordered<br>
  one off Amazon, I got a creepy clown book instead, too! So, I offer<br>
  this rare and difficult to find map to the first taker that wants it. <br>
  It's lived through only one letterboxing weekend, and we're not likely<br>
  to head back to Omaha any time soon, so, good condition and will go to<br>
  waste, otherwise.<br>
<br>
  Send me an email if you'd like it. We find local maps invaluable<br>
  resources to plot out letterboxing weekends and adventures!<br>
<br>
  Cheers!<br>
  E.N.<br>

  The map has been claimed. I'll get it in the mail next week.<br>
<br>
  The creepy clown book is now a part of the letterbox "Map of Omaha", and<br>
  clues are posted on AQ. Had to teach myself how to make a book safe to<br>
  do it, too.<br>
<br>
  And Flying J just has a thing for creepy clown books. And Nancy Drew.<br>
  :)<br>
