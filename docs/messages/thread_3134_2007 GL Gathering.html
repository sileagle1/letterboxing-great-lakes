                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everybody!<br/>
Sorry it has taken me so long to send out a thanks for choosing Ohio <br/>
for the next gathering. School started back about a month ago and <br/>
things are just now starting to settle down.<br/>
Anyway...my name is M&amp;8X (Stacey) and I'll be the host, along with my <br/>
husband EagleEyes (Jim). We started letterboxing in the Spring of <br/>
2003. The first gathering we attended was the Winter Barbeque in <br/>
Louisville, KY last year. That made us want to try our own. So was <br/>
hosted a gathering this year in central Ohio. It was very informal, <br/>
with about 25 people attending. The thought of hosting the GL <br/>
gathering is quite intimidating. Since we haven't attended a GL <br/>
gathering, we are unsure of how things have been done in the past. <br/>
Any help/advise would be greatly appreciated. One thing I know I will <br/>
need help with is coming up with a theme. Any ideas?  <br/>
At this point the only information I can give is the intended <br/>
location.<br/>
We are planning on holding the gathering at Alum Creek State Park. <br/>
Here is the web site for more information about the park. <br/>
http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/parks/alum.htm <br/>
It is located about 20 miles north of downtown Columbus.<br/>
If you have any questions, or want to offer help/suggestions <br/>
(hint,hint) just let me know!<br/>
<br/>
See ya' soon. <br/>

There is a short FAQ in the FILES section (GATHERINGS folder) of the <br/>
list that gives some very general information about the annual GL <br/>
Gathering as well as a document that offers guidelines, hints, helps <br/>
for hosting a gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Stacey, feel free to ask any of the former gathering hosts if you have <br/>
questions, but keep in mind -- you don't have to do it *exactly* like <br/>
it has been done in the past.  Variety is nice too ;-)<br/>

to MapQuest, it's also only about 2 hours from where<br/>
we are in Ohio to the proposed gathering site.  Just<br/>
let us know what you might need help with!<br/>
<br/>
Here's an idea for a theme - since the intended<br/>
location is Alum Creek State Park, what if we did a<br/>
play on "alum" and had the theme alumni-centered? <br/>
Even people who didn't go to college are still alums<br/>
of high schools and even elementary and middle schools<br/>
(or will be in the near future).  Especially since<br/>
Columbus = OSU in some circles, it might be fun for<br/>
people from out of state to show up in their state<br/>
college gear - even if it IS from Michigan State ;)<br/>
<br/>
Any other theme ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Would have loved to make it to your gathering earlier<br/>
this year, but alas, the schedule didn't allow for it!<br/>
