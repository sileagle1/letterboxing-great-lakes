                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I emailed the Winnebago County FP people about letterboxes and <br>
their policy. I sent this nice, long email asking how those of us who <br>
have boxes removed by the county could get them back, among other <br>
things. All I got for a response was, "Attached is our Geocache and <br>
Letterbox policy." which I could very well have read online. That <br>
still didn't answer my question about what happens to the boxes (and <br>
even caches) once they are removed, so I responded, kindly, asking <br>
them the same question.<br>
<br>
The information in the policy can be found by going to the website <br>
and downloading the PDF file, but I will summarize it here as well to <br>
save the hassle.<br>
<br>
$10 gets you a permit to place 2 letterboxes for 1 year. After the <br>
year is up, you either pay another $10 or you remove the boxes.<br>
<br>
You must check on your boxes every 30 days and communicate to the <br>
preserve workers that you have done so by email, snail mail or other <br>
means.<br>
<br>
Only 3 boxes can be placed in a preserve at one time.<br>
<br>
Size can be no greater than 4"x8"x12".<br>
<br>
Anything not registered with them will be removed. (But we still <br>
don't know what happens to them after being removed.)<br>
<br>
Where can I get the job of letterbox removal? Whose job is it to sit <br>
in front of a computer and figure out clues? What fun that would be!<br>
<br>
Anywho, it looks like I won't be placing letterboxes on forest <br>
preserve property anytime soon. If anyone out there happens to be out <br>
and finds any of my boxes, please remove them yourself and let me <br>
know. I will pay shipping or arrange to have them returned to me some <br>
other way. If anyone else in the area wants me to do the same for <br>
them, I would be more than happy to. :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Angi, got home just now from our evening walk at Blackhawk Springs and read <br>
your message below.  We checked on "Tuber" and it was alive and well as of <br>
5:30 p.m.<br>
<br>
Now I don't know what to do about my two boxes on FP property.  I can hardly <br>
believe that the FP district is allocating funds for someone to hunt down <br>
and remove letterboxes.  If so, I highly resent that misuse of my tax <br>
dollars!<br>
