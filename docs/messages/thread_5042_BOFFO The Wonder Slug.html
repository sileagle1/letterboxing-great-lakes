                    <div class="plaintext-content">I saw this on the personal blog of a local letterboxer (42 Pines).  A <br>
year or so ago, I encourged these boxers to join this regional group, <br>
but I don't think they have.  Therefore I'm cross-posting the info <br>
here in case anyone knows the boxer/stamp in question:<br>
<br>
====================<br>
<br>
To my fellow Wisconsin and nation-wide letterboxers:<br>
<br>
We have a problem our unsurpassed community of knowledge really needs <br>
to pull it together tight in order to solve this dilemma. While <br>
replanting "To Judge a Book by its Cover", we found something while <br>
trying to define where the original hiding spot was for our <br>
letterbox. What was this find? It was someone's personal stamp! The <br>
stamp was immediately recognised, as it was one of the last <br>
letterboxers to have stamped our book. Out of respect for the trail <br>
and its culture I will not upload a photograph of the stamp itself <br>
but I will enlighten the community of what it looks like.<br>
<br>
Its got an insect-type creature on it and the text reads "BOFFO", and <br>
in smaller text "THE WONDER SLUG". If anyone can help find the owner <br>
of this stamp so we can arrange a way to get it back to them it would <br>
be great. Please leave a comment here to get ahold of us, or find us <br>
(42 Pines) at LbNA or AtlasQuest. I'm putting a post here hoping that <br>
someone finds it, and so that there is some mention of this before I <br>
get a chance to sitdown and really try to seek this letterboxer out.<br>
<br>
This stamp must have fallen out of their pocket/bag while they were <br>
stamping our box, and it survived a rough-and-tough Wisconsin winter. <br>
It deserves to get back home.<br>
