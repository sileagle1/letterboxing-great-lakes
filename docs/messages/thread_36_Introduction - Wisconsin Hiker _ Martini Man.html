                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing names:  Wisconsin Hiker & Martini Man<br>
Real names: Debbie & Jon<br>
<br>
We both have been active in a local hiking club for over 6 years and <br>
like to take hiking vacations.  We also enjoy puzzles and for years <br>
have had a "page-a-day" calendar with a puzzle that we look<br>
at over dinner.  Therefore when a friend from our hiking club sent an <br>
email about letterboxing in May of 2003, I was immediately <br>
intrigued.  It combined several things we liked and my research of <br>
the main website revealed that there were several boxes nearby <br>
(primarily thanks to "The Dragon").  I did more reading and<br>
research <br>
using the Internet and was anxious to get started.  I designed our <br>
signature stamps and had them custom made (didn't want to rely on<br>
my untried carving skills).<br>
<br>
The first box we looked for (and found) was in the Madison, WI area <br>
in July.  We went out in shorts and sandals for our first few <br>
searches, but eventually realized this was not a good plan - lots of <br>
scratches and shoes falling off!  We've been out on the hunt<br>
every <br>
month since then, having lots of fun along the way, and also <br>
introducing some nieces & nephews to the activity.  Our niece <br>
actually chose to write a paper about letterboxing for one of her 5th <br>
grade assignments (she got an "A"). In addition to Wisconsin,<br>
we've <br>
found boxes in Illinois, Wyoming, and Hawaii.<br>
<br>
Of course I started talking about LBing to our friends, relatives, <br>
hiking club members, and casual acquaintances.  Most thought we were <br>
nuts, but a few were also captivated by the concept and have joined <br>
in the fun.  In an attempt to create more interest in the Milwaukee <br>
area, I gave a brief presentation at a local outdoor store in March <br>
2004.  Working together with "The Dragon", we used this<br>
occasion as <br>
the basis for the first Wisconsin gathering and were pleased to meet <br>
the other local letterboxers that matched the stamps we had been <br>
seeing.<br>
<br>
The first boxes we placed were in Brookfield, WI (a suburb of <br>
Milwaukee) and included custom-made stamps.  However I finally <br>
started carving this month and was fairly pleased with how the stamps <br>
turned out, so we now have 2 boxes with hand-carved stamps.<br>
<br>
For only having a small group in Wisconsin, I'm very happy to<br>
report that there are many types of clues and locations.  I <br>
think "The Dragon" has been very creative in trying a huge<br>
variety of things with his boxes and that has been a great example <br>
for those of us who started more recently.<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to meeting more of you in the Great Lakes<br>
area, hopefully at the spring gathering if the date works out!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Nice to meet you both and glad you joined the group!  Kudos to you <br>
for trying the carving -- watch out though, it can be addictive!  My <br>
first couple of stamps were purchased, because I was sure I could <br>
never do that carving...  and then I needed a stamp for the Grand <br>
Haven lighthouse and couldn't find one, so I needed to begin <br>
carving.  I am so glad I did because the possibilities are limitless!<br>
<br>
Sounds like your presentation was a hit, what a great idea!  Hope <br>
the date works out and we will be able to meet at the spring <br>
gathering!<br>
