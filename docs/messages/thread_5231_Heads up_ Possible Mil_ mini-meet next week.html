is permissable, we'll meet in the outside dining area.<br/>

Once it is confirmed I will put the gathering info up on AQ so you can<br/>

I just want to let area boxers know what is in the works.<br/>

Oh - I wish we could come! I am on limited bed rest until Jr. arrives<br/>
this Fall. I have soooo missed letterboxing and getting out. I already<br/>
warned dh as soon as I was recovered, we were hitting the trails this<br/>
fall (I have spent no time in the woods this spring/summer due to moving<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks!  I have between 6-9 weeks left.  We found out about 3 weeks ago <br/>
that I have mild preeclampsia - and are trying to keep it mild or better <br/>
- hence no long (and very few short) walks for me.  While I am bored and <br/>
missing being out, it is worth it for Jr. to get here safely and on <br/>
time, rather than early.  Our feline herd actually grew 2 weeks ago - <br/>
added another one to the furry crew, lol!<br/>
