boxing the weekend of the 16th.  Since MM and WiH will be out of town,<br>
they asked others to work with FRH to set up a possible mini-gather. <br>
I am suggesting to FRH to meet at the California Pizza Kitchen at<br>
Bayshore Mall<br>
(http://www.bayshoretowncenter.com/tenant.cfm?tenantid=91&tenantspace=C34&tenantx=-1090&tenanty=-730&tenantmap=1)<br>
at 8:30 pm on either Wed. or Thurs. evening next week.  If the weather<br>
is permissable, we'll meet in the outside dining area.<br>
<br>
Once it is confirmed I will put the gathering info up on AQ so you can<br>
sign up to let us know you are coming.<br>
<br>
I just want to let area boxers know what is in the works.<br>

Oh - I wish we could come! I am on limited bed rest until Jr. arrives<br>
this Fall. I have soooo missed letterboxing and getting out. I already<br>
warned dh as soon as I was recovered, we were hitting the trails this<br>
fall (I have spent no time in the woods this spring/summer due to moving<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks!  I have between 6-9 weeks left.  We found out about 3 weeks ago <br>
that I have mild preeclampsia - and are trying to keep it mild or better <br>
- hence no long (and very few short) walks for me.  While I am bored and <br>
missing being out, it is worth it for Jr. to get here safely and on <br>
time, rather than early.  Our feline herd actually grew 2 weeks ago - <br>
added another one to the furry crew, lol!<br>
