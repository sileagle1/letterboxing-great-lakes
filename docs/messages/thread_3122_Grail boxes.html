<br>
Second, everything WI Hiker said about the HH is correct.  I have<br>
gotten the information and have updated the HH page.  I have also<br>
highlighted the info about the series and the HH on the main page.<br>
<br>
Third, I know some have put a link to their grail box on LBNA already<br>
(even though I asked you not to yet).  That's okay.  It's probably<br>
time we started letting the world know of our secret in the GL.  So,<br>
if those of you that created a grail box would finally like to post<br>
the box on LBNA, please go ahead and do so now.  I would suggest<br>
however, that you copy and paste the following into the spot for the<br>
clue to direct your would-be finders to the site (you can use<br>
something similiar for AQ, but I think you need to copy and paste the<br>
actual links rather than use the HTML code embedded below.):<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, concerns or comments about the clues,<br>
location or condition of this letterbox, I would love to hear from you!<br>
<br>
Use the "Contact the Placer" link above to contact me or you can<br>
contact The Dragon by using one of the links on the Grail webpage.<br>
<br>
Check the box's status above for current information.<br>
<br>
*** Before searching for any of the Grail boxes, be sure to read all<br>
about the series and its special HH.  You need to follow some very<br>
specific rules for this series, so be sure you do!! This information<br>
can be found using the links below. ***<br>
<br>
If you have "high speed" internet, click the link below to go to the<br>
"high speed" version of the Search for the Holy Grail clue page.  You<br>
will be able to access the clues to all of the Grail boxes from there,<br>
including this one.<br>

<a href<br>

target="_blank">Click here for clues to this box!<br>
<br>
If you have "dial-up" internet, click the link below to go to the<br>
"dial-up" version of the Search for the Holy Grail clue page. You will<br>
be able to access the clues to all of the Grail boxes from there,<br>
including this one.<br>

<br>
Fouth - if you still have a box to place - GET IT PLACED!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
Fifth - if you have clues for me, send them ASAP.<br>

  Dragon, did you send a box to Team Armadillo? If so, it might be <br>
  permanently lost as they have dropped off the face of the letterboxing <br>
  world. I've got a thread going on over at the PLB group asking for info <br>
  on any boxes in their posession, since I live 1 mi away from them I'm <br>
  going to attempt a rescue of any boxes still in their hands. Any idea <br>
