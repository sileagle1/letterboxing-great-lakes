                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know it's difficult to pick one place that will be convenient for everyone.  It's difficult to find a restaurant that can accommodate a group without a firm reservation or possibly not much advance notice.  Today, I attempted to contact the Sandpiper in Baileys Harbor and no reply.  They may have changed owners and they are not currently open.  And I know that letterboxers may not want to drive around, especially if they have been driving for several hours to get to Door County already.  But I'm receiving enough response and interest in a pre-gathering fish boil dinner that I will just have to make a decision. <br>
<br>
So, I will call Wagon Trail and let the owners know that we will be coming for dinner on Friday, October 2.  When I inquired initially, they said they would include non-alcoholic beverages in the fish boil/buffet price, and they could issue separate checks.  They do have a liquor license too.  I'll get the price for adults and children.  <br>
<br>
But I guess the most important thing is.....are there any letterboxes!!!  So, in addition to finding the 2 permanent letterboxes in Rowleys Bay, there will be a Fish Boil Event Box.  And I'm crazy enough to place some temporary boxes inside, outside, and around the restaurant....just to make the trip worth your while.  Let's call it sweetening the deal.  <br>
<br>
So, here's the deal:  a traditional Door County Fish Boil and all the fixings, plus the Wagon Trail restaurant buffet, or order from the menu, plus an event stamp, special stamps for that night only, and two permanent boxes nearby too....and most importantly, the friendship.  (Pooie, it's really just about the boxes!)  LOL!<br>
<br>
I have already started a list with the names with 9 people who have contacted me and said they would like to meet and eat on Friday night.  If you are interested, contact me.  No deposit, no reservation needed, but we'd like a general idea about the number of people who will be coming.  <br>

Letterboxers have a soft heart.  We know how it feels to read about all the planning for a gathering, and then the worst part is reading all the funny follow-up stories and viewing the photos.  If you absolutely won't be able to attend the gathering weekend in Door County, we can make a deal.  If you carve a stamp, create a letterbox, and send it to me, we will include it with the other stamps and we will mail you copies of as many of the event stamps as we can gather....as a way of thanking you for your contribution.  You might not be there in the flesh, but you can be their in spirit. Email me outside of the group and I will give you mailing information.  <br>
