<br/>
We were going to go looking for various boxes in the Shabbona area Monday<br/>
morning, weather permitting, when we stopped for a turkey at the Ho-Ka<br/>
Turkey farm in Waterman that's down that way.  'Bridge of Death' was going<br/>
to be one of the ones we went looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Cave Man is looking to do something with a turkey on the grill, but I've got<br/>
a feeling it'll end up in my Nesco cooker. I'm just not so sure I want to<br/>
trust him with something the size of a turkey.<br/>
<br/>
If nobody checks 'Bridge of Death' today or tomorrow, we'll check it on<br/>
Monday -- unless it's pouring rain -- in which case, we'll check it Tuesday.<br/>
