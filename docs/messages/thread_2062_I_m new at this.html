  I'm a new member and am trying this to see how it works. I'm new at letterboxing and am having a ball finding these. Our son and his family are doing it also. They've already made their own stamp and planted their first box! They're from NC, but they planted this LB in Kentucky. <br/>

  I'm so pleased to have found this fun new hobby. <br/>
