                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, before I get to the real reason for this post, I<br>
have to go off-topic for just a bit, so if you want,<br>
skip the following paragraph:<br>
<br>
Woo Hoo, I'm engaged!  Since it had been mentioned<br>
previously that I was not-so-patiently waiting for<br>
Deedle to ask me to marry him, I thought it only<br>
proper to post that he finally did!  It was actually 2<br>
weekends ago, on May 14th.  He has a fire ring in his<br>
backyard, and he asked me out there because that's<br>
where we had our first kiss way back when in 2003. <br>
*dreamy sigh*  Unfortunately, our letterboxing is<br>
suffering, since now there's planning planning<br>
planning to do right away, esp. since as soon as we<br>
told my parents about it, my mom started asking all<br>
sorts of questions such as, "What's the date?  What<br>
are the colors going to be?  Do you have any halls in<br>
mind?  Do you want to use bells or bubbles after the<br>
ceremony?  What church are you getting married at? <br>
What time are you going to have the ceremony?  Have<br>
you started calling the halls yet?  Do you have your<br>
bridal party picked out yet?  Are you planning on<br>
having a flower girl, because your cousin's twin girls<br>
will be 3 & 1/2 next June...." Help!  Going to the<br>
gathering will be a relief...<br>
<br>
Which brings me to the real reason for this post.  If<br>
we have committed to creating a box for the Great<br>
Lakes Gathering, I assume that we can send it to one<br>
of the wonderful organizers beforehand for planting<br>
and clue writing prior to the event, and if my<br>
assumption is right, who should we send it to and<br>
what's the deadline for getting it to them?<br>
<br>
Going back to find a reception hall that hasn't been<br>
snatched up for June 2006 yet....<br>

My event box is ready to go and I found a box that's just the right size at work today so I'm hoping to get it out in the mail today.  I believe all boxes are being sent to Team Rabbit as per the gathering website.<br>
