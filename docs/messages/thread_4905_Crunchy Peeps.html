                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh yeh, hit me in that soft spot...  a paper fixation indeed!  I don't really even scrapbook all that much, and when I do it is mostly digitally.  I just love the paper.  Now and then I use a piece for a letterbox logbook, a journal cover or endpapers or in another art project, but mostly I just like to collect the stuff.  It is a ridiculous obsession that is rampantly out of control -- papers and unique yarns and fibers.  But I guess one could have stranger or more costly obsessions.<br>
<br>
It would take a pretty awesome stash of handmade papers to influence my Bingo integrity though.<br>

- who always buys extra peeps on the day-after-Easter sale to save for the next year as Old Shoe also like his peeps slightly aged and crunchy.<br>
