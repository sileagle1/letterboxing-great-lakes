                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I was thinking about the fact that I won't get anything except incidental letterboxing in between now and the big move, so I'm glad the containers found their way to a fine, albeit temporary for now home ... let me know when they're hid and I'll go find them!<br>

  Thanks to all who stopped on the way to or from the gathering (Jacks did pick it up so watch for her sale next!) - it was nice seeing you all (and putting faces to trail names for some of you!) since I couldn't attend the event.  Those of you who met two of my GS's in the process - I think there now may be a bigger spark of interest there ... they finally want to "get serious", so think of this as a big thanks!  Our next meeting we'll be doing some stamp carving!<br>

Sneak preview the  all-new Yahoo.com. It's not radically different. Just radically better. <br>
