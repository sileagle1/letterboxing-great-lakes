                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am pleased to announce the arrival of a new letterboxing patch. The LBK9 patch. Photo is in the patches photo album. These patches are 2x1.5 inches, so they should fit nicely on most dog backpacks if your pup has one of their own. Patches are $2 each, just email me off list with "patches" somewhere in the subject line if you want one. I was really hoping they would be here in time for the gathering, but they turned out great and were worth the wait.<br/>
