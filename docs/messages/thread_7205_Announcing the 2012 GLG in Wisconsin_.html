Thank you for all the excited thoughts and comments, already.  The Verona<br>
Bird Patrol and I are proud to announce the 2012 Great Lakes Gathering :<br>
Drawn to Letterboxing!<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2290<br>
<br>
Although reservations cannot be made until January, we are planning to host<br>
the event at Blue Mounds State Park, a half an hour outside of Madison, WI,<br>
on Saturday, June 9th, 2012.  Camping is available at the park, and there<br>
are many hotels and even other campgrounds in the surrounding area.<br>
<br>
Our theme for the gathering is Cartoons!  While the 'Bird Patrol already has<br>
the lock down on the Smurfs, there are near endless possibilities, and we<br>
hope it will be a lot of fun for all.<br>
<br>
More details will emerge as we get closer, but for now, mark your calendars<br>
and start planning for your Wisconsin Road Trip!<br>

I'd really like to carve the Magic School Bus again, to show the improvement in my carving skills.  Would like to "borrow" my first carving from its permanent location for the weekend of the gathering.  Oh, the wheels (in my head) are spinning!<br>

Got it on my calendar!  May I reserve Beanie & Cecil?  Asterix The Gaul?  I just googled 1962 Cartoon Characters and there are some very strong contenders here - http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/1962.html<br>
<br>
Some great Homage possibilities and cute ideas.  Check your favorite year.  I have to back and look some more.<br>
<br>
And for those who work on my Snickers letterbox, you will be playfully surprised.<br>

Do you mind a couple of recycled stamps from one of the SILO events?  I have "Yogi and the Pik-a-nik basket" and "Inspector Clue-so and the Ink Panther" which were event stamps before but now can be hidden as traditionals for the Gathering.<br>

Both comics and cartoons are perfectly fine. We are carving the Smurfs, but we are also probably putting out a couple of Garfield stamps, and they're comics. I also think that some people are carving anime stamps as well.<br>

Unfortunately it seems the message board is limited to only 10 databases.  Perhaps one or more of the following could be deleted:<br>

I think Familyof6 could delete the first 2, but I think SpringChick (or possibly Azobox) would need to delete the last 2.<br>

  <br>
Here are two examples of databases that have been used for previous events:<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows&tbl=35> &tbl=35<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows&tbl=31> &tbl=31<br>
<br>
Unfortunately it seems the message board is limited to only 10 databases.  Perhaps one or more of the following could be deleted:<br>
<br>
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows&tbl=39> 50 Boxes of Springchick Game 2011<br>
<br>
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows&tbl=40> 50 Boxes of Springchick Word List<br>
<br>
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows&tbl=3> ALTERNATE BOX EXCHANGE<br>
<br>
<http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows&tbl=2> Metra Rail Letterbox Crawl  (this one appears to be an empty table)<br>
<br>
I think Familyof6 could delete the first 2, but I think SpringChick (or possibly Azobox) would need to delete the last 2.<br>

I have already sent a message to VBP privately, but since everyone else is calling "dibs" - I would like to officially claim The Simpsons (just the immediate family for now - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa & Maggie).<br>

Thanks Shorty for setting up the database! I'm also thinking that it might be a good idea to list the boxes on AQ as well, because I'm sure there are some boxers who don't follow LbGLK, so I think that we should list them there too.<br>
