Thank you for all the excited thoughts and comments, already.  The Verona<br/>
Bird Patrol and I are proud to announce the 2012 Great Lakes Gathering :<br/>
Drawn to Letterboxing!<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2290<br/>
<br/>
Although reservations cannot be made until January, we are planning to host<br/>
the event at Blue Mounds State Park, a half an hour outside of Madison, WI,<br/>
on Saturday, June 9th, 2012.  Camping is available at the park, and there<br/>
are many hotels and even other campgrounds in the surrounding area.<br/>
<br/>
Our theme for the gathering is Cartoons!  While the 'Bird Patrol already has<br/>
the lock down on the Smurfs, there are near endless possibilities, and we<br/>
hope it will be a lot of fun for all.<br/>
<br/>
More details will emerge as we get closer, but for now, mark your calendars<br/>
and start planning for your Wisconsin Road Trip!<br/>

Got it on my calendar!  May I reserve Beanie &amp; Cecil?  Asterix The Gaul?  I just googled 1962 Cartoon Characters and there are some very strong contenders here - http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/1962.html<br/>
<br/>
Some great Homage possibilities and cute ideas.  Check your favorite year.  I have to back and look some more.<br/>
<br/>
And for those who work on my Snickers letterbox, you will be playfully surprised.<br/>

&gt; Thank you for all the excited thoughts and comments, already.  The Verona<br/>
&gt; Bird Patrol and I are proud to announce the 2012 Great Lakes Gathering :<br/>
&gt; Drawn to Letterboxing!<br/>
&gt; http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2290<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although reservations cannot be made until January, we are planning to host<br/>
&gt; the event at Blue Mounds State Park, a half an hour outside of Madison, WI,<br/>
&gt; on Saturday, June 9th, 2012.  Camping is available at the park, and there<br/>
&gt; are many hotels and even other campgrounds in the surrounding area.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our theme for the gathering is Cartoons!  While the 'Bird Patrol already has<br/>
&gt; the lock down on the Smurfs, there are near endless possibilities, and we<br/>
&gt; hope it will be a lot of fun for all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More details will emerge as we get closer, but for now, mark your calendars<br/>
&gt; and start planning for your Wisconsin Road Trip!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Both comics and cartoons are perfectly fine. We are carving the Smurfs, but we are also probably putting out a couple of Garfield stamps, and they're comics. I also think that some people are carving anime stamps as well.<br/>

&gt; Here are two examples of databases that have been used for previous events:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows <http: database?method="reportRows&amp;tbl=35" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbglk=""> &amp;tbl=35<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately it seems the message board is limited to only 10 databases.  Perhaps one or more of the following could be deleted:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <http: database?method="reportRows&amp;tbl=39" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbglk=""> 50 Boxes of Springchick Game 2011<br/>

&gt; <http: database?method="reportRows&amp;tbl=2" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbglk=""> Metra Rail Letterbox Crawl  (this one appears to be an empty table)<br/>

&gt; I think Familyof6 could delete the first 2, but I think SpringChick (or possibly Azobox) would need to delete the last 2.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Both comics and cartoons are perfectly fine. We are carving the Smurfs, but we are also probably putting out a couple of Garfield stamps, and they're comics. I also think that some people are carving anime stamps as well.<br/>

Thanks Shorty for setting up the database! I'm also thinking that it might be a good idea to list the boxes on AQ as well, because I'm sure there are some boxers who don't follow LbGLK, so I think that we should list them there too.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Â  <br/>
&gt; Here are two examples of databases that have been used for previous events:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows <http: database?method="reportRows&amp;tbl=35" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbglk=""> &amp;tbl=35<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/database?method=reportRows <http: database?method="reportRows&amp;tbl=31" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbglk=""> &amp;tbl=31<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately it seems the message board is limited to only 10 databases.  Perhaps one or more of the following could be deleted:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <http: database?method="reportRows&amp;tbl=39" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbglk=""> 50 Boxes of Springchick Game 2011<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <http: database?method="reportRows&amp;tbl=40" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbglk=""> 50 Boxes of Springchick Word List<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <http: database?method="reportRows&amp;tbl=3" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbglk=""> ALTERNATE BOX EXCHANGE<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <http: database?method="reportRows&amp;tbl=2" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbglk=""> Metra Rail Letterbox Crawl  (this one appears to be an empty table)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think Familyof6 could delete the first 2, but I think SpringChick (or possibly Azobox) would need to delete the last 2.<br/>

It shouldn't be too hard to make a "Mee-Mee goes to a Letterboxing Gathering" box.  Hmmm, got to think of a story line...<br/>
