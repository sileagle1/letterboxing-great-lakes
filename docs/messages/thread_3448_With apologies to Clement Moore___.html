by Ace Blazer <br/>
<br/>
Twas the night before Christmas<br/>
And all through the house,<br/>
My children were sleeping<br/>
And so was my spouse.<br/>
I sat 'neath the glow<br/>
Of my trusty desk lamp<br/>
Near midnight, finishing<br/>
One last hand-carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
As I whittled away,<br/>
Tiny pink pieces falling,<br/>
I smiled to myself<br/>
On that cold night, recalling<br/>
An old man I'd met<br/>
In the mall's parking lot<br/>
A few nights ago<br/>
Who was in a tight spot.<br/>
<br/>
He'd seemed somewhat dazed<br/>
As he paced back and forth,<br/>
Mumbling to himself<br/>
"Now which way is North?"<br/>
I thought "Ah! A Boxer!<br/>
I know just what to do!"<br/>
And, pointing straight up,<br/>
Said:  "I haven't a clue!"<br/>
<br/>
His kind, bearded face<br/>
Grew a puzzled expression<br/>
And I realized this man<br/>
Didn't share my obsession.<br/>
It seems that I'd gotten <br/>
Our signals quite crossed;<br/>
He was no Letterboxer-<br/>
He simply was lost!<br/>
<br/>
I asked the old gent<br/>
If he needed a ride.<br/>
With a wink and a smile,<br/>
"No, thanks" he replied.<br/>
"I'm a long way from home-<br/>
Thank you for caring-<br/>
I was last-minute shopping<br/>
Now I've lost my bearing."<br/>
<br/>
"I can help you" I said<br/>
And without further thought,<br/>

Good job - a fun twist to a traditional verse!  In that same vein, here is<br/>
the intro to a box I planted for the St. Nick's gathering earlier this<br/>
month:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing Night Before Christmas<br/>
(with apologies to Clement Clarke Moore)<br/>
<br/>
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the park<br/>
Not a creature was stirring, not even a lark.<br/>
The boxes were hid by the shelter with care,<br/>
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.<br/>
<br/>
The boxers were nestled all snug in their coats,<br/>
While clues for new boxes appeared in their notes.<br/>
And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my hat,<br/>
Had just settled our butts for a long boxing chat.<br/>
<br/>
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br/>
I sprang from the bench to see what was the matter.<br/>
Away to the meadow I flew like a flash,<br/>
Tore through the thistles and got a good gash.<br/>
<br/>
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br/>
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br/>
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br/>
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.<br/>
<br/>
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br/>
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.<br/>
More rapid than cooties his coursers they came,<br/>
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!<br/>
<br/>
"Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<br/>
On, Marvey! On, Stampeaze! on, Donner and Blitzen!<br/>
To the top of the rocks! to the top of the wall!<br/>
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"<br/>
<br/>
As boxers that tackle the cryptic clues sigh,<br/>
When they meet with an obstacle, never say die!<br/>
So along the faint path the coursers they flew,<br/>
With the sleigh full of stamps, and St Nicholas too.<br/>
<br/>
And then, in a twinkling, I heard to the east,<br/>
The prancing and pawing of each little beast.<br/>
As I checked the compass, and was turning around,<br/>
Down the footpath St Nicholas came with a bound.<br/>
<br/>
He was dressed in camo, from his head to his feet,<br/>
And his clothes were all filthy with burrs, sticks and Deet.<br/>
A bundle of stamps he had flung on his back,<br/>
And he looked like a hiker, just opening his pack.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br/>
His cheeks were like inkpads, his nose like a cherry!<br/>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br/>
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.<br/>
<br/>
The end of a marker held tight in his teeth,<br/>
And the ink it encircled his palm like a wreath.<br/>
He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br/>
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!<br/>
<br/>
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br/>
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br/>
The good carving stuff and a twist of his blade,<br/>
Soon gave me to know he had come to our aid.<br/>
<br/>
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br/>
And filled all the boxes, then turned with a jerk.<br/>
Then after stamping his sig stamp into the book,<br/>
He went back down the trail, with a careful last look.<br/>
<br/>
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br/>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br/>
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br/>
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  "I can help you" I said<br/>
  And without further thought,<br/>

  A new compass I'd bought.<br/>
  "I want you to have this<br/>
  Your need's greater than mine.<br/>
  I've a new one at home,<br/>
  It will serve me just fine."<br/>
<br/>
  "Thank you" he said;<br/>
  "This is just what I need."<br/>
  I smiled as we parted;<br/>
  I'd done my good deed.<br/>
<br/>
  Back in the present,<br/>
  My carving now done,<br/>
  I rose from my chair;<br/>
  It was now half-past one.<br/>
  I wondered where I'd hide<br/>
  my new Yule-themed box<br/>
  When there came from my door,<br/>
  Three or four gentle knocks.<br/>
<br/>
  I opened the door<br/>
  And there in the cold,<br/>
  Was a brand-new compass<br/>
  With a case of pure gold.<br/>
  Attached was a note<br/>
  Written neatly in red:<br/>
  "Thanks for helping. -S.C."<br/>
  Was all that it said.<br/>
<br/>
  I stood alone, puzzled<br/>
  As I looked around<br/>
  And then from afar<br/>
  Came a jingling sound.<br/>
  I then heard a voice<br/>
  I'll recall til the end:<br/>
  "MERRY CHRISTMAS<br/>
  AND HAPPY BOXING, MY FRIEND!"<br/>
<br/>
  You should always help<br/>
  Others in need, for you see,<br/>
  You just never can tell<br/>

  Good job - a fun twist to a traditional verse! In that same vein, here is<br/>

  And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br/>
  The good carving stuff and a twist of his blade,<br/>
  Soon gave me to know he had come to our aid.<br/>
<br/>
  He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br/>
  And filled all the boxes, then turned with a jerk.<br/>
  Then after stamping his sig stamp into the book,<br/>
  He went back down the trail, with a careful last look.<br/>
<br/>
  He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br/>
  And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br/>
  But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,<br/>
  "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"<br/>
