                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, for those of you near Chicago, I'm sure you've all seen the new<br>
12 box series by Atom 118 and Coffee Beans.  A huge thanks to both of<br>
them for creating such a massive letterboxing series with stamps well<br>
worth the investment of both energy and time to find all 12 -- you did<br>
a great job!<br>
Mini Mom, Frogman, Big Boy and I headed out this morning to tackle the<br>
series and we had quite the adventure!  We thought we were very<br>
clever, deciding to ride our bikes since the hike was a bit further<br>
than Frogman and Big Boy usually enjoy and we thought it'd be a bit<br>
hot (heat index over 100!) for a four-hour letterboxing episode.  We<br>
geared up four bicycles and hit the road.  <br>
When we arrived and started unloading, we noticed that Mini Mom's tire<br>
was flat, despite the fact that she'd just put air in it before we<br>
left.  We inflated it again, only to be met with the hissing noise of<br>
air flying furiously out of the valve.  Bummer!  Undeterred, and<br>
wanting to keep our happy group together, we decided to bike with Mini<br>
Mom walking.  <br>
We quickly realized that there were some long stretches, so we pulled<br>
a move from our teenage days and I rode her on my bike -- she sat and<br>
I stood up pedaling while she balanced the clip board with the clues<br>
on my back and read them while we rode.  Yes, I supplied the power (I<br>
was a retired marathon runner, but am now thinking of making a<br>
comeback!) and she supplied the unprecedented coordination and<br>
multi-tasking skills.  So much for being discreet and unnoticed by<br>
others!!  Everyone who saw us surely thought we were crazy, and I have<br>
to say, we even knew we'd gone over the letterboxing deep end!<br>
One by one, we found the boxes... one had been attacked by an animal<br>
and we did the best repair job we could (good thing Mini Mom is always<br>
prepared with extra ziplocs)... one had us riding in a circle for a<br>
bit... and one caused Big Boy to wipe out on his bicycle, giving him a<br>
nasty scrape on his elbow (luckily it was quickly cured with wet<br>
wipes, sanitizer, and a lollipop), but we triumphed in the end!!<br>

Letterboxes in this heat! LOL But for 12 whole boxes of <br>
gratification??? (Priceless - like the commercial says!)<br>
<br>
Very neat - we will be seeking these! Did you end up with any FF <br>
certificates? <br>
<br>
I cant WAIT for the weather to improve - we have about 7 boxes sitting <br>
here just WAITING to be planted!<br>
