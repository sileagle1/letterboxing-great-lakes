there for a couple of hours (hurray), although, I think my son would <br/>
have rolled in the snow longer, LOL!  I was thrilled to have the time <br/>
to put faces with trail names (albiet red, cold faces!).  We had lots <br/>
of fun!  Thank you everyone for all that you did today!<br/>

<br/>
My thanks also goes to all those that helped make the "informal"<br/>
gathering a little more organized with food, planting your own boxes,<br/>
and creating new gathering stamps, etc.  Hopefully now that others<br/>
have seen how much help one can get to host a gathering it will<br/>
encourage others to hold more gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I think in the midwest all it takes is one person to say<br/>
"I'm planning a gathering on .... with such and such theme." and<br/>
they'll have so many helpers it'll plan itself.  So if you got an<br/>
inkling to hold a gathering, go for it!<br/>
<br/>
We're such a neat bunch! Group hug everybody! (Heck, it'll at least<br/>
warm us up after today...)<br/>

BTW - If you do want to host a gathering, I voluteer to create a<br/>
gathering webpage and host it on my site for anyone.  Just ask!<br/>
