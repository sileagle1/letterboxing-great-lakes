<br>
The polling is complete, and we now have a date set for our <br>
gathering!  The 2004 Great Lakes Gathering will be on June 12, 2004.<br>
<br>
You can go to the "official" website at:<br>
<br>
http://home.wi.rr.com/dragonlber/GLG.htm<br>
<br>
Remember - if you want to make an event box, whether you'll be in <br>
attendence or not, it can be based on any theme you wish.  We would <br>
like to have a number of boxes based on the theme "Cooler by the <br>
Lake", however.<br>
<br>
Please email me to let me know whether you plan to attend and <br>
whether you will help in any area noted on the website.<br>
<br>
I should have a location picked early in Easter week.<br>

Wow, cool site/page.<br>
Congrats for getting this underway.<br>
I'm anxiously awaiting the location announcement and the chance to <br>
meet some of the GLboxers who've visited our boxes.<br>
