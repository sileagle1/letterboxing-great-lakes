(great stamps and awesome box notes -- definitely worth a visit) we had our first-ever <br>
encounter with another boxer in the wild -- which turned out to be his first-ever such <br>
encounter too, because he saw the TIME article this week and made today his first-ever <br>
day of boxing <br>
<br>
Chuck, if you're reading this, welcome to the game! <br>
<br>
Hope everyone is having a (boxious, mosquito-free) weekend. Be nice to the newbies out <br>
there.  :)<br>
