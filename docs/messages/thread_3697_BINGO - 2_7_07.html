I WAS just one away from a straight line BINGO--and the word is <br/>
Muggle.  Thought maybe I had missed a day (and a word) when I saw the <br/>
winner list muggle as one of her words--then realized it was her free <br/>
space.  Unfortunately, now I am nowhere close to any of the other <br/>
Bingos :~(   No corners!  Only 3 in the perimeter and only 3 in the X-<br/>
shape.  <br/>
<br/>
Congrats to the Bingo winners so far--I was wondering if anyone was <br/>
ever going to call Bingo.<br/>
<br/>
BirdWoman/Waltzing Pigs  --who is bummed about Bingo and bummed that <br/>
she can't go to the SILO mini-meet(which doesn't sound so mini).  I <br/>
missed last years because we were out of town and now we have <br/>
something going on that day already.  And I'm bummed that we probably <br/>
won't be able to make the gathering in June (and we really love to <br/>
camp, too--that would be so much fun with everyone together)--but the <br/>
kids are still in school till the following week and I really don't <br/>
think I can convince anyone (besides fellow boxers) that taking them <br/>
out of school to get to a letterboxing gathering is OK.  Bummed about <br/>
the Superbowl--after the first 20 seconds.  Or maybe it is just <br/>
seasonal affective disorder and I'm tired of gloomy days and frigid <br/>
temps!!!!<br/>
