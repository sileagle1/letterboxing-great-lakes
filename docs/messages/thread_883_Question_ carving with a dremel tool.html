has anyone of you used a dremmel rotatory tool to carve a stamp?<br/>
<br/>
I've seen that there are carving points less than 1 mm thick, that is great!<br/>
but I tried one of those with white erasers and the red plumber's stuff and didn't came up well.<br/>
<br/>
the tiny carving tool leave no clear border, instead it leaves a "hairy" line along the edges of what I. I checked the webpage of dremel and they say that a diamond tool should be used to clear the border, but it didn't work either...<br/>
<br/>
has anyone of tou tryied on other material or with other tool?<br/>
<br/>
the thing is, that I see some potential on the toy but just don't know how to exploit it to my advantage at the moment of carving something with a lot of details<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance<br/>

Yeah, I've tried it but not with any success. I, too, thought the <br/>
teeny, tiny bits would be really cool for fine detail but it just <br/>
didn't work out. In fact I have some dental burrs but they didn't <br/>
deliver a good result either.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">well, at least we tried!<br/>
my theory is that the speed (even the slower one) is way too high for the soft material we are carving...<br/>
but there is nothing to do about it!<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>
