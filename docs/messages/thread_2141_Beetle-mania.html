they had to go back to school on Wednesday.  The ground was soggy from <br>
all the rain and melted snow, but the weather was great that day.  We <br>
were enticed up to Lake County as visions of 15 stamps in the "Santa's <br>
Lost Toys" series (placed by Beetle) danced in our heads.  Since we <br>
drove all that way, we wanted to hunt down as many boxes as we could.  <br>
In addition to the Lost Toys, we also searched out alot more boxes <br>
placed by Beetle:  Fatman, the Beatles Series (I loved the lyric clues <br>
even if the kids didn't know what I was trying to sing), Trolley Days <br>
(nice history lesson), Sunrise Beach (where the kids had a great time <br>
climbing around on huge rock piles), and the Great Rondout Train <br>
Robbery (another fun history lesson).  The only non-Beetle box we <br>
found was Lake Bluff, placed by Wayfaring Stranger (which has been <br>
there since 2003!) The boxes were all in good shape except Trolley <br>
Days (a very damp logbook--which Beetle is now aware of).  <br>
<br>
What I found very amazing was that we went looking for 24 different <br>
boxes and found ALL of them--not one missing box!  Even more amazing <br>
is that my kids hung in there for a whole lot of boxing without any <br>
complaints or arguments.  I guess warm clothes, a thermos full of hot <br>
chocolate, lunch at "the Silo" and the thrill of the hunt helped out.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Beetle and Wayfaring Stranger for some great boxes!<br>
