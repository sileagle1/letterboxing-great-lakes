and contents scattered. They picked up the pieces to return to me.  After I<br>
get whatever is left, I'll make a decision as to whether I will replace it.<br>
I hope the stamp is OK.... it was my very first carving!<br>

I like your original, but it's your choice if you're ready for something<br>
different!<br>

P.S.  We don't leave our boxing stuff in the car in summer or winter, mostly<br>
because of the ink & markers.  Starts freezing in winter and we've found<br>
that the markers ooze ink even w/o pressure if they get too warm.  We<br>
usually take the pack in to the office with us if we're planning an "after<br>
work" trip.<br>

So here's my situation: I went after a relatively<br>
simple box after work today and discovered that my sig<br>
stamp had somewhat melted and was STUCK to the cover<br>
of my stamp pad. It was still usable, however...there<br>
are small pieces missing on one side. Apparently<br>
Mastercarve has a low melting point...but<br>
ANYWAY....the dilemma: Obviously I need to carve a new<br>
sig stamp....should it be A: the same as the old<br>
one...don't break with tradition or B: an entirely new<br>
design....<br>
<br>
Thoughts?????<br>
