                    <div class="plaintext-content">Only two weeks until the 2008 GLG! I am so excited I<br>
can hardly contain myself. I was out earlier today<br>
planting the 4 boxes I made for the big day and had an<br>
idea. If you would like me to email the clues to you<br>
for this series of 4 boxes please let me know. I'm<br>
offering this for a very good reason. The "Loop" I<br>
planted on is 6 miles long. I would guess it would<br>
take someone around 3 hours, maybe more, to complete<br>
the series of four, seriously, wait until you see the<br>
trails, or lack thereof, you will have to travel upon.<br>
I wanted people to be able to go on Friday if they<br>
chose to so they wouldn't have to spend a large chunk<br>
of the gathering looking for only four boxes. I made<br>
the hike so long for several reasons. 1. Afton State<br>
Park is so diverse in it's topography. I wanted to<br>
take people on a tour of all of the different forest<br>
types, etc. 2. Longevity of the boxes I made. When you<br>
spend a lot of time making boxes you want them to last<br>
for a long time to come. 3. it was so much fun hiking<br>
for such a long distance. Some of the "trails" are<br>
completely made up, I hope your orienteering skills<br>
are up to par. 4. Chances of muggles or random others<br>
stumbling across these boxes hopefully is non-existent<br>
due to the long hike and remote locations of the<br>
plants. 5. Last but not least, long challenging hikes<br>
with sometimes difficult clues are very rewarding, at<br>
least to me.<br>
<br>
So, if you will be here early on Friday and would like<br>
to go for a nice tour of Afton State Park let me know.<br>
I'll email you the clues. <br>
<br>
I look forward to seeing everyone on the 31st.<br>
