The only year I won in Bingo was the first year I played ... and all I had on my card were the general terms.  Now that I've met many of you great letterboxers, and attended some events, I've not won a thing!!!  Hmmmm!<br/>

Yes, you can win with only general terms. Words are randomly selected each day. The trick is to guess what those winning words will be and to put those words in the right boxes on your personally designed Letterbox BINGO card.  And the excitement builds.....<br/>
