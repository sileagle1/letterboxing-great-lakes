I'm sorry to say, my first box has gone missing.  I have to admit <br>
though it was not the best hiding place, so lesson learned.  I also <br>
didn't realize how much foot traffic that area go until I went back <br>
without the leaves on the trees.  Footpaths through the brush <br>
everyewhere.  It was like grand central! <br>
<br>
I intend to rebuild and replace as well as add #3 (The Curious <br>
Savage) sometime over the holidays.<br>
<br>
Hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving!<br>
