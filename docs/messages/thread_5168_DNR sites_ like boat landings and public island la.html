PLEASE don't bring up letterboxing with the DNR anymore than it is<br/>
already.  The geocachers did us enough of a dis-service.  They<br/>
contacted the DNR to set up a policy (even though the letterboxing<br/>
community told them not to, and definitely not to lump letterboxing in<br/>
with the geocaching) and the next thing you know they put restrictions<br/>
on geocaching AND letterboxing in WI. If you mention letterboxing to<br/>
the DNR, they are reminded to actively enforce their "policies" or<br/>
create new ones, much to the dismay of the rest of us.  Please let<br/>
sleeping dogs lie! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Technically, to place a box in a state park one needs to complete a<br/>
form and submit it to the park ranger. The form is set up for<br/>
geocaching, but letterboxers are supposed to use it.  Since the policy<br/>
has been in place, only two parks that I know of have asked the<br/>
letterboxers with boxes on their property to fill out the form - one<br/>
was Rib Mountain and the other is in Door Cty I believe.  I had no<br/>
problem with the ranger at Rib Mtn, although I had to move my box off<br/>
of protected land.  I have not had to complete the form for any of my<br/>
other boxes in state parks, even though I know that the park rangers<br/>
are aware of the boxes being there (including High Cliffs where I am<br/>
currently camping at).  I believe the same applies for the rest of DNR<br/>
land.  Most letterboxes planted on DNR land are planted following<br/>
letterboxing etiquette, and if an issue with the DNR arises we<br/>
apologize afterwards and fix it (cf Mink River and Rib Mtn boxes). (As<br/>
a side note, this is pretty much what is happening with the MN state<br/>
parks too.  I have never been asked to document my letterboxes there,<br/>
even though I know the rangers know my boxes are there.)<br/>
<br/>
The best thing to do is to plant the box following the regulations<br/>
provided on LBNA.  One should never plant a box so that it harms<br/>
sensitive areas, regardless of whether it is DNR land or not.  If the<br/>
DNR land you are looking to hide a box on is a sensitive area, don't<br/>
plant a box there.  The DNR has maps of their sensitive areas online I<br/>
believe.  Letterboxes are not litter, especially if they cannot be<br/>
seen, as a recent post on AQ attests to.  If people regularly walk<br/>
where you intend to plant a box, it must not be a sensitive area - at<br/>
least not near the trail (just don't go off trail much).<br/>
<br/>
If one is new to planting boxes, it is probably a better idea to plant<br/>
some boxes in a local park or other "safe" areas first and wait (at<br/>
least a year) to see how well they hold up, before attempting to plant<br/>
a box that may be more problematic.  In other words, gain experience<br/>
in planting boxes before attempting harder plants.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 15 cents (adjusted for inflation)...<br/>
