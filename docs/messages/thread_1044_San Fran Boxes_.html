 <br>
 <br>
My husband and I will soon be taking a trip to San Francisco.  I understand there are many letterboxes hidden in the area, and we're excited to go looking for them!  Has anyone in this group ever gone to San Francisco?  Can anyone tell me about what letterboxing is like out in the western states?  We'd really appreciate some letterboxing tips, but we'd also be open to any travel advice anyone might have for us!<br>

I'm glad to get a head's up about one that is missing so I don't waste any time searching for it.  How was the weather when you were there?  Do you have any other tips for us?  Any good restaurants to recommend or places to avoid?  Any other info you could give us would be greatly appreciated!  We've never been there before.<br>
