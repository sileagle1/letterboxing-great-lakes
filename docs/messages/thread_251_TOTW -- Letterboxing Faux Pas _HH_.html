Don't feel bad; you certainly have not done any damage.  The <br/>
owner would probably appreciate hearing about the hitchhiker <br/>
(as the owner of the box would, too).<br/>
<br/>
While the philosophy is to keep hitchhikers moving, a letterboxer <br/>
will sometimes decide to leave a hitchhiker in the box for various <br/>
reasons, among them might be that she won't be going <br/>
letterboxing again soon.<br/>
<br/>
If you will be letterboxing soon, and you are so inclined, it would <br/>
be a favor to go back, pick up the hitchhiker, and move it along.<br/>

My best friend and I just started letter boxing a month  ago.  We were in the <br/>
rain, brought our purses, a huge tote, wore sandals  with no backs to them, <br/>
and didn't cover our clues with a plastic sheath.   Don't even tell me how dumb <br/>
we were...We KNOW!  Not to mention we got down  to the last clue and still <br/>
couldn't find the letterbox!  We learned a lot  that day, and had an absolute <br/>
blast anyway.  Gotta tell you though, we were  so glad no professional <br/>
letterboxers were watching us:{<br/>
