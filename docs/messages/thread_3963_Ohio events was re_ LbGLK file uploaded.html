Was there any discussion about the Columbus gathering?  It will be a huge<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The schoolhouse was so packed with people yesterday that someone right <br/>
next to me could have been coughing and sneezing and I wouldn't have <br/>
been able to hear?!  Remember that child's hand-saying where you motion, <br/>
here is the Church, here is the steeple; open the doors and out come the <br/>
people?????  Yeah, it was like that!  :)  Only no one came out, we all <br/>
stayed inside oblivious to the world outside?!  I have ringing in my <br/>
ears today like I was bar-hopping last night instead of stamping like a <br/>
crazy person!  :) <br/>
<br/>
It was all so very well done!  I can't say that enough.  Dr. Watson and <br/>
Van Man and Brenda of R-gang out did themselves in having every detail <br/>
done and ready to go.  We never got the snow---but it rained a lot and <br/>
it is super cold even today again. <br/>
<br/>
M&amp;8X and Eagle Eyes were there yesterday too!  (Jump in here too!)  :)  <br/>
Many of us talked about the event coming up in June.  I won't say <br/>
anything more to steal any of their thunder except keep checking their <br/>
web site (which is awesome) and then the list Eagle Eyes is going to <br/>
post about who can help and how so any of us who can help, can sign up.  <br/>
This was very great information because so many of us have offered but <br/>
they want to continue to get super organized before letting these <br/>
floodgates open, so to speak.  Both of these folks are exceptional at <br/>
organizing---it is very obvious!  We are lucky they are the hosts!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I no longer have them, but in my previous home, I had plaster <br/>
walls, and I LOVED them!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Continue to get better, speedsquare!<br/>
