I have tree lawns!  The islands I asked about are a totally different thing.  The islands are <br/>
also owned by the city but in all those years they city never mowed them.  They only came <br/>
out to complain if you started trimming trees, which, of course, they never did either.<br/>
<br/>
And the Cincinnati "please" - may be it comes from German roots, often said when you <br/>
want someone to repeat something, in the form of a question ... bitte?<br/>
