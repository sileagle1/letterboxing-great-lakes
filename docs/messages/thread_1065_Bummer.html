                    <div class="plaintext-content">I lost another letterbox.  The second box in my Hidden Village series was reported missing this weekend.  When I went to check on it, the landscape along the trail had changed signifigantly...I suspect the river came over it's banks between the last time I was out there and now.  On the bright side, someone was out there searching for it.  And on the even brighter side, they notified me just in time for me to go see that the county was doing a controlled burn.  I literally had to race to the rescue of box #3 this morning.  So all but the last and first boxes are either missing or pulled to protect them from the fires.  So now it's time to re-carve my missing stamp and ponder a possibly safer location for it.<br/>
