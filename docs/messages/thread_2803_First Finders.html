that you'll be placing in a new WI county!<br/>
<br/>
First Finder prizes are totally optional.  Lots of boxes around here <br/>
don't have anything in them.  As you've noted, there is a wide variety <br/>
of things that are left as a prize if the box does include something.  <br/>
We've found FF certificates, key chain trinkets, hitchhikers and a very <br/>
nice moon jewelry pin (my favorite prize!).  In the boxes we have <br/>
placed, we've left trinkets related to the box theme and hitchhikers as <br/>
prizes.<br/>

What we have seen most in SE Wisconsin are certificates and <br/>
hitchhikers as first finder prizes. When we first started planting <br/>
boxes, we would make small certificates so that people could put <br/>
them in their logbook. Now we tend to either carve a new hitchhiker <br/>
to send off or if we have one in our possession, we leave that so <br/>
that the first finder can get a little boost in their find count. <br/>
Who doesn't love opening a box and finding a HH?<br/>
