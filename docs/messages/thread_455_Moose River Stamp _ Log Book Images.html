Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>

I've taken to making simple AB logs for some of my specimen cup boxes.  I<br>
have a large oval punch...maybe 1x1.5"...that I've been using.  I punch out<br>
a bunch of cardstock ovals and bind them together with a brad and fancy<br>
fibers.  I stamp and emboss the image of the box's stamp (usually glitter<br>
powder) to spiff it up a bit.  Not quite the elaboracy of your log book, SC,<br>
but more fun than just an accordion folded sheet!<br>
