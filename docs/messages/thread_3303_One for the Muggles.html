                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, those old brain cells were sizzling and burning up, but I haven't cracked this code yet.  I have a 2 basic code books for children (and adults too I guess).  Each book lists several different ways to write or decipher clues.  It's a start.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, I came up with a nifty idea tonight.  What if the members of LbGLK developed a secret code language?  We could always use one special code language to write clues, well at least some clues but certainly not all clues.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll be at The Dragon's St. Nick's Gathering.  I'll reveal my idea then.  Maybe I'll even post a code message before the gathering to see if anyone can figure it out.  It's not impossibly difficult, but it's still a code none the less.  <br/>
