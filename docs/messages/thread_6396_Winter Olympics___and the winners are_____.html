                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! What an great day we had today at the Letterboxing Winter Olympics. The weather held out (even if the trails were DEEP with snow)and fun was had by all. So, who won the gold?<br>
<br>
The Gold (1st Place) went to Bahama Mama and Martini Mon (Bahamas) aka as Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man...although this was not much of a surpirsie since we didn't see them at the lodge from 10am until nearly 3:30pm. <br>
<br>
The Silver (2nd Place) went to Australia ...aka Atomic Beans. See" Those beans do work!<br>
<br>
The Bronze (3rd Place) went to USA....aka known as Booty Bandits.<br>
<br>
All three teams walked off with a good stash of prizes, but perhaps the BEST part was presenting Spartanfans (Greece)with boxes upon boxes of diapers so when the newest Spartanfan arrives in April, they'll have PLENTY of togas to go around! Justhappy2cya even knitted a baby blaket in their favorite colors (green & white). ENJOY those diapers, Spartanfans.<br>
<br>
Now, talk about creativity! Tiptoe and Tonto were both sporting some golden locks and EVERYONE represented their countries well! WOW!<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone. I'm glad you all had a great time. Please post pictures if you have them as we forgot out camera.<br>

<br>
It was also amazing to see da creativity of the country participants.  New Zealand had some impressive team uniforms and even had LIVE fish in their country display.  Portugal had an elaborate display and da Swedes were hilarious with their blond hair &  outfits.  They didn't have real fish in their display, but da Swedish fish proved to be very popular as snackins for da hard-working athletes.  Many of de other groups also have impressive things and we be hopin' dat we see photos of dem all.<br>
<br>
We have some photos ourselves, but also hope to see more so we can include dem in a wrap-up page on da web site within da next week.  <br>
<br>
We be sleepin' good tonight after all dat up & down and snow sinkin' on da trails today!<br>
<br>
Thanks again to everyone and especially da very creative F06!<br>

Mrs. Doglvrs took advantage of the roaring fire and hot cocoa in the lodge for this event.  The ski slopes were just too rigorous for her... so she THOROUGHLY enjoyed some great conversation and visiting with old friends.<br>
Michigan gatherings... always a good time!<br>

Thanks for having the event.  Finally met more of the western Michigan letterboxers as well as the out of state letterboxers. Exchanged with many there.  So many great displays there too.  The Austrians were really crafty.  I only had a small Maneki Neko (beckoning/lucky cat) and a box of Japanese cookies in the shape of a koala... and the stamp too.  There were some cookies in that box if anyone wanted to try them. One of these days I will head back to the west side of the state to letterbox (the southern half).  Maybe soon.  Unfortunately, after three out in the snow with help (thanks!!!) and falling down in the snow, something told me it's time to head back.  I headed back to the den and fell down in the snow again on the way back.  Today my body aches like I sprinted in a two mile race barefoot.  Thank you again!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, thanks to Familyof6 for putting together a really great event -- we <br>
had a blast! :)  All of the snow on the trails did make the hiking and <br>
finding of boxes difficult -- figure skating was definitely our most <br>
troublesome find, and it was unfortunate we had to "forfeit" our chance <br>
at gold for that box, but otherwise I think we would have been <br>
scrambling up (and sliding down) that little hill to look in that rock <br>
wall all day!  Snow boxing is fun. ;)<br>
