I have a large series of fish stamps (currently 9, but probably 11 when all finished) to plant and have run into a delema in where to place them.  I haven't found very many appropriate places to hide them in Champaign or immediately surrounding counties (if I were to place them around here they would probably end up scattered through several different parks, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing) but have a wonderful location in mind in Moultrie county (right off Lake Shelbyville, one of my favorite public lands ever...I have placed one stamp there).  The problem is that I don't believe there are any letterboxers within at least a half hour drive of Moultrie, and probably more like a one hour drive.    <br>

My question is, do you think hiding 12 boxes in one location would draw letterboxers or would it be more likely to mean that I'ld have 12 boxes that no one wanted to drive to find?  <br>
<br>
This series has some of my best work to date and I would really like the boxes to become well-visited (eventually, there aren't so many boxers in this area yet).  And while, on the one hand, Moultrie county isn't that close to any of the areas where I *know* letterboxers live, it also isn't really *that* far away.  Plus there are some other things people could do if they wanted to make the drive but not just for letterboxing (the Little Theatre on the Square, for example, regularly brings in people from northern Illinois, particularly the Chicago area).<br>

<br>
  I understand your concern of planting a large series of letterboxes.  However, keep in mind that there are us fellow letterbox-seekers that enjoy traveling to new locations and not just letterboxing in our locale.<br>
<br>
  In fact, my family (Papeseed, Escher, and myself) wandered from Green Bay, WI to most of Upper Michigan just to explore the area while letterboxing.  We discovered many wonderful places and met many wonderful people.  Exploring Illinois is on our list and if you planted your series I'm sure we would take the time to visit, especially if there are so many in one location.  It would be like a little museum for your art.<br>
<br>
  I say go for it!  Plant them and they shall come!  Maybe immediately, maybe not - but the reward will be for those who do.  The fewer the people that see them, the more precious they will be.  Either way it's a win-win situation!<br>
<br>
Good luck and I look forward to seeing them someday!<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

I have a question for everyone.  I have a large series of fish stamps<br>
(currently 9, but probably 11 when all finished) to plant and have run into<br>
a delema in where to place them.  I haven't found very many appropriate<br>
places to hide them in Champaign or immediately surrounding counties (if I<br>
were to place them around here they would probably end up scattered through<br>
several different parks, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing) but have<br>
a wonderful location in mind in Moultrie county (right off Lake Shelbyville,<br>
one of my favorite public lands ever...I have placed one stamp there).  The<br>
problem is that I don't believe there are any letterboxers within at least a<br>
half hour drive of Moultrie, and probably more like a one hour drive.<br>
<br>
My question is, do you think hiding 12 boxes in one location would draw<br>
letterboxers or would it be more likely to mean that I'ld have 12 boxes that<br>
no one wanted to drive to find?<br>
<br>
This series has some of my best work to date and I would really like the<br>
boxes to become well-visited (eventually, there aren't so many boxers in<br>
this area yet).  And while, on the one hand, Moultrie county isn't that<br>
close to any of the areas where I *know* letterboxers live, it also isn't<br>
really *that* far away.  Plus there are some other things people could do if<br>
they wanted to make the drive but not just for letterboxing (the Little<br>
Theatre on the Square, for example, regularly brings in people from northern<br>
Illinois, particularly the Chicago area).<br>

Except, I've got a better suggestion for the hiding location- it's a little town in Mississippi called Olive Branch.  They don't have ANY.  *grin*<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
