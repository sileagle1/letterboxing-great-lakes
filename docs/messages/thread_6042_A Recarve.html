You could mount them on the two sides of an acrylic block.  This might reduce confusion and save space in the box.  I love the idea of seeing the progression.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">How about trying to fix the old one and leaving it in the original box and then making an add-on box for the new stamp, with a one-step clue in the back of the logbook (you could explain what happened)?<br>

Doesn't it kind of suck when your carving progresses to the point where you feel that the level of skill and precision detract from the charm of your stamps?  While I greatly admire the talent displayed in finely detailed carvings, there is a definite charm to the rudimentary, primitive carvings (especially those where the carver has the skill to maintain that primitive look even though I know they have what it takes to do a finely detailed masterpiece).<br>
