and Mr. Duck for the really terrific time and beautiful boxes. It does <br>
appear that Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man gave you the secret for <br>
terrific weather, and also provided the delicious Revel bars (not to <br>
mention Emily's new favorite, Wisconsin Cheese Curds.)  It was terrific <br>
meeting new people and seeing some of our old friends again.  We were <br>
very happy to get out on the trails again, albeit for a short time and <br>
only a few boxes.<br>
