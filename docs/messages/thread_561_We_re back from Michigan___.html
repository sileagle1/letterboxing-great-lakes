                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  Deedle & I returned from our Great Michigan Adventure this evening around dinner time.  Everything about our trip was great...well, except for the mosquito bites.  And that rain that was never mentioned in the weather forcasts...but more about that later.  :)<br>
 <br>
First of all, to those who gave us phone numbers to try to meet up for exchanges, I apologize that we never got a hold of you, but don't feel too badly because we didn't have a chance to meet up with anyone.  But the "good news" is that we determined that with all the boxes planted in Michigan we have to start driving up there more often.<br>
 <br>
So Friday, after passing the Giant Rooster on Route 127, our first letterboxing stop was the Intrigue at Aiden Lair series in Somerset Center.  When we left Cleveland it was a rainy morning, but weather.com said no rain in Michigan, and the skies cleared the further west we went.  So what happened?  We found the park, got our hiking boots on, grabbed the backpacks, were literally ready to pull the clues out and start when it began to rain.  Not just little drip drops, but enough to soak you rain.  We took shelter in the car for about 20 minutes until the skies cleared enough for us to begin.  But it was worth the wait - that is an amazing park.  Of the 6 active boxes there, we found the first, second, third, and last ones.  Box four we could not find the correct location for.  Box five we're pretty sure we found the correct location, but no box, so we need to contact the placer to find out if we were on the right track.<br>
 <br>
By the time we were done with Aiden, though, it was about 4 pm, and we hadn't eaten since breakfast.  Oh, and as we were finishing with the last box the rain decided to start up again, so we decided to call it a day and head to our hotel.<br>
 <br>
Saturday was the "real" reason for our trip, my friend Shawn's wedding.  We started the day off by finding Adrian's letterbox, Laughing Jack.  Cute little box.  Then the rest of the day was dedicated to the wedding.  May I just say that my friend Shawn certainly knows how to do things up.  For their grand enterance at the reception, Shawn donned a tuxedo with tails (he had worn a kilt during the actual wedding ceremony), patent-leather shoes, top hat, walking stick AND monacle.  What a sight...and, well, we really didn't expect anything less from him.<br>
 <br>
But back to letterboxing....since we only found one set of letterboxes from our Friday list, Sunday we picked up with our Friday list.  I was a little leary about paying to get into the park where the Hidden Lake Gardens box was hidden, since it was only one box and we had this long list of others we could find, but Jeff thought it would be fun, so we went, and spent a few hours looking around at everything once we found the box.  Definetely worth the price of admission!  After Hidden Lakes, we went to Hell.  Good thing Jeff wore his drum set tuner that's shaped like a Gothic cross, otherwise we might have never made it out alive ;)  Although, we did manage to finally escape the rain in Hell that started up as we were leaving Hidden Lakes (the rain that, once again, wasn't in the forecast we saw).<br>
 <br>
By then it was nearing dinner time, so we decided to head towards Dearborn and our hotel there.  We passed by the park where April Fool's was hidden, but due to the time and rumors that the box is a tricky one to find (and the rain that had happened there while we were in Hell), we decided that maybe we'd try on another visit.  We waved as we passed, though.  We did stop to find Hachiko since we drove right by that park on the way to Dearborn.  Nice, precise clues.  And a neat area...it reminds me of the Cuyahoga Valley Towpath the way it's set up.<br>
 <br>
Finally to the hotel, where we spent the night eating pizza and watching the Olympics.  Ah yes, we came to Michigan to do that :)<br>
 <br>
Monday was Henry Ford Museum day, and even if there weren't more letterboxes to find in Michigan, we've already got another week's worth of vacation planned.  We spent the entire day in the museum only, and still didn't see everything that was in the museum to see.  We considered finding Joy of the River that evening, since it was right around the corner from our hotel, but decided after a day of walking (and the note about the gates being locked at dusk in the clues) it would be best to wait until Tuesday morning...<br>
 <br>
So Tuesday morning (today) we found Joy of the River, which we've fondly nicknamed "Joy of the Mosquitos."  It was fun reading the comments in the logbook about the killer 8 foot mosquitos almost making off with people's children, though.  :)  We then went to find the 4 Grosse Isle boxes, but just our luck, the bridge we needed to take to get to the island was closed for construction for one day, and one day only - today.  At least it wasn't raining...we hung out for a while in Elizabeth Park instead, taking in the view and contemplating where we could plant a letterbox when we take our what will have to be 2 week vacation next year to find the rest of the letterboxes, explore the rest of the Henry Ford museum & Greenfield Village, visit the Hard Rock Cafe (which was closed for a private party when we stopped by so I could try to buy my shot glass Monday), and maybe go hang out in Canada for a day or two....<br>
 <br>
So we headed to Monroe to find Old Frenshtown Island.  Jeff was very impressed by the fact that it was historical ground.  After that, on the way home, we decided to find Ay Ziggy Zoomba after all since we couldn't get to Grosse Isle.  And what a way to end our letterboxing day -- the Thoas Swallowtail Hitchhiker was stowed away inside!  (Sorry Armadillo Jo, since had we not stopped you probably would have found him on your visit that's coming up soon.)<br>
 <br>
Well, I guess it's time to unpack the suitcases now.  Or maybe work on a plant per SpringChick's Challenge of the Week instead.... :)<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
