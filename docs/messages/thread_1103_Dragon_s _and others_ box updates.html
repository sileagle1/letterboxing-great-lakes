I went out today to start the spring cleaning on my boxes.  Here's a<br>
report:<br>
<br>
Mathman #1 - Still active, now camouflage taped<br>
Mathman #3 - REACTIVATED!  and camouflage taped<br>
REI Box - REACTIVATED! (the employees are moving the box with the<br>
hiding location so we shouldn't have any more trouble :-) )<br>
The Buffy Box - Still active, now camouflage taped<br>
MCP/Oak Leaf Series:<br>
Brown Deer - Still active, now camouflage taped<br>
Detzka - Still active, now camouflage taped<br>
Currie Park - Sill INACTIVE, BUT I scouted a temporary spot for the<br>
box.  I hope to have it in place this coming week.  I have updated the<br>
clues already with the new temporary clues.<br>
<br>
I also checked on the following boxes that are not mine:<br>
Boyhood Adventures - #1 is definately missing, hiding location ripped<br>
up, #2 is frozen in place - you'll have to wait until it thaws more in<br>
order to retrieve the box.<br>
Mt. Bieterman - still there in good shape - old man snuck up on me<br>
replacing it, so I don't know what he did after I left, although he<br>
left the area before me<br>
Dog Park - still there in decent condition - baggies need replacing -<br>
don't ask why I didn't replace them (I DOH! moment...)<br>
<br>
Watch for more updates soon!<br>
