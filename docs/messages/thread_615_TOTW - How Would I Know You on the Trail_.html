But if you are letterboxing in Michigan and come across to 3 people: Mom, Dad and a little girl, take a closer look, If the trio stops every 10 paces to observe bugs/caterpillars, animal tracks, and flowers, get closer and hear, If dad is giving a botany/zoology lesson in spanish language...<br>

all my stuff around in could be a giveaway. (As soon as I actually get around<br>
to placing an order for some PFX patches, I'll have those sewn onto it.) I get<br>
some odd looks from other people out on the trails when they see me and<br>
my bag. It doesn't look much like the packs most hikers carry.  It provides <br>
nice cover, though -- it's large enough to hold all of my lb stuff plus a sketch <br>
pad or whatever else I feel like toting along. Guess I just look like a wayward <br>
art student. :-)<br>
<br>
Other way to tell me on the trails: I'm the one who looks like I'm out in <br>
nature, but trying desperately not to let the nature touch me. (I'm such a <br>
city girl.)<br>

Deedle & I tend to be the couple with the wild mood swings.  OK, _I_ tend to be the one with the wild mood swings, swatting his helping hand away from me in frustration because we can't find the box, and then throwing my arms around him & smothering him with kisses when we do find it :)<br>

p.s. and it doesn't have to be bickering about letterboxing, either. My husband and I, back in high school, once had a week-long fight about whether plastic was animal, mineral, or vegetable.<br>

I already posted about my attire - cargo pants, cheap bucket hat, hiking boots. Look for the gal in beige :) But what you really need to keep an eye out for is a guy & gal (because we always box together), gal with a royal blue bookbag on her back, bookbag being covered in patches, esp. a LbNA path & a sequined "doodle bug" towards the top.<br>
<br>
Or at least, that's how my bookbag WILL look as soon as the store calls to let me know the hole in the bottom has been fixed & I can pick it up & sew the patches on.<br>

So until then, if you see a young couple in jeans and t-shirts out on <br>

probably us.  We haven't yet made an exchange so if you see us - get <br>

easier to stamp in when comfortably seated. The "Sit-About" packs also give<br>
us more room to cart things such as bug spray, extra supplies for box<br>

I found the smaller one just didn't have enough space for all my stamp pads,<br>

Now I've got a nice big heavy bag that also holds 2 liters of water!!<br>
<br>
So to find me...I'd be the one hunched over while hiking because my pack is<br>
so darn heavy!!!  Maybe I need to get a wagon!!<br>
<br>
Do I really need all this stuff?  Probably not but I'm afraid if I don't<br>
bring it....I will need it!!! Since I 'box alone...better safe than sorry.<br>
But I figure I will probably give myself a coronary from carrying so much<br>

  I have to laugh at the image of you crawling along under the weight of<br>
your<br>
  backpack because mine is also getting rather large and bulky since I<br>
traded<br>
  up for a bigger one with more room and pockets for all of my essential<br>
  letterboxing stuff.  When hiking in the woods it doesn't seem strange<br>
  because there are some serious hiking trails around here that connect up<br>
  with the North Country Trail, but I think I looked a bit odd walking on a<br>
  paved urban pathway the other day.  An older couple I passed asked me<br>
about<br>

Other than the typical jeans and hiking boots (I'm still trying to <br>

common, too.  Maybe my habit of trying to find the item I'm looking <br>

At the Ren Faire I'll be wearing...<br>
<br>
velvety green pants<br>
white loose medieval shirt<br>
knee-high tan/brown moccasins with dagger stuck in<br>
feathery leather wrap holding his ponytail<br>
long sword draped on his back held in place with a black strap across<br>
his chest<br>
a rabbit-fur bag on his side  (actually this broke, so I won't have it)<br>
(if it is not hot - a black/green cloak)<br>
the "mark of The Dragon" on his left hand<br>
<br>
Come up to him and say "I see you have the mark of The Dragon.  Can I<br>
have it as well?" and he'll gladly exchange his mark for yours.<br>
<br>
On the usual trail, you can spot me as a middle aged man with a pony<br>
tail and a black camera bag (which actually hold my LB stuff).  I hope<br>
to have LB patches on the bag soon.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That varies.   If I'm just doing a quick pass-through to check on one of my<br>
local boxes, it seems I always forget to dress the part, and inevitably end<br>
up wearing something like a bright red or orange top which makes me as<br>
visible as a hunter during duck season while trying to appear covert.  Duh.<br>
<br>
When on an official trip, I tend to wear a pair of olive colored nylon<br>
zipoffs (which are men's, so as shorts they hit at a very unfashionable<br>
length...my knee...which embarrasses Papillon to no end.).  Top is some sort<br>
of tshirt, nothing specific.  No, I haven't worn the gathering shirt with<br>
FUNGUSWOMAN emblazoned across my back while out boxing, though I did wear it<br>
to work last Saturday.  My coworkers, knowing me as they do, didn't blink an<br>
eye.  (Though they probably rolled them behind my back.)  Back to boxing.<br>
I started with a fanny pack (see earlier comments about "too small" from<br>
other respondees), so have taken to using an obnoxiously bright<br>
stoplight-green and yellow daypack covered with GS patches (need to order my<br>
LbNA patches one of these days) and jangling with noisy keychains hanging on<br>
it.  (see paragraph #1).  Again, DUH.  You'll probably hear me before you<br>
see me.<br>
<br>
Speaking of hearing, if I've got Papillon, or any of her Boxing Buddies<br>
along, you'll probably hear them as well.  14 year old freshman girls.  That<br>
says it all.<br>
<br>
Muddy Paws/Hershey.  Take a guess.  She ain't no yellow lab.  She does wear<br>
a bandanna, if you want extra confirmation.<br>
<br>
Mr. FungusWoman?  He's the one grumbling the whole time "If I'd known you<br>
were going to do this all day, I'd have stayed home."  Needless to say, the<br>
chances of running into him on the trail are VERY slim!  However, if you<br>
ever come looking for FOOW5 in Riverside, Illinois, and you see a blue<br>
truck, possibly pulling a trailer, with a sign saying Thomas Landscape<br>
Company...that's him!  I should give him a personal traveller to carry in<br>
his truck...or not!<br>

Well, until just recently I'd say look for the guy who had waaayyy <br>
too many bags, straps, pouches, cases, etc. hanging around his back <br>
and belt. But now we have the same packs made famous (?) by Wisconsin <br>
Hiker and Martini Man. They're the ones that convert into a handy sit-<br>
and-stamp campstool. (I think WIHI&MM have a photo on the GL site <br>
that shows the packs). The pack has lots of pockets which are <br>
accessible to the user while he/she is sitting. I'm looking forward <br>
to using these.<br>
<br>
The other identifier is my omnipresent camera in its harness. <br>
Originally carried as a prop, the camera has been recently replaced <br>
by one that I love to use. The camera chest-harness is the best <br>
accessory I've acquired for quite awhile. It holds the camera close <br>
to me so it doesn't dangle around my neck as I walk, or swing down <br>
when I lean over to search for a box. I love it.<br>
Oh yeah, and probably the hat. When the natural head covering thins <br>
to the point of no longer affording any protection from the elements, <br>
it's time for the hat, fulltime.<br>
<br>
We don't have a special dance. I'm so afraid of attracting attention <br>
that we act more like a calm discovery, "yup, here it is".<br>
<br>
In the fall, during hunting season, we're apt to wear blaze orange <br>
vests if we're anywhere near open hunting areas.<br>
<br>
Overall, I'd hope that you *couldn't* know me as a letterboxer. I try <br>
to blend in as a birdwatcher, nature photographer, or wandering hiker.<br>
But the compass and clues are the dead giveaway.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I usually wear long pants (my sage-green twill scrub pants are<br>
my favorite by far...they look like drawstring cargo pants more than<br>
scrubs) and some sort of t-shirt (although if it's hot out it's more<br>
likely to be a tank top).  But the biggest give-away of all would have<br>
to be the big white German shepherd wearing an orange backpack with<br>
reflective stripes down the sides.  I don't usually have a back pack<br>
because all the ones we own seem way too big for 'boxing with and<br>
everything fits into the dog's pack anyway.  I'm also usually out with<br>
Katy (who usually wears similar attire) and her brindle whippet mix<br>
who is wearing a (much smaller) red and black backpack.  We blend in<br>
quite nicely on the trail (the dogs provide plenty of cover for our<br>
forages into the woods) and usually get lots of questions/comments on<br>
the dogs' packs (again, great cover...people are too distracted by the<br>
dogs to wonder what we're up to).<br>
