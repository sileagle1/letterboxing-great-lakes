LOL!  When I was a kid, we rarely had dessert after dinner.  The one exception was when dinner was Pea Soup.  None of us (6 kids) liked peas, so there was usually dessert (pudding) on pea soup night as a motivation for us to eat our soup.  That wasn't even enough sometimes - we have photos of some of my sisters asleep at the table in front of their soup bowls because we couldn't leave the table until we finished our dinner.<br>
I still don't like mushy peas, but do enjoy sugar snap pea pods or snow pea pods.<br>
