Quoting Sandrich from the Migo forum,<br/>
[quote]<br/>
The DNR is aware of Letterboxing, and they have asked me about the<br/>
sport as well. Since I haven't done any letterboxing (yet), I felt<br/>
that it really was best to keep my conversations with them to be<br/>
'caching-centric, and not drift off that point too much. I did refer<br/>
them to the letterboxing website for any further questions... My<br/>
concern here is that the DNR may wish to also impose a use fee for<br/>
Letterboxing as well as caching, and I'm sure we all would like to<br/>
avoid that as well!<br/>
So, for the time being, I'm going to continue to negotiate with the<br/>
DNR as regards to 'caching, and hope that down the road, when we have<br/>
the type of poilcy that our community wants, then perhaps someone can<br/>
negotiate to have Letterboxing included with caching.<br/>

I feel that the best approach to fitting letterboxing into this Parks<br/>
&amp; Rec policy is to be up front and proactive about it.  I predict that<br/>
if a fee were imposed on geocaching and none on letterboxing, then<br/>
geocachers would quickly become letterboxers and continue to hide<br/>
boxes on Parks &amp; Rec land unmonitored, and the DNR would be right back<br/>
to the original problem.<br/>
<br/>
So please log on to Migo and read the Parks &amp; Rec thread in the<br/>
forums, and join the conversation.  If we can do this policy right the<br/>
first time, in a way that encourages people to continue to hide and<br/>
seek boxes and addresses the concerns of the DNR about use trails, we<br/>
will save ourselves the annoyance of politicking in the future.<br/>
