of each others breath as a location system, to avoid bumping into one<br>
another, the Listerine would stop may eons of evolutionary progress<br>
for them.<br>

Sorry to have been away for so long, but we added another Curry to the<br>
family on May 1st this year.  Aislinn will be making appearances in<br>
the upcoming months.  We are just waiting for the coating of Listerine<br>
to set in first.<br>
<br>
Hope are well.  We have missed having you guys as a part of our lives.<br>
 Definitely miss boxing.<br>

Chirodoc, Camp Lady, Peace Pup, and a Little Boxer to be named later.<br>
