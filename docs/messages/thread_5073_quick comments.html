<br/>
Just trying to get all caught up on stuff since things have been <br/>
busy.  Anyway, a few things...<br/>
<br/>
1) Sending LOTS of postive thoughts out to Matt.  Hope you're feeling <br/>
better!!!<br/>
<br/>
2) Hope everyone has fun at the GLG this weekend!  We're sad to miss <br/>
out, but we'll be thinking of you.<br/>
<br/>
3) Good luck to StarGirl and El Cajador as they move out of the <br/>
region.  And welcome to Katy who's moving back.<br/>
<br/>
4) Thanks for the wedding congrats (again).  Everything on the big <br/>
day went very well, and we'll try to post a couple of pics <br/>
eventually.  The honeymoon in OR was GREAT -- sooo many cool boxes <br/>
and sites to see!  The weather wasn't the greatest for the most part, <br/>
but it was more or less what we expected so we packed <br/>
accordingly. :)  We did several great hikes (although ahhhh, <br/>
elevation gain makes the legs hurt!) and found 30-some boxes in total <br/>
I think -- I still need to update our stats.  And the M&amp;G organized <br/>
by Marmalade and Campfire Lady was really nice (as were the hosts, <br/>
guests, and the weather that day!).  If interested, check out the <br/>
pics on AQ. :)<br/>
