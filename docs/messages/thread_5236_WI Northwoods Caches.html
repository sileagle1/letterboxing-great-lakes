A Jag billboard is is a billboard owned by Jag, Inc. They're<br>
distinctive b/c of the bright orange dot on the "j" at the bottom of<br>
the sign. They're only in eastern Wisconsin (see the map at<br>

Door Co. is such a beautiful area, as you know.  Consider it!  I hope to see you at the October 4 gatehring. I will have to look for those Jag billboards now that I know what to look for.  I'm usually busy looking for white paper birch trees.  That's my indicator that we're in northern WI.  <br>
