I am afraid today that I will have to join the LBA(Letteroxers <br>
Annonymous).  I broke down infront of my students.  I just lost it!!  <br>
It was ugly.  Here is the story....  I decided to break out the new <br>
flag football belts for a big rousing game of Pull the Tail Off <br>
Roudolf, when I noticed that they were wrapped in some cool small zip <br>
lock bags. Perfect for small letterboxes!  That is when I just lost <br>
it.  I began to yell (not really yell) at them like a crazy person <br>
insisting that they save the bags!!!!!  I even had a couple of students <br>
help fold them up nicely.  I did appologize to them and told them what <br>
they were for.  They still looked at me like I was crazy.  I really <br>
need my Christmas break to start now!!<br>

This is a great way to further the addiction.  Lately, I have been <br>
snatching all those little dry packs out of shoe boxes to put into my <br>
plants.  I'll trade ya some dry packs for some zip lock baggies!<br>
