Oooh, are they allowing the audience participation for Rocky Horror Picture Show?  If so, don't forget your squirt guns and toast, and your copy of the Cleveland Plain Dealer!  <br/>

Actually the weather forecast is iffy, so we will not be going either - we're heading to friends for a Game Night instead.<br/>
<br/>
We're still hoping to make it to Rocky Horror on SEP 24, since we've never seen this "classic".<br/>

Hope all is well w/you!<br/>

Well we were really trying to plan our day so that were would be able to make it but it does not seem to be written in the stars. Both Tat2Bob and I are going to have to work later tonight then the rest of the week. So we are going to have to back out. We were so looking forward to it too. Hope everyone has fun. Maybe we will get to join the fun for the next one. <br/>

We're still out in NY, but will be home soon. Just a reminder - If anyone would like to join us on Friday night for the free outdoor movie (weather permitting), we are planning to see the "Darkside of Oz" this Friday, SEP 10. This is especially interesting due to the series that Hartx6, Pitties &amp; Shorty planted in IL this year, and also of interest to anyone who enjoys Pink Floyd music. Even if you can't make it to the movie this Friday, you may enjoy watching the video trailer.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you can make it, send us an email and we'll send you our cell phone # to meet up on Friday. Food &amp; drink available at the lakefront movie location, details on link posted above (fish fry, brats, chicken sandich, etc).<br/>

Let's see, you'll also need rice, playing cards, confetti... Around here, a lot of times when the movie is shown the venue will actually sell a "Rocky Horror Participant kit."  <br/>

      I assume audience participation will be allowed, or even encouraged since it is an outdoor venue.  However I have only read about this aspect since amazingly we have never seen this "classic"!  We can round up some squirt guns &amp; toast, but the Cleveland Paper will be more difficult.  Perhaps I can just print something from the newspaper's website to fake it....<br/>
