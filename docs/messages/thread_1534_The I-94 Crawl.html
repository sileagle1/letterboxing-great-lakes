                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alright, so it seems there's enough responses to get this thing going.<br>
<br>
First, the facts:<br>
Number of Miles- 1614<br>
    * Montana- 249 miles<br>
    * North Dakota- 353 miles<br>
    * Minnesota- 260 miles<br>
    * Wisconsin- 351 miles<br>
    * Illinois- 81 miles<br>
    * Indiana- 45 miles <br>
<br>
Major Cities - <br>
    * WEST END: Billings, MT _____<br>
    * Bismark, ND _____<br>
    * Fargo, ND _____<br>
    * Twin Cities, MN (Sqwubb, ____)<br>
    * Madison, WI (M Clan, _____)<br>
    * Milwaukee, WI _____<br>
    * Chicago, IL (Howling Coyote, _____)<br>
    * Gary, IN (Tiptoe & Tonto, _____)<br>
    * Kalamazoo, MI (Pale Puppy Posse, _____)<br>
    * Detroit, MI (Trail Troll, _____)<br>
    * EAST END: Port Huron, MI<br>
<br>
Let's call the thing "The I-94 Traffic Crawl" and prefix the boxes<br>
accordingly (e.g. "The I-94 Traffic Crawl: Gary, IN".  THEME: Just<br>
play off the word "crawl" and think "traffic" - we've all been there,<br>
right?  Try and tie it in to your location somehow.  Keep things a<br>
mile or two off the freeway and send us somewhere interesting.  We<br>
need stimulation after staring at brake lights.  (That part makes no<br>
sense for Montana, but oh well...)  <br>
<br>
Submit ideas and locations to me off-list and I'll make sure we avoid<br>
duplicates.<br>
<br>
Let's also try to avoid the Oases since a few people are already<br>
headed in that direction.  Get us off the freeway!<br>
<br>
It would be great to have all the major cities represented as well as<br>
the  start and end points of the freeway.  I'll try to find our ND and<br>
MT brothers and sisters.<br>
<br>
Even if someone in your area is already signed up, it doesn't hurt to<br>
have more than one.  Many of us crawl along this route often.<br>
<br>
This should be interesting and make our driving fun.  I'm starting to<br>
look forward to my next MI or Minneapolis trip.  When you travel this<br>
route, think about adding a box at a rest stop.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to your emails and ideas,<br>

Hi!<br>
<br>
Nice job doing the research and organizing this effort!  Do you plan to <br>
incorporate or reference existing boxes along the route?  Example:  <br>
Bell Mound near Black River Falls is a box in an interesting rest stop <br>
along I-94.  Elk Mound is also only a short distance off I-94.  Both <br>
are Matt the Rat boxes placed several years ago.  There are also other <br>
boxes near I-94 in the Madison and Milwaukee area.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a really neat project and I know people are always looking <br>
for organized information on boxes along their travel routes.  The <br>
way it is now, most of the easy-access boxes are buried in counties <br>
and you really don't know how far from the expressway the boxes are <br>
without studying the clues for each one.<br>
<br>
Might I suggest that you start a Yahoo group specific to this <br>
project?  It's not that I don't want it here, just that it spans <br>
geographic regions and as you include some of the states further <br>
West, they may not appreciate having to wade through Great Lakes list <br>
chatter to keep up with project messages.<br>
<br>
In many of the art circles I frequent, this is how it is done with <br>
projects -- a separate group is formed and anyone participating or <br>
interested in the project can join.  It helps to keep project details <br>
from getting lost in the main list messages.<br>
<br>
Just an idea...  If you would rather keep it here, that is fine also.<br>
<br>
Another suggestion is to create a database in whichever Yahoo group <br>
you end up using so that people can enter information about boxes <br>
they are placing along the route.<br>
<br>
BTW -- how many miles are in MI?<br>

If there's another box nearby, perhaps the clue can say, "Check out<br>
