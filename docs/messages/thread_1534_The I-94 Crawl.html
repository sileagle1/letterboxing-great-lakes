First, the facts:<br/>
Number of Miles- 1614<br/>
    * Montana- 249 miles<br/>
    * North Dakota- 353 miles<br/>
    * Minnesota- 260 miles<br/>

    * Fargo, ND _____<br/>

    * Detroit, MI (Trail Troll, _____)<br/>
    * EAST END: Port Huron, MI<br/>
<br/>
Let's call the thing "The I-94 Traffic Crawl" and prefix the boxes<br/>
accordingly (e.g. "The I-94 Traffic Crawl: Gary, IN".  THEME: Just<br/>
play off the word "crawl" and think "traffic" - we've all been there,<br/>
right?  Try and tie it in to your location somehow.  Keep things a<br/>
mile or two off the freeway and send us somewhere interesting.  We<br/>
need stimulation after staring at brake lights.  (That part makes no<br/>
sense for Montana, but oh well...)  <br/>
<br/>
Submit ideas and locations to me off-list and I'll make sure we avoid<br/>
duplicates.<br/>
<br/>
Let's also try to avoid the Oases since a few people are already<br/>
headed in that direction.  Get us off the freeway!<br/>
<br/>
It would be great to have all the major cities represented as well as<br/>
the  start and end points of the freeway.  I'll try to find our ND and<br/>
MT brothers and sisters.<br/>
<br/>
Even if someone in your area is already signed up, it doesn't hurt to<br/>
have more than one.  Many of us crawl along this route often.<br/>
<br/>
This should be interesting and make our driving fun.  I'm starting to<br/>
look forward to my next MI or Minneapolis trip.  When you travel this<br/>
route, think about adding a box at a rest stop.<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Nice job doing the research and organizing this effort!  Do you plan to <br/>
incorporate or reference existing boxes along the route?  Example:  <br/>
Bell Mound near Black River Falls is a box in an interesting rest stop <br/>
along I-94.  Elk Mound is also only a short distance off I-94.  Both <br/>
are Matt the Rat boxes placed several years ago.  There are also other <br/>
boxes near I-94 in the Madison and Milwaukee area.<br/>

<br/>
Might I suggest that you start a Yahoo group specific to this <br/>
project?  It's not that I don't want it here, just that it spans <br/>
geographic regions and as you include some of the states further <br/>
West, they may not appreciate having to wade through Great Lakes list <br/>
chatter to keep up with project messages.<br/>
<br/>
In many of the art circles I frequent, this is how it is done with <br/>
projects -- a separate group is formed and anyone participating or <br/>
interested in the project can join.  It helps to keep project details <br/>
from getting lost in the main list messages.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea...  If you would rather keep it here, that is fine also.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion is to create a database in whichever Yahoo group <br/>
you end up using so that people can enter information about boxes <br/>
they are placing along the route.<br/>

BTW -- how many miles are in MI?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Let's call the thing "The I-94 Traffic Crawl" and prefix the boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; accordingly (e.g. "The I-94 Traffic Crawl: Gary, IN".  THEME: Just<br/>
&gt; &gt; play off the word "crawl" and think "traffic" - we've all been<br/>
&gt;there,<br/>
&gt; &gt; right?  Try and tie it in to your location somehow.  Keep things a<br/>
&gt; &gt; mile or two off the freeway and send us somewhere interesting.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; need stimulation after staring at brake lights.  (That part makes no<br/>
&gt; &gt; sense for Montana, but oh well...)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Submit ideas and locations to me off-list and I'll make sure we<br/>
&gt;avoid<br/>
&gt; &gt; duplicates.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let's also try to avoid the Oases since a few people are already<br/>
&gt; &gt; headed in that direction.  Get us off the freeway!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It would be great to have all the major cities represented as well<br/>
&gt;as<br/>
&gt; &gt; the  start and end points of the freeway.  I'll try to find our ND<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; MT brothers and sisters.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Even if someone in your area is already signed up, it doesn't hurt<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have more than one.  Many of us crawl along this route often.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; This should be interesting and make our driving fun.  I'm starting<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; look forward to my next MI or Minneapolis trip.  When you travel<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt; &gt; route, think about adding a box at a rest stop.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Looking forward to your emails and ideas,<br/>

&gt; I'm certainly willing to do that, SC, if this<br/>

&gt; vast majority of the freeway is between Minnesota<br/>

&gt; not even sure of the region North Dakota fits into. <br/>
&gt; I posted<br/>
&gt; something about the series on the Rocky Mountain<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can I keep the discussion here for a while until we<br/>
&gt; see if the series<br/>
&gt; actually get the series west of Minnesota?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MI mileage = 275.49.<br/>

&gt; &gt; This is a really neat project and I know people<br/>
&gt; are always looking <br/>
&gt; &gt; for organized information on boxes along their<br/>
&gt; travel routes.  The <br/>
&gt; &gt; way it is now, most of the easy-access boxes are<br/>
&gt; buried in counties <br/>
&gt; &gt; and you really don't know how far from the<br/>
&gt; expressway the boxes are <br/>
&gt; &gt; without studying the clues for each one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Might I suggest that you start a Yahoo group<br/>
&gt; specific to this <br/>
&gt; &gt; project?  It's not that I don't want it here, just<br/>
&gt; that it spans <br/>
&gt; &gt; geographic regions and as you include some of the<br/>
&gt; states further <br/>
&gt; &gt; West, they may not appreciate having to wade<br/>
&gt; through Great Lakes list <br/>
&gt; &gt; chatter to keep up with project messages.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In many of the art circles I frequent, this is how<br/>
&gt; it is done with <br/>
&gt; &gt; projects -- a separate group is formed and anyone<br/>
&gt; participating or <br/>
&gt; &gt; interested in the project can join.  It helps to<br/>
&gt; keep project details <br/>
&gt; &gt; from getting lost in the main list messages.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just an idea...  If you would rather keep it here,<br/>
&gt; that is fine also.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Another suggestion is to create a database in<br/>
&gt; whichever Yahoo group <br/>
&gt; &gt; you end up using so that people can enter<br/>
&gt; information about boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; they are placing along the route.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW -- how many miles are in MI?<br/>
