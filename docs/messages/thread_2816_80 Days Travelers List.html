&gt; Has your staff been keeping track of the number of travelers who have<br/>
&gt; completed the tour? I think when B and I finished in May, we were maybe<br/>
&gt; the 5th or so...? And it seems like the numbers have exploded this<br/>
&gt; summer! Just curious how many intrepid souls have pulled off this<br/>
&gt; tour.... (which, by the way, was one of our favorites ever and got us<br/>
&gt; completely hooked on boxing when we started last summer!)<br/>

&gt;&gt; The Chicago couple ventured to the hinterlands of Michigan to quietly<br/>
&gt;&gt; wrap up their tour of `foreign' cities.<br/>
&gt;&gt; The Travel Team was aware of some Michigan roots in the successful<br/>
&gt;&gt; searchers, but doubt that it proved any advantage to the travelers.<br/>
&gt;&gt; However, they did make short work of the 15 city tour.<br/>
