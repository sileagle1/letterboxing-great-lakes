evening, starting at 8 pm.  Let me know if you think you might make it, and<br/>
what time you might arrive.  We'll probably be there for part of the time.<br/>
The Brewhaus is open until midnight.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in getting together Saturday night after the event,<br/>
one possible meeting place is Marty's Pizza in Delafield.  Perhaps an 8:30<br/>
or 9:00 pm time?  Again, let me know if you might be interested in this....<br/>
<br/>
Either or both nights would provide another opportunity to talk letterboxing<br/>
and do some "exchanges".<br/>
<br/>
Both places are off of exit 287 in Delafield (~2 miles from Lapham Peak).<br/>
Here are links for more info re: menu, etc.  No need to order food Friday<br/>
night, there is full bar in addition to their specialty beers.  However if<br/>
you do want food, both a regular menu and a "late night" menu are available.<br/>
Marty's of course offers pizza, in addition to other Italian items.<br/>

Friday night Pre-event:   http://www.delafield-brewhaus.com/interior.html<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night Post-event: http://www.foodspot.com/martys/delafield/<br/>
<br/>
I'll hopefully also post this info on the website tomorrow or Thursday<br/>
night.<br/>

We made our reservations today at the Baymont for Friday and<br/>
Saturday.  I really can't wait for the Third to get here!  Was<br/>
anything decided about the possibility of a small get together on<br/>
Friday night?<br/>
