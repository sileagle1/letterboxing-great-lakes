Time for some BINGO trivia!<br/>
<br/>
There were 140 words that could be chosen for the BINGO cards, plus 10 wildcard choices, for a total of 150 words.  How many of these were NOT picked by anyone?<br/>
<br/>
Any guesses?   I'll give you the answer in a few days.<br/>

I had a good run in Jan. but just one word called in Feb. on the 9th.  March has got to be better since there's not so many left now that I don't have.  Not feeling very hopeful now though as I was in Jan.  Thanks for hosting this year - I still think it's fun.  :)<br/>
