                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, sorry about my late response...just wanted to let you know that I <br/>
have found 5 of KazooDog boxes (that's out of 6 that I tried). I've <br/>
found Up Up and Away, Asylum Lake Preserve, Watch out for Flying <br/>
Saucers, and one of the West Lake Nature Preserve. (There were two at <br/>
that last one, but mosquitos and dark kept us from finding it!) We <br/>
couldn't find the Al Sabo Land Preserve one, although I'm told that my <br/>
partner later found it on his own. I haven't tried any of the others <br/>
that were mentioned on the list, but just thought I'd throw my <br/>
experiences in. Sorry that your mini vacation was a bust!<br/>
