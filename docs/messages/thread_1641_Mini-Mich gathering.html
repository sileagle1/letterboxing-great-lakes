of us nutty enough to have been letterboxing in the heat and <br/>
humidity this past Saturday in Muskegon!  So much work goes into <br/>
planning, carving, hiding, clue-writing and hosting - And all of it <br/>
is simply for our pleasure!  To all placers everywhere - a <br/>
big "Thank You!"<br/>
<br/>
Even though it was a last minute trip for us (along with the <br/>
frustration of not remembering the pack of clues we ran off!) - <br/>
Spring Chick and fellow boxers made it so worth while.  We had to be <br/>
in eastern Indiana by dinner and were only able to box in the <br/>
morning, but were able to visit Keltic Kara's first box in Muskegon <br/>
Preserve on the way out of town.  Interesting side note - as we were <br/>
inking her stamp, the famous Blue Angels flew over in formation <br/>
directly overhead!  A little deafening, but certainly a first for us <br/>
to be divebombed by aircraft rather than mosquitos- I guess the rest <br/>
of Muskegon were watching the air show while we were happily <br/>
letterboxing! <br/>
<br/>
We missed the rain, but had black clouds and thunder hovering <br/>
overhead as we were boxing on the run at one last stop before high <br/>
tailing it to Indiana - Azobox's "Asylum Birds"!  I think it was <br/>
appropriate that we barely escaped there before being commited on <br/>
charges of letterboxing lunacy!  But, we did prevail! We found and <br/>
loved the stamp (even if we were bad and didn't follow the <br/>
directions like we were supposed to!)<br/>
Thanks again to all who made our Saturday a relaxing, enjoyable <br/>
wonderful day!<br/>
<br/>
OOHH -a personal thanks to Dragon for the PI - and not the itchy <br/>
kind!<br/>
