myself, you know, so thank you to SpringChick, firstly for conceiving <br/>
of such a fun game to entertain all of us through the winter (and <br/>
spring) months, for picking 30 excellent words over those last 4+ <br/>
months, and for putting up with any gripes that have been made about <br/>
how YOU run YOUR game (let's not open that can o'worms again)!  Thank <br/>
you also to my wife, Gray Rabbit, for making me modify my list so that <br/>
we wouldn't have so many identical words (he he he)!  Godspeed to all <br/>
of you fighting for 2nd and 3rd (sounds like those spots will get <br/>
filled soon - I personally know of two 'boxers within spittin' <br/>
distance).  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!!<br/>
