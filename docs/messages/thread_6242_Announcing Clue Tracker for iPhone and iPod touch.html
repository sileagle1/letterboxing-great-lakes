Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to announce the availability of Clue Tracker for the iPhone and iPod touch.  Clue Tracker is a location-aware mobile app that makes it easy to find and use letterbox clues. Learn more here:  http://cluetracker.pearlcrescent.com/<br/>
<br/>
Clue Tracker's features include:<br/>
    * Find nearby boxes based on your current location.<br/>
    * Find boxes near a location that you enter<br/>
        (partial address or zip code).<br/>
    * Access letterbox listings from both Atlas Quest and LbNA.<br/>
    * For boxes listed on LbNA, view clues within Clue Tracker<br/>
        and optionally save them for offline use (in this version,<br/>
        Atlas Quest search results are opened in Safari).<br/>
<br/>
The cost for the app is $4.99 which includes upgrades.  The ability to view Atlas Quest box information and clues in the app is coming soon.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we love to receive feedback and suggestions so please send them to us via this page:  http://cluetracker.pearlcrescent.com/feedback/<br/>
