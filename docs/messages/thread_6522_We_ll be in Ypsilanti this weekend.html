Definitely look for mystery boxes in Washtenaw County.<br/>
If you are at Rolling Hills, be sure to look for Blue Diamond boxes in <br/>
the area (Potluck Picnic is one of my favorites).<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to the hands-on museum, be aware that it is very crazy <br/>
if it is a rainy morning.  When we were hiding the boxes, it took us <br/>
almost an **HOUR** to hide the one box.<br/>
<br/>
Also, at the museum, #3 is missing its stamp so it has been pulled until <br/>
Mysterina can recarve it.  The other 4 are still in place.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun wherever you go!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the info! We are planning to stop at Potluck Picnic, as well as a couple others nearby before heading to Rolling Hills. I've tried figuring out the mystery boxes. Got 2 of them figured out, but not the other 2. Not sure if we'll do those or not.<br/>
<br/>
Our plans are to be outside until it's horribly cold. In that case, we'd head to the museum.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
