                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now Be Nice!  The alleged reason Indiana is going to change time is purely<br>
an economic one;  seems Indiana has to accomodate the out-of-staters who<br>
don't know what time it is HERE.  And since we want YOUR dollars, we have<br>
to change.<br>
<br>
We already have two time zones here.  I wish the entire state would adopt<br>
Central Time and spring forward and fall back, but I don't think that's<br>
going to happen.  I've never had a problem knowing what time it is<br>
Indiana, and I lived in Central DST for 16 years.  Most of Indiana is on<br>
Chicago time in the Spring, and New York in the Fall.<br>
<br>
I say, just pick one!  Give it 5 years.  If it is a complete economic<br>
failure, address again after the grand experiment.  Politicians and their<br>
whiny political rhetoric is non-productive and boring.<br>
<br>
my two cents and some time wasted,<br>

I live in NW Indiana where we are always on Chicago time, and I never know <br>
what time it is in Indiana.<br>
To add to the confusion, Michigan is just down the road, and it is always on <br>
New York time.... so we have to think about 3 time zones to go anywhere within <br>
an hour's drive - it can be very confusing.... maybe that is why the band <br>
Chicago wrote the song, "Does Anyone Know What Time It Is (does anyone care?)"<br>
<br>
Sounds like a good letterbox series to me!<br>
<br>
The Linus Project Day was not only productive, but lots of FUN!<br>
Thanks for including me - hope to see you at many more events in the future, <br>
and hopefully when the weather cooperates, I will find more of your boxes in <br>
the area (I am a winter wimp! and getting worse!).<br>
<br>
Now, what time IS IT here?<br>
