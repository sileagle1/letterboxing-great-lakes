will be........   "Wandering in Wonderland".   Carvers are encouraged to<br>
create stamps based on "Alice in Wonderland" or "Through the Looking Glass".<br>
(Martini Man has already decided he wants to do the Mad Hatter).  I'll<br>
maintain a list of attendees and the planned stamps/boxes on the Gathering<br>
website (a basic version will be ready tonight).  If you already have an<br>
image in mind that you'd like to carve, just send me an email and I'll add<br>
it to the list.  If you want to carve a stamp unrelated to the theme, that's<br>
fine also.   Hopefully the weather gods will be kinder that day than the<br>
BINGO gods have been to us!  At the rate we're going we'll have our list<br>
done in August....<br>
