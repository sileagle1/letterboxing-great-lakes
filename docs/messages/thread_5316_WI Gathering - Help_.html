                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went today to plant the boxes that were sent to me.  Unfortunately<br>
that leaves about a dozen boxes still in the possession of their<br>
creators.  I tried to contact my helper but have not heard back from<br>
them.  If anyone is going up there or can go up early on Friday and<br>
plant the remaining boxes, please let me know ASAP so we can have the<br>
remaining boxes shipped to you.  I have all the clues to send you to<br>
plant the boxes quickly.<br>
<br>
If I don't hear from anyone by Monday afternoon, I will have the<br>
remaining boxes sent to me yet and try to plant them early Sat.<br>
morning before the gathering begins.<br>
