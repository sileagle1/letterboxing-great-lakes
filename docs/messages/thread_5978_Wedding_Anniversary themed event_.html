event in Chicago to celebrate 6 months before our actual wedding.  We <br>
have about 15-20 wedding-themed stamps that we could provide for your <br>
event if you want.  They're all in a box somewhere, but I can dig it out <br>
for you.  Our event was listed on AQ, so you can check there for more info:<br>
