She is leading the Rabbit family in the actual Bingo game.....waiting on just one word for both a 10-spot and a straight line.... AND she is leading us in the SpringChick game as well. We are waiting in anticipation to see if her strategy of choosing the cutest-sounding, funniest-sounding, or most girly-sounding applicable words from the list actually pays off in the end though! It could still be anyone's game (as anyone who has played in the past well knows! :-)<br/>
Good luck to everyone else out there...expecting to hear a Bingo from someone any day now! And thanks again to Family of 6..... we are having so much fun!<br/>
