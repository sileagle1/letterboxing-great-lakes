We've had several inches of snow overnight here in Michigan and it <br/>
is still coming down heavy.  A good day to carve.  Of course my mind <br/>
is spinning through possibilities for a "Mo' Music in Motown" box <br/>
for this year's gathering, but also I have a few other projects <br/>
brewing.<br/>
<br/>
One is a project I would like to put out to the members of this <br/>
list.  It is actually an idea I got from another letterboxing list I <br/>
am a member of and thought it would be fun to do here since many of <br/>
us are whiling away winter hours carving.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Great Lakes Letterbox Exchange:<br/>
<br/>
What it is:  A themed letterbox swap among members of the Great <br/>
Lakes Letterbox group.<br/>
<br/>
How it works:  Each person interested in participating is given the <br/>
name of another participant.  They then create a letterbox based on <br/>
the theme to send to that person.  The recipient is responsible for <br/>
choosing a hiding spot, planting the box, writing and posting clues <br/>
and providing ongoing box maintenance.  In return, each participant <br/>
will receive a box from another player whose identity will remain a <br/>
mystery until the box arrives in the mail.  The person you are <br/>
creating a box for will not be the same person you receive a box <br/>
from.<br/>
<br/>
A few ground rules:<br/>
<br/>
1) You must agree to meet the dates for the swap.  Dates Are As <br/>
Follows:<br/>
<br/>
Submit theme ideas: January 22-23<br/>
Voting on the theme: January 25-29<br/>
Sign-ups: January 29-February 5<br/>
Info to participants re: who they are creating for: February 15<br/>
Boxes mailed to recipients: April 15<br/>
Boxes planted and clues posted: June 1<br/>
<br/>
2) The box you create should fit the theme of the swap.<br/>
<br/>
3) You will be sending your assigned recipient a complete letterbox -<br/>
- stamp and logbook in a weatherproof container, labeled as a <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
4) Stamps must be hand-carved -- you do not need to be a stamp-<br/>
carver extraordinaire -- crude and/or primitive stamps are sometimes <br/>
the best finds...  but the stamp must be hand-carved.<br/>
<br/>
5) To make it easier to hide the boxes, please try to keep <br/>
containers no larger than about 6" x 6" in size.<br/>
<br/>
6) Boxes must be planted in traditional letterbox style -- they <br/>
cannot be turned into Postal Letterboxes and should involve a modest <br/>
hike (at least a 1/4 mile).<br/>
<br/>
7) Clues can be any style, but to ensure that nobody's efforts just <br/>
lay in hiding, never again to be found, they should not be total <br/>
mystery boxes -- clues should give at minimum a city and site name.  <br/>
Beyond that, creativity and conundrum are encouraged.<br/>
<br/>
8) Boxes must be posted to the letterboxing.org clue site once they <br/>
have been planted and clues must be accessible either at <br/>
letterboxing.org or on a personal web site which does not require <br/>
membership or a password for access.  If clues are on a personal web <br/>
site, they still must be listed at letterboxing.org, with a link to <br/>
your web site.<br/>
<br/>
9) Acknowledgement must be made in the clues as to whom the creator <br/>
of the box is.<br/>
<br/>
10) Anyone who is a member of this group is eligible to participate, <br/>
regardless of geographic location.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Theme?  I am open to suggestions...  I will take ideas over the <br/>
weekend and then post a poll of all suggestions received.  The poll <br/>
will be open to voting next week and the theme receiving the most <br/>
votes will be it.  ONCE A THEME HAS BEEN SET, I will take sign-ups <br/>
(watch for further details on the information to send me when <br/>
signing up).<br/>
<br/>
So...  First step -- get me your theme ideas before Sunday at <br/>
midnight.  You can either send them to me private e-mail or post the <br/>
list (suggesting a theme does not obligate you to participate).<br/>

I love this idea! I've already emailed my theme idea (wildlife native to the Great Lakes <br/>

How about the theme "Buried in the snow"?  Seems appropriate for today<br/>
for all of us!  I imagine carving stamps that show an image of the<br/>
LBer we are carving for buried in a ton of snow (i.e. a Dragon buried<br/>
in snow, a SpringChick buried in snow, a WI Hiker buried in snow, etc.<br/>
and of course a Delirium buried in snow down south!)<br/>

&gt; &gt; What it is:  A themed letterbox swap among members of the Great<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I love this idea! I've already emailed my theme idea (wildlife native to <br/>

Yep!  I was hoping you would mention the World's Largest Rubber Stamp, Doodle Bug.  All <br/>
the themes are good, and whatever doesn't get picked as "official" - I think we'll be seeing <br/>
boxes related to the remaining themes.  I can't wait to hunt for that Rubber Stamp.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - I just got a Dremel drill for engraving stamps for my birthday from my dh.  My first <br/>
attempt is pretty good, if I say so myself.  I will try another design with a larger bit.  I think <br/>
it'll work better on harder carving material, so I am going to find some pink pearls.  Watch <br/>
out, folks!  Summer will be here before we know it!  Yippee!<br/>
