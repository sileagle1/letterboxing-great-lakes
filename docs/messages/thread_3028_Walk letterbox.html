there is a family from OH that came accross "Walk" letterbox located in <br/>

have any idea.  If so you can contact him at jimmyc8@cox.net.  The <br/>

I wonder if they mean the Trash to Treasure box?  I'll<br/>

for the Wee Walkers (both The Pirates and Wee Walkers<br/>

their boxes a month or so ago).<br/>
