letterboxing fun for all.  I was reading messages from the big list and <br>
there is a family from OH that came accross "Walk" letterbox located in <br>
Parma OH.  They are trying to find out who's box it is.  Does anyone <br>
have any idea.  If so you can contact him at jimmyc8@cox.net.  The <br>
accidental find has gotten him and his family involed in letterboxing<br>

Thanks everyone! Have a safe weekend!<br>

I wonder if they mean the Trash to Treasure box?  I'll<br>
send him an email to see if this is the one they<br>
found, since I think I might have contact information<br>
for the Wee Walkers (both The Pirates and Wee Walkers<br>
are relatively newer letterboxing families from what I<br>
can tell; we had emailed the Wee Walkers about one of<br>
their boxes a month or so ago).<br>
