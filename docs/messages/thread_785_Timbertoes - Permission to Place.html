I'll "ride" on your permission (If you don't mind) and<br/>
I'll be very discreet when placing boxes :) !!<br/>
Thistle<br/>
Oh - and drop me a line if you have and conflicts with<br/>
our lunch date on the 25th :)<br/>
<br/>
I also subscribe to the "forgiveness rather than<br/>
permission" stance, <br/>
however, I did have a really good experience asking<br/>
for permission <br/>
not long ago.  I've already mentioned it here, but to<br/>
recap:  We <br/>
wanted to plant a series in a WI county park and, at<br/>
the prodding of <br/>
my husband, called the county headquarters for<br/>
permission.  The <br/>
director was very interested in the hobby after I<br/>
described it and <br/>
gave me blanket permission to plant in any of our<br/>
county's parks.  I <br/>
sent him the clues as well so he could see how<br/>
harmless the hobby <br/>
was.  He, in turn, sent a memo to all his park<br/>
employees with a <br/>
glowing tribute to a hobby that would encourage hiking<br/>
and the number <br/>
of park visitors...  he also attached the clues to the<br/>
memo.  It must <br/>
have been effective because those logbooks are full of<br/>
thumbprint <br/>
stamps, signatures and commercial stamps from families<br/>
that have <br/>
tried the hobby.  <br/>
<br/>
Given that response, I feel pretty comfortable placing<br/>
without asking <br/>
first in most cases.<br/>
