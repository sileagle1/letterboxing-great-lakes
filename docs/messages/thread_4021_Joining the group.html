requests/approvals -- usually within a couple hours of receiving notice.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally we get busy with other parts of our lives and it may take<br/>
a bit longer to approve.<br/>
<br/>
The request in question was hung up in the Yahoo-world somehow because<br/>
when I saw the query on the GL list, I also saw the membership request<br/>
(and, curiously, the request was dated 4/29!)<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, if a request for membership does not include a<br/>
note saying why the person wants to join, the request is denied. This<br/>
is to prevent non-letterboxing or automated membership requests.<br/>
