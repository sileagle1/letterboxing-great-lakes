&gt; The Bristol web page was updated this morning with all the 2009 information. I'm currently boxin' in the Devil's Lake area, and had to leave quickly this morning, so I didn't have time to write a story about Escher and Sir Tim, but the clues are there and won't change with the story. I hope to write a story when I get home.<br/>
