been doing a lot of testing and now this morning I am able to login <br>
and access the clue pages.<br>
<br>
Not sure if everything is working 100% yet as I did not try to post a <br>
new box.  I am sure there will official word from Choi soon and I will <br>
pass along anything to that effect that comes across his blog or the <br>
big list for the benefit of those who do not read those sites.<br>
<br>
Everybody -- go boxing!<br>
