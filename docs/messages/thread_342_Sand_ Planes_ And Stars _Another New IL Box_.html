<br>
I didn't post this on the new box notification for the big list, but<br>
if any of you happen to be <br>
out around the North Shore of Chicago and have 20 minutes to spare...<br>
<br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?<br>
boxnum=8823&boxname=Planes,%20Sand,%20And%20Stars<br>
<br>
I planted it in honor of my oldest friend's birthday*, which is<br>
today, and which he is <br>
spending fixing planes in the Qatar desert (he's in the Air Force).<br>
So, if you find it, it would <br>
be great if you could write a little happy birthday or other<br>
supportive message -- he's a <br>
long, long, long way from home, and I'd love to send him the book<br>
when it fills up a little.<br>
<br>
Happy Thursday!<br>
:)<br>

*Note: When I describe the man as my "oldest friend," I mean there is<br>
not anyone who has <br>
been my friend for a longer period of time, not that I do not have<br>
any friends older than <br>
32. (What with the now-known percentage of English majors and writing<br>
teachers on this <br>
list, I feel I should clarify that.  ;)  )<br>
