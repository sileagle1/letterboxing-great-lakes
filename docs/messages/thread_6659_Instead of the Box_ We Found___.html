Today, I found a blue heart-shaped diamond approximately 2x2 inches.  Hmmm...how many carats would that be?  OK, I think it's really a very nice glass paper weight.  Someone left it inside a letterbox which I found today.  I search the beaches and I collect heart-shaped rocks, so this was a real treat for me today.  I think I will put it inside my fairy house.  Fairy house?  That's another story......<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I almost always find some fishing something.  A bober or a lure.  And Tat2Bob found a hole tackle box once, thought for a second we had found a G-box.  And my fav find was a hair clip that at the time I didn't really want but Robert picked it up for me for when my hair comes grow long again.  And I use it on my scarfs every day.  I love that man oh mine.  Always thinking ahead.  We always find TONS of garbage.  I try to pick up what I can but there is only on many bags we can lug around.<br>
