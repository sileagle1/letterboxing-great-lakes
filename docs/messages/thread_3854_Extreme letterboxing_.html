But I have done things I shouldn't have, that risked my life for nothing more than nice scenery, a solitary trailride or for a letterbox. Looking back on it, I realize it was stupid and dangerous.  But it's so hard to hold back the drive when you've gone so far for a box and then come to what might seem like a surmountable obstacle.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me, someone a few years ago posted about how they had to be rescued from being trapped in mud by police and fire personnel.  And recently someone encountered a crazy man that attacked her dog (after his dog started a fight with her dog.)  I found myself trying to get "just one more" in total darkness in an area where a dead body was found two weeks later.  So you not only have dangerous terrain, you have dangerous people and animals to consider as well.<br/>
<br/>
When you go on a hike, is it always in areas where you have cell service?  Do you even carry a cell phone with you?  Do you know exactly where you are and how to tell someone how to find you?  Does anyone know exactly where you are?  Would they notice that you didn't come home?<br/>
<br/>
My point is: don't let the drive get the best of you.  Or, at least (as Trail tracker did) let someone know where you are and what you are doing BEFORE you take a risk.  At least that way you don't have to wait for someone to notice you're missing or happen along and see you before you can get help.  On some trails, that might take days or more!  A little planning and notifying someone in advance could save your life if something happens.<br/>
<br/>
If you know you're going for a difficult box, take along at least one other person that can pull you to safety and could go for help if you're walking up the stream and slip and crack your head on a rock (or fall down a cliff and break your leg or whatever.)<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a responsible thing to do to warn people about what they might encounter during the hunt.  It's much easier to prepare or choose not to hunt BEFORE you get out there and find out you're in over your head or let the thrill of the hunt over ride good judgment. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure no one wants to have someone die or get seriously injured looking for their letterbox.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is an interesting thread and there have been some very good points made in regards to the poll that was posted.<br/>
<br/>
I am of the opinion that every person has different limits and different perspectives in regards to what is or is not pushing their limits, and thus not all letterboxes are for all letterboxers.  Any letterboxer should be willing at any point in their quest to turn around if they feel uncomfortable in any way, whether that be terrain, weather conditions, people, animals, etc.  I realize that the box is the prize at the end of the journey, but in the end it is just a stamp in a box and is never worth taking a risk that puts you in danger or even outside of your comfort zone if you don't wish it to.<br/>
<br/>
With this in mind, I don't feel it is necessary for the clues to tell me what I am going to be up against and in most instances would prefer not to know ahead of time.  Many placers do choose to provide warnings and detailed terrain information in their clues and that is their option as it is their box, but to say that placers *should* provide this information infringes on an important aspect of the game for many people.  The *unknown* is part of the soul of letterboxing and a letterboxer would do well to adopt the Boy Scout motto of always being prepared.  I always wear hiking-appropriate clothing and footwear when letterboxing -- i.e. no shorts or sandals, footwear that can get wet or covered with mud without breaking my heart.  To me this just seems logical, this is letterboxing, an outdoor activity with roots in hiking.  Likewise there are certain safety-related items one should carry in their pack at all times, even if a particular hike seems like just a quick walk in the park<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
The more information a person includes in the clues, the more people become dependent on the clues/placer to guide their decision by supplying accurate information.  What is accurate information?  Can a placer provide information that is accurate -- that fits the perceptions of all future seekers, that accounts for all variations in season and weather, that anticipates who else may be at the park on the same day, etc.?  Sure, some things seem clear-cut...  you will have to cross a raging river on a 6-inch fallen tree bridge...  or wait is this so cut-and-dried as it may seem?  This may be the the obvious to the placer given the route he took and the time of year he was there, but is there information the placer did not encounter?  Could I walk a half-mile upstream and find that the raging river is just a placid stream 2-3" deep?  Or perhaps the placer was there in the spring and the run-off water was high and raging, but when I come in the fall, it is a mere trickle of water.  And <br/>
what is the definition of "raging river" anyway?  I daresay we do not all define that to the same degree.  Had I read about the raging river in the clues (based on the planter's experiences and perceptions) I may have unnecessarily avoided a box that would not have been beyond my limits. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the opposite is true -- if placer Joe is always really good about giving this type of information in his clues, and his newest box fails to provide any warnings, I may assume that this box is tame and well within my limits.  Upon reaching a part of the hike that really is not comfortable for me, I may be tempted to push on thinking that if it was so bad, Joe would have warned me.  Perhaps Joe was there during different weather conditions, a different season, etc. or perhaps major trail damage or rerouting has occurred since he wrote the clues, or perhaps I have misinterpreted the clues and am not even on the same trail as he was.<br/>
<br/>
And where do you draw the line as to what information should be revealed and what is not important enough to mention?  It will always be based on perspective.  Do you say that one should warn of raging rivers or wild boar colonies, but does not need to mention the sea of ragweed or crater-sized beehive along the trail?  And what if perhaps I am deathly allergic to bee stings or ragweed, but not intimidated by swiftly-moving water or wild boars?  Yes, I know these are extreme examples, but I think the point becomes obvious -- there is no way to cover everything that will be important to all seekers.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, it comes down to the personal responsibility of the seeker.  Whether to look for a box is a personal decision based on the information given in the clues.  If you feel a particular placer or box does not give enough information in the clues as to the terrain, etc. don't attempt that box.  If you do go and encounter a situation that was not spelled out in the clues and makes you uncomfortable or encroaches upon your personal limits, turn around.   <br/>

Just my 2 cents...<br/>

This is what we love about you!...You are always able to give this <br/>
group a perspective that makes one think beyond the obvious easy <br/>
answer...Let's just say we really appreciate that "you see the other <br/>
side of the coin"!...And that's priceless!<br/>

this very serious Email.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I chuckled because every year someone gets lost on a side of a mountain and  <br/>
the rescue teams all go looking BUT at least everyone knows why that person <br/>
got  lost -- they were trying to make it to the top of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Every year the coast guard goes out to find a ship, but at least everyone  <br/>
knows why that ship is out in the water -- they were fishing, or out for  <br/>
enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
What excuse to we have?<br/>
<br/>
"Excuse me sir why in the world are you out here??"<br/>
<br/>
"uhhhhh, I was looking for a box."<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, kinda hit me as funny. Though, personally I am more in the extreme  <br/>
category myself (did you all know that there is a letterbox in Antarctica ??)  <br/>
but with 4 young'ins it will be a decade or more before we can do any real (8  <br/>
mile plus) hikes.<br/>
