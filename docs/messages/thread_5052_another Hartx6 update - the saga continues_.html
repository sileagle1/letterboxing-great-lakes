                    <div class="plaintext-content">Matt went back to the ER this morning after an all nighter of severe <br/>
pain and vomiting.  He swears it is a kidney stone...but he has never <br/>
had pain like this with it.  I suppose it may be worse due to the <br/>
pneumonia.  He had another CAT scan done this morning to see about a <br/>
kidney stone.  The ER staff told him that there weren't any stones.  <br/>
SOOO, that takes us back to square one with the source of the pain.  <br/>
This makes it a bit more scary.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon around 4, the drs office called (urologist) and asked if <br/>
someone could come pick up some medicine for Matt to take before his <br/>
appt. tomorrow.  She also said that the dr didn't want Matt to <br/>
eat/drink after midnight in case he decided to do surgery to remove the <br/>
stone.  At that point, I said what the ER had told Matt and she said <br/>
that the results weren't back yet but the preliminary results show that <br/>
there is a stone there.  That is potentially good news.  We go to see <br/>
the urologist at 8:30 tomorrow morning.  We will hopefully know by mid-<br/>
morning what is happening.<br/>
<br/>
Continue to pray!<br/>
