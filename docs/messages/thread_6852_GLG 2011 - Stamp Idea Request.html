                    <div class="plaintext-content">the eggman would be great!  for event stamps, we're going to need characters from beatles' songs and the yellow submarine movie.  there's also a mystery hunt where we'll need some special stamps, and i'd prefer those to be from people who won't be able to attend, to avoid spoilers.<br/>
<br/>
this is going to be difficult to be switching back and forth between AQ and LbGLK, so I'd like to ask that if anyone would care to carve, please let me know on AQ, as my piddly msntv at home can't access yahoo.<br/>
