weekend that I thought might be useful to newbies and unnewbies alike.<br>
<br>
We were looking for more hiding places at camp this weekend, where <br>
there are wonderful huge junipers with their multiple twisted trunks <br>
providing a plethora (love that word!) of hiding places.  As it was <br>
dusky in the woods, I had a small flashlight with me.  When I shined <br>
it into one "hole" around the back of a tree to check out how deep it <br>
was, Papillon noticed she could see the light from the front.  It <br>
struck me that this would be a good way to check the visibility of a <br>
hiding spot from different angles, to use the flashlight test.  Hope <br>
this helps!<br>
