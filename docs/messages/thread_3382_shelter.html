we are bringing a small electric heater.  I don't know if it will do <br/>
any good, and I don't know how we will fit 60 people around it (huddle <br/>
up for warmth, everyone!), but I guess we will see.  But I was kind of <br/>
assuming that the shelter was just a roof with no sides.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, here's the midnight scoop!  By the end of this afternoon the sun <br/>
was shining brightly in clear skies.  We just got home from a party and <br/>
all roads were clear, even though we got 11"-12" in the area.  Should <br/>
be no trouble driving in the morning.  I will certainly brimg a camera <br/>
to document the die-hards who show up for a gathering after a foot of <br/>
snow!  Hopefully Dragon got out there later today or will do so early <br/>
tomorrow morning.  I'm sure there will be plenty of boxes to find and <br/>
exchanges to make for the hardy winter boxer.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing you at the park tomorrow (actually today)!<br/>

P.S.  Waiting to hear news from the Brat Pack and happy to hear the <br/>
Cottontails made it into December before the bunnies wanted out.<br/>
