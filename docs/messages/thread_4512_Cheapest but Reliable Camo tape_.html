&gt; Even if the cloth stuff does take on some moisture, it's outside <br/>
the box.<br/>
&gt; And, as ScoutDog said, the cloth stuff picks up the dirt and debris<br/>
&gt; surrounding it because of its texture. Hence, more stealthy.<br/>

&gt; &gt; WOW!  I never expected to have as many or as varied of responses <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; &gt; this topic!  I think I will stop by the army store tomorrow and<br/>
&gt; maybe wal-mart.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks so much for the advice everyone!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; To think, a year ago, I never knew camo tape existed, much less <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; there were so many textures, colors, patterns, varieties of<br/>
&gt; tackiness, etc!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I like the cloth-type ones I've seen in use, because they seem <br/>
like <br/>
&gt; &gt; the mold to the boxes better and blend in better.  I'll be on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; hunt for these!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My only real concern with the clothy type tapes is wether they <br/>
absorb <br/>
&gt; &gt; water and get moldy or anything like that.  Has anyone had a <br/>
problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; with that?<br/>
