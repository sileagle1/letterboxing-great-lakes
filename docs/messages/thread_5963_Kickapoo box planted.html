At the gathering, Atomic Beans asked if we would plant their IL State Parks Kickapoo box.  This morning Flying Dragon, the dogs, and I packed into the car and headed over to Kickapoo to plant this box.  We had a lovely hike, not too warm and surprisingly not buggy considering that the trail passes right between the Middle Fork River and several ponds (with water visible through the trees on both sides of the trail for a large part of the hike).  Tatsu found some really gross (and kind of fresh looking) feces to roll in.  He also decided to go over the steep bank to go down and see the river before we managed to stop him.  We thought we might have lost him for a moment, it took him several tries to climb back up the bank far enough for FD to grab his collar and hoist him back over.  Aina was glad that he managed to get back up, because the only other option would have been to push her over the edge and slide down on our butts so that we could walk<br>

river and the canoes -- funny memories now, but that trip almost <br>
resulted in the end of Atomic Beans... :P  Anyway, it sounds like an <br>
eventful day.<br>

Thanks again,<br>
