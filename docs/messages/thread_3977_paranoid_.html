Most likely they were watching you, but probably nothing more than that. We are a curious sort, you know!<br/>

 something about this hobby makes me overly so.  Even out hunting, I <br/>
 start thinking that everyone is being overly suspicious of <br/>
 everything.  Are we standing in this one place too long?  Are they <br/>
 looking at the paper I'm holding in my hand?  Are they wondering why <br/>
 I have that big backpack for this not too long walk?  And on and on.<br/>
<br/>
 But, today was something else.  I think I had legitimate reason to be <br/>
 paranoid.  I was out doing some planting today.  I was in a cemetery <br/>
 that is a pretty visible place, but I don't think I was looking <br/>
 overly suspicious.   I think I looked like I was just walking around <br/>
 looking at the stones.  But, I was SURE these people were watching my <br/>
 every move while I was there.  I was right by their fence line for a <br/>
 little while and she came out of the house right then "looking at a <br/>
 flower bed by the fence".   While I was there, I made a special point <br/>
 to stop and read lots of stone.   I was pretty far away from them <br/>
 while I was doing the actual plant and I don't think they could see <br/>
 me put the box away, so I'm not too worried they'll go find it.   I <br/>
 think they were kind of watching the whole time I was there, <br/>
 though.   As I was leaving the place, I think the guy got in his <br/>
 truck, drove around and followed me.    The road I was on was split <br/>
 so that to go north, you have to go south first and turn around.  We <br/>
 both did that, then both turned left on the next main road.  I turned <br/>
 into another cemetery that was around the corner (just in case he was <br/>
 watching me, I figured it would add credibility to my first visit. He <br/>
 bypassed the cemetery and kept going.   I turned around and was <br/>
 pulling back out on the main road.  As I was doing so, he came back <br/>
 from the other direction, so he obviously turned around somewhere <br/>
 back down the road.  He then proceeded to turn down his road and went <br/>
 back to his house.  He did not have time to go anywhere else on this <br/>
 little trek.   He didn't drive into the first cemetery at all before <br/>
 he went home.  Isn't that weird?  I am being paranoid, or do you <br/>
 think he was following me or that he was planning on coming to the <br/>
 first cemetery to see what I was doing, but I left before he had a <br/>
 chance?  Or am I completely crazy and whatever he was doing had <br/>
 nothing to do with me?<br/>
<br/>
 Does anyone else get these paranoid feelings when you are planting or hunting?<br/>

You're probably right!  I went back there today mostly because I <br/>
decided that the clues and trek through the cemetery weren't in depth <br/>
enough and I needed to add several more steps to the adventure.  But, <br/>
also because I was worried about those people.  The box is still <br/>
there, so I probably was just being overly paranoid!<br/>
<br/>
(Anyway, as a side note, if anyone in SE Michigan happened to notice <br/>
the clues for my new box planted yesterday and if you printed the <br/>
clues anytime before 7:30pm today, go back in and reprint them!  Or I <br/>
guess you consider the earlier clues a bonus short-cut, if you <br/>
prefer.  But, the longer clues are more fun. )<br/>
