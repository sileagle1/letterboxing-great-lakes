<br/>
<br/>
  Has anyone heard of any whereabouts or updates concerning the person <br/>
  that goes by Flying J? I've attempted a box of his that said it was <br/>
  still active, but it hasn't been found for over a year and as far as I <br/>
  know, there's been no maintenance on it for a while, if at all. I've <br/>
  tried contacting this person about the box, done other boxes by the <br/>
  same person and left comments too about needed maintenance, but no <br/>
  responses at all. So, I was curious to know if anyone's heard anything <br/>
  about this person moving or whatnot as it's a little disconcerting.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds nice, but that would be too late in the day for me..........I'd have<br/>
too much commuter traffic heading south down 355 and 53 getting home that<br/>
late in the afternoon.  I always go early in the morning, right around when<br/>
Geimer Nursery opens there on Rte 53.<br/>
<br/>
I'll check around downstream for the Buffalo Creek Pooh box..........I can't<br/>
imagine that it would have survived the water from this winter/spring and<br/>
not have floated away.  But, with luck, it may be caught someplace<br/>
downstream and be salvageable.  "Bushwackin' R Us."  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'll bring a spare camo lock 'n' lock box for Virgo.  I've also been meaning<br/>
to search for some box that's in a "haunted" cemetery in the area, but never<br/>
got around to it.  May possibly have time to get all 3 things done before<br/>
Geimer opens and then go check out the plants being as how it's THAT time of<br/>
year.  Our neighborhood squirrels have requested that I plant another<br/>
hazelnut bush and Geimer often has nice good-sized ones f'sale.<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, I have to check on my own box in Long Grove too pretty<br/>
quick here.  SpringTime = MaintenanceTime.<br/>
