Ooh! Ooh! I know this one! :-)<br/>
<br/>
They're called "bubblers" because back in the day, <br/>
pretty much all of them in the area were manufactured <br/>
by Kohler and the brand name on them was "Bubbler" -- <br/>
the water bubbled up out of them -- so that's what <br/>
everyone called them. (Much like people use "Kleenex" <br/>
or "Band-Aid.") <br/>
<br/>

Here's more for y'all (you guys):<br/>
<br/>
When a new subdivision goes up and the developers build a pond for run-off water, do <br/>
you call it a "retention" pond or a "detention" pond?  My family calls it a detention pond, <br/>
but I don't see myself ever calling it that.  Detention is where the undisciplined children go <br/>

My mom is from Wisconsin and it would drive me nuts when she would refer to an ice <br/>
cream bar (eskimo pie, or chocolate covered vanilla ice cream on a stick) as a paddle pop! I <br/>
never knew what she was talking about until she pointed it out one day!<br/>
<br/>
As for the pop/soda thing, we always called it Coke.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a new one we've argued at work recently. When we were kids, and you got pulled <br/>
behind a car in the snow, we always called it skeechin'. But apparently others call it <br/>
skitchin'. News to me.<br/>

And dont even get me started on south side Chicagoan terms...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For being a part-Polish girl from Cleveland, we never had paczkis before Lent began.  Maybe because my grandpa was the Pollack, and my Croatian grandma did the cooking?  I honestly don't recall ever hearing about them until maybe 5 years ago when the grocery stores started advertising them (grocery store or supermarket? :).  Polish flats....that's a new one to me, too.  But I knew the term "yatchsemaw" (that is nowhere near the correct spelling - per a website I found, this is closer:  JAK SIE MIEWA).  Means how are you, and I swear I'm not imagining this, but growing up as a kid (this would be late 70's, early 80's), I remember there being gimmicky car decorations that were a plastic hand on a suction cup that would wave and had "Jaksiemiewa" written on it.  <br/>
<br/>
Here in Cleveland it's pop.  I have a friend who for some reason says soda, and every time she does it I stare at her, because she's lived in Cleveland her whole life!  Do tree lawns exist outside of Ohio?  I know they don't in New Jersey (I was friends in college with a Jersey boy - we used to have fun teasing him about our Ohio colloquialisms).<br/>
<br/>
Evidently another Cleveland thing is to end our sentences with prepositions.  IE, "Where are you going to?"  "Where is my coat at?"  Other people think this is odd....? :)<br/>

Mmmmmmm, paczki! :)<br/>
<br/>
But not the ones sold in the grocery stores (why are they so big?), <br/>
the ones homemade by my Polish grandmother (and now by her kids and <br/>
grandkids).  They are much smaller than the store-bought ones, more <br/>
the size of a racquetball.  And she didn't fill them -- you just put <br/>
some jam on them if you wanted to.  Yum!  <br/>
<br/>
The same can be said for pasties, in my opinion -- much better when <br/>
they are of the homemade variety.  I'll eat them at a restaurant if <br/>
I haven't had one in awhile, but those typically pale in comparison <br/>
to the ones my mom makes!  <br/>
<br/>
Jill of TJ-Mich, who wonders why Paczki and Pasties, two of her <br/>
favorite foods, look (but not sound) so much alike?<br/>

that now be Desperate Housewives?) houses and no trees are called "Happy<br/>
Houses."  Never heard them called that before moving to Muskegon.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, in Michigan we have the "Michigan left turns" which not only<br/>
is a term unique to here, but a whole driving procedure that catches people<br/>
not from the area off-guard and frantically trying to change lanes on busy<br/>
highways to make a left turn, which actually requires them to make a right<br/>
turn, and then quickly cross into the opposite lane and make a left turn -- <br/>
usually with at least two traffic lights to sit through in the process.<br/>
Can't believe some civil engineer actually got paid to come up with that<br/>
idea!<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to remember the name of this stuff my ex-mother-in-law used to<br/>
cook when Doglvrs mentioned Banket and the whole Dutch food thing.  It was<br/>
called "Stip" (that may not be the correct spelling).  It is a Dutch food<br/>
which consists of white bread, deep-fried in bacon grease and then smothered<br/>
with syrup and eaten for breakfast along with the 3 lbs. of bacon that you<br/>
fried to get the grease to cook the stip.  How's that for clogging the<br/>
arteries?<br/>

&gt; Or how about the tendency in Indiana for a subdivision<br/>
&gt; to be called an "addition". I had never heard of that<br/>
&gt; before moving here...<br/>

&gt; &gt; When a new subdivision goes up and the developers<br/>
&gt; &gt; build a pond for run-off water, do<br/>
&gt; &gt; you call it a "retention" pond or a "detention"<br/>

&gt; &gt; Detention is where the undisciplined children go<br/>

Anyway, it's jellied pigs feet, and from what I understand, a common Eastern Eurpoean dish in general.  Wasn't that appetizing, to go to my grandparents and see the dish of jellied pigs feet sitting on the kitchen table? :)  She used to also make vegetable soup with tripe in it.  They used to tell me the tripe pieces were chicken.  With my father, they just told him it was tripe, and he nodded and ate, never asking what exactly tripe was...<br/>

Wow, sounds like your family was quite willing to try new things!  My <br/>
family ate very basic fare - my dad is a meat and potatoes kind of <br/>
guy and since there were fourteen of us, Mom didn't get too <br/>
experimental.  Stuff like hamburgers, pot roast, turkey, mashed <br/>
potatoes and gravy - that sort of thing.  Mom would make us whatever <br/>
we wanted on our birthdays and my brothers and sisters would always <br/>
get mad when I asked for chicken and gravy over rice.  It was (and <br/>
still is) one of my favorite dishes.  Just ask my husband!  One of <br/>
the weirdest things we ate was peanut butter and pickle (sweet) <br/>
sandwiches that Mom made us for lunches.  She had them when growing <br/>
up in Chicago and passed it on to us.  I loved seeing the response <br/>
when my friends at school saw my lunch.  One friend even went so far <br/>
as to try it (she didn't finish).  Other than that, food was pretty <br/>
dull.  I even eat my hamburgers and hot dogs plain because it took so <br/>
long to get the ketchup and mustard passed around the table that it <br/>
wasn't worth waiting for.  Ahhhh, memories!<br/>

until her lousy brother told on her (and she had to eat them cold).<br/>

&gt; And those are just the ones I remember being cooked on a regular <br/>
basis.  Since moving out of my mother's house I also have added <br/>
dumplings (pot stickers) and pork buns (both Chinese dishes) to my <br/>
ethnic repetior.  <br/>

<br/>
Yep, we (after a certain age anyway) didn't have to eat EVERYTHING new my parents (mostly my dad) tried on us...but we did have to at least try it before we were allowed to say "eww, I don't like it."  And truthfully, liver and black eyed peas are the only two things that I really hated (and my mom would periodically make us eat liver anyway...even though it's about the only thing I can think of that will make me gag just thinking about eating it).<br/>
<br/>
One of the weirdest things we ate was peanut butter and pickle (sweet) sandwiches that Mom made us for lunches.  <br/>
<br/>
*I* like peanut butter and pickle sandwiches!  My mom had them growing up too (but she was from Syracuse, NY).  <br/>

-My all time favorite peanut butter sandwich was peanut butter, <br/>
mayonnaise and lettuce!  We also used to enjoy an artery clogging <br/>
dish called noodles and bacon.  It was noodles mixed with LOTS of <br/>
crumbled bacon, onion, and butter. It was sooo good, but ahh, it's <br/>
only a memory now! :-)<br/>

Not exactly ethnic, but certainly idiosyncratic: my mother made Bacon Lettuce <br/>
and Tomato sandwiches with peanut butter.  The peanut butter melts on the <br/>
warm toast--delicious.  When we go out, she'll still try to get a restaurant to <br/>
make them for her.  I've never been brave enough to request it, but that's the <br/>
way I make them at home.<br/>
