                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got back from our trip to MI/OH! First off a<br/>
huge THANK YOU to Team Rabbit for putting together<br/>
such a fabulous gathering! You guys ROCK! <br/>
<br/>
We set out on Friday and started at Aiden Lair to<br/>
finish the 3 boxes we missed before. Isn't it funny<br/>
that things that stumped you when you first started<br/>
letterboxing, are SO OBVIOUS after time goes by! We<br/>
had much better luck this time and quickly found the<br/>
three we missed before. We stopped by Hidden Lake<br/>
Gardens for the HLG stamp and the Big Rooster. After<br/>
that we went to Hell and back. We had so much fun<br/>
making "hell puns" such as "Geeze, we're crusin' down<br/>
the Highway to Hell!" We walked entirely too far, but<br/>
found it on the way back. <br/>
<br/>
Saturday's gathering was overwhelming and great!<br/>
People everywhere, and I didn't even meet everyone!<br/>
The Circus was never-ending.....just when I thought I<br/>
had them all...another bag appeared! The Circus was<br/>
simply amazing.....Thank you so much, Mark and Sue,<br/>
for bringing it with you. Please thank everyone who<br/>
took the time to carve such beautiful stamps! <br/>
<br/>
The WOM clues were great! Thanks to everyone who took<br/>
the time to be so devious! The CD's and the can o'<br/>
nuts were soooo clever! <br/>
<br/>
We went to Kensington on Sunday morning to find<br/>
Delirium's two boxes as a stretcher.....then went back<br/>
to Hudson Mills to get the Landmarks series and the<br/>
Mo' Mustangs. Team Rabbit, the Landmarks were divine<br/>
and Dragon, what can I say, ingenious! My door's a<br/>
little crooked, and Ugler's Mustang has<br/>
hydraulics.....<br/>
<br/>
We then headed to Maumee for Linda Fay's boxes. We<br/>
found Aunt Phoebe's Letterbox with no problems....but<br/>
the British Kept Coming...well, let's just say that we<br/>
had a missing fort, it was removed from the maps, and<br/>
we had no younglings to give us the obvious answer! We<br/>
did find our missing fort AFTER reading the back of a<br/>
sign.....and it was worth it! Great box, with a good<br/>
history lesson! <br/>
<br/>
This morning we went to Avon to find some Duck Tape.<br/>
We found no Duck Tape. I am heartbroken. I couldn't<br/>
speak for nearly 40 minutes. <br/>
<br/>
After I recovered, we went to Defiance to find a bunch<br/>
of new A-Team boxes....got the Dam Stamp 2 (we just<br/>
love those Dam Stamps!) and Light and Dark (very zen)<br/>
at Independence Dam and headed to the cemetery to find<br/>
Charmed, Alias, and Thunder Cats. The Alias box was a<br/>
doozy, as my Teva's didn't have enough traction to get<br/>
up the hill without sliding back down. We got the box<br/>
with the use of a stick, and Ugler. Then to Oxbow Lake<br/>
for the Star Wars series! The Rebels and the Empire<br/>
were found no prob, but a weirdo was hanging out near<br/>
Boba Fett....Ugler distrated him TWICE so I could get<br/>
the box out and back in. <br/>
<br/>
Tiptoe and Tonto: Glad to see you got the box planted!<br/>
I'm sooooo excited! I'm going to find it pretty<br/>
soon...<br/>
<br/>
It was a lot of fun, and great to meet everyone! It's<br/>
nice to put a face with a name and stamp! I'm probably<br/>
going to drag some newbie boxers to at least one of<br/>
the gatherings in the fall...so I hope to see everyone<br/>
soon!<br/>

Ah-ha!  That's the box we found the cuckoo clue for<br/>
after-the-fact.  Day late &amp; a radio short.  I just<br/>
wanted to know if my hunch as to where the clue was<br/>
directing us was right, even though the "box" was no<br/>
longer on the premises Sunday morning when we found<br/>
the clue.  <br/>

<br/>
Yes, Armadillo Jo relayed her sad tale to us.  We're<br/>
headed that way this weekend en route to Port Clinton<br/>
(Duck Tape is about 45 minutes away from where we<br/>
live) so I promised to check up on The Duck and make<br/>
sure that his rivals from 3M didn't do anything fowl<br/>
to him.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of converts, I was talking to a co-worker all<br/>
about the weekend today and she wanted more info on<br/>
letterboxing, so I directed her to some of the<br/>
websites :)<br/>

We were relieved (and in my case, astonished) to find that both "Ode to a Rose" and "Den Grimme Aelling (After)" were in place, safe and dry!!!

Recently, I went to 4 Dollar Tree stores in 2 days...a letterboxer on a mission...to find those boxes.  When I did, I bought 30 boxes.  I'm set for awhile. LOL!<br/>
