logbook like a scrapbook.  Just thought I would mention in case you <br>
are not an AtlasQuest user, that Ryan has added a Scrapbooking Board <br>
where you can exchange ideas with other letterboxer-scrapbookers.<br>
<br>
In case you are not familiar, AtlasQuest is an alternate LB clues type <br>
web site where you can create a profile, enter your boxes and clues <br>
(including HH), post finds, etc.  There are also a number of subject-<br>
oriented message boards there -- some letterboxing related, some not <br>
so much.  Membership is free.  Check it out here:<br>
