else would we be?  Certainly not out on the trail. Cabin fever hit us <br>
hard this year with early snow, heavy snowfalls, ice, and now rain! <br>
<br>
This weekend, I'm ready to do something totally foolish and I don't <br>
even care what the weather will be.  I have new boxes to place.  I <br>
have clues in hand for boxes that were places right before the snow <br>
that hit in early December.  I just couldn't get to them.  I predict <br>
that the first warm and sunny weekend, we will ALL be on the trails <br>
tripping over each other. <br>
<br>
Yes, SILO helped to lift our spirits and get us ready for spring <br>
letterboxing.  Thank you to everyone who came and especially Lock for <br>
an inspirtational workshop that resulted in many light bulb moments. <br>
Spring will be here soon.  I feel stiff; a symptom of cabin fever <br>
also associated with coach potato syndrome.  My legs need to walk and <br>
wander.  I want to see spring flowers peeking up through the soil.  <br>
And letterboxes....Stand back and let me at 'em!  Boxes!  I need to <br>
find a box!  It's not an addiction and I can stop at any time.  <br>
<br>
Sing a long....I'm boxing in the rain. Just boxing in the rain.  What <br>
a glorious feeling I'm boxing again. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I planted a box today - or more accurately swapped out one I had <br>
planted in the last few weeks - realized I had a better place for it <br>
once I got home.  This happen to anyone else?  Well, this locationg got <br>
me thinking of long bike rides - and whether I dare go for another epic <br>
ride.....<br>
<br>
I wanna box, too!<br>
