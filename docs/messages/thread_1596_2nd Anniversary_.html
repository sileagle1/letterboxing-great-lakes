                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to say that today is the 2nd anniversary of finding our <br/>
first letterbox (E-Trails in Madison, WI).  Woo- Hoo!!  We've had <br/>
loads of fun with this pasttime and are looking forward to much more!<br/>
<br/>
As you might remember, we're planning a gathering in Wisconsin on OCT <br/>
1 and are already expecting 35 people.  Hopefully a few more of you <br/>
will also be able to make it.  I'm starting to spend a bit more time <br/>
on planning now, so I'd like to know if anyone has an interest in <br/>
an "Event T-shirt" and if anyone has any particular workshops they'd <br/>
like to attend or present themselves.  I know this will be the first <br/>
gathering for several of the attendees, so even if something has been <br/>
done before, it will be new for many people.  However if there isn't <br/>
a big interest, we don't have to have a shirt or workshops - hunting, <br/>
gabbing and eating is plenty of fun all by itself!<br/>
<br/>
I know it's early to think about planting, but if you live nearby and <br/>
are creating a box, I encourage you to hide it yourself and either <br/>
send the clues to me for inclusion with other clues, or <br/>
post/distribute clues at the event.  In the remote posssibility that <br/>
you discover a poker chip with a number on it when you're looking for <br/>
a spot for your box, please leave the chip there and choose another <br/>
spot.  We're going to be scouting out locations and writing clues <br/>
well in advance of receiving the other boxes and will be using the <br/>
poker chips as "placeholders".  (I may be out of town a fair amount <br/>
in the 2 weeks before the gathering, so need to get ready early.)<br/>
<br/>
Of course I'm hoping that some of you will bring a WOM (Word of <br/>
Mouth) box - I've seen some very creative ones in the few gatherings <br/>
I've attended.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who have contributed to our fun the past 2 years!<br/>
