<br>
to let everyone know that I just got engaged. I decided to use <br>
<br>
letterboxing as my way of asking. I created a pirate themed letterbox <br>

<br>
Lake Huron coastline. After she stamped the box stamp and saw what it <br>
<br>
said I pulled out the real ring and asked her. I am proud to say that <br>
<br>
she said yes. Thank you BrownRabbit from Team Rabbit for helping me <br>
