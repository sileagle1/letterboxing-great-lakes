crowds at certain passport checkpoints.<br>
At least four teams are reportedly using the long weekend to round up<br>
the elusive 15 city tour stamps and attemnpt to qualify for the bonus.<br>
On-the-trail exchanges while completing the "80 Days" tour should have<br>
their own special stamp (but, alas....).<br>
<br>
It appears that at least one team is attempting to set a new record by<br>
completing the entire series during a single extended weekend!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We tried our best but alas, like Tiptoe and Tonto and Star Girl and <br>
El Cajador, we were stuck at one location.  We visited all 15 <br>
locations, but only found 14 of the stamps (after 2 visits to one of <br>
them). We're tired, sore, biten, and scratched, but we still managed <br>
to have a good time!<br>
<br>
It was great to meet Tiptoe and Tonto on the trail (although we both <br>
snuck by each other at one location and then met up at another!) and <br>
would have been great to meet other boxers!  We thought we might <br>
have found another group from Minnesota, as their van had the same <br>
park stickers ours had, but alas, they had left just before we <br>
reached the parking lot.<br>
