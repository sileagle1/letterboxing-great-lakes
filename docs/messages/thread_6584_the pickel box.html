 Hello,<br>
<br>
Pickels was married to my cousin Bonnie, who passed away many years ago.  One of my friends works at the Citgo station in McHenry, and while he was cleaning out the trash bins, he came across a printed copy of clues for The Pickel Box.  Terri also knew George from driving gravel trucks.  He saved the paper to show me.  After I read it he said do you want to go and check this out.  <br>
<br>
So this evening about 6:30, we went over to St. Mary's Cemetary for an adventure. We got to say hello to George and Bonnie. We checked the evergreen bushes, but did not find a box.  <br>
<br>
I thank you so much for doing a tribute to George.  He was a great guy and left us much too soon.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

that). It's amazing how connected we all are... and how the love we put out<br>
there continues to touch lives even when we don't know about it. I'm glad,<br>
in this case, you got to know about it.<br>
<br>
There is something to say about "Changing the world, one box at a time" as<br>
our GLG is titled. When we plant our boxes, we do more than just put a box<br>
out into the world... we add another point of connection between time and<br>
space for an unpredictable web of fellow human beings.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all of you who are a part of this hobby. I feel so blessed that it<br>
has come into my life, not just for the adventure it has brought, but for<br>
the community of amazing people that I get to meet, connect with, and share<br>
in this love for letterboxing.<br>

so much to protect, not only creating financial contributions to help<br>

places. What's more, if we did not have all of the beautiful gifts that our<br>
environment and natural spaces provided us, we would not be able to<br>
have this hobby we so enjoy! If anything, I would argue that<br>
letterboxing creates a sense of appreciation and respect for the<br>
environment. If I could, I would appeal to him to team up with letterboxers<br>
and geocachers to support education of how to plant boxes respectfully,<br>
which areas we should avoid walking through, and even trying to organize<br>
movements to support areas that need financial help to be saved. I mean<br>
hell! Throw a gathering at a run-down park and require donations to fix it<br>
up and we could make a serious difference! Anyway, that's my soapbox on this<br>
matter. I was disheartened when LK told me about the individual who is<br>
taking boxes based on the presumption that they are harming the<br>
environment. *sigh*<br>
<br>
Whoever you are out there, I send you my love, and I hope that you find a<br>
more positive way to channel your love for our Earth.<br>

letterboxers and geocachers are not the ones he should be worrying<br>
about. Our hobby brings people to the beautiful natural areas that he cares<br>
so much to protect, not only creating financial contributions to help<br>
support them, but also increasing awareness and appreciation for those<br>
places. What's more, if we did not have all of the beautiful gifts that our<br>
environment and natural spaces provided us, we would not be able to<br>
have this hobby we so enjoy! If anything, I would argue that<br>
letterboxing creates a sense of appreciation and respect for the<br>
environment. If I could, I would appeal to him to team up with letterboxers<br>
and geocachers to support education of how to plant boxes respectfully,<br>
which areas we should avoid walking through, and even trying to organize<br>
movements to support areas that need financial help to be saved. I mean<br>
hell! Throw a gathering at a run-down park and require donations to fix it<br>
up and we could make a serious difference! Anyway, that's my soapbox on this<br>
matter. I was disheartened when LK told me about the individual who is<br>
taking boxes based on the presumption that they are harming the<br>
environment. *sigh*<br>
<br>
Whoever you are out there, I send you my love, and I hope that you find a<br>
more positive way to channel your love for our Earth.<br>
<br>
Respectfully,<br>
<br>
One Love Journeying<br>
