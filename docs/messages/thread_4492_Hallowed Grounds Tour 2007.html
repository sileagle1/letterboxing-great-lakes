few hours from Western NY), I thought I'd let you know about our<br/>
Hallowed Grounds Tour on the 20th of October. We're doing a driving<br/>
tour of the some of the famous and not so famous cemeteries in Orleans<br/>
County, NY that'll end on our (The Sprite &amp; the Highlander's)<br/>
doorstep. The clues are finally done and are posted on our website.<br/>
Either click on the website at the event page here:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=453<br/>
<br/>
or go to the AQ page for the boxes and the clue link will take you<br/>
right to it:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=57018 <br/>
<br/>
Again, if you can make it out our way, it promises to be a fruitful<br/>
venture. There's 31 stamps in the series, plus several on the wa that<br/>
you can grab to make an even 40 or more. Plus, you'll get to climb up<br/>
inside a spooky stone tower and hang out in the Highlander's Halloween<br/>
decoration explosion at our place! Just sign up so we know you're<br/>
coming and we'll give you our home number in case you get lost. I<br/>
uploaded the map to a page as well, but if you want a better view, get<br/>
a Western NY Region map from Mapworks...it's the best!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some new (and familiar) joining us! <br/>
<br/>
The (spooky) Sprite &amp; the (haunted) Highlander<br/>
<br/>
P.S.--The boxes are permanent, but the event stamp that will make the<br/>
whole set of stamps complete will ONLY be around on the weekend of the<br/>
20th!<br/>
