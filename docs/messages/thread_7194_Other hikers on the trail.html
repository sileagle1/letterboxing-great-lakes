                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, part of the fun about letterboxing is that it is a "secret" hobby.  If we told everyone we met what we were doing, that would take the fun of the secrecy out of it.  But probably the biggest reason not to tell other hikers what we are up to is to protect the boxes.  Most of the people we meet on the trails are not a threat, but if we told everyone we met then I guarantee letterboxes would turn up missing.  Some people delight in ruining others' fun, and it isn't always apparent who those people are when we meet them.  So for the good of the hidden boxes it's best to just not tell anyone who isn't a letterboxer (or at least most) we meet on the trail what we are doing.<br/>

I've only *had* to tell a couple people over the last 5 years what I was doing -- I only tell if I'm found in a compromised possition and it seems I'll get in more trouble by lying. Even then, I usually just tell them I'm on a "scavenger hunt" and they don't inquire any further.<br/>
<br/>
Having young kids I can always throw out the excuse, "my kid threw something over here." But that can backfire if they want to stop and help you look for the mystery item.<br/>
<br/>
Being a guy I can always forget my pride and say I needed to go to the bathroom . . . . . . come on guys, we've all done it -- the world is our bathroom :-)<br/>
<br/>
Why I don't tell? I think there's a thrill to the notion "I know something you don't" - makes you feel like a kid again :-)<br/>

 I do tell my friends about letterboxing (I'm hoping for boxing buddy) but<br/>
not random people on the trail, for the reasons both Kimono Momma and hx6<br/>
mentioned.  Secrets are fun!  Missing or vandalized boxes are not.<br/>
<br/>
I rarely have people ask what I am doing, even when I'm caught obviously<br/>
hunting for something in the bushes or sitting by the trail stamping in.  I<br/>
pretty much always have the dogs with me and not one person has yet offered<br/>
to help me find the missing poop I am trying to collect, although I have<br/>
been commended for being so responsible a dog owner and told to just leave<br/>
it since it is unlikely some one else will find it.  Nor does any one<br/>
question when I have the water bowl out and the dogs are clearly taking a<br/>
break or eating snacks.  Heck, I think most of the time, once people see<br/>
Yuki's backpack, they are too enthralled to pay attention to what I am<br/>
actually doing.  And despite the number of LB patches on his backpack, no<br/>
one has asked - except other letterboxers.<br/>

I don't have kids or a dog to hide behind, but usually pretending to write in my "journal" (logbook) or just fishing in my pack for a tissue seems to make them keep moving along.  When I am asked, I say it's kind of a scavenger hunt, and that satisfies most.  On the couple of occasions people asked for more info - I explained it to them.  <br/>
<br/>
One time I was at a gathering and some people we encountered on the trail asked what we were doing, and I gave them a very superficial explanation of letterboxing.  They thanked me for telling them, because they'd been seeing people with pieces of paper all day, with NAMETAGS.  Yeah, sometimes you just don't blend in, and it's best to fess up.<br/>

Skootching Dog and I have been totally busted on the trail, and have<br/>
(when we have nowhere to hide) used the "explain it to death" method of<br/>
creating disinterest in the sport.  We go really really into depth on it<br/>
(he can clear a room at a party by talking numbers on computers and<br/>
firearms in the most boring manner imaginable... it's one of his<br/>
strengths), until the person wants to escape the crazy boring people. <br/>
They start looking like a cat that's been cuddled for too long by a 3<br/>
year old.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, they want nothing to do with this benign sport, or us, or<br/>
even perhaps this park.<br/>
<br/>
When stealth has failed, the lecture works remarkably well.<br/>

I've actually been asked several times in the last couple of months. Three times with my new boxing buddy in just the last few weeks. The first time he started blabbing, and the hiker actually started snooping around the area with my friend while I watched and said nothing - a bit uncomfotable with the situation - I knew we weren't anywhere near the box they were looking for so we eventually parted ways - he probably thinking we were nuts lol.

We are never asked, probably because people just assume that we are chasing our children.  Truth be told, we usually are.  I do think that if we were ever asked we would lie and tell them we are geocaching.  Then again, we probably wouldn't have a chance to chat as we usually need to chase our children.<br/>
