We were boxing together for Fungus Woman's Fish Out of Water: spring break in MN.  I got so many bites I was miserable!  She got not one!!!  So when I went out to check on one of my boxes on the way home, I tried the lotion and got no new bites.  Today I put some on before going out hiking by a marsh, which was extremely mosquito-infested.  We could hear them buzzing all around our ears and they would land on us, but then immediately leave.  Only one bite!  I'm sold!  It's Bath &amp; Body Works White Tea and Ginger Body Cream...and right now they are having their semi-annual clearance so you can get it cheap!  Thought I'd pass this along.  --Papeseed  <br/>

&gt; How odd.  Did any of the people who stamped previous by chance leave an e-mail address or do you recognize them?  Perhaps you could ask them if there was a stamp when they found it.  I've never heard of a "Hitchhiker Book" without a stamp, but there is a first for everything I suppose.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   In one of the boxes we found today, we found a "Hitchhiker Book."  No stamp,<br/>
&gt;   just a book.  At first we thought the stamp and book got separated somehow,<br/>
&gt;   but the way it reads inside the logbook, it sounds like there may never have<br/>
&gt;   been an accompanying stamp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It says:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   "Hi!  This is a hitchhiker book started by Bob on August 18, 2002 at Holy<br/>
&gt;   Hill Wisconsin.  Stamp it, sign it and move it on to a new location.  Let me<br/>
&gt;   know where you found this.  RobbyRobot2002@yahoo.com."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   For having been started in August of 2002, there isn't much in the book.<br/>
&gt;   One family found it on Jan 4, 2003 and a note in there from them says they<br/>
&gt;   didn't have the time to pass it on until Oct 19, 2004, when they placed it<br/>
&gt;   at Starved Rock State Park.  It was picked up from there on Oct 23, 2004 and<br/>
&gt;   placed at Oakhurst Run in Aurora, IL on April 4, 2005.  Then we found it at<br/>
&gt;   Oakhurst Run today, June 15.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Tried to contact "Bob" but the email addy was dead.  So Bob, if you're<br/>
&gt;   reading this, the above is what's happened with the "book" so far.  And if<br/>
&gt;   it did have a stamp at one time, it no longer does.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Is there actually such a thing as just a hitchhiker *book*, no stamp at<br/>
&gt;   all???  I've never seen one before.<br/>
