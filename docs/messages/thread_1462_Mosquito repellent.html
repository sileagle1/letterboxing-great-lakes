                    <div class="plaintext-content">My sister accidentally discovered that one of her scented lotions makes an excellent mosquito repellent.  We were boxing together for Fungus Woman's Fish Out of Water: spring break in MN.  I got so many bites I was miserable!  She got not one!!!  So when I went out to check on one of my boxes on the way home, I tried the lotion and got no new bites.  Today I put some on before going out hiking by a marsh, which was extremely mosquito-infested.  We could hear them buzzing all around our ears and they would land on us, but then immediately leave.  Only one bite!  I'm sold!  It's Bath & Body Works White Tea and Ginger Body Cream...and right now they are having their semi-annual clearance so you can get it cheap!  Thought I'd pass this along.  --Papeseed  <br>
