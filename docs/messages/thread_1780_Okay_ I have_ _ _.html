What fantastic advice!!!<br>
<br>
I was hoping to leave this Monday but maybe I will stay until school<br>
starts for my daughter (about a week).<br>
<br>
I have 5 headlamps (I am a locksmith), a good sleeping bag, flip<br>
flops. I have contacted the Heads of the Department of PNW<br>
Letterboxing (Der Mad Stamper, et al).<br>
<br>
I still need a sleeping bag, a waterproof tent, a air matress that<br>
floats like a boat. <br>
<br>
Oh, and can someone please de-claw my daughter Puss N Boots, I can't<br>
get her off of me! Poor kid! I haven't left her for 11 1/2 years and I<br>
overheard her playing dolls again, this time it was a doll driving out<br>
west and she got into a horrible car accident and died a brutal death! <br>
<br>
Oh My! I am considering wearing my roller blading helmet on the trip!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi! I am new to Letterboxing but "very" old to camping (more than 40 <br>
yrs worth) and I train new scout leaders. I had to poke my head into <br>
this message cuz I got to point out 1 very improtant thing!<br>
<br>
If the nights will be chilly (and the usually are for fall), the air <br>
in the air mattress will disepate in the night. So unless your <br>
willing to wake up (at least twice) in the night and pump away, I <br>
suggest 2 possibilities for you; 1. get 1 of those lawn chairs you <br>
can stretch out on with no arms (the ones wear you bend foot and <br>
head to middle). I use this for scout camping all the time and <br>
nobody thinks I'm a wuss (I'm also a climbing instructor for BSA. <br>
LOL). or 2. get an air mattress with a built in motorized pump ("D" <br>
batteries) but these can be a bit expensive but worth not having to <br>
drag pump out and start stomping at 2 am!<br>
<br>
Another thing, when you pack your personal kit (toiletries), get <br>
some baby wipes and witch hazel (less sting then alcohol). Use these <br>
for cleaning face and other parts of body when showers are not <br>
available. They're also good when driving a long distance and you <br>
need to "freshen up".<br>
<br>
I hope no one minds my jumping in! Also keep in mind when buying a <br>
tent that when it says "sleeps 3-4" it means very small people! LOL! <br>
And weather-resistance is NOT non-flammable. But if you don't plan <br>
on plunking tent right next to fire or having a cig inside, you will <br>
be fine! LOL!<br>
<br>
Good luck and have fun! Wish I could go! Hoping to do this next fall <br>
actually! Maybe you can give some pointers when you get back!<br>
