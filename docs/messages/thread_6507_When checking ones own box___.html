What is the proper etiquette when you find a hitchhiker? We were just<br/>
checking out a box we planted recently and found a hitchhiker in it. We<br/>
decided it was only fair to leave it, even though we wanted to take it, or<br/>
at least log in and leave it. But we did neither. Anyone else ran into this?<br/>

"miscellaneous" stamp.  We only count HH's if they are found as a surprise<br/>

Personally I would've taken it. You will see in some HHs where they are <br/>
past hand-to-hand in person ie "Hart x6 gave me this HH at the Boxacon <br/>
gathering 10/4/09" (I just made all that up -- just an example)<br/>
<br/>
