OMG, this is a GREAT idea! I can already see the<br>
possibilities: killer rabbits (Team Rabbit is a shoe<br>
in for this one), shrubberies, flying cows, coconuts,<br>
hamsters, grail-shaped beacons, "bring out your dead",<br>
Holy hand grenades and the list goes on and on! Each<br>
box can simply have a box number (eg: LBGLK Search for<br>
the Holy Grail #1) as to not give away the contents or<br>
where the actual grail is....<br>
<br>
I smell one fun fall project a-brewin'!<br>

Have you seen the Black Knight doll?  My friend's little boy has one and<br>
the arms and legs actually come off!   I could picture a whole series of<br>
stamps:  his left leg, his right arm, his body...  or maybe an armless<br>
knight....<br>

I would love to be included if everyone decides to go ahead with <br>
this.  I have always been a big fan of Monty Python's Holy Grail and <br>
after seeing "Spamalot" in Chicago (pre-Broadway) this past winter I <br>
have a renewed appreciation for all that is Monty Python :)<br>

No, not yet.  Right now I think we're all just volunteering for the project but as yet no one has actually organized it.  Speaking of organization...I was just thinking that if we do this we should assign one person (by random lottery or something) to carve the grail so that there is one (and only one).  Or, we could be true to the movie and agree not to have a grail at all in this series.  Just some thoughts.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Papeseed - to bring you up to speed, the concept that<br>
has developed with this "search for the holy grail" is<br>
that all the participants from all over would carve a<br>
stamp pertaining to the movie, but when we list the<br>
clues they'd just be listed as "Search For The Holy<br>
Grail Box 1" or something like that, so that the<br>
searcher wouldn't know what the actual box's theme was<br>
until they found it, and then whoever found the Holy<br>
Grail box first could gloat....<br>
<br>
Kimono Girl - I was thinking, too, about how could<br>
this series be created without duplicates, etc.  One<br>
thought I had was at the gathering, we could right<br>
down characters/scenes/ etc. on slips of paper, and<br>
everyone who wanted to participate could draw one<br>
(keeping the element of surprise, no one will know who<br>
got what or where it will be planted).  But since not<br>
everyone who's voiced desire to participate will be at<br>
the gathering, how would THEY then get to pick their<br>
character/scene/etc?  Unless we didn't look at the<br>
remaining slips after everyone pulled one and put them<br>
in envelopes right away and mailed them out after the<br>
gathering.... *shrug*<br>
<br>
Anyone have any other thoughts on this yet?<br>

ROLF!  Good one!<br>
<br>
Ok, now that we have the go ahead from those whose toes we may be<br>
stepping on, I declare the Great Lakes Holy Grail Exchange open!  I<br>
will take on the role of coordinator.  The exchange will be similiar<br>
to the one we just finished with a few twists.  Give me a bit to put<br>
the details together.<br>
<br>
While you're thinking of what you might do, be advised that Papeseed<br>
is including her 4 stamps which may include something you might<br>
already have wanted to do.  I do not think we should do the same stamp<br>
more than once.  I will keep track of which stamp themes people sign<br>
up for, and if it is already picked, I'll let you know.  Hopefully<br>
this will not cause more than a minor disappointment to some.<br>
<br>
Also, with this exchange, you may request to make and hide more than<br>
one box.  If you are not up to carving a stamp for the exchange, you<br>
can still sign up to get a box to hide!<br>
<br>
Watch for more details soon.<br>
