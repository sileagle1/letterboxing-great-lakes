Beetle's computer has officially CRASHED - GRRRRRR!!!  So I'm not ignoring you.  For information about the Fish Boil Dinner and pre-gatehring, I hope to get the information to you soon.  We have 20 letterboxers who have indicate that they will be attending the fish boil at the Wagon Trail in Rowleys Bay. Directions to the Wagon Trail are available on their website.  Times and other inforamtion will be forthcoming.  Yes, there will be lettterboxes to be found at the Fish Boil Dinner/Buffet.  (More than just fish to eat for those who are not fish eaters.)  Hopefully I will get my computer back soon.  Questions?  Contact Fungus Woman and she can telephone me.  For now, I'm reduced to 30 computer use reservations at the local library.  <br/>
