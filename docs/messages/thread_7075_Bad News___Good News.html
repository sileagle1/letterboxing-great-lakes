GOOD NEWS is that we had a great dinner, dreamy night's sleep and good conversation with other guests at the great B&amp;B that we stay at when we go out that way.<br/>
<br/>
BAD NEWS is that there was a drizzly rain and then lightening storms most of the day and evening yesterday.  GOOD NEWS is that we got more done before leaving home than we had expected, and took our time stopping at a few cute shops along the way.  One had greeting cards that, although a "bit" off color, had us crying and holding our sides in laughter...which by the way is good for the soul!  Especially for two old souls that are dripping wet standing in Beetz Me!<br/>
<br/>
BAD NEWS is it was still raining when we got up this morning and now added to the mix were powerful winds to match.  GOOD NEWS is that we had that extra cup of coffee before heading out and snagging seven other drive-by letterboxes before the rain...Oh wait...make that horizontal blowing SNOW stopped!<br/>
<br/>
BAD NEWS is that the rain stopped, but the wind gusts became so strong and biting that we only managed to get five more OZ boxes before we had to call it quits.  GOOD NEWS is that we only have 19 more OZ boxes to go....and this time around we certainly weren't bothered by mosquitoes...or heat exhaustion!<br/>
<br/>
BAD NEWS is that we did stop by the shelter just to see if any other crazy letterboxers were there to meet for the "group picture" of the canceled event hehehehe....Nope...not a single person in site!  GOOD NEWS is that the only people we saw ALL day  were two fisherman ...no muggles to worry about!<br/>
<br/>
BAD NEWS is that we didn't have the potluck at Munchkinland.  GOOD NEWS is that we had great leftovers and CHOCOLATE to snack on in the car while the sleet pelted the windshield.  We then enjoyed a nice dinner on the way back home at Starved Rock Lodge.  A perfect place to traipse in with muddy, wet clothes from our adventurous day! <br/>
<br/>
BAD NEWS is that we had to head back home just as the sun broke through over the Illinois river after dinner.  GOOD NEWS is we get to look forward to another OZ adventure later on this summer or fall!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, we added a few pictures in the GLK photo file (4 pages back in TnT's Excellent Adventure file...wait 'till you see the waves!<br/>

I had your skull ready for ya and all! But from your(funny-where is everyone!?) pictures-it looked miserable out there and I commend you, CR2, and Maude/RT for still going out!<br/>

*Maybe* the fall one will be a bit nicer?! ; -) Raise of hands-Tornado or rain/snow mix? We have to have one at our events!<br/>

<br/>

&gt; BAD NEWS is that we had to head back home just as the sun broke through<br/>

&gt; &gt; BAD NEWS is that we had made plans to spend last night in Sheffield, IL<br/>

&gt; &gt; today's Munchkinland Event that had to be canceled due to weather. GOOD <br/>
&gt; &gt; NEWS is that we had a great dinner, dreamy night's sleep and good <br/>
&gt; &gt; conversation with other guests at the great B&amp;B that we stay at when we go<br/>
&gt; out that <br/>
&gt; &gt; way.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; BAD NEWS is that there was a drizzly rain and then lightening storms most <br/>
&gt; &gt; of the day and evening yesterday. GOOD NEWS is that we got more done<br/>
&gt; before <br/>
&gt; &gt; leaving home than we had expected, and took our time stopping at a few <br/>
&gt; &gt; cute shops along the way. One had greeting cards that, although a "bit"<br/>

&gt; &gt; color, had us crying and holding our sides in laughter...which by the way<br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; good for the soul! Especially for two old souls that are dripping wet <br/>
&gt; &gt; standing in Beetz Me!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; BAD NEWS is it was still raining when we got up this morning and now added<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the mix were powerful winds to match. GOOD NEWS is that we had that <br/>
&gt; &gt; extra cup of coffee before heading out and snagging seven other drive-by <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes before the rain...Oh wait...make that horizontal blowing SNOW <br/>
&gt; &gt; stopped!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; BAD NEWS is that the rain stopped, but the wind gusts became so strong and<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; biting that we only managed to get five more OZ boxes before we had to <br/>
&gt; &gt; call it quits. GOOD NEWS is that we only have 19 more OZ boxes to<br/>
&gt; go....and <br/>
&gt; &gt; this time around we certainly weren't bothered by mosquitoes...or heat <br/>
&gt; &gt; exhaustion!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; BAD NEWS is that we did stop by the shelter just to see if any other crazy<br/>

I agree heartily as the overgrowth is unbelievable along the canal! Makes finding the boxes &amp; following the clues extremely challenging!  <br/>
<br/>
I feel bad that we cancelled the event at the last minute, but it sounds like everyone had an interesting day. Letterboxing is, after all, all about the adventure and there was plenty of that to go around!  <br/>

Oh my - those are some funny photos! I think I was better off with the<br/>
dreaded Wild Parsnip burns rather than the freezing, biting winds and sleet.<br/>
Glad to hear that you made progress even under those wintery conditions. <br/>
<br/>
I would heartily encourage people to get out on the Yellow Brick Road in the<br/>
merry month of May if at all possible. Don't wait until fall to start your<br/>
journey! Use the fall event to finish up any that you have left and to<br/>
celebrate completing the series.<br/>

Yep! Trying to be positive, that's what it took to be out there<br/>
today!...Especially in light of the fact that I just re-counted and we have<br/>
not 19, but 22 more to find!....and seriously..those white caps and waves on<br/>
the canal where unreal! But, we still had a good time together, and what can<br/>
we say..the stamps are outstanding!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, hx6, we were stamping into your "Scales of Justice" when it was blowing<br/>
snow so hard on our faces that the bushes didn't even stop the sting! We<br/>
couldn't stamp in as that box and log were soaked...but it will be memorable<br/>
for us!<br/>

&gt; Yes, you didn't have mosquitos or heat exhaustion to worry about, but you <br/>
&gt; chalked up hypothermia &amp; snow blindness as ailments on the Canal.<br/>

&gt; BAD NEWS is that we had made plans to spend last night in Sheffield, IL<br/>
for <br/>
&gt; today's Munchkinland Event that had to be canceled due to weather. GOOD <br/>
&gt; NEWS is that we had a great dinner, dreamy night's sleep and good <br/>
&gt; conversation with other guests at the great B&amp;B that we stay at when we go<br/>
out that <br/>
&gt; way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BAD NEWS is that there was a drizzly rain and then lightening storms most <br/>
&gt; of the day and evening yesterday. GOOD NEWS is that we got more done<br/>
before <br/>
&gt; leaving home than we had expected, and took our time stopping at a few <br/>
&gt; cute shops along the way. One had greeting cards that, although a "bit"<br/>
off <br/>
&gt; color, had us crying and holding our sides in laughter...which by the way<br/>
is <br/>
&gt; good for the soul! Especially for two old souls that are dripping wet <br/>
&gt; standing in Beetz Me!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BAD NEWS is it was still raining when we got up this morning and now added<br/>
<br/>
&gt; to the mix were powerful winds to match. GOOD NEWS is that we had that <br/>
&gt; extra cup of coffee before heading out and snagging seven other drive-by <br/>
&gt; letterboxes before the rain...Oh wait...make that horizontal blowing SNOW <br/>
&gt; stopped!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BAD NEWS is that the rain stopped, but the wind gusts became so strong and<br/>
<br/>
&gt; biting that we only managed to get five more OZ boxes before we had to <br/>
&gt; call it quits. GOOD NEWS is that we only have 19 more OZ boxes to<br/>
go....and <br/>
&gt; this time around we certainly weren't bothered by mosquitoes...or heat <br/>
&gt; exhaustion!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BAD NEWS is that we did stop by the shelter just to see if any other crazy<br/>
<br/>
&gt; letterboxers were there to meet for the "group picture" of the canceled <br/>
&gt; event hehehehe....Nope...not a single person in site! GOOD NEWS is that<br/>
the <br/>
&gt; only people we saw ALL day were two fisherman ...no muggles to worry<br/>
about!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BAD NEWS is that we didn't have the potluck at Munchkinland. GOOD NEWS is <br/>
&gt; that we had great leftovers and CHOCOLATE to snack on in the car while the<br/>
<br/>
&gt; sleet pelted the windshield. We then enjoyed a nice dinner on the way back<br/>
<br/>
&gt; home at Starved Rock Lodge. A perfect place to traipse in with muddy, wet <br/>
&gt; clothes from our adventurous day! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BAD NEWS is that we had to head back home just as the sun broke through<br/>
ove<br/>
&gt; r the Illinois river after dinner. GOOD NEWS is we get to look forward to <br/>
&gt; another OZ adventure later on this summer or fall!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, we added a few pictures in the GLK photo file (4 pages back in TnT's <br/>
&gt; Excellent Adventure file...wait 'till you see the waves!<br/>
