                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Celery Flats" letterbox was reported missing quite awhile back<br>
(including reports from highly reliable boxers from states to the<br>
west.) Those reports had me convinced that it was very likely MIA.<br>
Today, with a rare glimpse of blue skies and reasonable temps outside,<br>
Artistamp and I headed out to  make a definitive assessment......Was<br>
it there or was it missing?<br>
YEA! It was still in place!<br>
So to those who tried in vain, my apologies....and my invitation to<br>
return to MI and give it a go.<br>
<br>
There had abeen a great deal of brush-clearing in the area of the box<br>
and I suspect that newly created obstacles obscured the placement from<br>
even resourceful seekers. Artistamp rolled a log away from atop the<br>
box place and there it was.<br>
<br>
I'll repost the clues with a minor change.<br>
BTW, the last recorded visitor was in May 2005. There had been quite a<br>
few prior to that.<br>
It's a favorite box of mine for many reasons, but most of all because<br>
it was SpringChick's F-100 and I *think* it has both of her sig stamps<br>
(pre F-100 and post F-100).<br>
<br>
Perhaps it's a hint of good things to come.<br>
