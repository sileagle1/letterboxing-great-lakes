I just saw how many boxes you have just placed?!  Way to go!  Very <br>
nice.  I also wanted to let you know that I did carve the stamp for <br>
"Hoosier Daddy?"  :)  I've tested family members to see if they can <br>

how to do a WOM box....any thoughts??  I even looked it up in the <br>
glossary of terms as many have suggested on LbNA but it does not really <br>
give directions on how to do this.  For now, I will have the box with me <br>
at both the Hoosier and Schoolhouse events!  Not a PT but I guess for <br>
all "Hooo" are attending, just as me????  This box is rated PG and <br>
anyone asking should  bring a smile and a sense of humor.  LOL  :)<br>

<br>
You don't need to be in a "competition" with another state to get a <br>
nice feeling of satisfaction on getting boxes placed in another <br>
county.  We (the greater "we", not just Martini Man & I) were <br>
diligently plugging away on Wisconsin and enjoyed seeing the map get <br>
filled in.  It wasn't until late in the game that Michigan challenged <br>
us to the "friendly competition".  Both states ended up winners by <br>
getting boxes in all counties.<br>
<br>
I must say the visual of a gradually filled in map is motivating, so <br>
if Bindle Babe reads this, maybe she'd be willing to create and <br>
maintain one for Indiana (hers were much more professional than my <br>
hand-colored one, and since I'm out of town on business, my resources <br>
& time are a bit more limited now).  We can't expect the LBNA <br>
webmasters to do frequent updates, so it is best to create one <br>
ourselves if we want it to be "real time".  Texas ended up doing the <br>
same thing we did - people planting boxes in counties, notifying the <br>
group and someone updating and posting the state county map.<br>
<br>
I'll send you a potential train robber graphic separately.  Might not <br>
be suitable for a tiny stamp though...<br>

  Please, nobody get out a map and start coloring just yet. There is more to come, eventually. Ideas for long range plans include several fun series like "Indiana Rockers" (you can't got to Indiana without hearing a Johnny Cougar song), "We're Not That ___________" (famous cities like Boston, Philidelphia, Salem), and "I've Got A Famous Brother" (Boone, Fulton).  Frankly, I'd love to see any Hoosiers pick up those ideas and plant in their area too.  Looking at a map, there is just so much white space in Southern Indiana.  Seems like I could cross the river and do my part to make the world a greener place.  (laughing)<br>

<br>
LOL  The last thing I would say you are is a LbNA slacker?!  I too, have <br>
to add quite a few plants to AQ that are only on LbNA right now.  I have <br>
been replacing or repairing boxes this past week.  Once I have gotten <br>
that under control, I will be getting back to that task as well.  <br>
Congrats on what you have already done!<br>
<br>
Okay...can I vote???  :)  Can I vote that you do the SE counties <br>
first???  :)  Those are closer to us Ohioans who are drooling over more <br>
boxes within striking distance!  I'll get proxies if I need to!  ;)  And <br>
as far as driving through a stream to get to a box-----oh happy days!!!  <br>
Can you list that as an extreme box?!  I very much look forward to that <br>
box of yours.<br>
<br>
I looked through my clip art and had nothing I could help with a train <br>
robber at all, big or small.  Nothing. Nodda.  I tried.<br>
<br>
Thanks for heads up on the WOM thread.  I had not seen any of that and <br>
waded through many of the messages.  Holy cow?!  Mine is definitely not <br>
that big of a deal at all so I'm full steam ahead.  Thanks for the <br>
direction!<br>

some posts lately are not making much sense.  Maybe I better check all the<br>

As far as populating Indiana, we certainly have a new batch of boxers<br>
here.  I just picked up my acetone from Indy and I will start carving<br>
again.  I imagine I could hit a few boxless counties along our eastern<br>
border by the end of summer.  Scoutdogs has retired a few boxes in<br>
Franklin County.  Last time I was in Union County I visited Whitewater SP.<br>
 I was thinking of planting more there, but I was disappointed in the<br>
amount of trash on the trails I saw.  Heading north of Wayne County, I<br>
placed one in Randolph.  I could work my way planting north to our family<br>
lake house in Steuben County over the summer.  My quandary -- do I spend<br>
my time planting or finding?  I must hit Evansville area soon ... and ...<br>
and ...<br>
<br>
By the way, dibs on Floyd's Knobs!  I have an image ready to carve.<br>
