reasons: one, to look like birdwatchers instead of bewildered <br/>
wanderers, and two, to watch birds!<br/>

&gt; Oh, Deb,<br/>
&gt; Your comment about the camera...<br/>
&gt; I never used to carry one (I'm not much into taking pictures) BUT, <br/>
&gt; I've discovered that it's the perfect accessory to create the <br/>
&gt; impression that you're doing something (other than letterboxing).<br/>
&gt; I've been openly carrying a camera during boxing excursions for <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; past few weeks and find it the perfect justification for just <br/>
&gt; standing there and looking around curiously -- as letterboxers do -<br/>
- <br/>
&gt; when anyone else is in sight.<br/>
&gt; I like the inclusion of tools in the pack -- "just in case".<br/>
&gt; The other thing I didn't mention earlier is that we carry bright, <br/>
&gt; hunter-orange vests in our pack during the fall. I first saw <br/>
&gt; letterboxers in NH wearing them during hunting season and it made <br/>
&gt; good sense.<br/>
&gt; Yeah, be safe.<br/>

&gt; &gt; For the first year I used a comfy old khaki backpack that was <br/>
&gt; &gt; structureless -- one big pocket with a small front pocket on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; outside.  I liked it because I had had it for a long time (i.e. <br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't have to buy it), it washed up beautifully and it was as <br/>
big <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; little as the stuff you put in it.  Unfortunately, I am also a <br/>
pack <br/>
&gt; &gt; rat and as the assortment of stuff inside the pack grew, it <br/>
became <br/>
&gt; &gt; harder and harder to find what I was looking for since it was <br/>
all <br/>
&gt; &gt; jumbled in the same place together.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Last summer I bought a real backpack with several pockets.  The <br/>
bad <br/>
&gt; &gt; thing is that it is bulkier and has more structure to it so it <br/>
&gt; feels <br/>
&gt; &gt; clumsy even when there is not a lot in it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There are two large partitions -- the back one is the "dirty <br/>
&gt; &gt; pocket."  In it I carry and boxes/HH that I will be placing, <br/>
&gt; boxes/HH <br/>
&gt; &gt; that I pick up, a couple of spare plastic grocery bags for trash <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever and extra supplies (various size baggies, letterboxing <br/>
&gt; info <br/>
&gt; &gt; sheets, a sheet of "this is a letterbox" labels, a sheet <br/>
of "this <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; a HH" labels and a sheet of labels with my contact info on).  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes I throw in an extra container if there is not already <br/>
too <br/>
&gt; &gt; much stuff in there -- otherwise there are usually a couple in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; vehicle just in case.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The other large partition is the "clean pocket."  In it I carry <br/>
&gt; &gt; clues, log book, a small spiral notebook for jotting clues and <br/>
&gt; notes, <br/>
&gt; &gt; our stamps, a variety of ink pads, unscented wipes and a roll of <br/>
&gt; TP.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; This pocket also has a handy plastic sleeve that is just the <br/>
exact <br/>
&gt; &gt; size for my compass.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There is a medium sized pocket on the front in which I keep a <br/>
small <br/>
&gt; &gt; first aid kit, gloves, a small flashlight, matches, a long-<br/>
handled <br/>
&gt; &gt; wooden spoon (works great for digging in sand*) and sometimes <br/>
extra <br/>
&gt; &gt; socks if it is wet out.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On the outside there are also two elastic-top net pockets on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; sides -- one carries a bottle of water and the other my cell <br/>
phone, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and a small slot pocket on the front that nicely holds a GPS -- <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; &gt; not for geocaching, but I do have several of my box locations <br/>
&gt; marked <br/>
&gt; &gt; as waypoints in the GPS to make it easier to locate them from <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; lake when we are out on the boat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I also always have my camera bag with me, although usually just <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; small one when letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; * about the digging...  I know you are not supposed to dig when <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing, but placing boxes in the sand dunes of West <br/>
Michigan <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; unique.  What was a totally open root cavity when you placed the <br/>
&gt; box <br/>
&gt; &gt; may be under 2 foot of sand when you come back -- keep that in <br/>
mind <br/>
&gt; &gt; as you search for boxes in sandy areas also.  And digging in the <br/>
&gt; sand <br/>
&gt; &gt; is not really harmful to the environment -- at least not the <br/>
amount <br/>
&gt; &gt; of sand me and my wooden spoon can displace in an afternoon.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; So to get things going...  this week's topic.  I know this one <br/>
&gt; has <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been talked about before on the big list, however not everyone <br/>
&gt; here <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is/was a member there or joined in discussion.  Even for those <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; us <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who did, as we take inventory and restock our packs gearing up <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; another LB season, it is an applicable topic:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What type of a pack do you use (not necessarily brand) for LB? <br/>
&gt; What <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; items do you carry in your pack?  What have you found to be <br/>
those <br/>
&gt; &gt; few <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; indispensable items?<br/>
