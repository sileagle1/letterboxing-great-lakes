Thank you to Dartmoor Dreamer for organizing it, and to all of you who came to the meet-and-greet for us!  We didn't get to do anywhere near as much boxing as we'd hoped, but we did get to discover the Ax Man Surplus Store - and its LB - what a nutty, quirky place!  <br>
<br>
We are happy to report that we shall probably be getting up to your neck of the woods a lot more often as DD hopes to go to college there in the fall of 2013.  <br>
<br>
And we recommend checking out the boxes along I-94 - one of my favorite hikes EVER took us to the American Paint LB at Trip Falls in Menomonie.  The stamp is a commercial one (which I've recommended to the placer they mention in the listing).  Heed the suggestions about waterproof footwear.  The area is fantastically beautiful! <br>
