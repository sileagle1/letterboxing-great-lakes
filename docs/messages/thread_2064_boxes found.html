<br/>
One way to check on activity on boxes is to look at the status logging <br/>
on LBNA (keep in mind that not everyone logs their attempts of finds, <br/>
but you can usually get some sense of activity based on those that have <br/>
logged).<br/>
<br/>
Here's one way to do it for the specific question you asked:<br/>
<br/>
Go to LBNA<br/>
Click on Search for Boxes<br/>
Click on the dropdown list for Placer and scroll to KazooDog<br/>
Click on Search Boxes button<br/>
You should now see a list of all the boxes this person placed<br/>
Click on the green flag to the right of the Nearby City for each box <br/>
and you should see a date, the name of a boxer and whether they found <br/>
the box or didn't (will show up as "attempted" if they were unable to <br/>
find it.  (You'll sometimes see that even if a few people logged a box <br/>
as "attempted" it doesn't mean it is missing, because someone else has <br/>
logged it as "found" with a more recent date.)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
PalePuppyPosse and I have been corresponding on this issue for quite<br/>
awhile. PPP has contact with the placer through another venue. Here is<br/>
what we've learned:<br/>
KazooDog is apparently not an active letterboxer, at least not<br/>
presently. She has boxes in greater Kalamazoo and at Fort Custer, near<br/>
Battle Creek.<br/>
There have been problems reported to me and others about some of the<br/>
clues, particularly at Fort Custer.<br/>
The one at Al Sabo Preserve in Kalamazoo was found (as reported on<br/>
this list) by JBBooks just this fall. The Fort Custer #2 box has an<br/>
incorrect clue (compass reading).<br/>
Since it is not my box, I am reluctant to "correct" the clue publicly.<br/>
However, the box HAS been found by a number of boxers (who noted their<br/>
frustration in the logbook).<br/>
Here's what I would suggest: if  you're seeking KazooDog's box #2 at<br/>
Fort Custer, use your imagination as you use your compass.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

You may not have seen my earlier post, but back in June when Wisconsin Hiker<br/>
and I were in the area, we ran afoul of Kazoodog's boxes as well. I believe<br/>
another post stated that this person is "older" and no longer active. We<br/>
found one of her boxes in Kalamazoo, "Up, Up and Away", but turned up nil on<br/>
many others. It's a shame she's no longer active, the stamp was well done.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards<br/>
