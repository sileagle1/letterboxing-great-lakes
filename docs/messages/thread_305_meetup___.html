Has anyone ever heard of this Meetup.com site?  I happened upon it <br/>
accidentally as I was searching the Chicago Tribune website.  They <br/>
claim July 10 at 3:00 pm is "international letterboxing meetup day", <br/>
and that these meetups occur every month on the second Saturday.  It <br/>
shows Pico and Angi as members from the Chicago area.  What's the <br/>
scoop on this?  Anybody know?<br/>

I would of course be THRILLED to get together with any and all boxers at just about any <br/>

July 10th just happens to be the first day of the Bristol Ren. Faire, <br/>
if anyone is interested. I will be going that day and I believe <br/>
Dumpster Diva and Lipstick Chick might be as well. Maybe some of us <br/>
could meet up there?<br/>
