                    <div class="plaintext-content">Woo Hoo!  I have to compliment some geocachers once again.  We had <br>
reports that my All Fool's Day box was missing, and when we checked a <br>
month or two or ago, could find no sign of it.  We therefore indicated <br>
in the clues that it was missing.  <br>
<br>
However last Friday I received a message from a geocacher who had <br>
found it out in the open in the general area, and who put it back in a <br>
nearby tree. They gave me the GPS coordinates (which didn't do much <br>
for me), and also provided a description of where they put it (that <br>
DID give us something to go on).  <br>
<br>
Since we were out of town for a 3-day weekend last weekend, and then I <br>
was out of town on business during the week, today was the first <br>
chance we had to look for the missing box.  We managed to find it <br>
fairly quickly based on the info from the geocachers.  Box is a bit <br>
nibbled on, but stamp & logbook are in great shape.  Hooray!!  We <br>
brought it home to put in a new box and will be replacing it shortly.<br>
