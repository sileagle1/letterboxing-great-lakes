Martini Man for ... well, everything.  <br/>
<br/>
This was the biggest, most-fun and successful Gathering I've ever<br/>
attended; so thanks, also, to everyone who contributed.  <br/>
<br/>
Just uploaded two pics - one of our hosts, and one of Gooble Gobble<br/>
caught entertaining with his juggling antics and talent.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like every box we found had an amazing carving inside and I was<br/>
just blown away by the amazing talent shown by the creators of the<br/>
GLK-region traveling event stamps.<br/>
<br/>
What fun to spend time chatting and sharing with other GLK boxers.<br/>
There's a part of me that finds this part of an event to be the most<br/>
satisfying of all.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Jigsaw and the Christmas Elves for providing transportation<br/>
to this "live HH'er" ... your hospitality was much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Time to board the plane, can't wait to read the rest of the messages<br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>
