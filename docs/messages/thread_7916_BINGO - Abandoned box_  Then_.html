He was in quite a bit of pain and his hand and arm swelled up quite a bit. He is doing relatively well now, thanks to several doses of morphine, but is staying in the hospital overnight for additional observation. I just got back to our hotel now.

Yikes! So sorry to hear that!  I hope he has a full and speedy recovery!  <br/>

That may be a Letterboxing first.  I almost stepped on a Mississauga rattlesnake a few years back.  I remember a story from Preboxed {   :(   } and Front Range Hiker in Colorado about snakes. But, I've never heard of anyone getting bit!<br/>
