                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wanted to let everyone know that there will be 2 drawings held at<br/>
the Fairies event and am posting this beforehand so you have time to<br/>
do what it takes to meet the requirements before Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
First Drawing -- Open to any attendee who has planted a new letterbox<br/>
in 2008.  Event boxes don't count -- it must be a box you created, you<br/>
planted and you made clues for.  Any type of box, including mystery<br/>
boxes are okay, except WOM.  It must be publicly listed at either LbNA<br/>
or AQ (otherwise how would we know it exists?).  If you planted the<br/>
box as a team (i.e. family, husband/wife, etc.) each person who<br/>
participated in the planting of the box can enter.<br/>
<br/>
Second Drawing -- Open to any attendee who has gone out in 2008 and<br/>
done maintenance on at least 4 of their previously planted boxes. <br/>
This means you physically went to the box yourself, checking the<br/>
validity of clues as you went.  Once there, you took the box out of<br/>
its hiding spot and checked the condition of the container and<br/>
contents, replacing torn, worn and missing items as necessary.  This<br/>
is on your honor, but be prepared to tell us what boxes you've given TLC.<br/>
<br/>
For both drawings you must be at the gathering at some point during<br/>
the day and enter yourself before 3:00 p.m.  Drawings will be held<br/>
sometime shortly after 3:00 p.m.  You need not be present at the<br/>
drawing to win, only to enter yourself.<br/>
<br/>
There are prizes ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone at the gathering -- it is a<br/>
wonderful park -- perfect spot for a spring gathering!<br/>

&gt; Hey all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is now just over one week away from the Fairies of the Forest; A<br/>
&gt; Spring Awakening event on Saturday, April 26th, 2008 in Ionia, MI.<br/>
&gt; It's not too late to sign up on the AQ site or just show up if you<br/>
&gt; want to. Everyone is welcome and we'd love to see you there. You even<br/>
&gt; may get to meet some of those "legendary" Michigan boxers (nod to that<br/>
&gt; "chick" who is named after this season..WINK WINK). What's to resist.<br/>
&gt; Beside, BINGO will probably be done by then so you won't have to be<br/>
&gt; salivating over the computer screen waiting to scoop up Mrs. handknit<br/>
&gt; socks (although it seems like lots of you want them). See you all there<br/>

I guess I'll have to get those clues posted asap, huh?<br/>
Then I'll qualify for both!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait!!!<br/>
