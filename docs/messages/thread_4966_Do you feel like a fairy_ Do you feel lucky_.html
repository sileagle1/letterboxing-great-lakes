                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wanted to let everyone know that there will be 2 drawings held at<br>
the Fairies event and am posting this beforehand so you have time to<br>
do what it takes to meet the requirements before Saturday.<br>
<br>
First Drawing -- Open to any attendee who has planted a new letterbox<br>
in 2008.  Event boxes don't count -- it must be a box you created, you<br>
planted and you made clues for.  Any type of box, including mystery<br>
boxes are okay, except WOM.  It must be publicly listed at either LbNA<br>
or AQ (otherwise how would we know it exists?).  If you planted the<br>
box as a team (i.e. family, husband/wife, etc.) each person who<br>
participated in the planting of the box can enter.<br>
<br>
Second Drawing -- Open to any attendee who has gone out in 2008 and<br>
done maintenance on at least 4 of their previously planted boxes. <br>
This means you physically went to the box yourself, checking the<br>
validity of clues as you went.  Once there, you took the box out of<br>
its hiding spot and checked the condition of the container and<br>
contents, replacing torn, worn and missing items as necessary.  This<br>
is on your honor, but be prepared to tell us what boxes you've given TLC.<br>
<br>
For both drawings you must be at the gathering at some point during<br>
the day and enter yourself before 3:00 p.m.  Drawings will be held<br>
sometime shortly after 3:00 p.m.  You need not be present at the<br>
drawing to win, only to enter yourself.<br>
<br>
There are prizes ;-)<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing everyone at the gathering -- it is a<br>
wonderful park -- perfect spot for a spring gathering!<br>

I guess I'll have to get those clues posted asap, huh?<br>
Then I'll qualify for both!<br>
<br>
Can't wait!!!<br>
