WiHi - I was already thinking along those lines about the naming convention - thanks for putting it into clear words.<br>
<br>
"Basket Case" - I can definitely see the possibilities there.  Even other baskets!  Yes, I was planning on this being a year-round series.<br>
<br>
While hiking on the bike trail (IAT connector), I filled six text-note pages on my phone with ideas for this project.  In my mind, I can think different groups of boxes:<br>
<br>
1) PUNNY EGGS - plays on the word "egg" like "Egg-stra Special Delivery" (stork bringing an egg)<br>
<br>
2) EGG RAINBOW<br>
<br>
3) LB EGGS - Martini Egg, Spring Chick Egg, etc.<br>
<br>
4) FOOD - SunnySideUp eggs (of course!), Peeps, etc.<br>
<br>
5) EGG TOWN - Sheriff Egg, Teacher Egg<br>
<br>
6) WISCONSIN EGGS -  Cow Egg, A Packer's Dozen, Bucky Egg<br>
<br>
7) CHARACTER/"LITERARY" EGGS - Sherlock Egg, Green Eggs & Ham<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for all of your ideas.  We ended up choosing "Eggopolis" 'cause it could be bigger than this one park - if necessary it could be throughout Waukeggshaw County.  Plus, maybe someone could carve a stamp of eggs playing Eggopoly.  The flow of puns have slowed down, but a more recent one was HRH Queen Egglizabeth.  <br>
<br>
Now I have to find a hiding spot for the basket - today's hike (4 miles RT) in the park yielded the realizations that there's a reason LB's aren't already in the western part of the park - little cover, and controlled burns.  Have no fear, I will get this party started - I have to for my own sanity!<br>

So I'm at Meijer today and decide to take a stroll down the lock and lock isle...and what do i see but a lock and lock egg carton...I immediately thought of this thread :)<br>

I see that lock and lock has redesigned a lot of their boxes and they have a lot of interesting now boxes on the market!!!<br>

If y'all ever have the chance to go to Eggopolis, you should try to catch Martini Man's Egg Fu box.  The clues, logbook and stamp are a really clever and fun package!<br>
