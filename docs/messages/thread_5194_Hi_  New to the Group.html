<br>
We just got back from a family vacation in the Keweenaw Peninsula on <br>
Sunday.  We looked for those very two boxes, but could not find them!  <br>
I'm assuming you did find them, since it wouldn't be very exciting to <br>
post that you've just discovered letterboxing but couldn't find the two <br>
boxes you were searching for!  We may have been in the wrong park for <br>
Keweenaw Park, but we definitely thought we were in the right place for <br>
the War Memorial.  The fence post appeared to be gone, and all we saw <br>
was a large pile of pine needles and lawn debris.  I even put on my <br>
gloves and dug through the pile (did you see my diggings???) but no <br>
luck.  And we've been at this for 5 years!<br>

there was a lot of "mess" on the ground.  We couldn't find <br>

ready to give up, but then my sister said "Found it!".  We also found <br>
a Hitchhiker in there.  We weren't sure what it was, but we kinda <br>
figured it out and I looked them up, so now I kinda know what to do.  <br>
We went on another search last night in the Lake Linden Museum.  Did <br>
you happen to look for that one?<br>

<br>
I was excited to see your post, because the Keweenaw Park box <br>
belongs to my son, "ASK me".  We haven't gotten many <br>
acknowledgements of our boxes being found - actually haven't gotten <br>
ANY of my boxes acknowledged as found this summer, and we have <br>
several hidden around Houghton and the Keweenaw.  <br>
<br>
Hope you've enjoyed the hunt!<br>

this, we didn't have any new containers or anything.  The letterbox <br>
and contents were damp when we found it. We happened to have a new <br>
ziplock bag and put the whole box in the bag, but the stuff might <br>
need to be repackaged.  I can rebox it if you guys live farther away, <br>
let me know.<br>

You can log your finds of HH's on Atlasquest and Letterboxing.org.  I <br>
know I appreciate it when someone logs when they've found one of <br>
mine -- I love to see where it's traveled!<br>

I believe we did look for that Lake Linden box -- was it the Flying <br>
Fish, at the schoolhouse at the museum?  You probably saw our stamps <br>
as the last people who had stamped in.<br>

Please try to make it to the Gathering in October -- they are SUCH a <br>

We found 7 of your boxes last week (3 of which were ASK Me's):  <br>
Brockway Mtn Series (Scenic View over Copper Harbor and Top of the <br>
Mountain), Phoenix Church, The Church Park, Bear Lake, Copper Country <br>
Humane Society, and Snow Thermometer.  We attempted Keweenaw Park and <br>
Portage Canal North with no luck.  I updated our status and sent you <br>
messages through Letterboxing.org (and AtlasQuest, too, if your clues <br>
are posted on there).<br>
<br>
So, of the 12 boxes we found while on vacation, over half were <br>
yours!  I didn't realize ASK me was connected to you.  Thanks for the <br>
fun and "tour" of the peninsula.  We sort of planned our vacation on <br>
where the letterboxes were!<br>

I've got two HH's in my backpack right now.  Need to get out boxing so I can send them on their way!<br>
