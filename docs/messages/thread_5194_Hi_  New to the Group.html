<br/>
We just got back from a family vacation in the Keweenaw Peninsula on <br/>
Sunday.  We looked for those very two boxes, but could not find them!  <br/>
I'm assuming you did find them, since it wouldn't be very exciting to <br/>
post that you've just discovered letterboxing but couldn't find the two <br/>
boxes you were searching for!  We may have been in the wrong park for <br/>
Keweenaw Park, but we definitely thought we were in the right place for <br/>
the War Memorial.  The fence post appeared to be gone, and all we saw <br/>
was a large pile of pine needles and lawn debris.  I even put on my <br/>
gloves and dug through the pile (did you see my diggings???) but no <br/>
luck.  And we've been at this for 5 years!<br/>

there was a lot of "mess" on the ground.  We couldn't find <br/>

fence post behind the tree though.  I hate to admit that I was almost <br/>
ready to give up, but then my sister said "Found it!".  We also found <br/>
a Hitchhiker in there.  We weren't sure what it was, but we kinda <br/>
figured it out and I looked them up, so now I kinda know what to do.  <br/>
We went on another search last night in the Lake Linden Museum.  Did <br/>
you happen to look for that one?<br/>

You can log your finds of HH's on Atlasquest and Letterboxing.org.  I <br/>

mine -- I love to see where it's traveled!<br/>

&gt; Yes, you probably were in the right place for the War Memorial.  <br/>
And <br/>
&gt; there was a lot of "mess" on the ground.  We couldn't find <br/>
&gt; the "leprechaun" that was supposed to be guarding it.  There was a <br/>
&gt; fence post behind the tree though.  I hate to admit that I was <br/>
almost <br/>
&gt; ready to give up, but then my sister said "Found it!".  We also <br/>
found <br/>
&gt; a Hitchhiker in there.  We weren't sure what it was, but we kinda <br/>
&gt; figured it out and I looked them up, so now I kinda know what to <br/>
do.  <br/>
&gt; We went on another search last night in the Lake Linden Museum.  <br/>

&gt; you happen to look for that one?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello and welcome Night Wisps!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We just got back from a family vacation in the Keweenaw Peninsula <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sunday.  We looked for those very two boxes, but could not find <br/>
&gt; them!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm assuming you did find them, since it wouldn't be very <br/>
exciting <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; post that you've just discovered letterboxing but couldn't find <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; two <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes you were searching for!  We may have been in the wrong park <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; Keweenaw Park, but we definitely thought we were in the right <br/>
place <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the War Memorial.  The fence post appeared to be gone, and all we <br/>
&gt; saw <br/>
&gt; &gt; was a large pile of pine needles and lawn debris.  I even put on <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; gloves and dug through the pile (did you see my diggings???) but <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; &gt; luck.  And we've been at this for 5 years!<br/>

We found 7 of your boxes last week (3 of which were ASK Me's):  <br/>
Brockway Mtn Series (Scenic View over Copper Harbor and Top of the <br/>
Mountain), Phoenix Church, The Church Park, Bear Lake, Copper Country <br/>
Humane Society, and Snow Thermometer.  We attempted Keweenaw Park and <br/>
Portage Canal North with no luck.  I updated our status and sent you <br/>
messages through Letterboxing.org (and AtlasQuest, too, if your clues <br/>
are posted on there).<br/>
<br/>
So, of the 12 boxes we found while on vacation, over half were <br/>
yours!  I didn't realize ASK me was connected to you.  Thanks for the <br/>
fun and "tour" of the peninsula.  We sort of planned our vacation on <br/>
where the letterboxes were!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yes, you probably were in the right place for the War Memorial.  <br/>
&gt; And <br/>
&gt; &gt; there was a lot of "mess" on the ground.  We couldn't find <br/>
&gt; &gt; the "leprechaun" that was supposed to be guarding it.  There was a <br/>
&gt; &gt; fence post behind the tree though.  I hate to admit that I was <br/>
&gt; almost <br/>
&gt; &gt; ready to give up, but then my sister said "Found it!".  We also <br/>
&gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; a Hitchhiker in there.  We weren't sure what it was, but we kinda <br/>
&gt; &gt; figured it out and I looked them up, so now I kinda know what to <br/>
&gt; do.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; We went on another search last night in the Lake Linden Museum.  <br/>
&gt; Did <br/>
&gt; &gt; you happen to look for that one?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello and welcome Night Wisps!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We just got back from a family vacation in the Keweenaw Peninsula <br/>
&gt; &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sunday.  We looked for those very two boxes, but could not find <br/>
&gt; &gt; them!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm assuming you did find them, since it wouldn't be very <br/>
&gt; exciting <br/>
&gt; &gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; post that you've just discovered letterboxing but couldn't find <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; two <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes you were searching for!  We may have been in the wrong park <br/>
&gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Keweenaw Park, but we definitely thought we were in the right <br/>
&gt; place <br/>
&gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the War Memorial.  The fence post appeared to be gone, and all we <br/>
&gt; &gt; saw <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was a large pile of pine needles and lawn debris.  I even put on <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gloves and dug through the pile (did you see my diggings???) but <br/>
&gt; no <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; luck.  And we've been at this for 5 years!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just a little introduction!  I'm from the Upper Peninsula of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Michigan <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I just found out about letterboxing YESTERDAY!  I feel like <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; missed out on so much fun, and I've never heard of it before.  <br/>
&gt; My <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sisters and I went out last night and found two boxes.  One at <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; War <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Memorial Park in Ahmeek and one at the Keweenaw Park in <br/>
&gt; Phoenix, <br/>
&gt; &gt; MI.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was pretty exciting.  I can't wait to go out and find more!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hopefully you'll be seeing our boxes soon. :)<br/>

I've got two HH's in my backpack right now.  Need to get out boxing so I can send them on their way!<br/>

It was a Georgia Peach HH by Three Hearts. We weren't sure what it<br/>
was. Funny to find a HH in our first box. :)<br/>
