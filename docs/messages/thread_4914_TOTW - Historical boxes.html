has caused me to rethink some of my plans about retiring/replacing<br>
some of mine.<br>
<br>
I have been swayed and convinced by friends here on the Great Lakes<br>
list, including TeamRabbit, TJMich, JBBooks, and Tiptoe & Tonto, among<br>
others.<br>
<br>
In a couple of cases I've decided to leave the boxes, but to move them<br>
slightly within their current parks. This is in line with ongoing<br>
plans to shift some clues out of the mainstream LbNA site and onto<br>
less public ones.  So what that might mean is that a box still exists,<br>
but its clues are no longer quite as public.<br>
I do intend to retain/maintain some boxes which had fallen on hard<br>
times, especially if they are `historically important', at least in my<br>
neck of the woods or maybe just to  me.<br>
<br>
For example, "First in the `Zoo" was the first letterbox in Kalamazoo<br>
(county or city). It was first placed in 2002. I have recently moved<br>
and re-clued it to a safer location. Those clues will likely be<br>
available at LbNA and I will strive to keep it current.<br>
On the other hand, I have just moved the Breakfast Elves to new spots<br>
(cereal bowls?!) within their current park. The old clues will not<br>
work anymore. The new clues will be placed elsewhere. (Perhaps hiding<br>
where Snap, Crackle & Pop can be with their other cereal pals?).<br>
<br>
I am considering replacing a very popular box on the (City of) Portage<br>
Bicentennial Trail that was retied a couple of years ago. I'll likely<br>
leave those clues at LbNA.<br>
<br>
I note that for the most part, boxes placed for the Michigan Fall<br>
Gatherings have retained their less-public clue status and, as a<br>
result, probably their safety, too.<br>
<br>
It was clear yesterday as I revisited a number of more mature boxes,<br>
that the ones with accessible clues (LbNA) have many more and<br>
geographically diverse visitors. Out-of-staters hit those more public<br>
boxes for sure.<br>
<br>
As has been noted here by others, maintenance and upkeep are a<br>
continuing challenge. <br>
