                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there!<br/>
I was wondering if anyone has seen or read about the latest "thing" <br/>
called LTCs or Letterbox Trading Cards.  It's a derivative of Artist <br/>
Trading Cards with the main difference being that at least one <br/>
component of the cards has to be a hand carved stamp image.  The <br/>
cards must be 3.5x2.5 inches.  Those are about the only <br/>
requirements.  From there, you can decorate, embellish, art up or do <br/>
whatever you want to the cards.  You make a bunch and trade other <br/>
people for their cards.  I've posted a bunch of web sites below with <br/>
more information.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point is, I was wondering if there's enough interest here <br/>
to do a Great Lakes regional LTC swap.  I was thinking we could have <br/>
the theme be "My home state/town".  You'd make a series of cards, all <br/>
relatively the same, that represents your state or town in some <br/>
way.  You'd have to carve a stamp to match this theme and design your <br/>
cards around that theme.<br/>
<br/>
You can get 10 cards from one piece of 8.5 x 11 cardstock (see <br/>
mirkwood designs link below).  So, I was thinking we could do either <br/>
1 or 2 groups of 10 participants or 1 large group of 20, if there's <br/>
enough interest.  It'd be awesome if we could get at least one person <br/>
from each state in the region.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be willing to host this.  I think we could have the due date be <br/>
the end of January.  That should give everyone plenty of time to do the cards.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?  If you want to participate, would you rather do <br/>
sets of 10 or 20?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bali, I would be interested in participating in the ATC swap.  Sounds like fun!  I am open to sets of 10 or 20.  My preference would be the larger group because you get more in return, and to me the work is in the concept and carving the stamp -- once you start assembling them, the quantity is not such a big deal.  But if a large number is a hindrance to some people, the smaller groups are okay too.<br/>
<br/>
We did a variation of this a few years ago on another letterboxing-related group using our signature stamps as the basis for a design on ATC's.  I think it might have been an idea before its time as not many people were familiar with ATC's at the time and there were only about 8-10 people who participated.  It was fun though -- you can see my contribution here:  http://www.confessionsofdecember.com/art_atcs.asp (the one on the right).<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I would caution though, and I know you didn't make up the name -- what exactly is it that makes these "letterbox" trading cards?  What do they have to do with letterboxing?  I once played around with using an ATC format as the basis of a hand-delivered letterbox clue, which I would think could have been considered a letterbox trading card since it was about a letterbox, but I ended up going with another format that allowed more room for the clues.  But I don't really see the connection between letterboxing and ATC's just because they include a hand-carved image.  Rubber stamp carving, while prolific among letterboxers, is an art form that has been around independent of letterboxing long before the first box was ever placed in the U.S.  It is not really about letterboxing at all.  I understand the name as a derivitive from one of  the things we do in this hobby, but it is really no more about letterboxing than a Saturday afternoon hike without a box (would anyone call that a letterbox hike then?) and it is bound to cause dissention among some of the purists just as the term "postal letterboxing" did.  But that is all semantics and life is too short to diddle over the details...  especially when there are stamps to be carved ;-)<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it does get the wheels turning as to several possibilities for a true letterbox trading card -- using the ATC format as means to distribute/trade WOM type clues...  perhaps hand-carved images that are in themselves clues and used as the basis of a trading card design...  oh the possibilities there!<br/>
<br/>
As an FYI, if there are those interested in more swaps like this involving hand-carved art, but not necessarily pertaining to letterboxing, you might be interested in checking out either the Carving Consortium (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CarvingConsortium/) or the Eraser Cuts (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erasercuts/) groups.  There are usually several different swap projects going on there (ATC's, postcards, etc.) involving hand-carved images.<br/>

Not much, really.  You're right.  I'm new to the party on this.  But, <br/>
reading through to the old posts on AQ, it seems like someone asked <br/>
if anyone was interested in trading ATC's.  Then, someone suggested <br/>
they have hand carved images.  Then someone coined the phrase.  I <br/>
think they decided on that because it's sort of a combo of ATC's and <br/>
postal letterboxing.  (which as you noted, in itself is a whole other <br/>
debate about whether it's letterboxing).  I think they thought this <br/>
was a good way to trade images without the expense of sending logs <br/>
and stamps through the mail.  They just called them LTCs because they <br/>
wanted to add the requirement that one component of the card be a <br/>
hand carved image.<br/>
<br/>
I've never done a postal ring, but this idea really intrigues me <br/>
because it combines the carving aspect of letterboxing with my other <br/>
love of paper crafting.  Maybe a better term would be "Letterboxers' <br/>
Trading Cards", since they're created by letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for your interest and other information about similar <br/>
swapping.  I'll add you to the list and keep you posted.  Right now, <br/>
I have 5 people and 3 states.  I'd really like to have all the states <br/>
in our region represented, if possible.  (need Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota)<br/>
<br/>
If you know any letterboxers that may be interested in this, but <br/>
don't read the message boards, please feel free to pass on the info!<br/>

I would also be interested in participating in this swap.  It sounds <br/>
pretty cool.  Until today I didn't really know what the LTCs were <br/>
about.  Either small groups or a large group would also be fine with <br/>
me.<br/>

I guess not completely intent on that, no.  I just posted it here, <br/>
because that's closest contact I have with other boxers.  I also <br/>
posted it on all our individual state boards in AQ.  I'd love to have <br/>
some Ontario boxers!  Other states would be great, too.  I don't <br/>

Illinois or something like that.  I'd like the group(s) to be spread <br/>

me, the clues make the box and this would be very challenging. It <br/>
would be fun to trade them out for ones you need to complete a series <br/>
amongst fellow LBers. Perhaps to have mini meets to trade cards to <br/>
keep them circulating. You could put multi stamp images in a book as <br/>
your clues, that way it would get less damaged as you pass it around. <br/>
Keeping them from getting coffee staines and ink runs would be one of <br/>
the harder parts to figure out. I guess you could laminate them. <br/>
Well, I think this is an idea definitely worth looking into.<br/>

Sounds like fun!  I am open to sets of 10 or 20.  My preference would <br/>
be the larger group because you get more in return, and to me the <br/>
work is in the concept and carving the stamp -- once you start <br/>
assembling them, the quantity is not such a big deal.  But if a large <br/>
number is a hindrance to some people, the smaller groups are okay too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We did a variation of this a few years ago on another letterboxing-<br/>
related group using our signature stamps as the basis for a design on <br/>
ATC's.  I think it might have been an idea before its time as not <br/>
many people were familiar with ATC's at the time and there were only <br/>
about 8-10 people who participated.  It was fun though -- you can see <br/>
my contribution here:  <br/>
http://www.confessionsofdecember.com/art_atcs.asp (the one on the <br/>
right).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only thing I would caution though, and I know you didn't make <br/>
up the name -- what exactly is it that makes these "letterbox" <br/>
trading cards?  What do they have to do with letterboxing?  I once <br/>
played around with using an ATC format as the basis of a hand-<br/>
delivered letterbox clue, which I would think could have been <br/>
considered a letterbox trading card since it was about a letterbox, <br/>
but I ended up going with another format that allowed more room for <br/>
the clues.  But I don't really see the connection between <br/>
letterboxing and ATC's just because they include a hand-carved <br/>
image.  Rubber stamp carving, while prolific among letterboxers, is <br/>
an art form that has been around independent of letterboxing long <br/>
before the first box was ever placed in the U.S.  It is not really <br/>
about letterboxing at all.  I understand the name as a derivitive <br/>
from one of  the things we do in this hobby, but it is really no more <br/>
about letterboxing than a Saturday afternoon hike without a box <br/>
(would anyone call that a letterbox hike then?) and it is bound to <br/>
cause dissention among some of the purists just as the term "postal <br/>
letterboxing" did.  But that is all semantics and life is too short <br/>
to diddle over the details...  especially when there are stamps to be <br/>
carved ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, it does get the wheels turning as to several <br/>
possibilities for a true letterbox trading card -- using the ATC <br/>
format as means to distribute/trade WOM type clues...  perhaps hand-<br/>
carved images that are in themselves clues and used as the basis of a <br/>
trading card design...  oh the possibilities there!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As an FYI, if there are those interested in more swaps like this <br/>
involving hand-carved art, but not necessarily pertaining to <br/>
letterboxing, you might be interested in checking out either the <br/>
Carving Consortium (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CarvingConsortium/) <br/>
or the Eraser Cuts (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/erasercuts/) <br/>
groups.  There are usually several different swap projects going on <br/>
there (ATC's, postcards, etc.) involving hand-carved images.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hi there!<br/>
&gt;   I was wondering if anyone has seen or read about the <br/>
latest "thing" <br/>
&gt;   called LTCs or Letterbox Trading Cards. It's a derivative of <br/>
Artist <br/>
&gt;   Trading Cards with the main difference being that at least one <br/>
&gt;   component of the cards has to be a hand carved stamp image. The <br/>
&gt;   cards must be 3.5x2.5 inches. Those are about the only <br/>
&gt;   requirements. From there, you can decorate, embellish, art up or <br/>
do <br/>
&gt;   whatever you want to the cards. You make a bunch and trade other <br/>
&gt;   people for their cards. I've posted a bunch of web sites below <br/>
with <br/>
&gt;   more information.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Anyway, my point is, I was wondering if there's enough interest <br/>
here <br/>
&gt;   to do a Great Lakes regional LTC swap. I was thinking we could <br/>
have <br/>
&gt;   the theme be "My home state/town". You'd make a series of cards, <br/>
all <br/>
&gt;   relatively the same, that represents your state or town in some <br/>
&gt;   way. You'd have to carve a stamp to match this theme and design <br/>
your <br/>
&gt;   cards around that theme.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   You can get 10 cards from one piece of 8.5 x 11 cardstock (see <br/>
&gt;   mirkwood designs link below). So, I was thinking we could do <br/>
either <br/>
&gt;   1 or 2 groups of 10 participants or 1 large group of 20, if <br/>
there's <br/>
&gt;   enough interest. It'd be awesome if we could get at least one <br/>
person <br/>
&gt;   from each state in the region.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I'd be willing to host this. I think we could have the due date <br/>
be <br/>
&gt;   the end of January. That should give everyone plenty of time to <br/>
do the cards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   What do you think? If you want to participate, would you rather <br/>
do <br/>
&gt;   sets of 10 or 20?<br/>

If you go to a hobby type store and look for the baseball card stuff, <br/>
they have binder pages (fits 9) and individual plastic sleeves for <br/>
baseball cards.  The ATCs fit in there perfectly!  I bought a whole <br/>
lotta them yesterday at Target right up front near the registers <br/>
where they have the trading cards for kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DD, Are you interested in doing this LTC swap?  It wouldn't <br/>
necessarily be cards for clues to boxes like SC was mentioning. This <br/>
would be just a display of a stamp carving representing your town or <br/>
state.  I suppose you could make it tied to a box as a clue, too, as <br/>
long as it fit within the theme.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes...  what a fun twist this could be indeed!  I like the idea of trading them to complete a series or even trading them to get all of the necessary clues for a particular box.  I am wondering though if people would be willing to let them go, even once they have the info they need from them?  Not only would they serve as clues to ultra-rare letterboxes, but the cards would be collector's pieces themselves -- like being sent a WOM clue from a boxer for whom you have a lot of respect that is so far from you that you may never get there, but still it is a great thing to add to your letterboxing memorabilia collection.  But I suppose if trading were the way to get others -- clues to boxes you don't yet have, then it would be a worthwhile exchange.  Remember the old card game, Pit, where you traded commodities to get a run on one particular suite?  Sometimes it was hard to let go of a couple of Rye, but necessary to get a full set of Wheat.  <br/>
<br/>
I think this is definitely worth some more thought...  It would probably take a while for it to catch on, but once there were a fair number of people playing, it would be great fun!<br/>
<br/>
In the meanwhile, the hand-carved ATC cards will be a wonderful winter diversion.<br/>

I agree with you, SC, this isn't really "letterboxing".  Nor would I say<br/>
it was "invented" by Mama Cache as AQ says.  Several years before I<br/>
started letterboxing, I was involved in ATC's, and there were those who<br/>
carved their own stamps to create the cards.  Whatever.  Like you say,<br/>
semantics.  Bring on the PZKut and let's carve more stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to another permutation of the idea.  Back in those days,<br/>
another mail art group I belonged to did "one-to-one" exchanges, AKA<br/>
"1-2-1"s.  We had a database of those interested in participating and<br/>
you'd just mail one to someone on the list and they'd mail one back to<br/>
you.  No particular theme (usually, though seasonal themes often<br/>
emerged).  No time restraints on the return.  No large expenses (though<br/>
postage was cheaper in those days!).  (A way around the expense could be<br/>
to outline the 2.5x3.5" size on a postcard sized piece of cardstock,<br/>
create the ATC within the outline, and mail at the reduced postcard rate<br/>
(assuming no ephemera or add-ons that could be lost to the USPS<br/>
machinery).  The recipient could then cut it to size.)<br/>

So, Fungus Woman, does that mean you're interested in joining the swap with us?<br/>
<br/>
They do the individual swaps with these as well.  There are currently <br/>
a ton of individual cards listed on AQ, as well.  I have three <br/>
available to 1 to 1 trades right now, if anyone has any they would <br/>
like to trade.  Primitive Bali 1 is no longer available, but the rest <br/>
are all ready and waiting for trade!<br/>

I would agree about the reference to it being "invented" by Mama Cache.  It is definitely not a new idea -- it is exactly the same as we did back in 2003 at the IALC (International Artgirls Letterboxing Cabal) swap...  The idea of trading ATC's with our letterboxing signature stamps on them was originated by the IALC group in general and the first swap was hosted by Kimberly from OH.  I guess because there was no AQ back then and we didn't write up official instructions or officially name them (we just considered them ATC's with a theme of hand-carved letterboxing signature stamps, which actually they are), it doesn't count as the official inception of the idea.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, it's nice to see people extending their carving skills for some other artsy and fun kinds of things.<br/>

  I agree with you, SC, this isn't really "letterboxing". Nor would I say<br/>
  it was "invented" by Mama Cache as AQ says. Several years before I<br/>
  started letterboxing, I was involved in ATC's, and there were those who<br/>
  carved their own stamps to create the cards. Whatever. Like you say,<br/>
  semantics. Bring on the PZKut and let's carve more stamps.<br/>
<br/>
  Which brings me to another permutation of the idea. Back in those days,<br/>
  another mail art group I belonged to did "one-to-one" exchanges, AKA<br/>
  "1-2-1"s. We had a database of those interested in participating and<br/>
  you'd just mail one to someone on the list and they'd mail one back to<br/>
  you. No particular theme (usually, though seasonal themes often<br/>
  emerged). No time restraints on the return. No large expenses (though<br/>
  postage was cheaper in those days!). (A way around the expense could be<br/>
  to outline the 2.5x3.5" size on a postcard sized piece of cardstock,<br/>
  create the ATC within the outline, and mail at the reduced postcard rate<br/>
  (assuming no ephemera or add-ons that could be lost to the USPS<br/>
  machinery). The recipient could then cut it to size.)<br/>
<br/>
  Too many fun ideas, too little time!! (-:<br/>

It shouldn't be that expensive.  We're definitely not sending stamps <br/>
or logs.  These are basically ATCs, which are 2.5 x 3.5 size <br/>
cards.  The base should be cardstock or index card thickness.  You <br/>
carve your stamp.  The decorate the cards with your stamps, layers of <br/>
paper, paint, ink, ribbons, whatever.  The possibilities are <br/>
endless.  Read through the links I sent in the first email, <br/>
especially the Mama Cache one, that has the best desciption.  The <br/>
second one has a million (give or take) of samples of ATCs (not using <br/>
LB Stamps, but it'll give you ideas)<br/>

I don't have a separate account form me so I used my team name. <br/>
I'm working on my stamp now and thinking about doing group 2 as well <br/>
but waiting to make sure the people who didn't make it in group one <br/>
get a chance to get in before it gets filled up with us over achievers.<br/>
