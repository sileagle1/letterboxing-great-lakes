Diana Dolphin and I have wanted to get over and do the WofO series but I<br/>
haven't biked in more than a year and I know without training my butt<br/>
would never let me forget the ride! I think my legs need some training<br/>
too, and would suffer without some practice rides. But I need to sit at<br/>
my job and know I wouldn't be sitting for a week if I rode a bike that<br/>
far without conditioning! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On a flat bike trail like the Hennepin, it is much easier for me to bike.<br/>
Each push of my foot takes me a greater distance than if I was simply<br/>
walking, I get a breeze from moving faster and there is no "impact", since<br/>
my feet are on the pedals.  If I bike a long distance (long for me would be<br/>
over 25-30 miles) without getting off much, my butt might be sore the next<br/>
day from the bike seat.  However on the "yellow brick road" I was getting<br/>
off my bike every 1-3 miles, so no problem.  Granted, it was much easier to<br/>
bike on the hard surface side of the canal, but even on the bumpy grassy<br/>
side, we definitely made better time biking than hiking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now if we would be talking about a HILLY or MOUNTAIN area, I would<br/>
definitely prefer to be hiking, not biking!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not a horse person, so I'm not sure about all of the requirements a horse needs on a long trail.  One problem that I could foresee is that there are quite a few crossings requiring one to get off a bike and go through tunnels that are only about 7 feet in diameter and 20 to 30 feet long. (I posted a picture of one in the picture section)  Im not sure that would spook a horse or not.  They would certainly do well on the grassy path clues, as those were more horse friendly and indeed where we came across the woman on her horse.  I wish I had asked her more questions regarding horses on the canal, but we were so anxious for her to be on her merry way so we could look for a nearby box, that I didn't want to engage her any more than a friendly "hello". Also water on the trail is hard to come by and the overgrowth along the canal and steep bank might be hard for a horse to get near that source...however, we did see a big golden retriever jump in and<br/>
 out at one of the day use areas.  Seeing that they have specific equestrian trails, the ranger at the visitor center might be able to give you answers to all of your questions.I did laugh at how in the past I thought boxing by horse seemed so difficult, but I can't tell you how many times I thought..."Now, this is more suited for a horse, than me on a bike"!  I was even wishing for a golf cart, but the road and bridge crossings wouldn't work too well!  You would definitely need someone else with you, as many of the boxes are located off the trail and require more scrambling to the boxes than we all had expected.  Jim was teasing me that I must have thought it was going to be a straight shot with the boxes placed right on the trail ready to stamp in and then go on.  It was all I could do to just get to the box, let alone then go scrambling in the thickets to find the darn box, stamp in, and return the box.  Took a LOT more time and energy than I<br/>
 had planned.  All I can say is, thank heavens we had Martini Man and Tonto fetching most of the boxes for us.  Nonetheless, Wisconsin Hiker and I both managed enough scratches and she poison sumac to prove we did go in and find some!Hope you get to go and at least snag a few boxes!Kathryn (TIptoe)<br/>
