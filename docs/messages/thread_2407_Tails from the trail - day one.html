                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mrs DogLvrs and I got a nice early start and arrived in the Kzoo area<br>
just when we thought we'd arrive.<br>
<br>
Our first box goal was "Mark in the Park" placed by Belgin Mom back in<br>
July 2003.  With a hint, we did find the box with it's hand-carved<br>
stamp. However, the clues badly need updating. The sign for French's<br>
Island has long been down and we never did find a trail marking for<br>
Memory Lane. The trails are awash with tiny white and pink Dutchmans<br>
Breetches. (See picture in photo section)<br>
<br>
Next it was on to Asylum Birds placed by AZObox in June of 2003.<br>
Lessons learned on this one: don't spend 3 hours walking the trails<br>
trying to make the clues fit what you're seeing. If it takes that<br>
long, something is wrong! Geez oh pizza ... it might even mean the box<br>
is only a short trip up and back.<br>
<br>
All in all we found 6 boxes and did not miss any we had gone in search<br>
of. We'll email the placers with box reports.<br>
<br>
Lunch-time today, we may have a mini-meet up with some of our fellow<br>
GLK letterboxers, where mayham or mischief may occur .... you never<br>
know with this group.<br>

Sail on!<br>
