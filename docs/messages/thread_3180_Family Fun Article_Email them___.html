Here's a novel suggestion: Email Family Fun Magazine and let them know the response and the results of their September 2006 feature article Go Letterboxing.  Maybe they were misinformed or unaware that this somewhat "secretive" hobby (formerly secretive hobby?) requires some research into the rules and etiquette.  Their article doesn't go into details about using caution when discovering a box nor so they give specific details about how to<br/>
carefully replace a box.  I would venture to guess that many of the newbies just read this article and ran right out  to find as many boxes as they ....gulp.... dare I say.....as many as they could find, toss aside on the ground, or simply take home.    <br/>
<br/>
Protect nature.  Safe guard letterboxes.  Hopefully, we can discourage Family Fun Magazine from reprinting this feature article again.  Unless they are made aware of the problems that have resulted in publicizing this hobby to a large reading circulation of parents, children, and youth groups, then they may continue to print similar articles on letterboxing in future issues.   <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think this is a good idea but there could be a down side to it! If <br/>
we all email this place TOGETHER at the SAME time they will have to <br/>
listen to our conserns. I know that every time you place a box you <br/>
risk a loss, but this is getting out of hand! We must preserve our <br/>
beloved hobby from the one hit wonders of the LB world. I really <br/>
love seeing new boxers out there catching the fever, but for some it <br/>
is just a passing fancy and they end up ruining it for the rest of <br/>
us!<br/>
However doing this does have a down side! We could just weather the <br/>
storm and soon enough those people would lose interest and our boxes <br/>
safe again. Emailing and talking to Family Fun about it might spur <br/>
more interest into it and raise some eyebrows at the parks causing <br/>
permits to be issued for placing boxes. What do you all think? <br/>
