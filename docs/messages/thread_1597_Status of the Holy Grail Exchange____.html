I sent my request to join to Dragon but haven't heard back yet, and it's<br>
been pretty quiet on the board about this exciting exchange   :-)<br>

I think the deadline for everything was July 15.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
