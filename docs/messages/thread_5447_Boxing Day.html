It's Boxing Day and even if you can't get out to hunt for a letterbox,<br>
you CAN get your 2013 Bingo card filled out if you haven't already done<br>
so!<br>
<br>
There are only 5 days left to get your card submitted.  New players are<br>
always welcome and I hope more of the experienced players will be<br>
playing again this year.<br>
<br>
I have received a card from someone who claims it will be the "winning<br>
card".  Do you want to prove this person wrong? Then get your card in<br>
soon! You can send it to me via email (kotlarek@wi.rr.com<br>
<mailto:kotlarek@wi.rr.com> ) or pop it in an envelope and mail it to<br>
me.   I must have your CARD by DEC 31 if you want to be part of the fun.<br>
<br>
Your booty contribution and $2 fee (to cover costs of mailing out<br>
prizes) isn't due until JAN 26.  You can give it to me in person (I'll<br>
be at the Dead of Winter event) or mail it to me by that date.  Booty<br>
can be anything related to letterboxing.  If you want to save on mailing<br>
costs, gift cards for gas, craft stores or restaurant chains can easily<br>
be sent in an envelope with your card and $2.<br>
