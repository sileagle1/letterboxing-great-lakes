                    <div class="plaintext-content">ROTFL!  Flying Dragon and I both blamed the shaking bed on the dog<br/>
too!  At first I thought it was FD (not sure what I thought he was<br/>
doing, seizing I guess).  Then we thought it was Tatsu scratching<br/>
(poor itchy allergy boy, sometimes he scratches so hard he shakes the<br/>
floor in the room) but when yelling at him (which I don't<br/>
remember...must not have been that awake yet) didn't stop the<br/>
scratching we were both convinced he was having a seizure...and a<br/>
violent one at that!  We both bolted upright and straight to the end<br/>
of the bed...only to find no dog at all!  At that point we figured out<br/>
that it was in fact an earthquake (even Tatsu doesn't shake the blinds<br/>
on the windows when he scratches!).  A quick snuggle and Tatsu<br/>
completely forgave us for blaming him before we tried to go back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Rest assured, many people blamed the dog.  My vet woke her husband up<br/>
and asked him if it was an earthquake...to which he replied "it's just<br/>
the dog, go back to sleep."  He didn't remember a thing about it this<br/>
morning.  I really wished I could have gone back to sleep.  I've slept<br/>
through earthquakes before, some as big as this one...living in CA and<br/>
WA you kind of get used to them.  But for some reason this morning's<br/>
quake unsettled me and I never did quite get back to sleep...I only<br/>
managed to doze and have weird dreams about fast food places running<br/>
out of food.  FD didn't really get back to sleep either...this was his<br/>
first earthquake (or so he claims...although I find it hard to really<br/>
believe as I've been through two other earthquakes in this area...both<br/>
MUCH smaller).  I did not however feel the after shock.  This morning<br/>
at work was rather hectic and we were all much too busy being run<br/>
ragged to notice any slight shaking that might have been going on.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny how so many of us thought our dogs were having seizures.  That <br/>
was one of the first thoughts that went thru my head as well.  I <br/>
quickly dismissed it due to the intensity and hearing their nails on <br/>
the hardwood floor and realizing they were both at the bedroom door <br/>
insisting that they needed to get of there.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm still surprised the younger dog did not jump in bed with us as that <br/>
is where she wants to be if there is thunder.<br/>
