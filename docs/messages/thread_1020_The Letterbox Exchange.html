There are still a few days left to sign up for the group letterbox <br/>
exchange project.  I am hoping that I didn't miss any e-mails from <br/>
folks wanting to participate while my e-mail was under the weather.  <br/>
If you have already signed up you should have received an e-mail <br/>
back from me confirming that I received your message.  If you did <br/>
not receive an e-mail from me confirming then I did not get your <br/>
message about participating in the exchange, in which case I would <br/>
ask that you please resend to me at springchick1219 "at" comcast.net.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't been reading lately and are wondering what this is <br/>
about -- we are doing a group letterbox exchange where each <br/>
participant makes a letterbox and sends it to another assigned <br/>
participant.  The theme of the exchange is "Hometown Landmarks."  <br/>
All the information and details on how the swap works can be found <br/>
in the FILES section in the SERIES AND GROUP PROJECTS folder.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you will join us!<br/>
