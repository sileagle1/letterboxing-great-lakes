it is a hitchhiker because "hitchhiker" is written on the bag.  It does <br/>
have an e-mail address in the logbook, but it is no longer valid.  It <br/>
doesn't really specify what the name of the hitchhiker is, although it <br/>

Thank you for all the ideas regarding the hitchhiker.  I'm quite sure<br/>
it is a hitchhiker because "hitchhiker" is written on the bag.  It does<br/>
have an e-mail address in the logbook, but it is no longer valid.  It<br/>
doesn't really specify what the name of the hitchhiker is, although it<br/>
is a really neat carving of the "Dos Equis XX Amber" beer logo and the<br/>
stamp is inside the bottle cap of the same. So that is the only way I<br/>
can think of to search for it.  It looks like the tiny little logbook<br/>
has gotten damp at one time so the stamps are hard to read.  I guess<br/>
I'll just move it on.<br/>
