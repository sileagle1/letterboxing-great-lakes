little misty eyed. The day was magical to say the<br/>
least. What a beautiful day, for the most part (more<br/>
on that later) everything was perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you SOOOOO MUCH to The Red Cat for all the work<br/>
she put into making the gathering truly special.<br/>
Everyone I talked to had a great day. A very special<br/>
Thank You to Red Cat's parents and brother for<br/>
supplying everyone with a tasty selection of meats to<br/>
enjoy, and for cooking them for us. The selection of<br/>
food was over the top as always with a huge variety of<br/>
things to munch on (I don't remember who it was that<br/>
made the delicious pasta salad with the wheel pasta,<br/>
artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, etc. but please<br/>
send me the recipe, I forgot to ask you for it)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's true that letterboxers are the nicest people<br/>
around. As always everyone was walking around with a<br/>
huge grin plastered on their face. I really enjoyed<br/>
seeing all of you again, or for the first time, and<br/>
hope it's not too long before our "paths" cross again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone who made boxes for the event.<br/>
All of them were great and I will always look at them<br/>
and remember how special the day was. It's funny how<br/>
even several years later you can look at an image in<br/>
your logbook and remember where the box was, what kind<br/>
of day it was, etc, without having it written down.<br/>
Things like that, to me, are a testament to how<br/>
special and unique letterboxing is. I thank God for<br/>
being a part of it. I thank God for all of you as<br/>
well, for without you it wouldn't be possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now for the interesting part. I don't know when people<br/>
left, but I can say with almost certainty that I was<br/>
the last one out of the park (with the exception of<br/>
Optic and Kayakin' Monkey who were camping) because<br/>
when I got back to my car at 9:15 I was the only one<br/>
left in our section of the parking lot. Do you<br/>
remember where you were and what you were doing at<br/>
8:00 p.m.? I do and will never forget it. It was a<br/>
truly memorable experience to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After parting ways with C.C. Family at Campsite #12 it<br/>
started to rain lightly. I headed down the bluff to<br/>
find the rest of the boxes. It rained a little bit and<br/>
then it stopped and cleared up some. The sun came out<br/>
and everything was perfect again. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After looking a little while for some boxes on the<br/>
south river trail I decided to head back up the bluff<br/>
and look for "The World's Largest Ball Of Twine" box.<br/>
Having secured that image I was off to find the boxes<br/>
by Martini Man and Wisconsin Hiker. I knew exactly<br/>
where I needed to go, being very familiar with this<br/>
side of the park, and started the trek. What I failed<br/>
to notice though were the ominous clouds rolling in<br/>
fast. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was stamping into "The Body" and felt a couple of<br/>
light raindrops hitting my head. No big deal I<br/>
thought, This is just a sprinkling like before and it<br/>
will pass soon. Ummm, that's not how things went down<br/>
though. I thought "There's no sense in turning back<br/>
now, I'm two miles from my car", and I was going to<br/>
find all the boxes. I continued on a little ways to<br/>
see how far I could get and what would happen with the<br/>
rain. Maybe 200 feet down the trail the sky opened on<br/>
me, and I don't mean cleared up. I have never been<br/>
outside in the open in rain like that in my life. For<br/>
those of you who weren't there I was on top of the<br/>
bluffs on the edge of a HUGE prairie when the deluge<br/>
came. There was thunder, lightning and a wind that was<br/>
unbelievable. I would guess that the wind was at least<br/>
30-40 m.p.h. The first thought that ran through my<br/>
head was "Oh no!, my logbook will get soaked!"<br/>
Immediately after that I sought cover, and fast. I<br/>
found a nice big tree to stand behind, which as<br/>
everyone knows is the best spot to hide in a storm,<br/>
ESPECIALLY one with a lot of lightning : ) The first<br/>
mission was to make sure my bag stayed as dry as<br/>
possible to protect my collection of treasures, next<br/>
was my futile attempt at staying out of the driving<br/>
rain. When I say driving I mean driving. It was<br/>
seriously coming at me almost horizontally, that is<br/>
NOT an exaggeration. With nothing to block the wind<br/>
coming across the prairie the wind was raging. I kept<br/>
trying to look out from behind the tree to see if<br/>
there were tornadoes but it was of no use. As soon as<br/>
my head cleared the side of the tree the rain was<br/>
blinding it was coming down so hard and fast. I had no<br/>
choice but to wait it out. After about 20 minutes of<br/>
the Heavenly faucet on "High" it let up enough for me<br/>
to give walking back to the car a try, my hopes for<br/>
finding all the boxes dashed.  I thanked God for my<br/>
safety and started on the long, wet trek to the<br/>
parking lot. The rain stopped after 5 minutes of<br/>
walking at which point I promptly slipped and fell in<br/>
the mud : ) I had a GREAT laugh at myself for now<br/>
being completely drenched and covered in mud on my<br/>
left side. I gave thanks to God for my slip and fall<br/>
in the mud because it just seemed like a perfect<br/>
ending to a perfect day. As soon as those words were<br/>
out of my mouth I was on my left side again in the<br/>
mud. Awesome, Just Awesome. I felt like a little kid<br/>
who has been splashing in puddles and not caring how<br/>
wet or dirty they were. It was a beautiful, liberating<br/>
experience to have at the end of such a great day. I<br/>
wouldn't have changed it for the world. You could<br/>
probably hear my laughter and shouts of joy back at<br/>
the parking lot. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Later that night at a small post gathering party C.C.<br/>
Family and Hart x 6 told me that there were tornado<br/>
warnings in the area while I was out in the middle of<br/>
the storm. I felt very blessed to be safe. I'm glad I<br/>
had the foresight to bring a change of clothes and<br/>
socks with me, "Just in case".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once again, Thank You to God, The Red Cat, and all of<br/>
you. Whether you were at the gathering or not, it's<br/>
you who make this thing we call letterboxing so<br/>
special. God Bless, take care, be safe, and box on<br/>
brothers and sisters, box on.<br/>

sorry we missed the post-event get-together, but when the rain came we <br/>
opted for an earlier dinner, then crashed at the hotel.<br/>

storm in its full glory.  After running in the CC Family on our way <br/>
back to our campsite and finding out that the rain fly was put on my <br/>
tent (Letterboxers are wonderful people!!) we decided to take the <br/>
time to look for some more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We were sitting on the side of the trail happily stamping Pengi into <br/>
our log books when a fellow camper came down with his two dogs.  He <br/>
was on his way to the storm shelter and informed us that there was a <br/>
tornado watch out.  I left Mom to put Pengi safely back in his <br/>
hiding spot while I jogged (those of you who made it to our site <br/>
know this wasn't a fun jog) back to our site to grab headlamps, <br/>
something to eat and full water bottles to take to the shelter with <br/>
us.  I also had to rescue out letterboxes.  About halfway up the <br/>
hill the rain started.  I'd tell you about it, but I can't top <br/>
Gooble Gobble's description.  <br/>
<br/>
Being the mother that my mom is, she couldn't just sit and wait <br/>
patiently for me.  She was convinced I had been struck by lightening <br/>
and came up the hill after me.  We met near the top and started our <br/>
slip slide down the hill.  About half way down the rain stopped and <br/>
we decided there was no point heading to the shelter and trudged <br/>
back up the hill to our site.  In my mad dash to gather stuff to <br/>
take to the shelter with us, I managed to get a bunch of water in <br/>
the tent.  We realized we had been beat and decided to pack it up <br/>
and head home.  As we were frantically packing up our gear the rain <br/>
started again.  There wasn't a dry spot on my body.  Optic had been <br/>
smart enough to pack a rain poncho and I think a portion of her <br/>
shirt managed to stay dry.  I was dumb enought to think, it's not <br/>
a "real" backpacking trip and we're only a mile from the car, I <br/>
don't really need all my normal gear.  I don't think I'll make that <br/>
mistake again.<br/>
<br/>
It was a day neither of us will ever forget.  We didn't get to spend <br/>
the night in our cute, little campsite that we were so excited <br/>
about, but we did have a wonderful day.  We both met some great <br/>
people and have spectacular new images in our logbooks.  A huge <br/>
thanks to Red Cat and her family for all the work they did!!  The <br/>
only regret we have is that we didn't have time to meet everyone we <br/>
wanted to.  We're both looking forward to the next gathering.<br/>

north, heading into the worst of it. I spent about half an hour at a<br/>
gas station, waiting it out. Glad I did, as when I finally resumed the<br/>
trip I passed drifts of golf-ball sized hail. <br/>
<br/>
The first part of the day was truly wonderfulcouldn't have asked for<br/>
better weather or a better group. I know I missed meeting several<br/>
groups that were there, but it was such a pleasure to meet so many<br/>
people and families after seeing your trail names for so long. Thanks<br/>
to everyone who drove or flew a distance to make it.<br/>
<br/>
Extra special thanks to The Red Cat and her fabulous family for<br/>
setting up and hosting such a great event and feast! Yay to Greg, Jane<br/>
and Brian for all their hard work.<br/>
<br/>
I have to apologize to anyone who tried to find my "A Little Looney"<br/>
box. The clues were offI don't know what I was thinking when I wrote<br/>
them. A thousand apologies! And to the Cottontails, who did manage to<br/>
find it despite that glitch, I hope you aren't cursing me now because<br/>
of the poison ivy! When I planted it it some 2-3 weeks ago, nothing<br/>
was leafed out. When I got to it Saturday, I realized the stump was in<br/>
the middle of a decent patch of it. The perils of planting in the<br/>
spring, I guess. I hope none of the other boxes I hid had the same<br/>
problem!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, what was the tick tally? I pulled seven off mefour wood<br/>
ticks and three deer ticks. Two days later I still have the<br/>
creepy-crawlies. :-P<br/>

We slogged up that hill ye steady afternoon and definitely would NOT want to try running up or down it, especially in the fierce wind and rain.  And on top of that you had not only yourselves to worry about, but had to haul gear down that slope, then back up to the parking lot - YIKES!!  (For those of you who weren't at the event, one website states that "The campground is a strenuous 3/4 mile hike from the parking lots."  I can also tell you that Optic's and KM's site was not on the NEAR side of the camping area.)<br/>

Let's hope that "Pastors Wife" has some pull in arranging fabulous weather for the event on JUN 21 - including the evening for those that are camping!<br/>

&gt; about, but we did have a wonderful day.  We both met some great <br/>
&gt; people and have spectacular new images in our logbooks.  A huge <br/>
&gt; thanks to Red Cat and her family for all the work they did!!  The <br/>
&gt; only regret we have is that we didn't have time to meet everyone we <br/>
&gt; wanted to.  We're both looking forward to the next gathering.<br/>

and something about your adevntures being posted on this group.<br/>
So I joined this afternoon and just now read of your escapades.<br/>
WOW! Thank God you were safe-Literally! When FoundUnicorn and I left <br/>
Afton State Park around 7:30 PM we were very fortunate to have missed <br/>
the active weather! Kudos to you for keeping on keepin' on despite <br/>
the weather. A true sign of a dedicated Letterboxer! It was wonderful <br/>
meeting you and all the other GLKers who attended GLK Gathering 2008.<br/>
The day was so much fun for me and FoundUnicorn. We even got Cootied <br/>
3 times! :)<br/>

&gt; Another GLG has come and gone. I can't help but feel a<br/>
&gt; little misty eyed. The day was magical to say the<br/>
&gt; least. What a beautiful day, for the most part (more<br/>
&gt; on that later) everything was perfect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you SOOOOO MUCH to The Red Cat for all the work<br/>
&gt; she put into making the gathering truly special.<br/>
&gt; Everyone I talked to had a great day. A very special<br/>
&gt; Thank You to Red Cat's parents and brother for<br/>
&gt; supplying everyone with a tasty selection of meats to<br/>
&gt; enjoy, and for cooking them for us. The selection of<br/>
&gt; food was over the top as always with a huge variety of<br/>
&gt; things to munch on (I don't remember who it was that<br/>
&gt; made the delicious pasta salad with the wheel pasta,<br/>
&gt; artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, etc. but please<br/>
&gt; send me the recipe, I forgot to ask you for it)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's true that letterboxers are the nicest people<br/>
&gt; around. As always everyone was walking around with a<br/>
&gt; huge grin plastered on their face. I really enjoyed<br/>
&gt; seeing all of you again, or for the first time, and<br/>
&gt; hope it's not too long before our "paths" cross again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you to everyone who made boxes for the event.<br/>
&gt; All of them were great and I will always look at them<br/>
&gt; and remember how special the day was. It's funny how<br/>
&gt; even several years later you can look at an image in<br/>
&gt; your logbook and remember where the box was, what kind<br/>
&gt; of day it was, etc, without having it written down.<br/>
&gt; Things like that, to me, are a testament to how<br/>
&gt; special and unique letterboxing is. I thank God for<br/>
&gt; being a part of it. I thank God for all of you as<br/>
&gt; well, for without you it wouldn't be possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now for the interesting part. I don't know when people<br/>
&gt; left, but I can say with almost certainty that I was<br/>
&gt; the last one out of the park (with the exception of<br/>
&gt; Optic and Kayakin' Monkey who were camping) because<br/>
&gt; when I got back to my car at 9:15 I was the only one<br/>
&gt; left in our section of the parking lot. Do you<br/>
&gt; remember where you were and what you were doing at<br/>
&gt; 8:00 p.m.? I do and will never forget it. It was a<br/>
&gt; truly memorable experience to say the least.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After parting ways with C.C. Family at Campsite #12 it<br/>
&gt; started to rain lightly. I headed down the bluff to<br/>
&gt; find the rest of the boxes. It rained a little bit and<br/>
&gt; then it stopped and cleared up some. The sun came out<br/>
&gt; and everything was perfect again. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After looking a little while for some boxes on the<br/>
&gt; south river trail I decided to head back up the bluff<br/>
&gt; and look for "The World's Largest Ball Of Twine" box.<br/>
&gt; Having secured that image I was off to find the boxes<br/>
&gt; by Martini Man and Wisconsin Hiker. I knew exactly<br/>
&gt; where I needed to go, being very familiar with this<br/>
&gt; side of the park, and started the trek. What I failed<br/>
&gt; to notice though were the ominous clouds rolling in<br/>
&gt; fast. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was stamping into "The Body" and felt a couple of<br/>
&gt; light raindrops hitting my head. No big deal I<br/>
&gt; thought, This is just a sprinkling like before and it<br/>
&gt; will pass soon. Ummm, that's not how things went down<br/>
&gt; though. I thought "There's no sense in turning back<br/>
&gt; now, I'm two miles from my car", and I was going to<br/>
&gt; find all the boxes. I continued on a little ways to<br/>
&gt; see how far I could get and what would happen with the<br/>
&gt; rain. Maybe 200 feet down the trail the sky opened on<br/>
&gt; me, and I don't mean cleared up. I have never been<br/>
&gt; outside in the open in rain like that in my life. For<br/>
&gt; those of you who weren't there I was on top of the<br/>
&gt; bluffs on the edge of a HUGE prairie when the deluge<br/>
&gt; came. There was thunder, lightning and a wind that was<br/>
&gt; unbelievable. I would guess that the wind was at least<br/>
&gt; 30-40 m.p.h. The first thought that ran through my<br/>
&gt; head was "Oh no!, my logbook will get soaked!"<br/>
&gt; Immediately after that I sought cover, and fast. I<br/>
&gt; found a nice big tree to stand behind, which as<br/>
&gt; everyone knows is the best spot to hide in a storm,<br/>
&gt; ESPECIALLY one with a lot of lightning : ) The first<br/>
&gt; mission was to make sure my bag stayed as dry as<br/>
&gt; possible to protect my collection of treasures, next<br/>
&gt; was my futile attempt at staying out of the driving<br/>
&gt; rain. When I say driving I mean driving. It was<br/>
&gt; seriously coming at me almost horizontally, that is<br/>
&gt; NOT an exaggeration. With nothing to block the wind<br/>
&gt; coming across the prairie the wind was raging. I kept<br/>
&gt; trying to look out from behind the tree to see if<br/>
&gt; there were tornadoes but it was of no use. As soon as<br/>
&gt; my head cleared the side of the tree the rain was<br/>
&gt; blinding it was coming down so hard and fast. I had no<br/>
&gt; choice but to wait it out. After about 20 minutes of<br/>
&gt; the Heavenly faucet on "High" it let up enough for me<br/>
&gt; to give walking back to the car a try, my hopes for<br/>
&gt; finding all the boxes dashed.  I thanked God for my<br/>
&gt; safety and started on the long, wet trek to the<br/>
&gt; parking lot. The rain stopped after 5 minutes of<br/>
&gt; walking at which point I promptly slipped and fell in<br/>
&gt; the mud : ) I had a GREAT laugh at myself for now<br/>
&gt; being completely drenched and covered in mud on my<br/>
&gt; left side. I gave thanks to God for my slip and fall<br/>
&gt; in the mud because it just seemed like a perfect<br/>
&gt; ending to a perfect day. As soon as those words were<br/>
&gt; out of my mouth I was on my left side again in the<br/>
&gt; mud. Awesome, Just Awesome. I felt like a little kid<br/>
&gt; who has been splashing in puddles and not caring how<br/>
&gt; wet or dirty they were. It was a beautiful, liberating<br/>
&gt; experience to have at the end of such a great day. I<br/>
&gt; wouldn't have changed it for the world. You could<br/>
&gt; probably hear my laughter and shouts of joy back at<br/>
&gt; the parking lot. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later that night at a small post gathering party C.C.<br/>
&gt; Family and Hart x 6 told me that there were tornado<br/>
&gt; warnings in the area while I was out in the middle of<br/>
&gt; the storm. I felt very blessed to be safe. I'm glad I<br/>
&gt; had the foresight to bring a change of clothes and<br/>
&gt; socks with me, "Just in case".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once again, Thank You to God, The Red Cat, and all of<br/>
&gt; you. Whether you were at the gathering or not, it's<br/>
&gt; you who make this thing we call letterboxing so<br/>
&gt; special. God Bless, take care, be safe, and box on<br/>
&gt; brothers and sisters, box on.<br/>
