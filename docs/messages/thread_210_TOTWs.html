<br>
My first thought was "Ha!  I never make mistakes while carving!" <br>
then I remembered carving some letters backwards.  Then I remebered <br>
chopping off part of the image.  Ooops!<br>
<br>
When I started, I only used an exacto knife.  My personal stamp was <br>
made that way and it still work s pretty well.  I still use the <br>
exacto knife for doing most lettering and sharp angles.  I use a <br>
Speedball cutter for everything else.  I see that one can use a <br>
Dremel tools to carve also.  I'm thinking of trying that.  Anyone <br>
out there with experience using a Dremel tools to carve?<br>
<br>
I pretty much only use the "pink stuff".  I prefer it to all other <br>
carving material.<br>
<br>
I seem to be different in that when I start carving, I just go at <br>
it, easy and hard parts all at once.  I've never made a mistake that <br>
forced me to start over.  Lucky me I guess.<br>
<br>
I also rotate the the carving material as I cut, and sometimes move <br>
the carving material instead of the cutter to make cuts.  I do try <br>
to make the area I carve in a bright as possible, but I found using <br>
a magnifying glass to be more difficult than helpful.<br>
<br>
When testing the print, I color it with inking pens as I intend them <br>
to be in the end, then just clean the stamp right away.<br>
<br>
Excitement-<br>
<br>
I enjoy everything about letterboxing!  What excites me the most is <br>
seeing a new box placed in my area no matter how easy or tough, the <br>
area, the hike, or the carving!  I guess you could say that I still <br>
have the "newbie" bug even after nearly two years!<br>
<br>
I've enjoyed most, if not all, of the letterboxes that I've found <br>
for many different reasons.  Ones that stick out are-<br>
<br>
The three in mid-MO - great hikes, great places to visit.  One I had <br>
to wade through waist-deep swiftly flowing water to get to due to <br>
the thunderstorm the night before, but it was fun!<br>
<br>
Most of SpringChicks boxes - particularly those in Muskegeon SP and <br>
the thought-provoking mystery boxes.  The decoding of the Ghosts <br>
Below box was most fun and interesting!<br>
<br>
Monopoly Railroad - I was amazingly the first finder of the whole <br>
series, tho I was beaten to one box by Stampin' Pam (if memory <br>
serves).  It is a very neat idea that spurred ideas for boxes of my <br>
own.  (I don't want to give anything away.)<br>
<br>
I'm sure I'm leaving something out...<br>
