                    <div class="plaintext-content">I need your creativity (who better to ask than letterboxers??).<br>
<br>
I've had this idea for a series of boxes floating around in my head <br>
for a year and a half now and its time!<br>
<br>
Letterboxes are not allowed in certain parks and places, some owned <br>
by the state and other spaces owned by the nation.<br>
<br>
Clues on LBNA are looked at by such authorities and now and then we <br>
get messages from Rangers and other "powers that be".<br>
<br>
I've always had a rebellious streak in me, so I've wanted to carve a <br>
series of stamps titled "Pesky Park Ranger," to be placed in said <br>
areas.<br>
<br>
Here's where you come in. I would like pictures of you, my fellow <br>
boxers, taking on your most menacing pose (arms crossed, finger <br>
pointed, billy club in hand, etc) if you have some clothing <br>
resembling the uniforms worn by our trusty rangers that would be <br>
GREAT (and helpful).<br>
<br>
Email me a picture of yourself and I will (eventually) carve a stamp <br>
of your efforts. These stamps will be placed somewhere . . . here or <br>
there . . . who knows.<br>
<br>
I am sending this call out to you my fellow Great Lakers first and <br>
see what response I get back, then I will probably open this call out <br>
to other message boards around the nation (my ultimate goal).<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
