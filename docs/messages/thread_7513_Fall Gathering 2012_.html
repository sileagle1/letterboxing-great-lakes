In fact, I hope you'll consider bringing ANYTHING pirate that you have!!!  I would love to have a background set up and wearable items for use, then boxers can dress up and take a photo opportunity!  <br>
 <br>
:-D  I just got a Pirate Treasure Chest that is STINKIN' AWESOME!!  It's a "real" old trunk (even has mold inside, rusty hinges, a rusty clasp--FOR A COMBINATION LOCK!!!!)!!!!<br>
 <br>
Girl, I am going to need your help to pull this event off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :-D  C'mon!!  You're the real "expert" on all of this stuff!<br>
 <br>
I have two pirate books that I will be referring to.  But the real nuts and bolts will be the event itself.  <br>
<br>
Renea      ;-)  <br>

P.S.  Planning a trip to Cheryl's place on August 4th.  Sure wish you had a chance to visit with us!  :-<<br>

I've been watching intently and....hoping! Please LMK ASAP! If not, I would like to step up to the plate and....swing! This would be my FIRST time EVER hosting an event and would love feedback both before and after. If someone else is hosting an event, we will step back and perhaps use our idea for next April/spring. In a nutshell: Van Buren State Park, South Haven. Sat. October 6th (date still in the works, of course) and it would be titled, "Pirate's Ahoy." Thank you for your consideration and I anticipate your feedback! :-D Blessings, Renea/Housepitality Hostess, Vicksburg, MI<br>

YOU BETTER WEAR YOUR PIRATE GARB! :-D <br>
<br>
In fact, I hope you'll consider bringing ANYTHING pirate that you have!!! I would love to have a background set up and wearable items for use, then boxers can dress up and take a photo opportunity! <br>
<br>
:-D I just got a Pirate Treasure Chest that is STINKIN' AWESOME!! It's a "real" old trunk (even has mold inside, rusty hinges, a rusty clasp--FOR A COMBINATION LOCK!!!!)!!!!<br>
<br>
Girl, I am going to need your help to pull this event off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-D C'mon!! You're the real "expert" on all of this stuff!<br>
<br>
I have two pirate books that I will be referring to. But the real nuts and bolts will be the event itself. <br>
