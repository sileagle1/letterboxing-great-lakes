                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm currently in Georgia for business.  There are about a dozen of us<br>
from my company staying at the hotel and three of us are working<br>
second shift, from 1 pm to 11 pm.  The day shift people have been<br>
pitying us because we can never go out to dinner with them, but this<br>
morning I was pitying them.<br>
<br>
This morning I enjoyed a breakfast of ripe wild blackberries while<br>
hiking at a gorgeous park just a few miles from our hotel.  I found a<br>
very interesting letterbox, learned a bit about local history and<br>
cotton farming, played in a creek with some dogs (I'm missing<br>
Claire-dog and Yuki quite a bit), and saw some really cool lizards. <br>
Somehow, dinner at the local Italian place with a bunch of people I<br>
see half the day at work anyway pales in comparison to all that.<br>
<br>
And tomorrow there's another park and another box and, I'd bet money,<br>
more berries.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I SO wish I had known about letterboxing when I had to travel with my job.<br>
I traveled at least one week a month, and one month a quarter I was gone for<br>
all but one week.  And then during Texas' legislative year I was gone even<br>
more!<br>
<br>
I spent way too much time doing happy hour, eating out in heavy expensive<br>
restaurants, going to bars with colleagues I didn't particularly like but<br>
had to politic with, or slaving over my laptop in my room.  I was such a<br>
workaholic!<br>
<br>
If letterboxing had been in the picture then, I'm sure I would've found a<br>
way to escape all that and get out and go boxing.  So, Katy - Way to go,<br>
Girl!<br>
