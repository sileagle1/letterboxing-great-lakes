So it turns out that we picked a very apt trailname. Due to the<br>
difficulties we had during our last pregnancy, twins, our doctor wanted<br>
an early ultrasound (13 weeks, normal is twenty). Well we went, and<br>
were thinking one baby, first they said twins, then just as we thought<br>

I'm not sure if I should congratulate you both, or feel sorry for you because it's obvious that with your expanding family neither of you will get a good night of sleep for years to come.  Yawn!  <br>

Yes, Cottontails is a perfect name...and another one, and another one, and another one....like bunnies.  <br>

All we have to say is that Tiptoe's sister was told she was carrying triplets and somewhere <br>
around the 3 month mark a fourth baby appeared!  Now, you are going to have to rent a <br>

Peabody and I practiced our parenting skills on his sister's triplets --<br>
- and now they've grown up to be drivers!  So you LbGLK'ers in the <br>
Rockford area - watch out!<br>
<br>
Cottontails - do get in touch with the area group(s) for parents of <br>
multiples - it was an invaluable source of information and support for <br>
DSIL.  Best wishes to the whoel family!<br>

difficulties we had during our last pregnancy, twins, our doctor wanted <br>
an early ultrasound (13 weeks, normal is twenty). Well we went, and <br>
were thinking one baby, first they said twins, then just as we thought <br>
we were wrapping up they discovered it wasn't twins...but TRIPLETS! <br>
Thats right folks, the cottontails are having a litter! <br>

This is better news than even finding out you were expecting in the first place, and I wish you and the babies all the best.<br>
