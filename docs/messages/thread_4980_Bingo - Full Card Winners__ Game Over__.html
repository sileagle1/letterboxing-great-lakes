                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday's word was indeed a winner for Tiptoe & Tonto and the Cereal<br>
City Boxers.  So they have claimed the final 2 victory spots in this<br>
year's game.  Congratulations to all!<br>
<br>
I know there was some debate over whether they would be considered the<br>
last two winners or if it would be a tie for 2nd and the game would<br>
continue for a 3rd.  I do allow ties where there is no other choice --<br>
i.e. when there is a tie for an interim game or if there is a tie for<br>
3rd place in the big game, or if say 12 people would have called bingo<br>
for full card.  Nobody would be denied their win, even if it meant<br>
increasing the expected number of winners.  However, in a situation<br>
where there are open winning slots when the tie is called -- i.e. if<br>
two people would call Bingo for 1st or 2nd place on the full card, it<br>
just uses up the available winning spots in order to try and keep the<br>
number of winners as close as possible to the predetermined number of 7.<br>
<br>
Hope that makes sense...  and if you were one of those people sitting<br>
there waiting for "exchange", "degree" or "trail map", you are not<br>
alone.  Each day as I pulled the word, I breathed a sigh of relief<br>
that it was not one of those 3 words as there would have been a<br>
plethora of winners with any of them.<br>
<br>
If any of the winners of the Bingo games are going to be at the<br>
Fairies Gathering tomorrow, please e-mail me.  I will see if I can get<br>
the stuff divided out this evening and possibly bring it with tomorrow<br>
for those folks.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to next year's game and taking suggestions --<br>
especially as to how to avoid 20 people all waiting for the same<br>
couple of words at the end of the game.<br>

For those who wanted to know, had I continued calling words:<br>
<br>
I - The Interurban (OH)<br>
B - Trail Map<br>
N - The Happy Snowman (MI-LP)<br>
I - Baby Bunny's Birthday Bash (IL)<br>
O - Degree<br>
N - He's Not a TAME Lion (IN)<br>
O - Exchange<br>
G - George & Lettie (IL)<br>
G - Racine Bells (WI)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good to know the tension is over!  Although I also had only one word left on my card, it wasn't one of the "popular" ones.  I see that I wouldn't have had a full card until the very LAST word.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much for dreaming up this winter diversion for us!  As you can tell from all the chatter each year, it really does provide some entertainment for us.<br>

prize!  Never in a million years did we think that we would get so much satisfaction from <br>
telling friends and family that our great achievement thus far for 2008 would be to claim <br>
victory as "Full card 2nd place BINGO winners."   Our son's remarks pretty well sums up <br>
everyone's comment when he shook his head and said, "Get a life..."  To which we cheerily <br>
defended the fine letterboxing one we have!<br>
<br>
We also would like to thank Spring Chick for the effort, time and creativity she has put into <br>
the game for all of our enjoyment (albeit sometimes tortuous!)  It was only fitting that we <br>
needed a drawn out BINGO game to coincide with the longer than usual winter.<br>
<br>
Which leads us to the next point...we are planning on attending the Spring Awakening <br>
gathering tomorrow, but by the look the forecasted temps, our little tootsies will need <br>
some extra warm foot coverings! Hint, hint, wink, wink!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL, well had SpringChick kept drawing i would have been on UNO for a <br>
full 30 days!   Yep, that's just about long enough to petrify a <br>
peep.  I did notice the one general term i needed would have been the <br>
last general term called.  However, I had questioned before playing <br>
if it was even possible for someone with only general terms to <br>
win....well, i would have to say yes..... If only SpringChick had <br>
pulled that exchange earlier....<br>
<br>
Well,  no Bingo Winnings for me, but i did find a stray package of <br>
peeps in the closet last weekend..... guess i shall have to start <br>
crunching for solace......  <br>
<br>
And SpringChick, i don't think it's possible to not have multiple <br>
winners; at least not if you are being fair to the times people may <br>
be able to access the system ( am, pm etc.) It seems you have handled <br>
ties very well. <br>
<br>
Ok, back to cleaning, and making LTCs.... If it's nice maybe i will <br>
get out to find a box or two.   <br>
