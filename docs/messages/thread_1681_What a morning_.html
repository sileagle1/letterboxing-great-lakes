                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now that classes are done until next semester starts in two weeks, I finally had a chance to get out and do some much-needed maintenance on my "Aina" series out at Kickapoo.  The tree that the first box was hidden blew down in one of the storms we had a month or two ago and was missing.  That box has been replaced and clues are updated on the LbNA site.  And as members of this Yahoo group, you are privaliged to know that this series now includes a bonus box that I placed today commemorating Aina earning her Dog Scout badge!<br>
<br>
While I was at Kickapoo, I came within 20 feet of wildlife all morning!  Driving to the boxes, I passed a skinny doe feeding on the side of the road and about 4 wild turkeys!  I never realized turkeys were quite *that* big...they had to be almost 3 feet tall when they stood up straight!  Then, walking along the trail to get to replant the first box I looked to the left at a tree and thought to myself, "gee, if that weren't facing the trail directly it might be a good place to hide a box."  As I was thinking that, what I had thought to  be the bottom of what I thought was a hole in the trunk moved!  It was a mother racoon and a little baby racoon!  The mother was so soundly asleep I don't know that she ever noticed me.  The baby was just too cute.  I guess it does pay to get up early and go hiking in a light rain!<br>
<br>
On the way home, I stopped by Homer Lake to check on my boxes there.  West Quoddy Light is in great shape and pretty much invisible from the trail in spite of my misgivings about its hiding spot.  I will have to move it before th leaves fall though or I'm sure it will be in plain sight.  I only checked on the first box in my Hidden Village series though...since it hasn't seen much activity I'm sure that the other boxes have enough clue sheets for now.<br>
