                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was a great day to be outside in historic Long Grove, IL. to meet <br>
and greet new letterboxers SG, C, M, and KT.  MM, we'll meet again <br>
someday.  C, came later so she used her cell phone to call and locate <br>
me.  LOL!  I actually had my cell phone turned on today.  That's rare.  <br>
After we stamped and traded LTCs, we took in the art fest, food <br>
vendors, and frozen treats.  My ears certainly perked up when I heard <br>
the band in the park playing hits by The Beatles and Traveling <br>
Wilburies.  WOW! So C, and I hustled over to the park and enjoyed some <br>
twisting and shouting. I stayed till 4:30 pm and then went in search of <br>
some historic places and strolled a nature walk area for future <br>
letterbox sites.  Thanks to all who showed up for this impromptu mini <br>
meet and greet.  With LOVE From Me To You - Everyone!  Beetle  <br>
