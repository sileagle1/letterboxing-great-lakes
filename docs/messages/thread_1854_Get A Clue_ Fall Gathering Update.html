approaching and we are really geeked about this get-together on <br/>
October 22nd at Yankee Springs Rec Area!<br/>
<br/>
There is a great list of clue stamps in the works -- some have <br/>
arrived already.  If you haven't already sent me your stamp, please <br/>
have in the mail by October 10th.  Looking forward to seeing <br/>
everyone's carvings for this.  I had the opportunity to watch the <br/>
Clue exchange game in action at the Virginia Mystery gathering last <br/>
a couple of weeks ago.  This is going to be fun!<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the Clue stamps, we could still use some more letterbox <br/>
contributions -- boxes to be planted out on the trail.  Some have <br/>
been planted already and others are on the way.  If you can get over <br/>
there to plant a box or two yourself, please bring copies of your <br/>
clues to the gathering to distribute.  If you can't make it there to <br/>
plant, but would like to send a box, I am planning to go out there <br/>
and place boxes the weekend of the 15th, so if you can have it hear <br/>
by then, I will place it for you and write up clues to hand out at <br/>
the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
There is a delicious list of food brewing for the potluck and it <br/>
promises to be a day filled with good fun, good boxes and good <br/>
people!<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning to attend (or contribute a box) and I don't have <br/>
you on the list, drop me an e-mail and I will add you.<br/>
