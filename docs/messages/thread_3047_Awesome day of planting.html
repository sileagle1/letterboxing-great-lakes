HOOKED! Talk about treasure hunts, oh my goodness.<br/>
With shroom hunting you never know if you'll even see<br/>
a Morel and when you do it's better than finding a<br/>
mystery box it's taken you 6 months to solve because<br/>
you can eat it. Also the Morel season lasts for only<br/>
about 1 month a year (unless you move further north to<br/>
follow the weather) If you have never hunted the<br/>
elusive and delectable Morel, DO IT! you will have a<br/>
new obsession to look forward to every spring. Just<br/>
what we all need right? another obsession to make sure<br/>
we never get anything done. But seriously, DO IT! If I<br/>
get lucky and find enough this next spring I will be<br/>
bringing some to the gathering to share with you all.<br/>
I've read some incredible stories of people finding 40<br/>
+ lbs. in one outing! If you have never tasted the<br/>
Morel you don't know what you're missing. I better<br/>
stop typing, this message has strayed off topic,<br/>
sorry, but you really need to hunt for Morels next<br/>
spring. Even if you don't like mushrooms you can sell<br/>
the Morels for $20 + per pound! MMMMMM Morels ( read<br/>
with a Homer Simpsonesque longing in your eyes and<br/>
make sure to drool). Umm where was I, oh yeah, great<br/>
day of planting and dreaming about the future.<br/>
