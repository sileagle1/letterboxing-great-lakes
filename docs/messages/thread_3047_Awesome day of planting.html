NI! and came across several cool things. First and<br>
foremost I saw my first ever Coyote! A strange<br>
coincidence considering the Nights box was carved by<br>
Howling Coyote!!! Second, I was in a small (or so I<br>
thought) park 2 blocks from my house that I had never<br>
been to before only to discover it's huge! I saw a big<br>
white-tailed deer running through the forest perhaps<br>
15 yards away and several species of mushrooms in<br>
profusion. I have been really jonesing for Morel<br>
mushroom season and doing alot of reading online about<br>
it to increase my odds of finding more next year. This<br>
last May was my first time out and now I'M COMPLETELY<br>
HOOKED! Talk about treasure hunts, oh my goodness.<br>
With shroom hunting you never know if you'll even see<br>
a Morel and when you do it's better than finding a<br>
mystery box it's taken you 6 months to solve because<br>
you can eat it. Also the Morel season lasts for only<br>
about 1 month a year (unless you move further north to<br>
follow the weather) If you have never hunted the<br>
elusive and delectable Morel, DO IT! you will have a<br>
new obsession to look forward to every spring. Just<br>
what we all need right? another obsession to make sure<br>
we never get anything done. But seriously, DO IT! If I<br>
get lucky and find enough this next spring I will be<br>
bringing some to the gathering to share with you all.<br>
I've read some incredible stories of people finding 40<br>
+ lbs. in one outing! If you have never tasted the<br>
Morel you don't know what you're missing. I better<br>
stop typing, this message has strayed off topic,<br>
sorry, but you really need to hunt for Morels next<br>
spring. Even if you don't like mushrooms you can sell<br>
the Morels for $20 + per pound! MMMMMM Morels ( read<br>
with a Homer Simpsonesque longing in your eyes and<br>
make sure to drool). Umm where was I, oh yeah, great<br>
day of planting and dreaming about the future.<br>

P.S. You lucky folks in Wisconsin have some of the<br>
best Morel hunting grounds around I hear. <br>
