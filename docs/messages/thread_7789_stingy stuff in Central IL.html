I got some nasty blistered burns on my legs a few years ago. Very painful!<br>
It took months for the scars to go away completely.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ahh yes.  That seems to be it.  The blisters broke yesterday and I had to<br>
gauze my leg as they drained for over 24 hours.  This is not pleasant.  I<br>
would advise everyone to avoid this if possible!  The web said that it is<br>
more potent as the summer goes on - so if I had this severe a reaction in<br>
spring, I don't want to imagine a summer case.  I do tend to react to things<br>
more than normal people.  Swimmer's itch can get me all over, and my husband<br>
gets nothing.  It must be somewhere in my garden, but now that I've pulled<br>
all the weeds out, I can't find it until it comes back.  I'll have to be<br>
vigilant.    <br>
