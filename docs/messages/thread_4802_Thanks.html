SILO 2 gathering.<br>
<br>
Thanks esp. to FW for her organizing me getting a wonderful package in <br>
the mail today that contained many (if not all) of the images!! FW, you <br>
went above and beyond by actually making a logbook for my "Louie" <br>
stamp -- I was just going to let him float around without a log -- <br>
thanks for going the extra mile for me!<br>
<br>
BTW What ink did you use that when dry has that plastic like feel to it?<br>

Thanks . . . the wind and the rain were pretty easy to orchestrate. I  <br>
REALLY had to pull some major strings for the tornado though.<br>
