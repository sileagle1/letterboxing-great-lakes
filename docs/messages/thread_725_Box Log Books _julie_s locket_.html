&gt; Wow, I had no Idea that the materials for letterboxing could grow to<br/>
&gt; the collection size you are talking about.  Right now we are keeping<br/>
&gt; our stuff in a child's lunch box.  Sounds like that won't last for<br/>
&gt; long.  I did just buy a carving kit and some carving medium the other<br/>
&gt; day.  I can see there's no room for any of that in the lunch box.<br/>
&gt; Fortunately, I have an extra storage bin that I didn't use last<br/>
&gt; Christmas.  Maybe I better label it for letterboxing now so I will<br/>
&gt; have it for the near future.  I do have one question that perhaps you<br/>
&gt; could take a moment to answer however.  I understand why the logbooks<br/>
&gt; in the boxes contain art quality paper, but...is it possible to buy<br/>
&gt; them and create a new cover, do you need to make them from scratch???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THANKS,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Having been involved with letterboxing for a couple of years now, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; am accumulating quite a lot of stuff -- a variety of carving<br/>
&gt; related<br/>
&gt; &gt; stuff, a stash of possible letterbox containers, a collection of<br/>
&gt; odd<br/>
&gt; &gt; little memo books that could be used for box logs, clues to boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; placed, clues for boxes yet to find, park/trail maps, books about<br/>
&gt; &gt; hiking trails and out-of-the-way interesting places, info on<br/>

&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; ideas for clues and puzzles, filled box logs...  not to mention 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; filled personal log books, a photo album holding index cards<br/>
&gt; stamped<br/>
&gt; &gt; with images of boxes I have placed and another album of WOM clues<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamped postcards that letterboxing friends from other areas of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; country have sent to me.  This doesn't even include the assortments<br/>
&gt; &gt; of art paper, book-binding materials and stamp pads because I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; most of those things in my art supplies before letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, the question...  how to organize all of this stuff so that<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) doesn't take over my house and 2) is easily findable when I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; looking for it?<br/>

Thanks JP -- glad you liked that log book, but I have to admit -- I <br/>
didn't make it.  I actually found that beautiful little book in a <br/>
discount bin at either Michael's or Hobby Lobby!  I took all 3 that <br/>
were there.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what type of book you were trying to make, but here is one <br/>
you might want to try:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.confessionsofdecember.com/lbna/files/monkey.pdf<br/>
<br/>
At the first Great Lakes Gathering there was a workshop using this <br/>
pattern and I know that I and a few other groups use it quite often <br/>
in new letterboxes.  Once you have mastered the construction, you <br/>
will be able to modify the dimensions on future books to meet your <br/>
needs per the size of your box.<br/>
<br/>
Also an easy to do handmade logbook is a stack of index cards with a <br/>
thin piece of cardboard for the covers.  You can cover the covers <br/>
with decorative paper or fabric and embellish if you wish.  Punch <br/>
holes in the covers and the pages (using the blank side of the cards <br/>
as the fronts) and either tie with yarn or string or use biner rings <br/>
to hold it all together.  If the 3"x5" size is too large for your <br/>
box, you can cut the cards down to a better size.<br/>

  &gt; Wow, I had no Idea that the materials for letterboxing could grow to<br/>
  &gt; the collection size you are talking about.  Right now we are keeping<br/>
  &gt; our stuff in a child's lunch box.  Sounds like that won't last for<br/>
  &gt; long.  I did just buy a carving kit and some carving medium the other<br/>
  &gt; day.  I can see there's no room for any of that in the lunch box.<br/>
  &gt; Fortunately, I have an extra storage bin that I didn't use last<br/>
  &gt; Christmas.  Maybe I better label it for letterboxing now so I will<br/>
  &gt; have it for the near future.  I do have one question that perhaps you<br/>
  &gt; could take a moment to answer however.  I understand why the logbooks<br/>
  &gt; in the boxes contain art quality paper, but...is it possible to buy<br/>
  &gt; them and create a new cover, do you need to make them from scratch???<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; THANKS,<br/>
  &gt; Carol<br/>

  &gt; &gt; Having been involved with letterboxing for a couple of years now, I<br/>
  &gt; &gt; am accumulating quite a lot of stuff -- a variety of carving<br/>
  &gt; related<br/>
  &gt; &gt; stuff, a stash of possible letterbox containers, a collection of<br/>
  &gt; odd<br/>
  &gt; &gt; little memo books that could be used for box logs, clues to boxes<br/>
  &gt; &gt; placed, clues for boxes yet to find, park/trail maps, books about<br/>
  &gt; &gt; hiking trails and out-of-the-way interesting places, info on<br/>
  &gt; possible<br/>
  &gt; &gt; box locations, notes about possible boxes/series, bits and pieces<br/>
  &gt; of<br/>
  &gt; &gt; ideas for clues and puzzles, filled box logs...  not to mention 3<br/>
  &gt; &gt; filled personal log books, a photo album holding index cards<br/>
  &gt; stamped<br/>
  &gt; &gt; with images of boxes I have placed and another album of WOM clues<br/>
  &gt; and<br/>
  &gt; &gt; stamped postcards that letterboxing friends from other areas of the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; country have sent to me.  This doesn't even include the assortments<br/>
  &gt; &gt; of art paper, book-binding materials and stamp pads because I had<br/>
  &gt; &gt; most of those things in my art supplies before letterboxing.<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; Anyway, the question...  how to organize all of this stuff so that<br/>
  &gt; it<br/>
  &gt; &gt; 1) doesn't take over my house and 2) is easily findable when I am<br/>
  &gt; &gt; looking for it?<br/>
  &gt; &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; So for this week's TOTW, I am interested in hearing some of the<br/>
  &gt; &gt; tricks that other people use to keep their letterboxing-related<br/>
  &gt; stuff<br/>
  &gt; &gt; in order.<br/>

I downloaded your monkey journal instructions to my computer a while <br/>

one day make my own box logbooks. I don't know if I can blame this on <br/>

&gt; Not sure what type of book you were trying to make, but here is one <br/>
&gt; you might want to try:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.confessionsofdecember.com/lbna/files/monkey.pdf<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the first Great Lakes Gathering there was a workshop using this <br/>
&gt; pattern and I know that I and a few other groups use it quite often <br/>
&gt; in new letterboxes.  Once you have mastered the construction, you <br/>
&gt; will be able to modify the dimensions on future books to meet your <br/>
&gt; needs per the size of your box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also an easy to do handmade logbook is a stack of index cards with <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; thin piece of cardboard for the covers.  You can cover the covers <br/>
&gt; with decorative paper or fabric and embellish if you wish.  Punch <br/>
&gt; holes in the covers and the pages (using the blank side of the <br/>
cards <br/>
&gt; as the fronts) and either tie with yarn or string or use biner <br/>
rings <br/>
&gt; to hold it all together.  If the 3"x5" size is too large for your <br/>
&gt; box, you can cut the cards down to a better size.<br/>
