I have not seen a lot of log-books (I have only found 9 boxes including 4 of yours), but Julie's locket's logbook was the nicest book we have found so far!<br>
 <br>
I was conviced that a hand carved stamp was important, but after julie's locket I came to believe that finding a hand-binded (?) book it may be very rewarding for the people visiting the box...<br>
 <br>
So I carved a couple of stamps (with "just decent" results) and then tried to "inovate" with a simple (yet nice) handmade logbook, the result: an absolute piece of s*** 8^) went back to walmart and found a "mini scrapbook kit" (90 cents) that includes a small book of very high quality paper but only 10 pages! and all the other small pads were ruled so believe it or not, the book is still an issue to solve in our case...<br>

mine, but it is certainly not necessary.  As you can see from the list<br>

A lot of people buy the small sized Strathmore spiral-bound sketch pads and<br>

Thanks JP -- glad you liked that log book, but I have to admit -- I <br>
didn't make it.  I actually found that beautiful little book in a <br>
discount bin at either Michael's or Hobby Lobby!  I took all 3 that <br>
were there.<br>
<br>
Not sure what type of book you were trying to make, but here is one <br>
you might want to try:<br>
<br>
http://www.confessionsofdecember.com/lbna/files/monkey.pdf<br>
<br>
At the first Great Lakes Gathering there was a workshop using this <br>
pattern and I know that I and a few other groups use it quite often <br>
in new letterboxes.  Once you have mastered the construction, you <br>
will be able to modify the dimensions on future books to meet your <br>
needs per the size of your box.<br>
<br>
Also an easy to do handmade logbook is a stack of index cards with a <br>
thin piece of cardboard for the covers.  You can cover the covers <br>
with decorative paper or fabric and embellish if you wish.  Punch <br>
holes in the covers and the pages (using the blank side of the cards <br>
as the fronts) and either tie with yarn or string or use biner rings <br>
to hold it all together.  If the 3"x5" size is too large for your <br>
box, you can cut the cards down to a better size.<br>

Thanks JP -- glad you liked that log book, but I have to admit -- I <br>
didn't make it.  I actually found that beautiful little book in a <br>
discount bin at either Michael's or Hobby Lobby!  I took all 3 that <br>
were there.<br>

I downloaded your monkey journal instructions to my computer a while <br>

one day make my own box logbooks. I don't know if I can blame this on <br>
my being a visual learner or just being a blonde ;) but once I get to <br>
the part where the different parts are sewn together, I get <br>
completely lost. Do you know if there are photos of this process out <br>
there in Internet-land? I think once I see it done I will have an "ah <br>

Or maybe...all these papers I'm working on for school are frying my <br>
