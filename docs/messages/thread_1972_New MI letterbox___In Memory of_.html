I just placed a new letterbox in An Arbor MI.<br/>
It's dog related as many of mine are, but not exactly a notable dog<br/>
in the sense that the others have been.<br/>
I'm posting the clues here, I'll add the box to my website and <br/>
letterboxing clue page when I get a chance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox was created to memorialize Sarah, who passed away in <br/>
July of 2005. She is notable primarily because she was a beloved <br/>
family pet. Sarah was a Border Collie with the black coat with white <br/>
markings typical of the breed. She was intelligent, friendly, and <br/>
devoted.<br/>
 When you stamp in to the log book, you are encouraged to add your <br/>
memorial to <br/>
someone who has touched your heart.<br/>
If you don't have a carved image, you may choose to simply write in <br/>
their name.<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is planted in Gallup park in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The <br/>
park entrance is off Geddes road, west of the  intersection  of <br/>
Geddes Road and Huron Parkway. The walk to the treasure will take 15-<br/>
20 minutes if you walk at a rapid pace, 30-40 minutes if you take a <br/>
more leisurely stroll. All travel is on level, paved trails. The <br/>
final search may require a roundabout approach due to vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
  The clues:<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park, and park in the first parking lot.<br/>
Begin your quest at the sidewalk adjacent to the parking lot,Geddes <br/>
Road to your left.<br/>
Travel south.<br/>
 Follow the river.<br/>
 Kids play here, right?<br/>
 Fishing pond? <br/>
Right again!<br/>
 Gallup Park trail?<br/>
Right again!<br/>
Two big rocks.<br/>
 Put your toes where they meet.<br/>
Look 260 degrees.<br/>
Ancient park resident reaches towards the sky.<br/>
Sarah rests there.<br/>
