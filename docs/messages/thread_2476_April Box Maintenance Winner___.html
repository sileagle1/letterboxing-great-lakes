                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday at the Spring Fling gathering a name was drawn from all of <br>
those who made entries in the April box maintenance database for <br>
checking in on their letterboxes during the month of April.<br>
<br>
There were over 200 entries, nearly half of which were Dragon -- so a <br>
huge pat of the back goes to Dragon for getting out and checking on <br>
all of those letterboxes!  But despite the fact that he dominated the <br>
entries, it was not his name drawn out.<br>
<br>
The winning entry was Howling Coyote for checking on the Stockman <br>
House box in Mason City, Iowa on 4/15/06.<br>
<br>
Howling Coyote, please send me an e-mail offlist with your mailing <br>
address and I will get the handmade journal out in the mail to you.<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone for the great job of checking on boxes!<br>
