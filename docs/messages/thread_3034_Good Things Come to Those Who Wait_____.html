                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I must have been a very good girl this year because my Secret Santa delivered the most amazing package to my doorstep yesterday.  I opened up my box and was greeted by four beautifully wrapped packages tied together by elegant strings.<br>
<br>
My first present contained much needed stamping markers.  They were in fact so needed that they were opened up for use the day the package arrived.<br>
<br>
My second present contained a hand macramd keychain with LBNA beads.  I can't wait to add it to my keys.<br>
<br>
My third and forth presents contained the most amazing handmade log books I've ever seen.  I can't say anything other than they are truly works of art.  I can't imagine ever using them other than to show them to everyone I know.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much to my Secret Santa for making me feel so special.  These gifts will be treasured.<br>
