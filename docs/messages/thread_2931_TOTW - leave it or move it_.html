we leave it where it was, unless, as SpringChick points out, it has<br>

practice, we've found that a large number of clues are sufficiently vague as<br>

<br>
Here's one to ponder:<br>
Say you're searching for a box and find it, but not in the precise<br>
spot that the clues say it should be, should you (1) leave it where<br>
you found it (assuming it's concealed and appears to have been<br>
intentionally placed vs. a critter dropped it there) OR (2) move it<br>
to the location that (you think) the clues said it should be?<br>
<br>
BTW, I don't think there is a hand-and-fast right answer to this one,<br>
myself.<br>

Heres another question - When you are maintaining one of your own<br>
boxes, do you leave a hitchhiker if you find it, or can you claim it<br>
and move it on???<br>

 ===================================<br>
<br>
Unless it is a HH we have already come across before, we take it and view it<br>
as a "reward" for doing box maintenance.  We do make a note in the box<br>
logbook that we are taking it, so the next finder doesn't wonder "what<br>
happened to it?"<br>
