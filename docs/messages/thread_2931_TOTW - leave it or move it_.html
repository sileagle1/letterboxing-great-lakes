we leave it where it was, unless, as SpringChick points out, it has<br/>
blatantly been moved by an animal/non-boxer, e.g. is out in the open. In<br/>
practice, we've found that a large number of clues are sufficiently vague as<br/>

automatically where the placer wants it to be.  That said, if the<br/>
clues are very clear and obvious (IE the box is under a pink stone and<br/>
there's only one pink stone in the area), then I will move the box to<br/>
where I think it should be.  <br/>

Heres another question - When you are maintaining one of your own<br/>
boxes, do you leave a hitchhiker if you find it, or can you claim it<br/>
and move it on???<br/>

 ===================================<br/>
<br/>
Unless it is a HH we have already come across before, we take it and view it<br/>
as a "reward" for doing box maintenance.  We do make a note in the box<br/>
logbook that we are taking it, so the next finder doesn't wonder "what<br/>
happened to it?"<br/>
