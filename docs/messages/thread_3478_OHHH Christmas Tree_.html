                    <div class="plaintext-content"><br>
This year, I decided to decorate our Christmas tree a<br>
little bit differently. <br>
<br>
Every Christmas, since babyhood, each of our children <br>
would receive a new ornament. Kim received the<br>
Crayola series, along with a few Wizard of Oz, a<br>
'computer mouse', a bookworm.<br>
<br>
Amy's series was Holiday Barbie and also has a<br>
Cheerios mouse, an ice cream cone mouse, and a<br>
cheerleader Barbie. <br>
<br>
I started Lauren with the Disney Princess series, but<br>
that series only lasted three ornaments so after that<br>
I started the Music Box collection which is ongoing.<br>
<br>
David has Mickey's Parade. Then there is my dh Chuck's<br>
airplane series which, every year I pray that I am<br>
purchasing the final airplane only to realize that the<br>
history of flight is a verrry looooong history.<br>
<br>
Well, this year instead of scattering the ornaments<br>
throughout the tree, I decided to put each child's<br>
ornaments grouped together in separate sections of the<br>
tree. The effect was really nice - having all the<br>
Crayola guys next to one another, all the Barbies<br>
together. I wondered why I had never done this before<br>
since all the series are very fun to view when they<br>
are displayed in their own area.<br>
<br>
I then put all the "Baby's First Christmas" ornaments<br>
together; and the rest of the odds and ends scattered<br>
about.<br>
<br>
With the new puppy this year, I didn't put any glass<br>
ornaments up at all.<br>
<br>
Now, when the tree itself was assembled (before the<br>
decorating), there was one screw in the stand that was<br>
missing. <br>
<br>
It was decided by the powers that be that the tree<br>
would be fine, although at a slight tilt that bothered<br>
me to look at it.<br>
<br>
Last night, thankfully I was not at home, when the<br>
tree stand gave out. Since it had been leaning<br>
slightly, all the weight had been slowly causing one<br>
of the legs to bend...bend. ..bend. Till finally the<br>
entire tree toppled over.<br>
<br>
Chuck heard the crash from the kitchen where he had<br>
been taking the dishwasher apart for the 3rd time this<br>
week. He wanted to blame the dogs, but there were no<br>
animals in the vicinity.<br>
<br>
Well, he ran to Walgreen's and purchased another tree<br>
stand which didn't fit so in his hurry, he decided to<br>
just straighten out the bent leg, replace the missing<br>
screw (hooray!) and redecorate the tree.<br>
<br>
When I came home, I immediately noticed that the<br>
entire side of the tree that you see when you enter<br>
the house is almost completely bare while the front of<br>
the tree which faces the room is as crowded with<br>
ornaments as an el train at rush hour.<br>
<br>
Barbie in formalwear is fighting with Spongebob in his<br>
underpants for space on one branch. Donald Duck is<br>
playing his tuba and marching down Dorothy's Yellow<br>
Brick Road. One of the First Christmas babies appears<br>
to be flying a WWI biplane.<br>
<br>
I began to redecorate and regroup, halfheartedly, but<br>
gave up after a few minutes. So much for a beautiful<br>
to look at tree! <br>
<br>
I would like to feel sorry for the other half who<br>
asked if I had ever tried to pick up a completely<br>
decorated tree that has to weigh at least 100 pounds<br>
with one hand and try to stick it into a tree stand<br>
with the other. <br>
<br>
But, its hard. <br>

  I did a letterboxing tree this year for various letterboxing guests. Each<br>
  ornament (made of little altered art decorated boxes) contains a clue.<br>
<br>
  The clues are relatively simple. But the only problem is, the clues aren't<br>

  Only the beginning clue and the end clue are obvious. Thankfully I had it<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I feel your pain.  We set our tree up the day after Thanksgiving, so that my brother would have a tree around which to open presents before he shipped off again.  We got the tree up, got all the lights on, put on all the decorations (almost...a few were left off on purpose and some I just forgot) and it was beautiful.  Then we ate some dinner and sat down to watch Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  About 15 minutes into it we hear CRASSSHHH!  from the next room. The tree, without any help from the cats whatsoever, had come completely down.  We picked up the tree, tied it to the windows, swept and mopped, and jumped in the car to go to walmart for more glass balls.  <br>
<br>
Aside from a good number of my cheap-o glass ball ornaments, we also lost the two turtle doves from the 12 days of Christmas, an elephant (although a little hot glue will fix that one right up), and a spun glass angel that shattered into so many tiny pieces that we never did see her in the wreckage.  My favorite cream colored glass balls all survived unscathed, as did the two real egg decorations and the other two days of Christmas (the partridge and the french hens).  Unfortunately, the blown glass ornaments my MIL gave me were not on the tree and as a result were totally unaffected (they're really not bad ornaments...if you're into those kinds of ornaments, which I'm not).  The lights however did have to be taken completely off the tree and restrung.  The second decorating is not nearly as complete, and my tree is looking a little more bare than usual...but I just reached the point where I was done putting ornaments on.<br>
