This is where we stand...<br/>
<br/>
Moraine Hills SP (just to the south of Chain 'o Lakes) has ALL of <br/>
their picnic shelters available June 12!  They also have more trails <br/>
and the woods seem to be just as old with hiding places.  I <br/>
currently have one of the shelters on reserve, and intend to go down <br/>
tomorrow on my way to MI to check the place out for final commitment <br/>
and finalizing reservations.<br/>
<br/>
So (unless something else goes wrong) it looks like it will be June <br/>
12 for the gathering at a picnic shelter at Moraine Hills SP.  (AND <br/>
I think you can drive there w/o paying tolls!)<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of camping spots available at Chain o' Lakes for <br/>
the weekend of June 12 yet.  I personally have site #15 in the <br/>
Turner Lake South area reserved.  Since at most I'll have one tent <br/>
and two people, I'd be willing to share the campsite and the costs <br/>
with another group of two with one tent if anyone is interested.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tim, this sounds like a wonderful park with some very nice trails!  <br/>
For those who are not familiar with the location -- it is about an <br/>
hour N-NW of Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of links with some info about the park:<br/>

<br/>
If you want to get an idea of distance/location -- use the city of <br/>
McHenry, IL on MapQuest or another mapping site.<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like an ideal location Tim!  Glad you were able to <br/>
secure a shelter.  Thanks again for all the effort you are putting <br/>
into this gathering -- I'm pumped!<br/>
