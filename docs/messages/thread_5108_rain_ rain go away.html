Not sure where you are in this soggy state, but I am about 10 miles south and slightly west of Lake Delton in a little burg called Reedsburg. Lots of problems here, including our wastewater treatment plant under water, one of our electrical substations under water, our main bridge with structural damage, and large parts of the city still under water. We happen to be on high ground, but our daycare provider is on the other side of the bridge, so the first two days of summer vacation have been daycare-less. Even so, we are well off compared to Loganville, which doesn't connect to anything right now, and waaaay better than Rock Springs, whose entire town is under water. No one can go anywhere except by boat. Big concerns are the Lake Redstone dam, which is iffy, which if breached will send a wall of water 12 feet high to everything downstream (including us), and the dam in Richland county where all the debris from Lake Delton will be in another day or two.<br>
 And lastly, the river in Baraboo, just to our east, is nine feet over flood stage and going up about another 3 feet. <br>
We feel incredibly lucky here, and wish we could help some of the folks who are in real dire straits..<br>
And where in Wisconsin are you?<br>

We're in a suburb west of Milwaukee.  Most things are pretty much OK, <br>
but some people did have water damage in their basements.  It sounds <br>
much worse where you are.<br>
<br>
I know where Reedsburg is - we stayed there once when we were biking <br>
on some of the bike trails in the area and have also found some <br>
letterboxes in the area - including the "Rock Springs" box.  I have a <br>
strong feeling that a few of my letterboxes are under water right <br>
now - I'll have to go check on them when possible.<br>
<br>
I hope you are able to stay in your home and are not threatened by <br>
the rising rivers.  Have you made preparations in case you need to <br>
evacuate?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have a good location - on a hill and over 7 blocks from the river, on 6th street near the old hospital and St. John's church. Water is down today in many places, but still lots of homes flooded. Our bank reopened today, as did our lawyer's office and our day care. My seven-year-old is going to humane society day camp this week, and they were supposed to go to the Big Cat rescue place on Tuesday and couldn't due to flooding. If it doesn't rain tonight they may get to go tomorrow and he is really looking forward to that.<br>
There were about 35 families evacuated to a shelter here. We had been out driving around after the rain stopped and noticed that the elementary school where Elan goes has tremendous flooding in all the grassy areas, almost up to the front door. We hadn't been home even an hour when they announced that they were setting up the shelter at, guess where, the elementary school. What a kick!<br>
As I said before, we here in Reedsburg were lucky comparedto Rock Springs, LaValle, Lake Delton and so many others.<br>
I actually grew up in the Milwaukee area in a suburb called South Milwaukee. Lived in Milwaukee for a while also while going to school at MSOE. Even worked at Boston Store downtown there. Are you in Brookfield? Glad to hear you're OK. If you get out this way again, perhaps we can meet. And I also hope to be looking for some of your boxessoon.<br>
Stay dry,<br>
