I didn't see the "mysterious iron hook" listed in the clues, but found the<br/>
letterbox because it was laying on the side of the trail in pieces. <br/>
Luckily, the plastic bag everything was in held up fairly well.  It looks<br/>
like it had been ravaged by hungry critters.  The tupperware container<br/>
also has a crack in the bottom of it.  I camo duct taped the bottom of the<br/>
box, inside and out, and I triple bagged the stamp and log when I put it<br/>
back together.  It is now hidden under some sturdy rocks next to the tree<br/>
with the long roots.<br/>
Also, the log book is full.<br/>
<br/>
MATT - Please let me know if I can help with anything (replace the<br/>
container, send you the old logbook &amp; put a new one in, etc.)<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
