                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Thanks for the great response on the bookbinding meet idea.  <br/>
I've received several e-mails in addition to the list comments and <br/>
feel there is definitely enough interest to move forward on this.<br/>
<br/>
I am working on getting the details in place and will post all of <br/>
the information as soon as I can.<br/>
<br/>
I tentatively have enough people to do the workshops, but if there <br/>
are others who may be willing to lead a workshop, please e-mail me <br/>
privately in case some of the others are not able to work with the <br/>
date, location, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know at this point how limited the attendance will be as it <br/>
is largely dependent on the meeting place and feedback from the <br/>
workshop leaders as to what is a comfortable class size for them.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would appreciate additional feedback on -- are there any <br/>
particular types of books/bindings you are interested in learning?<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned...<br/>
