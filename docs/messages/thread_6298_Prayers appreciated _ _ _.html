Meeting him was certainly a highlight for me!! I planted a box last August  <br/>
in Galena, as I was carving it, I kept thinking of Fred (as it reminded me <br/>
of  his Ode to a Rose stamp). So, as I finished carving it and planted it, I <br/>
 dedicated to Krait.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, here it is half a year later and I don't have the clues up <br/>
 . . . I was hoping Leaping Lizards could help me with that ;-)<br/>
<br/>
All kidding aside, tell Krait that we're thinking of and praying for  him!!<br/>
