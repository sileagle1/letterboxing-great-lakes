                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many of you were around when we hosted the 2006 GLG at Lapham Peak, with the "Wandering in Wonderland" theme.  Most boxes remained as permanent boxes, but a few were temporary and were pulled after a few days or a month.<br>
<br>
Acorn had a series of 3 temporary boxes, 2 of which disappeared but one survived.  She recently gave the stamp to us and we replanted it yesterday w/a new logbook.  So if you never found this box 7 years ago, you now have another Alice in Wonderland themed box to hunt for.  Clues are on LBNA.<br>

P.S.  We have 3 more of Acorn's old boxes to replant, 1 in WI and 2 in IL.  <br>
