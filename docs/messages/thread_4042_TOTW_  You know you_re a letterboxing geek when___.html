..........you've put together a binder with all the clues and <br/>
logbooks to the boxes you've placed.  <br/>
<br/>
We've placed some letterboxes (not as many as some, but a decent <br/>
number) and have some filled-up logbooks that we removed from the <br/>
boxes.  THose logbooks were scattered around the house in various <br/>
locations, and were just asking to get misplaced or (horrors) <br/>
recycled during a cleaning frenzy.  So I decided to put a binder <br/>
together.  For each letterbox (or series) that we've placed, I <br/>
printed out a copy of the clues and put a copy of the stamped image <br/>
on the clues.  Then I put each set of clues in one of those plastic <br/>
sheet protectors that fit into a binder.  Then I slipped the filled-<br/>
up logbooks into that plastic gizmo along with the clues.  Now I can <br/>
easily look at things whenever I want--it is nice to see everyone's <br/>
stamps and comments.  I have the binder on the shelf with my <br/>
scrapbooks (which is another addiction--I mean hobby!)<br/>

 BirdWoman/Waltzing Pigs, I do this exact same thing. It's almost <br/>
creepy! :o) I always stamp the top right corner of the clue sheet and <br/>
put them in either the found or planted section! I scrapbook too, <br/>
maybe that's why we do this?<br/>

1.  You make a list of EVERYONE signed up for the event.<br/>
<br/>
2. You begin your excel spreadsheet weeks in advance of a big gathering, indicating <br/>
letterboxer's name, name of the PT, Clues and finally a column for your answer.<br/>
<br/>
3. You check back daily to see if anyone new has signed up for the event.<br/>
<br/>
4. You study the spreadsheet every day.<br/>
<br/>
5.  You lose your spreadsheet on the way to the event.<br/>
<br/>
6.  You still manage to remember which PT goes with which letterboxer and pick up a few <br/>
at the event.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Has anyone seen how long the list is getting for GLG 2007?  I think I saw 170 last night at <br/>
AQ.  My lists of letterboxers' PT's is running at 41.  I now appreciate Martini Man and <br/>
Wisconsin Hiker's decision to forego them.<br/>

And yes, I did color coordinate my list and it does make it easier to <br/>
keep track.  I also have my clues of boxes to find in binders divided <br/>
by area.  A lot of the boxes close to me are mapped out already so I <br/>
can grab those pages for a last minute trip.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have several maps -- a Michigan map, a detail map of just West Michigan (my home area), a detail map of the U.P., a map of the greater Chicago area, the greater Detroit area and then several small city maps -- Kalamazoo, Lansing, Ann Arbor, Flint.  It is really cool to see the maps with all the pins on, but it is very difficult to keep up with the "boxes yet to find," especially in areas where there are many boxes.  As my maps become more saturated with plants and find (different color pins for mystery boxes), I have been considering redoing them and not marking the boxes yet to find with pins.  I have also considered taking down some of the smaller city maps to make room for a U.S.map.<br/>

  WOW, that is a really great idea!! My kids would love that, to see <br/>
  where we have been and where we want to go. Of course if I had my way <br/>
  the entire US map would be covered with "yet to find" pins : )<br/>
