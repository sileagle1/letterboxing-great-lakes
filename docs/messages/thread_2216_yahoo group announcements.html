                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, thanks FungusWoman for passing that along -- I had no idea that group existed either.  A couple of the messages were broadcast on the home page of all groups, but the others ones -- I was wondering "how does she know these things" when you posted them.  I have joined the alerts groups also.<br>

Thanks!<br>
