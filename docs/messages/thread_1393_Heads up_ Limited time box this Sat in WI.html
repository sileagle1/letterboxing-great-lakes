<br>
Ok, so it's the first weekend I have off from school, and do I get to<br>
go letterboxing? NOOOOOOOOOOO! I get stuck hosting a rummage sale<br>
instead...<br>
<br>
So for all you letterboxers that also can't pass up a rummage sale (or<br>
if you just want to get a limited time only box), my wife conceded to<br>
one of my wishes, and is allowing me to hide a letterbox in our<br>
rummage sale!<br>
<br>
The rummage sale is at our place in Shorewood, WI, this Saturday from<br>
9am to 5pm. Where exactly? Well, that will be part of the clues.<br>
<br>
Please don't feel you need to buy anything at all - I just want some<br>
letterboxing comaradary while I'm stuck at home. Come and snoop for<br>
the box, stamp in, do an exchange with me if we've never met, and<br>
maybe pick up one of the dozen hitchhikers I currently have (I REALLY<br>
need to get out and box)!<br>
<br>
I'm still working on the clues, so look for them to be updated on the<br>
webpage on Friday - they should be done by then.<br>
<br>
(Also, if you can't make it this weekend, word has it that we have so<br>
much stuff to sell that we'll probably need to have yet another<br>
rummage sale later this summer.)<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
Dragon<br>
