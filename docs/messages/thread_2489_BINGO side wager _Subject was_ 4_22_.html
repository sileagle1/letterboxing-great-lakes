Azobox, does this mean you'll be awarding the prize to YOURSELF??? <br>
<br>
Congratulations to you and to Brown Rabbit!<br>

T_J, you are indeed correct in your observation that the "Anthony..."<br>
clue was the last one posted. And that person(s) is the Side-Wagers<br>
winner!<br>
<br>
(And....er...uhmmmm. it is *not* azobox).<br>
<br>
I've actually spent some time trying to figure out a new<br>
Side-Side-Wagers game in which I'd challenge anyone who wanted to<br>
guess the real trail names that I've mangled over the past four months. <br>
<br>
(How many did *you* figure out?  Did you get that last one?)<br>
<br>
Obviously people knew their own BINGO dates and could deduce their<br>
encrypted trailname as it appeared here. In some cases there was<br>
discussion here about who the current player was.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure that the true winners know who they are and know that<br>
they've won. <br>
<br>
I'll give the winner a couple hours to come out of the box....if they<br>
don't, I'll announce it here later today.<br>
<br>
Their prize goes in the mail today.<br>
<br>
Since I didn't have a chance in the world of winning BINGO I'm glad I<br>
had the diversion of Side-Wagers to keep me busy.<br>
