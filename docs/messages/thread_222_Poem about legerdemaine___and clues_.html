<br/>
Just wanted to clarify that the Legerdemaine poem is on my site. <br/>
L'ger emailed it to me - the poem is a result of finding it in my <br/>
email after a weekend of finding a L'ger box!<br/>
<br/>
That clue is hidden somewhere on my site! Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

I can't say for certain what area of the country this particular box <br/>

lucky enough to come across one some day in the future.<br/>
