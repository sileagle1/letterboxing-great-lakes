<br>
Just wanted to clarify that the Legerdemaine poem is on my site. <br>
L'ger emailed it to me - the poem is a result of finding it in my <br>
email after a weekend of finding a L'ger box!<br>
<br>
That clue is hidden somewhere on my site! Good luck.<br>
<br>
Have fun and just get out there & box!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is actually Mark Pepe's site.  Legerdemaine passed along a clue <br>
to a letterbox for Mark to hide somewhere on his site.  This is the <br>
only place you can find the clue to this box.  The poem is a clue to <br>
the clue.<br>
<br>
I can't say for certain what area of the country this particular box <br>
is hidden in, but even though legerdemaine hails from Maine, his <br>
boxes are sprinkled across the entire country.  So you just may be <br>
lucky enough to come across one some day in the future.<br>
