on the front, and on the back "Great <br>

Cooler by the Lake in Illinois" on the <br>

Vote on location for MI Fall Gathering.  Event date is <br>
Saturday, October 22, 2005.  Location options include:<br>
<br>
Yankee Springs Rec Area:  Located just a short distance <br>
off U.S. 131 between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo -- good <br>
central location.  There are several miles of prime trails <br>
at this park, however there are no current letterboxes in <br>
this area.  Park is open year-round and the shelter is <br>
available.  Shelter is roof, cement floor w/ half-walls, <br>
includes grills and electricity.  Problem:  by October the <br>
plumbing is turned off so there is no water and the modern <br>
restrooms are closed.  Nearest outhouses are about 1/4 <br>
mile from the shelter.<br>
<br>
Hoffmaster SP:  Located at the south end of Muskegon <br>
county along Lake Michigan -- not as centrally located.  <br>
There are also several miles of nice trails at this park <br>
with a few letterboxes already in place and many others in <br>
the surrounding area.  Park is open year-round and the <br>
shelter is available.  Shelter is roof w/ cement floor, <br>
includes 1 large grill, a hand pump for water and a large <br>
stone fireplace in the shelter -- there is NO <br>
electricity.  No modern restrooms in this area of the <br>
park, but outhouses are located very near the shelter.<br>
 <br>
<br>
  o Yankee Springs Rec Area <br>
  o Hoffmaster State Park <br>

The gathering "Mo' Boxin" workshop that Mark Pepe gave about<br>
Dartmoor Letterboxing was a specifically requested.  It has<br>
been suggested that the 2006 Great Lakes gathering take<br>
place in Dartmoor.  Would you be interested in going? Keep<br>
the following in mind when you vote:<br>
<br>
1) We would go for at least a week in late June of 2006.<br>
2) June might not be the BEST time to go (weather and<br>
price-wise), but there are a number of letterboxers that<br>
can't go in the fall when the trips are usually planned.<br>
3) Mark Pepe is not taking a group until the fall of 2007. <br>
<br>
  o Definately yes! <br>
  o Most likely! <br>
  o Maybe, but most likely no. <br>
  o Definately not. <br>

For the Holy Grail project, Team Bindlestiff would like to<br>
contribute boxes that are phrases from the movie, since we<br>
think that is part of what "makes" it so funny. We're not<br>
including some of the ones that might be offensive to tender<br>
eyes (even though they might be some of the best lines)<br>
Choices with // means it would be 1 box with bonus clues to<br>
the "response" box inside. These lines are listed in no<br>
particular order. Please select up to 6 of your favorites<br>
from the movie. (7 if you also choose #25) <br>

picnic shelter. There will be signs to help you navigate to the <br>
meeting spot. There are 58 miles of trails in this great area. Many <br>
of our members have stamps already planted so bring your clues to <br>
these boxes and there are several new boxes planted in honor of this <br>
event plus a special event stamp just for attending. Don't forget to <br>
bring personal travelers or word of mouth boxes if you wish.<br>
Hope to see some new faces and some regulars too!<br>

Since no one is rushing to post their Grail boxes on LBNA or AQ (at least I haven't noticed any), what should be done about the announcing of the clues to the general public?<br>
 <br>
<br>
  o Post the clues now - we're almost done <br>
  o Wait until the project is completely complete <br>
  o Dragon should go ahead and post the clues to all the boxes on LBNA and AQ for everyone <br>
  o The box creators should post the clues on LBNA and AQ <br>
  o The box placers should post the clues on LBNA and AQ <br>

Bring it on! Mud was my enticement to my toddler to plant a series of <br>
6 this Tuesday and Wednesday in Ohio. She was happy the whole time as <br>
long as there was mud to play in. So, a stream would make her very <br>
happy on a hunt!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is nothing that would prevent me from finding a letterbox!  I'd find a way.  When I'm on a mission, I am determined to find that box.  I'd go back several times if necessary; better prepared each time.  <br>
<br>
Fungus Woman remembers, because how will we ever forget our St. Nick's experience.  One of the clues at the St. Nick's Gathering had a group of us marching through a large swamp area of semi-frozen sewage, but that didn't stop our group.  Others gave up the search for that box, but not us.  And I'll never forget "THE SMELL" or the fact that my boots weren't tall enough to prevent the frozen sewage from coming in over the top of my boots, and the fact that my feet were freezing as I marched on with icy water sloshing around in my boots, and the cold weather, and the reality of hypothermia etc.  After I warned people that I might start experiencing stages of hypothermia, I made a judgment call that I had 20 minutes max. to find that box and get back to the base camp to get the freezing water filled boots off my feet before my body went into shock!  Yes, we reached the letterbox.  And yes, my feet survived.  Thanks again to FW.  <br>
<br>
So my response to the poll is  yes to all the options!   <br>
<br>
 Sometimes there is a challenge to finding a letterbox.  Anyone can find a drive by lettterbox.  When a box is a challenge to find, that's the memory that remains and that's part of the fun -sharing the story.  My feet still get cold thinking about that "fun?" experience!  <br>

  Would you be willing to "cross" a small creek or wade through a mud ditch to get to a letterbox? Are you willing to hike through a state game area that is remote and muddy? <br>
<br>
  o Wade through a creek (knee deep) <br>
  o Slop through a muddy path <br>
  o Follow an unmarked trail<br>

When I had Verizon, that big gang on TV that was supposed to have been<br>
following me around got lost someplace around Appleton.  They must've gotten<br>
off at a different exit than I did.<br>
<br>
In all fairness to Wisconsin, tho, I always lost the big gang around Peoria,<br>
IL too, so they didn't seem to like southern Illinois any more than northern<br>
Wisconsin.<br>

Haven't tried my T-Mobile north of Appleton yet.<br>

It's a great get away location to camp, hike, bike, shop, golf, eat, fish, canoe, commune with nature, or just relax.  And for letterboxers who 'have the clues'....(don't get caught).... there are some great letterboxes in the area!  One of my favorites is Mink River.  It's a challenge, but worth the quest!<br>

kind of like the one about treasures -- maybe Maritime Treasures,<br>

also lend itself to more specific interpretations, such as shipwrecks,<br>
natural resources, lighthouses, etc.<br>

LbGLK group:<br>

We need a overall theme for the 2009 Great Lakes Gathering to be held at Pokagon State Park on Saturday, May 30, 2009.  The suggested theme, All Things Green, would give us a lot of possibility for event-themed boxes.  If you plan to attend, please vote your opinion now. <br>
<br>
  o I like it!  Let the creativity begin. <br>
  o I don't like it; I'll suggest a new event theme. <br>
  o Sounds fine/I can live with it. <br>
  o Don't make me vote. <br>

Enter your vote today!  A new poll has been created for the <br>
LbGLK group:<br>
<br>
It has been suggested that the date of the annual Great Lakes<br>
Gathering, which has typically been held on the Saturday after<br>
Memorial Day, be modified to make it easier to reserve park<br>
facilities and to make attendance accessible to a wider range<br>
of people. <br>
<br>
  o Leave the date as it is, consistent from one year to the next (the Saturday after Memorial Day) <br>
  o Choose a new date and make it the consistent date for the next rotation of GL states (6 years) <br>
  o Let the event host choose a date that works for them within the May-September range <br>
  o Let the GL list members vote on the gathering date each year <br>

We're considering having Pathtags made for the GLG in June. Due to the cost we would like to poll the group as to wether or not we should go through with an order and also the costs. <br>

  o No, don't invest in the Pathtags. <br>
