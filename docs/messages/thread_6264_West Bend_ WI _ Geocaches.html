=========================================<br/>
Thank you to everyone who attended the 2nd Annual West Bend $1000 Cache Ba$h and all the volunteers who helped to make it a huge success! Be sure to mark your calendar for next years Cache Ba$h, August 13th to 15th, 2010!<br/>
The 2nd Annual West Bend $1000 Cache Ba$h brought together over 1,000 geocachers for a weekend of fun. Geocachers came for the festivities, door prizes and great geocaching amid West Bend's many natural areas, trails and historic sites.<br/>
<br/>
The new permanent caches that were launched for the event will remain permanent caches, bringing West Bend's cache count of more than 500 caches within a 7-mile radius. This abundance of caches and the unique mix of urban and rural caches has given West Bend the welcome reputation as the "Geocaching Capital of the Midwest." <br/>
==========================================<br/>
<br/>
Holy-jamoly!  500 caches within a 7-mile radius!!!  They even have a little promo/advertisement video on the webpage: http://www.westbendcache.com<br/>
<br/>
Seems unlikely that I'd find a spot for a letterbox that didn't already have a geocache in it.<br/>
