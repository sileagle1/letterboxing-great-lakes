                    <div class="plaintext-content">We automatically assumed that our nieces and nephews would want their own<br/>
stamps and logbooks when they started at ages 7, 10 &amp; 10.  The older two<br/>
picked out their own store bought stamps and made up their own trail names.<br/>
After losing a variety of store bought and handmade stamps, I carved a<br/>
signature stamp for the youngest with his approval of design &amp; name. Having<br/>
everything separate has worked well, since they sometimes like to choose a<br/>
different color for stamping something in their own logbook and they have a<br/>
more individual involvement with stamping in, etc.  Our niece (now 12) has<br/>
even started writing her own little comments in the logbooks when we stamp<br/>
in.  We don't always have the same kids with us each time, so each of their<br/>
logbooks is slightly different.  However SpringChick is definitely on target<br/>
when she says it will take more time!  Sometimes we have had 5 kids with us<br/>
and it does take quite a while to get everyone logged in.  It is really<br/>
confusing when we find a hitchhiker and even though we try to be organized,<br/>
on more than one occasion we've discovered (after we're gone) that someone<br/>
has missed stamping into something!<br/>
<br/>
They are each planning to carve something for the Haunted Harvest Gathering<br/>
and are excited about hiding their first boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have 2 kids (9 and 11) and started letterboxing a year ago.  We <br/>
decided that each of us would have our own stamp and logbook <br/>
(instead of a family stamp and logbook) for several reasons.  First <br/>
of all, we don't always letterbox all together--my husband insists <br/>
on working instead of going on all of our little summer <br/>
expeditions!  Plus, I wanted the kids to have their own logbooks for <br/>
when they leave the nest in the (more rapidly than I can believe) <br/>
not-so-distant future.  In fact, on one letterboxing trip this <br/>
summer (Schoolhouse Rocks!), the kids mentioned that they would be <br/>
taking their grandkids letterboxing someday and that it would be <br/>
cool to show them the logbooks they had as kids. Yeah!!<br/>
<br/>
Stamping can be a bit chaotic with 4 of us stamping in, but we're <br/>
trying to get a system down for inking and stamping.  My daughter <br/>
even writes in the placer's logbook on occasion.  <br/>
<br/>
We did decide to create a family stamp ("Waltzing Pigs") for when we <br/>
place boxes, since that is a family affair for finding the hiding <br/>
spot and creating the clues, etc. We've only placed one box so far, <br/>
but another one is soon to come.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As the highly addicted to LBing mother of 2...here is my experience.<br/>
When we first started out, there was one stamp - the family!  We stamp our <br/>
clue sheet - so we just kept them all in a binder.  The binder was heavily <br/>
looked over on a regular basis.<br/>
Then each of the kids wanted a stamp...they started out at personal <br/>
travelers, but as soon as they had them in their hot little hands, they <br/>
wanted to stamp every box we found.<br/>
"the skull" (8 y/o boy) carved his own stamp and is so proud of that little <br/>
thing - he can't wait to stamp into every single box we get!  He is also the <br/>
2nd most addicted to LBing, and the 2 of us have gone together on many <br/>
hunts.<br/>
"Daddy's Girl" (11 y/o girl) wanted words for her stamp, and so I carved it <br/>
for her.  She is less interested in making sure her stamp is in every box we <br/>
find...and mostly would rather stay home and paint her nails if given the <br/>
opportunity.<br/>
They both have their own log books now (thank you Santa) and while "the <br/>
skull" is eager to fill his himself..."Daddy's Girl" just wants us to take <br/>
her logbook along for the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
In short - my sons hand carved stamp is his pride and joy!  He even took it <br/>
to school yesterday to show what he did on his summer vacation.  He can't <br/>
wait to stamp in and get logged.<br/>
PLUS - when we've been at gathering's, he has his own stamp to exchange with <br/>
people, and this keeps him busy much of the day.<br/>
<br/>
YES - it's busy when stamping in to a found box....but in the end, it's so <br/>
worth it - we don't even think about it anymore.<br/>

&gt;When we first started out, there was one stamp - the family!  We stamp our<br/>
&gt;clue sheet - so we just kept them all in a binder.  The binder was heavily<br/>
&gt;looked over on a regular basis.<br/>
&gt;Then each of the kids wanted a stamp...they started out at personal<br/>
&gt;travelers, but as soon as they had them in their hot little hands, they<br/>
&gt;wanted to stamp every box we found.<br/>
&gt;"the skull" (8 y/o boy) carved his own stamp and is so proud of that little<br/>
&gt;thing - he can't wait to stamp into every single box we get!  He is also the<br/>
&gt;2nd most addicted to LBing, and the 2 of us have gone together on many<br/>
&gt;hunts.<br/>
&gt;"Daddy's Girl" (11 y/o girl) wanted words for her stamp, and so I carved it<br/>
&gt;for her.  She is less interested in making sure her stamp is in every box we<br/>
&gt;find...and mostly would rather stay home and paint her nails if given the<br/>
&gt;opportunity.<br/>
&gt;They both have their own log books now (thank you Santa) and while "the<br/>
&gt;skull" is eager to fill his himself..."Daddy's Girl" just wants us to take<br/>
&gt;her logbook along for the stamp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In short - my sons hand carved stamp is his pride and joy!  He even took it<br/>
&gt;to school yesterday to show what he did on his summer vacation.  He can't<br/>
&gt;wait to stamp in and get logged.<br/>
&gt;PLUS - when we've been at gathering's, he has his own stamp to exchange with<br/>
&gt;people, and this keeps him busy much of the day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;YES - it's busy when stamping in to a found box....but in the end, it's so<br/>
&gt;worth it - we don't even think about it anymore.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 08 Sep 2005 00:48:01 -0000<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     As a new (and highly addicted) letterboxer I have a question on<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;trail name etiquette.  I posed the question to Grandvilla and it was<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;suggested to repeat my question here.  Here goes...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     I discovered letterboxing through Springchick's Flickr<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;photostream and introduced it to my family.  We have hunted a few<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;boxes together but I have hunted many by myself.  For the boxes that I<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;have hunted with the family, I created a stamp and we use our family<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;name when logging in. For the boxes I have found on my own, I created<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;a personal stamp and use the trail name of Robin of Loxley.  Is this<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;proper form?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     Grandvilla also had a great suggestion of letting the kids create<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;their own stamps and having them do as much of the carving as they are<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;able to.  Then they will also be able to stamp in themselves.  I also<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;thought it would be fun if they had their own log books to use.  Any<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;thoughts?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;     On another note, I have placed my first box this evening in the<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Allegan State Game Area and I am very excited about it.  I have yet to<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;write up the clues and I am a bit nervous in that I want to make them<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;"good" ones.  Wish me luck.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks everyone.<br/>

&gt;   &gt;When we first started out, there was one stamp - the family!  We stamp our<br/>
&gt;   &gt;clue sheet - so we just kept them all in a binder.  The binder was heavily<br/>
&gt;   &gt;looked over on a regular basis.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;Then each of the kids wanted a stamp...they started out at personal<br/>
&gt;   &gt;travelers, but as soon as they had them in their hot little hands, they<br/>
&gt;   &gt;wanted to stamp every box we found.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;"the skull" (8 y/o boy) carved his own stamp and is so proud of that <br/>
&gt; little<br/>
&gt;   &gt;thing - he can't wait to stamp into every single box we get!  He is <br/>
&gt; also the<br/>
&gt;   &gt;2nd most addicted to LBing, and the 2 of us have gone together on many<br/>
&gt;   &gt;hunts.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;"Daddy's Girl" (11 y/o girl) wanted words for her stamp, and so I <br/>
&gt; carved it<br/>
&gt;   &gt;for her.  She is less interested in making sure her stamp is in every <br/>
&gt; box we<br/>
&gt;   &gt;find...and mostly would rather stay home and paint her nails if given the<br/>
&gt;   &gt;opportunity.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;They both have their own log books now (thank you Santa) and while "the<br/>
&gt;   &gt;skull" is eager to fill his himself..."Daddy's Girl" just wants us to take<br/>
&gt;   &gt;her logbook along for the stamp.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;In short - my sons hand carved stamp is his pride and joy!  He even <br/>
&gt; took it<br/>
&gt;   &gt;to school yesterday to show what he did on his summer vacation.  He can't<br/>
&gt;   &gt;wait to stamp in and get logged.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;PLUS - when we've been at gathering's, he has his own stamp to <br/>
&gt; exchange with<br/>
&gt;   &gt;people, and this keeps him busy much of the day.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;YES - it's busy when stamping in to a found box....but in the end, it's so<br/>
&gt;   &gt;worth it - we don't even think about it anymore.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt;Subject: [LbGLK] Trail name etiquette<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 08 Sep 2005 00:48:01 -0000<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;     As a new (and highly addicted) letterboxer I have a question on<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;trail name etiquette.  I posed the question to Grandvilla and it was<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;suggested to repeat my question here.  Here goes...<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;     I discovered letterboxing through Springchick's Flickr<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;photostream and introduced it to my family.  We have hunted a few<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;boxes together but I have hunted many by myself.  For the boxes that I<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;have hunted with the family, I created a stamp and we use our family<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;name when logging in. For the boxes I have found on my own, I created<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;a personal stamp and use the trail name of Robin of Loxley.  Is this<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;proper form?<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;     Grandvilla also had a great suggestion of letting the kids create<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;their own stamps and having them do as much of the carving as they are<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;able to.  Then they will also be able to stamp in themselves.  I also<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;thought it would be fun if they had their own log books to use.  Any<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;thoughts?<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;     On another note, I have placed my first box this evening in the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;Allegan State Game Area and I am very excited about it.  I have yet to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;write up the clues and I am a bit nervous in that I want to make them<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;"good" ones.  Wish me luck.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;Thanks everyone.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
