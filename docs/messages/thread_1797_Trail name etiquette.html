                    <div class="plaintext-content">We automatically assumed that our nieces and nephews would want their own<br>
stamps and logbooks when they started at ages 7, 10 & 10.  The older two<br>
picked out their own store bought stamps and made up their own trail names.<br>
After losing a variety of store bought and handmade stamps, I carved a<br>
signature stamp for the youngest with his approval of design & name. Having<br>
everything separate has worked well, since they sometimes like to choose a<br>
different color for stamping something in their own logbook and they have a<br>
more individual involvement with stamping in, etc.  Our niece (now 12) has<br>
even started writing her own little comments in the logbooks when we stamp<br>
in.  We don't always have the same kids with us each time, so each of their<br>
logbooks is slightly different.  However SpringChick is definitely on target<br>
when she says it will take more time!  Sometimes we have had 5 kids with us<br>
and it does take quite a while to get everyone logged in.  It is really<br>
confusing when we find a hitchhiker and even though we try to be organized,<br>
on more than one occasion we've discovered (after we're gone) that someone<br>
has missed stamping into something!<br>
<br>
They are each planning to carve something for the Haunted Harvest Gathering<br>
and are excited about hiding their first boxes.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have 2 kids (9 and 11) and started letterboxing a year ago.  We <br>
decided that each of us would have our own stamp and logbook <br>
(instead of a family stamp and logbook) for several reasons.  First <br>
of all, we don't always letterbox all together--my husband insists <br>
on working instead of going on all of our little summer <br>
expeditions!  Plus, I wanted the kids to have their own logbooks for <br>
when they leave the nest in the (more rapidly than I can believe) <br>
not-so-distant future.  In fact, on one letterboxing trip this <br>
summer (Schoolhouse Rocks!), the kids mentioned that they would be <br>
taking their grandkids letterboxing someday and that it would be <br>
cool to show them the logbooks they had as kids. Yeah!!<br>
<br>
Stamping can be a bit chaotic with 4 of us stamping in, but we're <br>
trying to get a system down for inking and stamping.  My daughter <br>
even writes in the placer's logbook on occasion.  <br>
<br>
We did decide to create a family stamp ("Waltzing Pigs") for when we <br>
place boxes, since that is a family affair for finding the hiding <br>
spot and creating the clues, etc. We've only placed one box so far, <br>
but another one is soon to come.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As the highly addicted to LBing mother of 2...here is my experience.<br>
When we first started out, there was one stamp - the family!  We stamp our <br>
clue sheet - so we just kept them all in a binder.  The binder was heavily <br>
looked over on a regular basis.<br>
Then each of the kids wanted a stamp...they started out at personal <br>
travelers, but as soon as they had them in their hot little hands, they <br>
wanted to stamp every box we found.<br>
"the skull" (8 y/o boy) carved his own stamp and is so proud of that little <br>
thing - he can't wait to stamp into every single box we get!  He is also the <br>
2nd most addicted to LBing, and the 2 of us have gone together on many <br>
hunts.<br>
"Daddy's Girl" (11 y/o girl) wanted words for her stamp, and so I carved it <br>
for her.  She is less interested in making sure her stamp is in every box we <br>
find...and mostly would rather stay home and paint her nails if given the <br>
opportunity.<br>
They both have their own log books now (thank you Santa) and while "the <br>
skull" is eager to fill his himself..."Daddy's Girl" just wants us to take <br>
her logbook along for the stamp.<br>
<br>
In short - my sons hand carved stamp is his pride and joy!  He even took it <br>
to school yesterday to show what he did on his summer vacation.  He can't <br>
wait to stamp in and get logged.<br>
PLUS - when we've been at gathering's, he has his own stamp to exchange with <br>
people, and this keeps him busy much of the day.<br>
<br>
YES - it's busy when stamping in to a found box....but in the end, it's so <br>
worth it - we don't even think about it anymore.<br>
