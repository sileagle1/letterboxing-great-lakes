                    <div class="plaintext-content">To each their own!  Personally I really enjoy a challenging hike and if I knew it were coming probably wouldn't think twice about wading through a creek (neither would my dogs!).  I would, however be hesitant about thick mud (I'm not too keen on mud, even if the dogs think it's great).  I don't know that it would necessarily deter me from a box (or even just a good hike, no letterboxes involved).<br/>

<br/>
You are absolutely right!  And for some of us, enjoying the great outdoors involves mud and crud.  At least once in a while.  WI Hiker and Martini Man really love the boxes that involve long scenic hikes and aren't so fond of urban or drive by's.  On the other hand, Flying Dragon really enjoys urban letterboxing and is somewhat less thrilled at the prospect of hiking 8 miles for a box  (don't get me wrong, he'll be a man on a mission at the gathering in June no matter what the trails throw at him...but it's not what he prefers).  Good thing for them, there's a little something for everyone out there!<br/>

You're right about that!  We also are willing to endure harsh <br/>
conditions in our treks, but DO like to be warned about anything out <br/>
of the ordinary ahead of time.  <br/>
<br/>
Included below is most of a clue for the scariest LB adventure we've <br/>
had so far. We walked down the hill and wore water shoes &amp; swimsuits <br/>
because the clues had provided enough info as to what we would be <br/>
encountering. We had our LB gear in plastic bags in a small pack <br/>
attached shoulder height.  There were huge waves out in the ocean, <br/>
crashing onto the beach and then surging into the channel.  A moment <br/>
later that same water was heading back out to sea, trying to suck us <br/>
out with it!   There were 3 guys ahead of us trying to cross - 1 made <br/>
it but the other 2 decided to give up.  Martini Man then made it <br/>
across with our books, got a large branch to use as a balance (or <br/>
sticking point to hold onto) and came back to help me.  I had the ink <br/>
&amp; stamps in a small pack hooked around my swimsuit strap.  We slowly <br/>
made our way across, leaning to the lagoon, then leaning to the ocean <br/>
as we grasped the stick and fought our way across the strong current.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we did find the box and were the First Finders!<br/>

CLUE:<br/>
This letterbox is located in Waipio Valley on the Big Island of <br/>
Hawaii. After you reach Waipio Valley Lookout, park and enjoy the <br/>
views. Then, venture down the 25% grade, 4WD only, single lane road <br/>
with EXTREME CAUTION. This is a very narrow, single lane road, and <br/>
drivers on their way up have the right of way. If you don't look out <br/>
and pull over for drivers coming up (they have periodic pull-over <br/>
spots), you have to back up the STEEP hill to let them by. Don't let <br/>
your brakes overheat - use LOW gear. If the road is wet, I would not <br/>
recommend driving. You may be able to walk down, but check the posted <br/>
signs first. <br/>
<br/>
Once you have reached the bottom, take the road that leads to the <br/>
beach (take a hard right at the bottom). There are several [muddy] <br/>
roads, but just stay in the middle. There are usually cars parked at <br/>
the beach. Park anywhere and proceed to the beach where a channel <br/>
separates the sand into two beaches. Cross this channel WITH EXTREME <br/>
CAUTION. It can be very deep. When I crossed it, it was about 4.5 <br/>
feet deep. Swim across, if you wish, just make sure you have a <br/>
waterproof pack for your letterboxing log book! <br/>
<br/>
After crossing the channel, walk along waterfront until you see the <br/>
first "lone" pine tree. Take a left up the small incline at <br/>
the "lone" pine tree, through a stone path to the dirt car path, <br/>
heading west. At the first grassy knoll with three pine trees, I saw <br/>
a bunch of butterflies frolicking in the shady paradise. <br/>
<br/>
Follow the road until you see some old trees "sleeping". AT 220 <br/>
degrees there are some palm trees and twin "multi-trunk" trees. Take <br/>
35 steps through the grass, toward the "multi-trunk trees". At the <br/>
base of the "multi-trunk" tree on the west side is the letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the peaceful paradise before heading back up the steep hill. <br/>
You can travel around the valley if you desire. <br/>

WOW!  You're my heroes!  I've been "following" you all around SE <br/>
Michigan with my finds, but no way in the world I could do that <br/>
one!  Sounds scary!  I wonder if there were any second-finders!<br/>
