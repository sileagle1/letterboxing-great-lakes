plans for the 2006 travel season.<br/>
Ports of call at about half the fifteen destinations have been<br/>
reviewed and have been certified for spring and summer tourists. Staff<br/>
is planning site visits at the remaining locations.<br/>
<br/>
Previous and successful travelers are advised that their comments left<br/>
at the boxes thus far certified, have been read and noted. The Travel<br/>
Staff is impressed with the number of visitors' stamps observed.<br/>
<br/>
Comments, both affirmative and disparaging, about a certain "crossing<br/>
point" will be studied. However staff who conducted this week's site<br/>
visits did agree with some visitor comments. Inspectors did not agree<br/>
wth some others. Staff was certainly amused.<br/>
<br/>
More to come in the days/weeks ahead.<br/>
Website updates are planned.<br/>
