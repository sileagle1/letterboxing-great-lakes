much fun. The stamps made for the gathering were amazing! The temp <br>
might have been frigid but everyone was so warm and friendly that we <br>
hardly noticed the cold. Well, okay, that's a lie. I definitely noticed <br>
the cold especially when we were supposed to leave at around 3:30 and <br>
then Hawkeye, my husband, decided we HAD to look for the "It's a <br>
WOnderful Life" series. We found a few of them and some bonus boxes but <br>
at 4:15 with fingers frozen, I threw in the towel. Anyways, thanks, <br>
Dragon, for organizing it. Happy Holidays to everyone!<br>
