Holy Grail  Bridge of Death Clues<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Poison ivy in the area!!!<br/>
Follow the signs to the Chief Shabbona Historical marker off of Route<br/>
30 in Shabbona, Illinois.<br/>
Park by the shelter near the merry-go round and begin walking down the<br/>
road into the woods.  Take the orange trail until it opens into a<br/>
clearing, look to your left and walk into the oval bordered by wooden<br/>
posts.  The number 1848 is significant.  From this number  there will<br/>
be a trail to your left at 200 degrees, walk down this trail until you<br/>
see the bridge that will lead you to "The Bridge of Death". Cross the<br/>
bridge and follow a winding path until just before it makes a<br/>
noticeable ascent and curves to the left.  Look low and to the left to<br/>
find a rather large rock, from this rock, walk about 38 steps up the<br/>
curving hill.  These steps should take you to a point where there is a<br/>
sawed off double trunked tree to your right and a pile of logs to your<br/>
left. Turn off the trail to your left at about 40 degrees and walk<br/>
forward about 18 steps to a large fallen tree.  Your quest will end in<br/>
the roots of the old fallen tree.<br/>
