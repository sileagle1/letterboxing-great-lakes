Thanks to Armadillo Jo, two bentriders, Flagbearer and Full of Heart we <br/>
managed to have a great day letterboxing as well. Here is the scenerio:<br/>
<br/>
First, Potato Creek.... fun little park, kind of expense for out of town <br/>
people, $7 for a one day pass! It also seems that two bentriders have moved <br/>
to NY and are asking someone to adopt this box. Did the list know this? Has <br/>
someone adopted it yet? just FYI as I don't remember reading about it.<br/>
<br/>
Then we had lunch at the Schoop's burger joint which is next to Centennial <br/>
Park. We first did Plymouth Rocks! a three box series. Box one is doing <br/>
well, box two has a destroyed log book - totally soaked and box three was <br/>
not to be found.  Hoosier hysteria and My heart of heart are both well. <br/>
This park is WAY bigger than it looks!<br/>
<br/>
Off to Magnetic park and Bird park.  We were pulled to the magnet without <br/>
hesitation but seems the resident of Bird park might have flown the coupe. <br/>
Very funny location as we started from both ends of the park.<br/>
<br/>
Next to Oakhill cemetary... this place goes on forever! Lots of neat stones <br/>
to see. I was a little upset to see a woman walking her dog there... <br/>
Anyway.... Dem Bones series needs some surgery! Naughty dog got no "head" <br/>
and Pale puppy posse was minus her "left hand" man. You might want to <br/>
rethink your choice of boxes. The M &amp; M containers seem to attract the <br/>
critters and the others are just not water tight. Many of the "pictures" <br/>
were soaked.  Some gave all needs a new home as the box is trashed and <br/>
logbook soaked. Make a difference in the world was wonderful.. what a cool <br/>
stamp!! I was pleasantly surprised to find all these wonderful stamps hand <br/>
carved. With such tough subjects I thought for sure I would find purchased <br/>
stamps... ( I have a personal preference for the hand carved ones) So gold <br/>
stars to everyone in Plymouth, IN.<br/>
<br/>
Let us know if you get a chance to check the missing ones as we will be <br/>
back this week some time.<br/>
We missed New beginnings and will hit that next time we are there. Great <br/>
day for boxing.. though can't decide if it was spring boxing or winter <br/>
boxing.. I prefer to think spring!<br/>
