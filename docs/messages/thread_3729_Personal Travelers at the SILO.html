<br>
I checked the AQ information and once your personal traveler is listed, and then you rsvp to an event listing, the personal traveler should pop up on the listing with that event.  However, we may not have done it in that order, so we're trying to delete the rsvp, leave the personal traveler listed, then go back in and send a new rsvp for the SILO event.  If the personal traveler doesn't appear, then maybe there is a problem at the AQ end.  <br>
<br>
However, the long and detailed way to look up personal travelers is to do a basic search on each person who is listed in the rsvp column of participants planning to attend.  Once you do a basic search on their trail name, you can select 'traveler' and IF they have a traveler, it will appear.  Like I said, this is the long way to pull up the travelers, but it works!  <br>

even Event stamps would normally be hidden the "regular" way and <br>
clues handled at such.  We're posting them on AQ as we are just so <br>
they show up as boxes to be found in their temporary indoor <br>
locations, in many case using the PT format of "answer the question <br>
to receive the stamp" in lieu of a hiding place.  While many of these <br>
stamps may remain PT's after the gathering, I'm guessing others will <br>
take on new incarnations as more conventional Lb's (at least mine <br>
will!).<br>
