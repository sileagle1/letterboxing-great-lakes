I hope to make one of the series permanent, so stay tuned. <br/>

It was great meeting both of you, and seeing Grey Rabbit again.  We <br/>
had fun figuring out the clues to the "Icing Death Dragon Slayer" <br/>
story.  Fortunately it didn't start raining until we were done. :)<br/>
Hope to see you on the trails again sometime.  J-Walkers<br/>
