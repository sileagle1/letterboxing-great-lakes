Good point about the money in the boxes being a potential source of mischief, BTW. I hadn't thought of that (not that I really want to encourage people leaving anything other than stamp images or hitch hikers in my boxes anyway).<br/>

The idea of mystery letterboxers who are simply 'out there' and may not be playing by 'the rules' is a scary thing.  Ex.  You go looking for a letterbox, but forgot your stamp at home.  So, simply take the box home with you to stamp in and then bring it back the next time you get around to it.  YIKES! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What I meant by "not playing by the rules..." was more about taking a box for an extended period of time (like for months!) rather than whether or not they report their Finds.  E-comments aren't necessary, but I do appreciate reports if first aid is needed or a box might be missing.  Yes, I agree, when I do my box maintenance, I enjoy reading the logbook and seeing where the boxers are from...especially people from out of state.   Seems that I'm not the only one to have had a box disappear for along period of time and then to have it reappear.  It's a puzzlement.  <br/>
<br/>
Tonight, it's snowy and icy and that indicates the start of months of winter weather ahead.  I'm glad I was able to get out this weekend and find some boxes. <br/>
