Last fall, I heard a lot of shooting while out letterboxing, so I bought a bright, hunters orange, fleece jacket with a hood. Not very fashionable, but you can see me for miles!!! <br/>

Sound travels for miles and miles, especially in the direction of the blowing wind.  But it never hurts to know where you are hiking before heading out on a trail.  <br/>

  Today I wore bright orange on my letterboxing outing. It is the THIRD<br/>
  time I have letterboxed to the sound of gunshots in the distance.<br/>
