  Thanks!  Tried to find #2 today - no luck.  I have a tendency to <br>
2nd guess myself, but I'm pretty sure we found the right gnarly tree -<br>
 even climbed it to check for a box! - but no luck.  :(  <br>
<br>
I/we consoled myself by going for 5 other boxes. Including the <br>
surprising All Fool's Day.   I told my family that today I saw the <br>
Loch Ness Monster, went to Stonehenge and the Bermuda Triangle - I <br>
thought I was funny - they said, "Oh, you must've gone LBing <br>
today..."  NO, I AM NOT OBSESSED - really.  Of course it helps to <br>
have lots of LB's in metro Milwaukee.  I did reach 150 finds today - <br>
Letterboxing Blues was the lucky/unlucky box!  How fitting! <br>
<br>
Tomorrow we have a soccer tournament in Verona, and the kids <br>
are "graciously" "agreeing" to look for one box.  I'm wondering how I <br>
cna sneak in more - Sneaky Mom will find a way!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">wow, congrats.  I put the boxes as unavailable because of several <br>
reports that some where missing.  Box number one is in the hands of <br>
one family that will be returning it to its place, it was waterlogged <br>

3 being found unintentionally.  I have had intentions on making it <br>
out there all summer to get them replaced but I have not been able to <br>
do so.  So I have them listed as unavailable until I can do so.  <br>
Thanks to everyone who is interested in this particular series, and I <br>
will try and get them fixed before winter.<br>

P.S.  Hi everyone, long time no see!<br>

I'll put the box back before the 10th Anniversary Gathering (Gotta <br>
