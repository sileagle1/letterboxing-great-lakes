does appear that Rain Man Tim is the winner. My notes indicate that<br/>
the next posting would be on the 14th so Rain Man is still holding<br/>
forth. Therefore it's gonna be Prize Central in Wisconsin!!<br/>
Congratulations.<br/>
<br/>
I'll work out the details when I'm back in MI at the home office.<br/>

Aww!<br/>
<br/>
I'm humbling requesting a list of all your names and the appropriate <br/>
translations!  I figured out quite a few of them ,but since some <br/>
people did the side wagers, but not bingo, I had a hard time with many.<br/>

There were a couple of boxers on this list who were onto me right from<br/>

In a case or two I had to take some liberties. For example if I'd used<br/>

Of the 22 announced so far, I couldn't figure out 5 ("He Among Tee in Toe" was one of them), so I'm curious to find out what they were. I was also very close to seeing what my name would be, since I had picked this coming Monday as my date.  <br/>
Sounds like we had a lot of people with good guesses for the "win" date - no one exact, but many very near.  <br/>
