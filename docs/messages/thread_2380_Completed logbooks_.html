This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

We also added a second logbook to the "first Wisconsin box" since when we<br>

left the initial logbook in that box for historical posterity.  (We<br>
generally carry 1 or 2 spare logbooks with us so we can add them to a box if<br>
needed - such as if current book is full or it is severely damaged).<br>

<br>
So far I have added pages. But I have one, History Tower, that needs more room in about 6 <br>
visits. Its a bound book so I can't really add pages. I thought I'd add another book. I love to <br>
see everyone that has been there before, and I guess others do too so I hate to remove the <br>
filled book!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It depends.  I've been re-planting boxes now after the winter and so far, I<br>
haven't kept the old logbooks in them because there's just no room.  Most of<br>
my boxes are in areas where there tend to be a lot of people around, so my<br>
boxes for this year have gotten smaller.  Not microboxes, but also not<br>
really enough room left over for the previous two logbooks after the stamp<br>

is a nice touch for finders.<br>

If it is larger and has tons of stamps in it and/or doesn't fit along with the new one, I take the old one home.<br>
<br>
I have found that once they are home, I look through them and then just put them in a drawer.  While I agree with the sentiment that I would hate to lose the stamps and the history, I just as strongly feel I would like to share that history with future finders of the box.<br>

Whatever works for the particular box I guess.<br>
