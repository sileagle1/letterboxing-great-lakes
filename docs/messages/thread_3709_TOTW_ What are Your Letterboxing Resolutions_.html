Last year my resolution was to get all my boxes checked before school was out -- I nearly did it!  I only needed to check on 2 more after school got out.  It was hard work, but really paid off!  I think I'll do that again this year.<br>
<br>
I also plan to do more boxing this summer -- so, I hope everyone plants more boxes! : ))<br>

  The new year is typically a time for making resolutions and setting <br>
  goals, so as we head into a new year of letterboxing, what are some of <br>
  your letterboxing-related resolutions or goals?<br>
<br>
  Is there a special letterbox or series you are aiming to plant or <br>
  find?  Are you planning a letterboxing trip somewhere fun?  Are you <br>
  setting your sights on a milestone PFX number?  Is it your focus to <br>
  improve your carving or experiment with new logbook styles?  <br>

Seriously, we do still have to replant our Marriage is<br>
a Wonderland box that we carved for last year's Great<br>
Lakes Gathering.  We need to create our Memphis<br>
Drive-In tribute box for this year's gathering.  I<br>
have a really cool idea for a box I'm calling<br>
"Invisible Ink" that I finally have to bring to<br>
realization.  And I also kind of promised that after a<br>
few years of promising to do it, I'd create a<br>
letterbox about the Cleveland Free Stamp.  That's<br>
something I should really try to get done before the<br>
gathering.<br>
<br>
Lots of work!  And home remodeling to complete! <br>
Better get off the computer & get to work!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am so excited you asked the 2007 goals question SpringChick!<br>
<br>
(standing up and reading....)<br>
<br>
My name is Trailtracker and I am a letterboxing addict.  (Is that how we <br>
are supposed to start??)  :)  I cannot stop and I have no intention of <br>
stopping.  I only intend on buying more ink and more PZ Kut!<br>
<br>
Over the past 3 days I have accomplished some of my goals, but have more <br>
to go.  One of my goals is to get to P100 and F1000. I'm not sure I will <br>
get there, but I'm gonna give it a try!   I have another 30 planted <br>
boxes that I have not posted on AQ that are only on letterboxing.org.  I <br>
am hoping to work on that this weekend from my igloo here in Ohio?!<br>
<br>
I also am signing up for Scout Dog Camp so that my new German <br>
Shorthaired Pointer learns first of all, how to put his hunting <br>
instincts on quiet mode while we hike and hunt for letterboxes.  Thanks <br>
Sirius Star Gazer and Scoutdogs for sharing so much about this camp in <br>
MI!!!  (I'm coming back to my homeland!!)  :)<br>
<br>
But the number one thing I wanted to do was a letterbox asking for <br>
support for our troops!  I had a really hard time trying to figure out <br>
how to do this but finally got it posted as a PT this morning!!!  I have <br>
had 6 hits already and I haven't even turned the picture upright on it <br>
yet?!  lol<br>
<br>
My son serves in the 82nd Airborne and he just deployed to Afghanistan <br>
for the next year.  I want to make sure these soldiers know that they <br>
have support from Americans at home.<br>
<br>
This PT has an option where you can get the stamp via snail mail!  The <br>
name of the PT is POST CARDS FOR THE 82ND AIRBORNE.  Here is the link   <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=31650<br>
<br>
(Stay tuned as Granny Butterfly is doing a similar postcard PT box as <br>
well!!  Both her grandson and his wife are serving in Afghanistan as well!!)<br>
<br>
Last but not least, I am trying to reach out to newer letterboxers to <br>
help them get signed up for events, message boards or whatever else they <br>
need.  When I first started, there was almost NO ONE in many counties <br>
around that letterboxed. Some boxes were abandoned and/or they never <br>
returned my emails.   I even skipped picking up some HH because I just <br>
had no clue what they were when I first started?!  LOL   I just didn't <br>
know?! I want to make it better for others.  There is a lot of brand new <br>
talent as this hobby is really expanding.  In Ohio, the number of <br>
letterboxes has increased x 6 times since I first started!  Happy, <br>
happy!  :)<br>
<br>
Back to carving and posting!<br>

All of these wonderful men and women are in my prayers.  My grandfather was<br>
in WWI, my father was in WWII, my brother died in Vietnam, my oldest brother<br>
was in Iraq in Desert Storm, and my nephew was in Iraq a year ago.  Add to<br>
that various aunts, uncles and cousins.  We have always been a family full<br>
of military men and women.  I have a great deal of respect and admiration<br>
for those serving our country.<br>

Rock Hoppin' Mama and Hart x6,<br>
<br>
Wow, both of your families are a huge part of why we have the freedoms <br>
we have.  Thanks so much for sharing such a great history of contribution.<br>
<br>
Hart x6, believe it or not, the spitting on soldiers has not stopped.  <br>
Less than 24 hours after my son came home from Bagdad the first time, <br>
that happened to him as well.  Aside from the obvious reasons why not to <br>
do this, who in their right mind thinks that's a wise thing to do to <br>
someone who is extremely wired from being shot at?!  Talk about playing <br>
with fire?!  On the other hand, some others have gone out of their way <br>
to thank him and I am grateful for that.<br>
<br>
I am so glad you are doing the series for Vietnam Vets especially.  It <br>
really is time they know there is support for them too.  I always <br>
approach and shake the hands of these vets if I see some indication that <br>
they served.<br>
<br>
I will have to look and see what state you are in and will hopefully be <br>
able to search for your new boxes.<br>
<br>
FungusWoman and prairie dog, thanks for your support as well!!!  Hugs to <br>
you for sure!<br>
<br>
A soldier currently IN Iraq has already responded to the PT?!  That sure <br>
makes our world a little bit smaller!<br>

The WWII vets are dwindling in numbers, but are being replaced by those from Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, etc.  Many, many more female vets than when I started.  As supportive as I am for those who serve, it is disheartening to think of their swelling numbers translating into my job security.  <br>

Stories like this just make me sick to my stomach. My dad never really  <br>

questions and he answered them all.<br>
 <br>
He never saw combat, he was stationed in Japan, Guam and the Phillipines.  He <br>
did spent one night in Danang in Vietnam and heard the gun fire. He told me  <br>
that the soldiers (back then before the internet) had no idea of the sentiment <br>
 back in the states. In fact he felt like he was doing his duty, serving the  <br>
country and that he was a "hero." <br>
 <br>
Then he came home and right off the plane got spat on and he wrote, "I  guess <br>
I wasn't a hero after all."<br>
 <br>
Well, he's my hero. He gave me his uniform and patches (that had been  hidden <br>
in a drawer for 30 years) and now I display them proudly on my wall in a  <br>
shadow box.<br>
 <br>
I will write more in the clues for the Letterboxes to come.<br>
 <br>
Anyhow, it just makes me sick -- my heart goes out to the Vietnam vets  esp. <br>
because the whole of the nation was against them. To know that this still  <br>
goes on with our military today churns my stomach in the same  way.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do not remember much about when my brother was in Vietnam.  I was very<br>
young.  He went to boot camp and they were sending him straight to Nam.  He<br>
wasn't going to get to see us before he went.  He was upset because he knew<br>
the chances of him coming home alive were slim.  He was a Marine and headed<br>
for the front lines.  He went AWOL to see us for the weekend.  It must have<br>
been common because they didn't get too upset about it.  I was afraid of him<br>
when he came in the door because he was in uniform and I didn't recognize<br>
him.  I have a few of his letters and a poem he wrote about having a bullet<br>
in his chest and seeing a child without a leg.  Heartbreaking.  His last<br>
letter to us said goodbye to us.  He knew he was not coming home.  Before we<br>
got the letter someone in his platoon set up a chain reaction bomb and the<br>
whole group was killed.  My mother told me once that when he was in Nam I<br>
went around telling everyone "Jim Nam."  I also remember that the tv was on<br>
all the time with war news.  I don't know if it was a local channel or a<br>
cable channel but I remember seeing it on.  We didn't have many channels<br>
then so it was probably local.  <br>
<br>
My daddy didn't have to see combat in WWII but his job was very dangerous.<br>
He was in Hawaii.  His job was to put the bombers on the planes or whatever<br>
they are called.  They had to be timed so that they would go off without<br>
hitting the propellers or something.  He said they made him test fly each<br>
one because if it wasn't right the plane would blow up and they didn't want<br>
to die if he made a mistake.  He didn't talk too much about the service.  He<br>
was able to go to college and get a two year degree.  That was a huge thing<br>
for a farmer's son in the 40's.  He was also part of the Civilian<br>
Conservation Corps.  I would love to do a series of boxes about the CCC.  He<br>
was involved in creating Watoga State Park in WV.  He talked a lot about<br>
making a hand made dam and bridges etc.  He graduated high school at 16 so<br>
he was too young to go straight into the service.  CCC gave him a good job<br>
until he was old enough to go to the Navy.<br>
<br>
My grandfathers were all in wars.  I've gone back to great great great great<br>
grandfather so far.  I find it quite interesting.  I am the youngest of nine<br>
children so I depend on my siblings' memories more than mine since I was too<br>
young to remember the stories my grandmothers told.  Both my grandfathers<br>
were gone before I was born.<br>
<br>
Anyway, too much information I'm sure. <br>

yet...but I will somehow manage!  Here, southeast of Columbus, OH we got <br>
hit hard by ice after the snow.  Not much moving out there at all!!<br>
<br>
I had fallen behind in these posts already, but now am trying to dig my <br>
way out of this AND the ice!<br>
<br>
So, the day that both you, Rock Hoppin' Mama and you, Hart x6 wrote <br>
about your families' military experiences and contributions was an <br>
emotional rollercoater ride for me.  This is rare for me because once my <br>
son deployes, I usually keep my emotions TIGHTLY in check like a steel <br>
box to get through having him in such high risk position in the Army.  <br>
Both of your posts hit me hard (which is okay!!).  I also got an amazing <br>
email and picture of my son in Afghanistan, FungusWoman and prairie dog <br>
touched my heart with their generous and immediate offers of help AND I <br>
got an email from a solider (who is also a letterboxer) from Iraq!!  <br>
This was all within about 3 hours?!  Turns out I had been to the box <br>
this soldier's wife had placed in his honor in NC.   I had emailed back <br>
and forth with her!!  He went out of his way to thank me for doing a PT <br>
in honor of the 82nd Airborne.  LIke the postcards I hope to get, these <br>
"little" things really make a difference to these soldiers.  He will be <br>
coming home on "mid deployment leave" and we hope to do an exchange next <br>
month!  His wife and two others will be there as well!<br>
<br>
So,  I thank you both for sharing.  I was just so spent emotionally, I <br>
just couldn't bring myself to respond.  RHM, thank you for bringing such <br>
an interesting perspective both from your age at the time your brother <br>
was serving in Vietnam and from your birth order as well!  Birth order <br>
always plays a part, doesn't it??  :) <br>
<br>
I'm sorry you lost your brother in Vietnam and thank your family for <br>
their sacrifices--through many generations.  Maybe your brother never <br>
knew of the protests.  If not, that would be a good thing.<br>
<br>
Hart x6, I think that is awesome that you asked your 50 questions AND <br>
that your dad answered!!!  Your dad IS a hero, in my opinion, whether he <br>
saw combat or not.  The minute they enlist, they agree that they WILL <br>
fight for our freedom, if asked.  Often times soldier feels a tremendous <br>
amount of guilt if they don't see combat while others do. My son and I <br>
have both kept in touch with his recruiting officer.  This soldier is <br>
now in a higher position and is also at Fort Bragg.  My son has now <br>
deployed for the 3rd time in 5 years while his recruiting officer has <br>
not yet gone after almost 15 years in the service.  HE feels guilty and <br>
responsible for that while my son is deployed again?!  It all depends on <br>
the position and timing. <br>
<br>
My mom was born in Germany and lived through the war and Hitler times.  <br>
She married my dad who was an American soldier and then they moved back <br>
to Detroit where I was born.  My mom always got upset with me because I <br>
didn't understand what all they went through over in Germany in general <br>
but also because her father got caught helping Jews escape---but she <br>
would never talk about it either.  UNTIL, at my insistance, we went back <br>
to Germany and went on a journey of all the places she lived and of the <br>
experiences she had. We included some of her childhood friends who still <br>
live in the same houses where they grew up.  It was hard on her <br>
emotionally, but it was good that I finally got to hear at least part of <br>
what times were like then and what she and others went through.  Hart <br>
x6, I hope those 50 questions netted some of the same results for you <br>
both.  Thank you to you and your family for your sacrifices as well. <br>
<br>
(I also have to interject, if your father is still living, please make <br>
sure he knows there are/were many of us who DID support our soldiers. I <br>
still have one of those POW bracelets.  After all these years, I saw a <br>
tiny article in our local newspaper where the remains of "my" soldier <br>
were finally identified through DNA and were returned to their family <br>
members in Defiance, Ohio.  It was either a total fluke that I saw this <br>
article or Devine guidance--which ever you believe.  I got this bracelet <br>
in Washington, D.C.  This summer, I hope to contact the family, give <br>
them the bracelet and ask if I can place a letterbox in this soldier's <br>
honor. I forgot to add this as part of my 2007 resolutions.)<br>
<br>
Somewhere in my spare time, I am reading Tim Russert's book, "Big Russ & <br>
Me".  (Tim Russert of Meet the Press).  To hear what both of your <br>
fathers went through reminded me of what is written early in the book <br>
about Tim's father when he was in the military.  I won't say anything <br>
more to spoil it for anyone other than Tim regretted not asking those 50 <br>
questions until after his father died.  Then he got answers from others <br>
who knew his dad.<br>
<br>
I have heard from many other letterboxerss who also have family members <br>
currently serving and deployed!! (There's hardly anyone left who isn't <br>
deployed.)   Many family members are making a lot of significant <br>
sacrifices while their sons, daughters, spouses and grandchilden are <br>
deployed.  The ripple effect is stunning at times. Thanks to you all!!<br>
<br>
I very much look forward to the letterboxes both of you plan to <br>
place!!!  Please don't be shy in letting me/us know when they are done!  <br>
(How's THAT for holding you to your 2007 goals and resolutions!)  :)<br>

I have more Email in my inbox than I do snow on the driveway. <br>
 <br>
Thank you for sharing your emotions with us, your sons duties are very much  <br>
respected and honored by myself and my family.<br>
 <br>
My dad still lives and is out in Oregon. This past June he flew out with my  <br>
mom to see their grandchildren and meet our twins born a year ago january. <br>
 <br>
My Vietnam series is DONE -- They were among the first stamps I ever carved  <br>
(there are 4 total). I WILL bring the "Thank You!" stamp with me to the SILO,  <br>
though it was carved in honor of my dad and those who served in Vietnam, it  <br>
really covers ALL vets of the military wether in peace or war.<br>
 <br>
It is a small stamp, but if you have special paper or letter you would like  <br>
me to stamp I will.<br>
 <br>
One final note on my dad. When he flew in this past June we met him in the  <br>
airport holding huge "WELCOME HOME" signs, my girls held up signs that they  <br>
painted by themselves. I wanted to give him the "homecoming" he never got. There <br>
 were tears and everything and then (yes, we believe in God and his <br>
providence) a  vietnamese family walked through the airport. <br>
 <br>
I was a little nervous, not knowing what they would think. The man never  <br>
took his eyes off of us or our signs (that read, "Vietnam Vet . . .") the man  <br>
came up to my father and asked "you in vietnam?" My dad said yes and he said,  <br>
"Thank you." and shook my dads hand and hugged him.<br>
 <br>
It was very emotional.<br>
 <br>

<br>
Wow!<br>
What a wonderful honor you gave your dad with the belated and warm <br>
welcome home!!!  I will state the obvious---you are a great son.  How <br>
lucky your dad is to have you.  I'm thinking that has to be one of the <br>
highlights of his life.  To have grandkids there to honor him as well <br>
must have been icing on the cake.<br>
<br>
I'm so sorry that I am not able to make it to the S.I.L.O. event <br>
afterall.  I left my name on the RSVP list because my postcard PT and a <br>
couple traveling event stamps will be there.  (Hopefully if they got to <br>
FungusWoman's house today!!!)  I am just sick I can't make it after <br>
all.  I was REALLY looking forward to meeting all of you NOW...cause <br>
June just seems too far off!  :) <br>
<br>
I did get the first phone call from my son after he got to Afghanistan <br>
very early this morning and so that helps offset the disappointment of <br>
not being able to come to the event.  Where he is now is basically a <br>
base camp.  Their howitzers finally arrived.  Because we (the US <br>
military) has now been there for 6 years, base camp is set up pretty <br>
well for these guys.  Get this!  There are 4 food vendor trailers <br>
there.  One from Taco Bell, one Subway, a Burger King and a Tim <br>
Hortons!!  He said that each one is a mini-mini-version of what a full <br>
menu in the states offers and that Tim Hortons is the only one that <br>
tastes the same, but it FAR outweighs MRE's!!!  Once he leaves base camp <br>
and probably goes into the mountains, it will be nothing but MRE's.    I <br>
think it is AWESOME that these food companies do this for our soldiers.<br>
<br>
I hope to meet you, your family and everyone up in your direction soon!<br>
<br>
I also hope everyone has a great time at the S.I.L.O. event!  I can't <br>
wait to see the pictures and hear what FungusWoman and Beetle had up <br>
their Chinese sleeves that you didn't know about!!!<br>
