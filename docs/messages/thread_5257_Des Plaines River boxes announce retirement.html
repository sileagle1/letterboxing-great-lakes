                    <div class="plaintext-content">Over the weekend, Coffee Beans and I did some maintenance on our boxes <br>
along the Des Plaines river trail since we've recently gotten a few <br>
reports of 'missing' boxes.  Fortunately, our boxes were still in <br>
place.  Yea!  Unfortunately, much of the landscape has changed over the <br>
past two years since we first planted the boxes making the clues hard to <br>
follow.   So, we decided to retire 'Talking about the HHH,' 'Des Plaines <br>
River,' and the 'Hunt for the Hidden Hollow' boxes.  The 'Cruising for <br>
the HHH' box is still in place (for the time being).<br>
<br>
For those of you who live in the area, don't worry.  We have five boxes <br>
at home, ready to be planted!<br>
