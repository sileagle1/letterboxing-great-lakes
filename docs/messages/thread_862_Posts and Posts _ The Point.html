As of August, the point lb was there.  If ya email me off line i can help you out a little more to see where you were at as well.  As for the posts, it wasn't there in august.  I <br>
emailed the owner of box.  They said they'd heard it was missing and were going to make an attempt to replace.  Maybe they haven't yet replaced.  This was a tough one for us we circled the park a couple times before we found it by sheer luck!  My email is mehawkfan at yahoo dot com.<br>
