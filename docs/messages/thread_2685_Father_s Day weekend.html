Boxer-in-TRAINing.  Speaking of whom, we spent a great weekend (both days,<br>
woo-hoo!) out boxing.  Some were new finds for him, others were new for me,<br>
while yet others were new for both of us.  We found one box reported missing<br>
lying right in the open in the grass, and rescued another lying sprawled all<br>
over near its hiding place.  We researched a new box to be placed the<br>
weekend after the Fourth (stamp is carved, clues are written, just have to<br>
do the log and packaging).  I also have one ready to be placed nearby in<br>
time for the July 1st Micro-Meet, so that those of you who've already<br>
attended others have something new to find.<br>

<br>
Can you tell my husband is out of town (fishing, of course) and I am doing<br>
nothing but living and breathing letterboxing?  Ah, life is good!<br>

for dinner.oops!  [She's putting a frozen pizza in the oven.])<br>
