through because I have never posted there before so I am going to <br>
repeat it here because I told her that I would make sure that people <br>
know...The C&WT box has not yet been replaced.  She sent me a text from <br>
G.S. camp this evening asking me to let people know, she has not yet <br>
responded to my return text messages so I am not sure if she even knows <br>
that I got the message, but now my conscience can be clear, I have done <br>
my best.  If you are looking for the C&WT box, be assured, you will not <br>
find it.<br>

The Chicago and West Towns letterbox has been replaced, along with <br>
several more tribute boxes to my Dad, all placed in a certain location <br>
also home to lions and tigers and bears (oh, my!).   Just be very <br>
careful...they are in a *very* high traffic (sub)urban location...use <br>
your utmost stealth techniques.  Later in the day is the best time to <br>
try for them.<br>
