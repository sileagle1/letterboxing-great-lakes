looking for drive-bys, because I like getting out of the car and<br/>
letting the dogs get some exercise, but it would have to be super box<br/>
for me to drive more than 30 minutes out of my way.<br/>

the IN/OH border is Blue Star, but don't you have that one?  I have seen<br/>
your stamp a few places already.  I won't brag on my boxes, but you might<br/>
do a quick search to see if they fit your requirements.  Don't forget to<br/>
look at ALL of my boxes.  Contact me off-list for more specifics. <br/>
Incidentally, I don't think there's been a first finder on my Beauty<br/>
School Dropout (placed Feb-05).  I'll be checking on it during the<br/>
holidays.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I-71 to I-90, oh wait, that's my neck of the woods! <br/>
Our Kumbaya box located in Bonnie Park (just a few<br/>
minutes away from I-71) should be a winter friendly<br/>
find (unless the box is frozen in its hiding spot) and<br/>
although a relatively quick find, the park would be a<br/>
good place for the dogs to stretch their legs.  The<br/>
clue page says where to get off of I-71 &amp; directions<br/>
to the park.<br/>
<br/>
There was a recent plant by us called Kiddie Park,<br/>
that box should be only about a 5 to 10 minute drive<br/>
from the W130th exit of I-71.  No idea how winter<br/>
friendly a find it would be, though - haven't had a<br/>
chance to find it yet (and we live right down the road<br/>
- bad letterboxers!).  I do know that if it's snowy,<br/>
the park is one of THE sledding places in the area, so<br/>
it may be too crowded to find the box.<br/>
<br/>
There are also quite a few boxes hidden in Medina<br/>
County (the county just south of Cuyahoga, where<br/>
Kumbaya is hidden) that may not be too far from your<br/>
travel route.  The clues for Kelmark #1 - Plum Creek<br/>
say it's not far from I-71, but I don't remember how<br/>
winter-friendly the search might be; I know we had<br/>
some trouble finding the one path and it was<br/>
springtime when we went (but that was also on account<br/>
of us making assumptions instead of really following<br/>
the clues).  We haven't had a chance to hunt most of<br/>
the rest of the Kelmark boxes, so not sure how close<br/>
to the freeway or winter-friendly those would be.  <br/>
<br/>
Have fun on your trip, and good luck!<br/>
