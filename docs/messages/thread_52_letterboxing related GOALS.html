<br>
Your post reminds me of one of the letterboxing related goals I'm <br>
working on for this season.<br>
<br>
I'm calling this particular one: "catch a letterboxer in the wild" <br>
<br>
Unlike you, and some lucky others, I haven't come across another <br>
boxer while out on the trails. Bindle Bum and I travel a moderate <br>
amount so I decided I'd try to "catch" a letterboxer "in the wild" <br>
(ie: anywhere)<br>
<br>
To facilitate my goal, I've been using the LbNA logo as "bait" by <br>
turning a jpg of the logo patch into our luggage tags. So far, no <br>
letterboxers in the airports or train stations we've been through <br>
have taken the bait and talked to me.<br>
<br>
I already had it displayed on my trail pack and I'm planning to put <br>
the same "bait" into the back window of my mini-van.  Still trying <br>
to decide how to display it on our boat in a way that won't annoy <br>
the Captain (Bindle Bum)too much. LOL ... <br>
<br>
Anyone else willing to share any letterboxing related goals you're <br>
working on?<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
