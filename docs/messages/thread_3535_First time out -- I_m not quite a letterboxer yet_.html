                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like you have a good attitude, though, about not finding the box.  <br>
Although I do get discouraged when boxes aren't in place or I'm just too<br>
inept to find them, I have to say that some of the best letterboxing<br>
experiences, for me, have very little to do with the boxes.  <br>
<br>
For example, we stopped at this awesome trail in Ohio while traveling<br>
home for Christmas.  The trail actually goes under the interstate, a spot <br>
I'd often admired on my treks to/from my parents' house.  There was a<br>
paved trail and a parallel mulch trail and a parallel series of fields,<br>
some with playground equipment or soccer fields or just open areas.<br>
Although we only found one of the four boxes, hiking to find them worked<br>
all the stiffness and restlessness from driving out of my limbs.  The<br>
trail was so beautiful and I understand why the Olentangy has a "scenic<br>
river" designation.  It's a spot that I will visit again when I'm<br>
traveling that direction, whether the boxes are still there or not.<br>
<br>
On the dog note, I have to agree with you about strange dogs approaching. <br>
I have actually started claiming that Claire is a vicious pit bull just<br>
to make people keep their crazy dogs away.  One of the things that really <br>
impressed me about our Christmas letterboxing experience was that all the <br>
dogs we saw were off leash (probably close to a dozen in our 2 miles of<br>
hiking) but not one of them came within 20 feet of us;  they were all so<br>
very well-behaved and under control.<br>
<br>
Hopefully your next trip will be more fruitful!<br>

<br>
That has happened to me before!   In fact, pretty nearly happened today!<br>
But, a good deal of the point of this odd hobby is the getting out <br>
and doing the physical part.  It's not just finding the box itself.<br>
<br>
Actually, we did two boxes today, the first had a parking lot right <br>
next to where we ended up, but we were instructed to park a mile or <br>
so away.  This was kind of an "urban" box and we pretty much knew we <br>
could find it from the car and park closer.  But, rain and cold <br>
weather be damned, we parked where we were supposed to and did the <br>
box as the planter intended.  It was fun to see how and where they <br>
came up with the clues.  The used all the store and restaurant names <br>
as puns to lead us on the way.<br>
<br>
The second box pretty much had us start about 100 feet from the box <br>
and took us in a big circle around it.  We didn't have to hike for 90 <br>
minutes, but the clues definitely went the indirect way!  Not to <br>
mention I'm an idiot and we started from the way wrong place and <br>
probably added a mile onto our walk before we got on the right <br>
track.  LOL  That's the fun, right?  Getting into the placers head to <br>
see what they were thinking. We saw a whole bunch of really cool <br>
trees that we wouldn't have seen by the direct route.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you didn't find the box, but hope you had a great time, anyway!<br>

first started 'boxing in 2003.  We did the out on the<br>
trail with no food or water thing (because we weren't<br>
going to be on the trail that long, right?).  We also<br>
did the 90 minutes hiking a trail and here the box was<br>
hidden right next to the parking lot thing, too.  Good<br>
times, good times!  Actually, in my opinion this<br>
officially makes you a letterboxer!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love that site.  The closer ya can zoom in, the more accurate the mileage<br>
is.  For normal city streets I generally click the "map" style in the upper<br>
right corner, no need really to go to a satellite view.  For forest<br>
preserves, I click on "hybrid" in the upper right corner which gives a<br>
satellite view plus the street names.  How much ya can see with that view<br>
depends on how clear the satellite got the image and what time of year it<br>
was.  If there's a lot of foliage, then it's often hard to see smaller<br>
trails and paths.  But it's amazing how much can be seen at some preserves.<br>
There was one letterbox I found last year where I could even see the<br>
"landmarks" in the clues on the satellite map that's how clear the satellite<br>
view was close-up.<br>
<br>
I do 5ks and 10ks -- workdays are for racewalk training and Sunday<br>
afternoons and days off are for fast hiking walks -- no moseying on those<br>
walks  :-).   Every January I change my "routes" for the new year and enter<br>
the new routes at the USATF.com site so that I've got my distances figured<br>
out right off the bat.  If you search under Darien IL, you'll see my 2<br>
Waterfall Glen walks and under Glen Ellyn IL is my Churchill Woods walk.<br>
The Waterfall Glen 3k is deceiving because right after the 1 mile mark comes<br>
a rather nasty incline, especially since the path is gravel and not that<br>
easy on footing for this old lady.  I know I'm starting to be in good shape<br>
for the season when I can do that loop twice in a row and go 6k without<br>
feeling this overwhelming urge to check to see if I can get enough cell<br>
phone reception to call 9-1-1 if needed.   :-)<br>
<br>
This year I want to try planting a letterbox using the USATF site for the<br>
clues -- except for the very end location of the box.   This way, anyone who<br>
goes looking for it will know exactly how far their muscles are walking<br>
since it's probably going to be a long hike.  Tho flat.  No serious<br>
elevation rises/falls in that area, since the mounds have been badly<br>
excavated by thieves in decades past from what I understand.<br>
<br>
But right now, with 1 1/2 more weeks to go with this cast, all I can do is<br>
map my routes.  Now watch -- as soon as my cast is off, we'll get more snow<br>
than Denver.  Everybody in the Chicago area can plan on either 10 feet of<br>
snow or 40 below zero on or shortly after the 17th.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I totally know this feeling, LOL!  Our church does a hike down in the <br>
Southern Kettle Morraine forest here in WI every year and the park <br>
they do it at actually has markers on it that indicated the number of <br>
hills/steepness for each section.  The first year I did this, I <br>
thought sure they were going to have to get an ambulance for me - I <br>
thought I was gonna die!!<br>
<br>
Well, shortly after that, we started Letterboxing.  Thanks to some of <br>
the trails that WI Hiker and Martini Man have sent us down, when we <br>
did the hike this year, that church hike barely winded me!!  The only <br>
thing complaining was my knees and the 12 year old boy of a friend <br>
next to me.  Apparently, I am now in better shape than he is, LOL!<br>
<br>
What a way to get in shape!  Letterboxing!  Who knew - way more fun <br>
than any exercise routine, LOL!<br>
