Dragon for all the hard work. put into the planning And thanks to <br/>
Wisconsin Hiker for the vat of chili. I know others brought some, too, <br/>
so double thanks.  We pitched in bowls, but will bring actual food now <br/>
that we have the hang of it.  Tromping through the drifts was <br/>
exhilarating!. It was a beautiful day--the snow only added to the <br/>

Yes, thank you to Beetle and Lock, shock and Barrel.  We had an awesome time.  Bitty Brat had a great time trading cards, and the boys were excited to help find the stamps around the tables and floats.  It was SO wierd,a flock of geese dropped a flea on us!  Beetle gave us soe GREAT information about fleas.  MUHAHAHA  We had a wonderful time, and a great presentation from Lock, Shock, and Barrel!  <br/>

Two letterbox gathering attended in less that a week's time...is life good or what? While the "Fungal Infestation of San Jose" was much smaller than the SILO (hey, 21 people, somecoming from over an hour away on aweek night just to meet up is pretty cool...and I got to meet Wassa and other greatboxers from the Silicon Valley area in person...including Sharuna, a transplant from Lombard, IL...small world!), SILO appears to be gaining a reputation for showcasing some of the area's outstanding carvers...and float creators (have to ask Ryan to create a new category on AQ??).<br/>
<br/>
So what's next year's theme going to be? February 4th is National Stuffed Mushroom Day (ouch!)...the 21st is National Sticky Bun Day (as if inky fingers isn't bad enough...). February is National Condom Month...nope, not touching that one with a ten-foot carving tool. It's also Potato Lovers Month...hey, we could carve potatoes instead of rubber! Feb 12 (1959) - first Barbies sold in stores...Lock could have a field day with that one. The 18th is Pluto Day (too controversial - planet or not?). National Inventors' Day (as proclaimed by Ronald Reagan in 1983, in honor of Edison's Feb 11th b-day)...now THAT could be fun..........<br/>

Great job, LS&amp;Bx2 (that's Lock Shock &amp; Barrel and Beetle)! I'm glad I was <br/>
able to get back in time to attend SILO3. Two letterbox gathering attended <br/>
in less that a week's time...is life good or what? While the "Fungal <br/>
Infestation of San Jose" was much smaller than the SILO (hey, 21 people, <br/>
some coming from over an hour away on a week night just to meet up is pretty <br/>
cool...and I got to meet Wassa and other great boxers from the Silicon <br/>
Valley area in person...including Sharuna, a transplant from Lombard, <br/>
IL...small world!), SILO appears to be gaining a reputation for showcasing <br/>
some of the area's outstanding carvers...and float creators (have to ask <br/>
Ryan to create a new category on AQ??).<br/>
<br/>
So what's next year's theme going to be? February 4th is National Stuffed <br/>
Mushroom Day (ouch!)...the 21st is National Sticky Bun Day (as if inky <br/>
fingers isn't bad enough...). February is National Condom Month...nope, not <br/>
touching that one with a ten-foot carving tool. It's also Potato Lovers <br/>
Month...hey, we could carve potatoes instead of rubber! Feb 12 (1959) - <br/>
first Barbies sold in stores...Lock could have a field day with that one. <br/>
The 18th is Pluto Day (too controversial - planet or not?). National <br/>
Inventors' Day (as proclaimed by Ronald Reagan in 1983, in honor of Edison's <br/>
Feb 11th b-day)...now THAT could be fun..........<br/>

You were missed!  Folks were asking me if Trail Rider had arrived, and I had to tell them that you were unable to attend at the last minute.  Yes, I hope to see the photos soon...at least the ones that are suitable to post!   Let the good times roll!<br/>
