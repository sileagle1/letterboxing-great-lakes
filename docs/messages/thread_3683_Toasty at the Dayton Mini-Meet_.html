Dayton, Ohio!!!  What a packed house with ink 'a flyin'!!  Fifty<br/>
people is considered a SUPER mini-meet, isn't it?!  I missed<br/>
exchanging with everyone and didn't even know some folks were there! <br/>
It was crazy and so much fun dispite the ridiculous winds that had<br/>
kicked up.  Everyone's PT's were outstanding and so were Pioneer<br/>
Spirit's bonus boxes!  I was so glad to finally meet some folks after<br/>
a couple years and reunite with others and to share some funny<br/>
stories!!!  This was the PERFECT place for a bunch like us!  :)  I<br/>
have a feeling there will be a lot of clicking of carving tools today<br/>
after the wonderful inspiration yesterday!!  Thanks again HA!!!<br/>
