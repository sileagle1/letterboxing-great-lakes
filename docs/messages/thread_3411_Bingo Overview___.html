                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, for those who were not around last year, and even for those <br>
who were, as there are a few changes this year -- here is a brief <br>
overview of how the Bingo game will work (complete instructions can <br>
be found in the BINGO1.pdf and BINGO2.pdf files in the FILES section <br>
of the Great Lakes list).<br>
<br>
- Anyone who is a member of the Great Lakes Yahoo! group can play<br>
<br>
- Each person who is playing will fill in the provided card template <br>
(BINGO-GRID.pdf) with words of their choosing using the word list <br>
provided.  There are 24 word choices for each column, B-I-N-G-O.  <br>
The words you can choose are a mix of letterbox names, trailnames, <br>
event names and general terms relating to letterboxing.  Some of the <br>
words have stipulations attached with using them -- i.e. to use a <br>
letterbox name, you must have either found that letterbox or be the <br>
person who planted it, etc.  But don't worry -- there are plenty of <br>
general terms so that even a brank-spanking new letterboxer who has <br>
never found a box, planted a box, exchanged with anyone or attended <br>
a gathering, still will have some choices and enough options to fill <br>
their card.<br>
<br>
- A copy of your card gets mailed to me along with an item to go <br>
into the prize pot, otherwise known as the Bingo Booty.  There are <br>
examples of things people sent last year in the instructions, but <br>
feel free to get creative -- anything a letterboxer could use or <br>
enjoy while letterboxing.  I *MUST* have your entry by Dec. 27 -- NO <br>
EXCEPTIONS!<br>
<br>
- Beginning January 1, I will draw a word each day (there are 120 <br>
words total) and announce it in a post at the GL list.  If you have <br>
that word on your card, you cross it off.<br>
<br>
- There are 5 games, for a total of 7 winners:<br>
<br>
   * The "big game" is full card -- first, second and third places <br>
will be winners<br>
   * 4 interim games where (first place winner only on each) -- 4 <br>
corners, straight line, "X" and perimeter.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was a lot of fun last year and helped to pass the cold winter <br>
months here in the GL region.  If you have questions after reading <br>
through the instructions, feel free to post to the list as somebody <br>
else may be wondering the same thing.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to all!<br>
