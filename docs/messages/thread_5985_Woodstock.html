<br>
Two letterboxers from Oregon are in our region.<br>
<br>
Der Mad Stamper was one of the very first involved in the hobby and he was instrumental in establishing the letterboxing.org site.  RaqsEnigma is from Illinois, but relocated to Oregon two(?) years ago. Some of you may have met her at the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering in WI or when you visited Portland.  They are in currently in IL to visit Raq's family and attend a wedding.<br>
<br>
A few of us plan to get together for dinner with them on Wednesday JUL 29 at O'Leary's Pub in Woodstock, IL. We plan to meet around 6 pm, but if you can't get there until a bit later, that's OK, come anyway! Weâ€™ll probably enjoy some liquid refreshments until everyone arrives, then order some food.<br>
<br>
Here's a link to O'Leary's website, which includes their address & menu:<br>
<br>
http://www.olearysonthesquare.com/<br>
<br>
Let me know if you will be able to make it (& approximate arrival time) so we can have approximate idea of how many to plan for.<br>

By the way, did you know that we're almost at the 40th anniversary of the<br>
original Woodstock Festival, held AUG 15-17, 1969?  That get-together had<br>
nearly 500,000 people!<br>

ask???<br>

Subject: Re: [LbGLK] Woodstock<br>
<br>
I posted a message over the weekend, but here's a recap:<br>
<br>
Two letterboxers from Oregon are in our region.<br>
<br>
Der Mad Stamper was one of the very first involved in the hobby and he was<br>
instrumental in establishing the letterboxing.org site. RaqsEnigma is from<br>
Illinois, but relocated to Oregon two(?) years ago. Some of you may have met<br>
her at the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering in WI or when you visited Portland.<br>
They are in currently in IL to visit Raq's family and attend a wedding.<br>
<br>
A few of us plan to get together for dinner with them on Wednesday JUL 29 at<br>
O'Leary's Pub in Woodstock, IL. We plan to meet around 6 pm, but if you<br>
can't get there until a bit later, that's OK, come anyway! We'll probably<br>
enjoy some liquid refreshments until everyone arrives, then order some food.<br>
<br>
Here's a link to O'Leary's website, which includes their address & menu:<br>
<br>
http://www.olearyso <http://www.olearyso<br>
<http://www.olearysonthesquare.com/> nthesquare.com/> nthesquare.com/<br>
<br>
Let me know if you will be able to make it (& approximate arrival time) so<br>
we can have approximate idea of how many to plan for.<br>
