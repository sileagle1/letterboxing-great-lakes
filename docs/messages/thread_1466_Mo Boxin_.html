                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to thank everyone who attended the gathering yesterday for <br>
making it such an enjoyable event!  We were very pleased to meet each <br>
and every one of you!  It's amazing how each boxer had his or her own <br>
individual take on the hobby and something unique to offer to the group <br>
as a whole!<br>
<br>
For those of you that couldn't attend, most of the boxes posted in the <br>
clue pack will be there for at least a week.  I think the only two that <br>
were taken home yesterday were "Here I am Baby" by the Christmas Elves <br>
and "I Love my Daddy" by Funguswoman (to be sent back soon).  <br>
The "Tranquil Moment" box "Mo Mustangs" boxes will both become <br>
permanent residents of the park (with official clues to be posted soon).<br>
<br>
Thank you again for such a wonderful day!<br>
<br>
Team Rabbit<br>
<br>
ps.  Dragon and Pale Puppy Posse: sorry about the "overgrown bench" <br>
fiasco... ==:+(<br>

<br>
I think my favorite part was the secret boxes!  As a family, we all thought the "Mo Mustangs" boxes were just the coolest!<br>
<br>
Today on our way home we stopped in Holt to rescue some Superhero's from certain demise at the hands of their arch enemies and were totally geeked to see a stamp in the boxes of someone we just met at the gathering!  How cool is that??<br>
<br>
Mr. Doglvrs has been giving some serious thought to his own PT...so be on the lookout for hints in that direction before the next gathering!<br>
<br>
Thanks for all your hard work Team Rabbit and everyone else that had a hand in the planning!  We had some great laughs!  : ) <br>
