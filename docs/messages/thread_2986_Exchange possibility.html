<br>
If any of you are planning to attend the Star Trek 40th Anniversary <br>
convention in Chicago on September 8, 9 & 10, I will be there too.  I <br>
would love to meet some fellow letterboxers and do an exchange.  I <br>
also have a personal traveller making its debut at the convention, so <br>
I hope I have some takers.  Here's the info:<br>

<br>
The convention is at the Wyndham O'Hare, so for those of you who are <br>
not going but are going to be in the area, perhaps we can work <br>
something out as well.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
Trekkie Gal<br>
