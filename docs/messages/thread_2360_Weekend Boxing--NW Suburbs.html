                    <div class="plaintext-content">We decided that Saturday was the day for an early Easter Egg hunt, so <br>
we headed out to Elgin for the Cottontail's Easter Egg Hunt.  <br>
Beautiful little stamps (in quite clever containers) and a gorgeous <br>
Easter basket at the end.  We had a hard time finding #6 and couldn't <br>
find #7 at first.  We decided to try one more time on our way back to <br>
the car and found it! Good thing we saved a spot on our pages for it.  <br>
Then it was on to a few more Cottontail stamps:  I "Heart" Haring and <br>
Stick a Fork in Me.  These works of art are also stamping works of art.<br>
<br>
Then it was on to Schaumburg.  We tracked down the box to Viva La <br>
Mexico (by Lavender)and then had lunch at that restaurant.  Our next <br>
stop was Anniversary Logo--also by Lavender--another beautiful stamp.  <br>
We were hoping to be First Finders since it was just placed on <br>
Thursday.  However, as we approached the spot we saw that The <br>
Cottontails had just beat us there and were stamping in.  Oh well.  <br>
Even though we met the Cottontails at the Haunted gathering, we hadn't <br>
done an exchange--so we got the chance here.  Then it was on to home <br>
to get ready for our evening activities.  But we'll need to head back <br>
to this area as we left a lot of boxes unsearched.<br>
