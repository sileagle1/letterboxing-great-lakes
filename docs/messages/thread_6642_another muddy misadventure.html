Poor RNF went into a sideways split going downhill, with her hands fully immersed in the mud to support herself. Sweet Pea took it as a sign it was playtime, and proceeded to jump on her and lick her face, and she (RNF) couldn't get the dog off of her. We couldn't stop laughing...not being mean, it was just so funny. (Laughing with her, not at her, though I'm not really sure she was laughing....)<br/>
