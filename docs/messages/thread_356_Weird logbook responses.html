I went to go check on my boxes the other day (mostly out of a faint hope to run into other letterboxers while doing so than any real fear that the boxes are in danger), and I found the oddest message in my "Girly box" logbook.  Now, bear in mind, this box is fairly new, and doesn't have many finders yet, but there's already some interesting oddities there:<br/>
<br/>
1) most of the finders don't have a stamp<br/>
<br/>
2) the messages are brief to the point of cryptic- example: "I found it.  Yay."<br/>
<br/>
Which set me thinking.  I know I've left my share of short messages in logbooks (Dragon's "The Gathering" box being one- so many mosquitoes I really only had time for one word- "Hagus!").  What's the strangest entry you've left/found in a logbook?  <br/>
<br/>
And, does "I found it.  Yay."  truly have sarcastic overtones, or am I just jaded and mean-spirited?<br/>

The very first box Deedle &amp; I found we noticed that quite a few people had signed the log book stating that they didn't have a stamp yet.   That was the Funshine Bear box in Berea.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, the Girly Box is one of the boxes I told Deedle I want to make sure we find when we're in Michigan in August.  We'll try to leave you a nice, long message in the log book :)<br/>

Here in Western New York, some friends of mine are Search and Rescue<br/>
folk.  They set up a training exercise for the dogs in a park.  One of<br/>
the dogs gave the sign for "scent found" and started going the wrong<br/>
way but clearly on the trail of someone.  The dog found a letterbox! <br/>
Thinking they had found lost property the S&amp;R crew opened it looking<br/>
for identification.  From reading the logbook they got the general<br/>
idea of how the game is played and had the dog "stamp in" as a finder! <br/>

the strangest entry you've left/found in a logbook?  <br/>

<br/>
I am happy to report that I planted a box yesterday in an area that <br/>
did have a few, but none of them were biting--a sort of stag party <br/>

In any case, no sacrifice is too great; I'll try to leave more <br/>

loss of blood.<br/>

hide a box...<br/>
  The box was placed in the base of a hollow tree that was just over <br/>
the crest of a fairly steep hill and at least fifty feet from the <br/>
trail that got you into the area.  The opening in the tree faced <br/>
downhill, away from the trail.  Someone had written in the logbook <br/>
that they had seen the box while "walking in the woods", wasn't aware <br/>
of letterboxing, but thought it was a fun thing to do.  <br/>
  Now, the only way they could have "seen" the box was to have looked <br/>
up, into the tree while climbing up a steep hill covered with large <br/>
rocks and brush.  A walk in the woods????  It must have been a <br/>
friendly masochist.<br/>
