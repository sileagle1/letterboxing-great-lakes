                    <div class="plaintext-content">We left WI this morning and arrived in Arizona before noon.  After a quick lunch we were out on the trails in Papago Park in Phoenix and had to laugh when we looked through the logbook of the very first logbook we found.  Who had logged in before us?  Several WI letterboxers!!<br/>
<br/>
- Verona Bird Patrol<br/>
- Kermit<br/>
- Capt Jim<br/>
- Mequon Gardener (only a week or 2 ago)<br/>
<br/>
And in another box, there was Cuppie and several friends logged in!<br/>
<br/>
We always seem to see other Great Lakes letterboxers whereever we go, but it was especially fun to see so many WI entries today.<br/>
<br/>
We have some major hiking planned for the next 2 days and hopefully will do a bit better on finding boxes (only got 3 of 6 attempted today).  However we DID do a lot of scrambling, using hands as well as feet in the steep areas, and I had to resort to using my butt to negogiate the precipitous slopes on the way down.  And even with all that hard work, we just couldn't seem to find the right location for that particular box!!  <br/>
