                    <div class="plaintext-content">I placed a box in Rocky Arbor State Park just north of Wisconsin<br>
Dells, WI.  When I look at my atlas, the park is located on the border<br>
of Juneau and Sauk Counties.  I can't for the life of me figure out<br>
which county this box is in.  And to further the problem,<br>
www.letterboxing.org's map divides the region between these two<br>
counties so that if I list it as Sauk, it's in SW WI and if I list it<br>
as Juneau, it's in West Central WI.  Can someone help me find out what<br>
county this box is in?<br>

Thanks,<br>
