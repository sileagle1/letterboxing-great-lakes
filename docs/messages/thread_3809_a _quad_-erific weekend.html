                    <div class="plaintext-content">To celebrate my birthday (yesterday), Atom planned a weekend of <br>
letterboxing for us (without my knowledge of the location), and I just <br>
had to share. :)  To start, he'd made plans to meet a boxer from Denver <br>
(murmur) who was in town for a conference on Saturday morning.  The <br>
three of us drank coffee and swapped letterboxing stories and stamps, <br>
which was great fun.  Afterwards, we headed out of town towards our <br>
"mystery" destination: the Quad cities! :)  He'd gotten some detailed <br>
advice from Hart x6, so we had great directions from box-to-box along <br>
the way west on I-80 as well as in the quad city area, plus some great <br>
restaurant recommendations.  Following his advice for the order to find <br>
the boxes was great and efficient, resulting in very little/no arguments <br>
over driving and navigating which can sometimes be a problem for us. :P ;)<br>
<br>
Anyway, for the most part, the boxes we found had only been visited by <br>
the local boxers (although Tiptoe & Tonto and KissMeKate & Barefoot Ankh <br>
had been out there in a few of the boxes), but let me tell you, there <br>
are some fun finds out there!  A lot of the boxes were in historically <br>
and/or geographically significant places, which were fun.  We got some <br>
great views of the Mississippi and the various cool bridges across it.  <br>
Mostly all were hand carved stamps as well, which were much appreciated <br>
and admired.  Though the boxes were mostly drive-bys, the clues were <br>
well done and many included funny stories/poems to liven things up, in <br>
addition to some interesting facts on the area. :)  My favorite boxes <br>
from the weekend include Campbell's Island, Captain's Wheel, and Monkey <br>
Island, plus the 2 Broadway series boxes, since we'd been wanting to see <br>
what the other nearby musical series was like. ;)<br>
<br>
Overall, it was a great weekend. :)  We managed to get 24 boxes over the <br>
two days -- 2 of which we were first finders, and 2 of which were <br>
hitchhikers.  And we left 3 hitchhikers at various points along the way, <br>
so get out there and find them! :)<br>
<br>
So thanks to the quad-cities planters and especially Hart x6, who also <br>
helped Atom organize our weekend.  And, of course, a special thanks to <br>
Atom for planning the whole thing for my birthday -- he's such a <br>
sweetheart. ;) :)<br>

Subject: [LbGLK] a "quad"-erific weekend<br>
<br>
To celebrate my birthday (yesterday), Atom planned a weekend of <br>
letterboxing for us (without my knowledge of the location), and I just <br>
had to share. :) To start, he'd made plans to meet a boxer from Denver <br>
(murmur) who was in town for a conference on Saturday morning. The <br>
three of us drank coffee and swapped letterboxing stories and stamps, <br>
which was great fun. Afterwards, we headed out of town towards our <br>
"mystery" destination: the Quad cities! :) He'd gotten some detailed <br>
advice from Hart x6, so we had great directions from box-to-box along <br>
the way west on I-80 as well as in the quad city area, plus some great <br>
restaurant recommendations. Following his advice for the order to find <br>
the boxes was great and efficient, resulting in very little/no arguments <br>
over driving and navigating which can sometimes be a problem for us. :P ;)<br>
<br>
Anyway, for the most part, the boxes we found had only been visited by <br>
the local boxers (although Tiptoe & Tonto and KissMeKate & Barefoot Ankh <br>

are some fun finds out there! A lot of the boxes were in historically <br>

well done and many included funny stories/poems to liven things up, in <br>
addition to some interesting facts on the area. :) My favorite boxes <br>
