Yesterday was my Dad's birthday.  Anyone in the Chicago area looking <br>
for something to do, there's a letterbox placed in his memory just <br>

FW is good at giving clues to finding clues.  It might be a rainy day, but Boxer's Box can still be accessed without getting all muddy at the oozdleifkoorB.  I've been to this box...well worth the search.  Another 'fab' FW Lb!<br>

Hubby and I were boxing in Kane County Friday and found a box <br>
with "Boxer in TRAINing's" stamp in the logbook.  This is the first and <br>
only time I've run across it, but I'm sure I'll see it again.<br>
