I should also mention that the Happy Days series has now been fixed, <br/>
although Canadian Goose may not have yet updated the clues.  If you <br/>
want the clues before she fixes them, email me and I'll send them to <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, ALL Mathman boxes are now completely fixed up and accounted <br/>
for.  Mathman 7-Luther's Love is replaced in a new spot and Mathman <br/>
11's clues have been updated to compesate for the park taking away <br/>
some clues.  Unfortunately, as I updated the clues at school, I found <br/>
I forgot to email myself a needed graphic for the Mathman 11 clues.  <br/>
So until I can get back up to school to upload the grahic, if you are <br/>
going to try Mathman 11, just email me and I'll send you the graphic <br/>
via email.<br/>
