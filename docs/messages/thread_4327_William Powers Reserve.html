Box #1 is intact as of yesterday.  Foliage has overgrown the area by<br>
about 4 inches, but the cairn is readily visible if you're seeking it<br>
at the intersection.<br>
<br>
Box #2 may be intact. The landmark (beavers' lodge) has altered its<br>
dimensions by about 10 feet. This makes the tree that was originally<br>
at the end of the lodge, about 10 feet in from the end.  I was in a<br>
skort and sandals yesterday and could not climb the lodge to check<br>
behind it.  Will return better prepared in about 2 weeks.<br>
<br>
Box #3 is missing. Possibly is in the hands of a fellow boxer who<br>
wrote about performing first aid. Waiting for a response to my query.<br>
<br>
Box #4 is missing. No signs of pieces anywhere. The covering debris<br>
was replaced over the spot, which tends to indicate human, rather than<br>
animal, interference.<br>
<br>
Repairs/replacements will have to wait at least a week as I'm outbound<br>
to ValPo tomorrow. Sorry.<br>
