Several years ago, Flying J told me about The Shawshank Redemption film and the obvious letterboxing reference, and it moved me to create a letterbox.  I posted it on AQ and <br/>
<br/>
LbNA - The Shawshank Redemption Letterbox. If you watch the film, you understand the clue.  However, due to needed repairs at 'the prison', I had to remove the box, but it will return soon.  Love that movie!<br/>
