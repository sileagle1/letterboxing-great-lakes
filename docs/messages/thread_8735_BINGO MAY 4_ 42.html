<p>Once upon a time, in our own galaxy, an adventure began with

and Carving.<span>  </span>It also contained a
Hitchhiker, compelling us to continue adventuring.<span>  </span>We met Azobox at our first Gathering and,
between that one and GLG 2017 One for the Books we met PartyOf6Plus 1, Sunny
Side Up, CookieCutter, Lady of Many Hats, PackerBackers, Mamanator, Rosmarinus,
Suffering Husband in Tow, and many other fellow letterboxers.<span>  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using our Compass to dial in the right Degree and find our
Bearing, our adventures have taken us to more than one Mystery Box as well as
many other box styles.<span>  </span>Toting our roll
of Camo Tape and other supplies for boxes in need, we’ve endeavored to Leave No
Trace other than hidden boxes.<span>  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our adventures have taken us to the shores of the Pacific, along
and across the Atlantic, as well as close to home.<span>  </span>However, we need to revisit Devil’s Lake
State Park as our last visit was prior to our letterboxing life.</p>

<p>May the 4<sup>th</sup> be with you a little while longer and
enjoy Cinco de Mayo!</p>

<p>Thanks to Adam for confirming my full card Bingo!  Who will be next?  We've enjoyed the poems very much.  They have kept our spirits up during this long Great Lakes winter.</p>
