Barefoot Lucy ~ I don't know if our G.S. camp would allow one or not, but I'd be happy to ask and adopt a box to be placed there or near there!  Just let me know!  Thanks!  Huntin dogs<br/>

Barefoot Lucy---count me in on planting a box near one of our BS summer camps in Ohio! Thanks for the offer!! This would be in southeastern Ohio.TrailtrackerBarefoot Lucy wrote:&gt; LOL Doodle...what's really funny about your description is that it is&gt; exactly how I thought Boy/Cub Scouts would feel about letterboxing, &gt; until we&gt; did a letterboxing-themed parent/pal weekend with Cub Scouts back in&gt; April. Like you, I've staffed numerous Cub and Boy Scout camps and thought&gt; I knew the market well enough to know it wouldn't be well-received, &gt; which is&gt; why I never bothered to ask the Council about putting boxes on camp until&gt; there were already caches.&gt;&gt; I think it's all how you present it as to whether boys get excited about&gt; letterboxing. If you tell them it's art, they'll turn their noses up, if&gt; you tell them the art side is a necessary part of a treasure hunt game,&gt; they'll go with you on it. At our event, all the Cub Scouts received&gt; hand-carved stamps by someone else. 150 boys - 30 at a time - made carving&gt; tools seem like a bad idea, but the boys were terribly upset they &gt; didn't get&gt; to play with the sharp instruments - errr, I mean carve their own&gt; stamps. They did make their own logbooks. We told them the stamp and the&gt; book were tools for the rest of the events for the day. After they had&gt; those two things, they were good to go. I was even amazed at how many of&gt; the Boy Scout staffers came to my station during their off-time to make a&gt; logbook and carve a stamp for themselves.&gt;&gt; I think what ultimately made it a huge success was that the boys realized&gt; they were on an even footing with any of the adults there - they were&gt; learning compass skills and other navigation skills all day that &gt; helped them&gt; be able to read clues for themselves and figure them out as well as any&gt; grown up. In fact, if they found all 13 boxes, there was a 14th for them -&gt; with spoken clues only. They came to me and I said the clues to them in&gt; riddle form, and they had to remember it and figure it out. The boys &gt; got it&gt; long before the dads did! I just don't think they could've gotten the same&gt; sense of satisfaction from geocaching.&gt;&gt; I see the bit about the tech-y side of geocaching, but when you can't &gt; put a&gt; GPSr in every boy's hands, it starts losing its fun value. And then when&gt; most the caches planted aren't trade caches (only about 20% in our &gt; area have&gt; trades, and none of them on scout camp do), what's the fun in all that&gt; hunting, just to write your name and move on to the next?&gt;&gt; And all this reminds me - I have a few of those boxes that still need &gt; to be&gt; hidden in the general wild. The logbooks still have the stamp entries of&gt; the boys in them and each box has a FF prize in it. I wonder if any of you&gt; Great Lakes Scouter/Letterboxers would be interested in taking a box and&gt; planting it near YOUR scout camp?&gt;&gt; -- &gt; Barefoot Lucy&gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"&gt;&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&gt;&gt;No virus found in this incoming message.&gt;Checked by AVG Free Edition. &gt;Version: 7.5.476 / Virus Database: 269.11.8/940 - Release Date: 8/6/2007 4:53 PM&gt; &gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed] <br/>
