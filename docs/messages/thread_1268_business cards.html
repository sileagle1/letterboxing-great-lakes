&gt; &gt; &gt;info, or both?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I know about a year ago Azobox showed me some business-card type<br/>
&gt;cards<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;he was using in letterboxes.  They had a nice background picture<br/>
&gt;with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;tree that kind of looked almost like a watercolor or chalk picture<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;had all the pertinent LB info.  I thought these were kind of a neat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;idea.  I think this is even the company he mentioned he had gotten<br/>
&gt;them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;from.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Is this what you guys are referring to?  Are there other people<br/>
&gt;doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;this now too?  It's kind of a nice clean way to leave your info in<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;box -- very convenient for people to quickly take one rather than<br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to write down your e-mail from inside the log book, etc.<br/>
