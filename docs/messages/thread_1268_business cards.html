info, or both?<br>
<br>
I know about a year ago Azobox showed me some business-card type cards <br>
he was using in letterboxes.  They had a nice background picture with a <br>
tree that kind of looked almost like a watercolor or chalk picture and <br>
had all the pertinent LB info.  I thought these were kind of a neat <br>
idea.  I think this is even the company he mentioned he had gotten them <br>
from.<br>
<br>
Is this what you guys are referring to?  Are there other people doing <br>
this now too?  It's kind of a nice clean way to leave your info in the <br>
box -- very convenient for people to quickly take one rather than have <br>
to write down your e-mail from inside the log book, etc.<br>

About the cards...  I would probably make my own rather than <br>
ordering, thus the design wouldn't be limited.  Have you ever seen <br>
anyone using their signature stamp or another rubber carved/stamped <br>
image?<br>
<br>
What info do you include on the card?<br>
<br>
I feel kind of like I want to have these made up before the GL Gather <br>
to trade -- you know like artists trade ATC's at art gatherings and <br>
stampers trade little signature items they made at stamping <br>
conventions.<br>

letterboxing is, take this card and visit<br>

email address on the cards, so people can take the<br>
card and contact us if our box needs attention.  We<br>
just printed them off on our home computer on the the<br>

have the LB name, LbNA URL, my e-mail and instruction to contact me <br>
if anything is in need of attention.<br>

But I like this idea of making it more of a authentic personal <br>
business card / calling card to use both for contact info for finders <br>
and in trade with other letterboxers at gatherings and such.<br>
