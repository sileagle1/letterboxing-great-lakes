                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  What a fantastic Birds of a Feather event yesterday!  <br>
TrailRider and Pastor's wife were so well organized (they even <br>
obtained some great weather for us). Their husbands and other family <br>
members assisted with cooking, photos, and generally keeping <br>
everything flowing.  There were a ton of great carvngs and the bird <br>
theme was carried out in variety of creative ways.  The trails <br>
surrounding the lodge and river were nice and we had a chance to <br>
explore all of them on our hunts.  Not only did we find a lot of <br>
boxes, the hostesses gave everyone a CD with bird-themed songs by <br>
many different artists. We've only listened to a bit of it so far, <br>
but we'll have a chance to hear the rest when we drive home later <br>
today.<br>
<br>
As usual at an event, the food was tasty (especially those Revel <br>
bars!) and it was great to see so many "old friends" again.  It was <br>
also fun to meet people like Northstar and Espresso Beans who were <br>
attending their first event.  Northstar has a great logbook, with <br>
annnotations for  every box find.<br>
<br>
Thanks TR and PW for organizing and executing a wonderful day for all <br>
of us!<br>

<br>
DITTO..DITTO..DITTO!<br>
We left the event after 5:30 and the parking lot was still full of cars... with many still out <br>
on the trails...trying to capture all of those elusive birds! <br>
 <br>
The food was super!..Hats off to all of the cooks!..Especially the grill masters who so <br>
faithfully slaved over the hot coals!<br>
<br>
The stamps were clever, enjoyable and it seemed funny that a lot of the boxes stuck with <br>
the theme..."Birds of a feather, flock together"...I guess letterboxers do think <br>
alike..."Hmmm, Big dead tree, great place to hide a box...and another box..and maybe one <br>
more just for the fun of it!"<br>
<br>
I think FungusWoman made and donated the fun bird CD's...That FW, always looking out <br>
for us and providing the icing on the cake!<br>
<br>
As usual it was great to meet up with those "old" friends and meet new...We love this <br>
hobby!<br>
<br>
And as for the prize drawing.....Yippee-I-O-Ki-AAAAA!  How fun is it to go to a letterbox <br>
gathering and win a great bottle of local wine!  <br>
<br>
As we gathered up our stuff and said our good-byes to Pastors Wife, Trail Rider and their <br>
crew, they looked very tired...But, I sure hope it was a "good tired" because we all <br>
appreciated their hard work that went into making a delightful day for all of us!  Thank <br>
you!  Thank you!  Thank you!<br>

We had a WONDERFUL time at the gathering!<br>
<br>
The park was perfect for a gathering...everything was spread out, but it <br>
was all along the same trail.  Result....most of the boxes were far <br>
enough away from one another that there were not 'packs' of folks at <br>
each box, but we were able to bump into most of the groups along the <br>
way. (we managed two new exchanges as a result, one with Frog A Nobies <br>
and one with a new local boxer who didn't know about the <br>
gathering...just wanted the box that was newly posted on LBNA!)  Great <br>
to meet boxers who we only know via email and box comments, and, as <br>
always, nice to catch-up with our other boxing friends.  It was nice to <br>
see so many GLKers.  I guess the location was also perfect since it <br>
seemed to be nearly equidistant from Madison, Milwaukee, Chicago, and <br>
Iowa (give or take).<br>
<br>
Trial Rider, Pastor's Wife, and company were tremendous hosts.....They <br>
had everything under control, and they didn't seem to have forgotten any <br>
minor detail!  We felt a bit lazy...when we got there in the morning, <br>
and were leaving in the afternoon, our offers of help came back, <br>
"Thanks, but I think we have everything under control."  And they sure <br>
did!  (BTW, what was the results from the voting)?<br>
<br>
Oh, and the boxes!  WOW, there were some wonderful carves of birds, and <br>
there were a few ingenious hiding locations (including the hiding spot <br>
for the retainer...).  We hadn't seen things like that before. <br>
<br>
GREAT, GREAT day!<br>

The Mukwonago Relay For Life I attended on Friday and Saturday raised $105,300 + and that didn't reflect the matching corporate donations.  So we probably hit our goal of $150,000 for the American Caner Society.  This was my first relay and it was both fun and emotional.  Each of the 24 teams had to have at least one or more persons walking the track from Friday at 4 pm till Saturday at 9 am.  I did my share of walking laps, especially the Sat. 1-2am for the Dress As Your Favorite Rock Star lap.  My tribute to Sir Paul McCartney was fab! Yes, I have photos of Beetle as a Beatle!  But all that lap walking was more than any day of letterboxing.  The abuse we subject ourselves to is amazing.  Today, I just want to rest.  I was thinking of my letterbox friends.  Sorry I wasn't able to attend the BofaF gathering, so I still sent Blackbird Flies instead.  With Love From Me To You!   Beetle  <br>
