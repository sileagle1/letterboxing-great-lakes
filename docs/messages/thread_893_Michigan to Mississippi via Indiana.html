                    <div class="plaintext-content">A postal box is similar to regular, in that it has a stamp and logbook, and<br>
you stamp as you normally would.  Thing is that it isn't hidden with clues.<br>
It gets mailed from person to person.  Some have sign up lists and only<br>
accept a certain number of participants.  Some do have clues or other<br>
conditions that must be met to receive it (See Fish Out of Water 3, for<br>
instance).  This one is different in that I want to share it as a Lb version<br>
of Christmas cards with all the members of LbGLK, so I'm not limiting it to<br>
numbers, and continuing to solicit people to join the list.  I want it to<br>
come home for Christmas, but will send it back out afterwards as needed to<br>
get as many of us stamped in as possible.<br>
<br>
So as I said on a previous message (assuming yahoo sends these out in the<br>
correct order I'm responding!), send me your snail message offlist (ASAP)<br>
and the Kranks will come for a visit!  (Don't worry, we're good houseguests,<br>
and don't eat much!)<br>
