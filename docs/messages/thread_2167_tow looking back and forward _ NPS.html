those folks DO NOT appreciate letterboxing (or geocaching)<br/>
<br/>
You might do well to check out the Land Use policy of the NPS.<br/>
<br/>
Not saying you CAN'T put a box on NPS land (uh-hum ... clearing<br/>
throat) because I know someone (looking around innocently) who has a<br/>
box on another Michigan island that is part of the NPS.<br/>
<br/>
One way to do so would be a Word of Mouth box ... or, just make it<br/>
kind of difficult for the NPS to find out your box is there. (ie: use<br/>
caution if you post clues on letterboxing.org)<br/>

who is THRILLED that someone chose my Haunted Shipwreck box as "the"<br/>
thing they're looking forward to for next year<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Looking forward: I would love to go to the U.P. and camp around for<br/>
a week up there going to different LB. I would like to place a LB on <br/>
Isle Royal. &lt;<br/>
