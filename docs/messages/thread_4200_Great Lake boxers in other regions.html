That's exactly how we felt boxing the last week in Virginia! We saw <br/>
PGranola's stamp in the "Annabel Lee" box, saw Tiptow &amp; Tonto stamped <br/>
in as "first finders" at "The Tribe has Spoken" box (I think that was <br/>
the one), and FungusWoman carved the excellent event stamp for the <br/>
SummerSlam Pub Crawl event that we attended on Saturday.  Always fun to <br/>
see evidence of our friends in faraway spots!<br/>
