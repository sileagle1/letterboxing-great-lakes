As is customary I would like to hear from anyone who is interested in hosting the event.  Typically the gathering is held on a Saturday in late May or early June -- exact date is host's choice.<br>
<br>
I did want to mention that we do already have one person who is very interested and ready to jump in as host!<br>
<br>
Please respond to the list or to me directly before the end of August. If there are multiple parties interested in hosting the event we can try to hook them up or a vote will be taken based on proposed date and location.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
