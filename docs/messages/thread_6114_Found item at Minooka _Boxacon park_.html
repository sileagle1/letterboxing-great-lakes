Unfortunately, no.  They are still out there somewhere!  Maybe we could list them as a WOM and anyone who finds them gets a special "Lost & Found" Stamp!<br>

Sorry to hear your friend lost her glasses.  I checked with the park and we have not currently found a pair.  Sometimes these things take a while to show up.  If they are turned in, we will contact you at this e-mail address.  If you would like to periodically check with Minooka Park directly, you can do so by calling them at (262) 896-8006.  Good luck!<br>
<br>

Sincerely,<br>
