                    <div class="plaintext-content">In an effort to clean up past loose ends/mistakes before embarking on <br/>
anything new, I have replaced the On the Waterfront box in downtown <br/>
Rockford and updated the clues this weekend.  Hopefully, this new spot <br/>
will be a little more permanant. <br/>
<br/>
The "I Want YOU, to Want ME!" letterbox, (my first ever, and naively <br/>
vulnerable) would have been replaced as well but I somehow lost my <br/>
personal stamp this weekend(WAHHH!!).  Retracing my steps has not <br/>
turned it up and I didn't want to replace the box without stamping in <br/>
myself.  I should have it in place by the end of the week.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, be on the lookout for some new clues in Northern Illinois along <br/>
the Wisconsin border - especially if you're in the mood for a halfway <br/>
decent hike.  I'm not the official placer, but I promise - I helped!  <br/>

the clues should be updated by this afternoon.  :)  It feels so good <br/>
