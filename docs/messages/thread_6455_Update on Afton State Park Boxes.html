                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well we are back from the trails with moderate success! But for all you boxers out there who still had active boxes, we wanted to give you an update.  <br>
<br>
MN State Flower- Lady Slipper (Missing) We found your location and are certain that the box isn't there.<br>
<br>
Babe the Blue Ox- Well we canvased about a mile of the trail looking for possible trails up the side of the hill, we explored many, surprisingly looked at many burnt stumps but with no avail. This is the box that we probably spent the longest time looking for because in our opinion it could still be out there but we might not have found the exact location, but like I said we explored many possibilities.  <br>
<br>
Empire on Rails, is safe and sound, looks like the logbook was wet at one point but a bag was switched out and is now dry again! <br>
<br>
Manoomin, well after our "gentle" ascend, we were really hoping that we would find your box WiHi but we didn't.  We will send you an email with a picture of your box location just to make sure it's the correct location but no luck sorry it does seem as though it is missing.  We do want to make a call to the Ranger though, just to make sure it's not there anymore. We tried to contact them when were were done but they were closed already.<br>
<br>
Lock, Shock and Barrel, all 3 of your boxes are safe and sound!<br>
<br>
Spam Bus is also safe and sound, no problems to report.<br>
<br>
Prince is unfortunately missing as well.  There was quite a bit of flooding on the beach area for starters so if the box was located anywhere near the hill it probably got washed away.  However! We did climb the hill from another direction to canvas downward, we investigated a couple of solid possibilities with no avail.<br>
<br>
Well there you have it guys, if anyone who has missing boxes wants to contact the ranger station to see if by chance they have collected it we would be happy to pick up your box for you!<br>
<br>
Good to be on the trails again and thanks for all your posts!<br>
<br>
LK and OLJ<br>

> Hello fellow boxers! Lighthouse Keeper here! So recently One Love Journeying and I have moved into the Twin Cities area; We have been exploring the metro boxes recently but seeing that it's such a beautiful day we wanted to do our first full day of boxing at a nearby State Park, we chose the site of the 2008 Great Lakes Letterboxing location, Afton State Park.  However we heard that there have been some problems with the Rangers at the park.  Wondering if there were any further status updates on any of the other boxes? Additionally, we were wondering if anyone knew the clues to ArtGekko's boxes, since they are not posted on AQ.... any updates would be appreciated!<br>
