This event will have a plethora of stamps, many of them micros, and<br>
will involve snow. So, if you think you're ready for the challenge of<br>
a Familyof6 event, sign up (and no, the clues won't be as challenging<br>
as the Fairies of the Forest event...this is winter after all and we<br>
don't want to be finding frozen boxers on the trail (like doglvrs or<br>
Tonto for that matter) or wait until spring to find a thawed out chick<br>
(wink..wink...) It will, however, promise to be fun...fun...fun....! <br>
<br>
So...go to the link...decipher the clue...shoot me an email with the<br>
location and city and get yourself there on Saturday, February 7th<br>
(with boots!)And if that doesn't work, hey, you can help celbrate my<br>
birthday that weekend! Now, doesn't that sound fun. And Mrs. D....I'm,<br>
expecting a big gift...OK? lol<br>

Familyof6 <br>

remember that ;)<br>
