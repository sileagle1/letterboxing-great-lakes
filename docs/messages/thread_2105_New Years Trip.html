 &gt; I love listening to all of your new years resolutions, and it got me<br/>
 &gt; excited about my upcoming trip.  I have to let you know that River Rat<br/>

 &gt; around a Dallas Cowboys game but it turns out that letterboxing is<br/>

We were in Texas over Thanksgiving and had a nice time (Austin - San Antonio<br/>
area).  We saw some armadillos on a few trails and 4 turkeys waddled ahead<br/>
of us on the trail on Thanksgiving day - very funny!  Found quite a few<br/>
boxes and had some GREAT Texas BBQ.  You should have a great trip!<br/>
