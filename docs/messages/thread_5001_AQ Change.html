Those of you with clues on Atlas Quest will want to know that Green <br>

yet, but I assume it is somewhat similar to geocaching.com.  You can <br>
choose to opt out entirely.  You can choose to allow comments after <br>
you have moderated them.  You can choose to allow unmoderated <br>
comments.  The choice is yours, but if you want to select one of the <br>
more secretive options I would act quickly.<br>
=================================<br>
<br>
I'm surprised that Ryan set the default to ALLOW comments, since <br>
there has been a lot of concern about what type of "spoilers", etc. <br>
might be posted when people have the ability to post public comments <br>
in the box listing.  <br>
<br>
I immediately went to AQ and disabled comments on my boxes.  However <br>
since I only have 6 boxes listed on AQ (only my International boxes), <br>
3 of which have never been found yet, it's not a huge issue for me.<br>

They show up on the bottom of the main box page (not the clue page).<br>
<br>
This is for an LTC, not a real box, but you can see what it looks <br>

There's a big debate going on about this on the message boards on AQ, <br>
and I think he changed his mind because of that. <br>

<br>
Lots of people agreed with this.  Ryan just changed it so that the <br>
default is "moderate comments" so the planter/owner has control over <br>
what gets posted.  You can go into your preferences and select <br>
options to automatically post comments (you can delete anything you <br>
don't like later) or you can select no comments so you don't have to <br>
approve anything and nothing can be posted.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of comments, but I did switch my option to moderate <br>
before he set that as the default.  It could be pretty handy for <br>
boxes that are outside of a planters stomping grounds, but need <br>
maintenance or for planters that go MIA.  It'd be helpful to the next <br>
person to know that clues may need to be updated or maintenance is needed.<br>

I'm not quite sure what to do about this as most comments are, "thanks for the nice stamp." I mean really whose going to say, "What a crappy stamp"?<br>

Here is the main problem I have . . . yesterday, we drove to Washington Co., Iowa (I'll post more of our trip later) I left no "individual" box comments... I just hit "log find" only on the last box did I leave any comments and since we found 7 boxes all placed by the same boxer I gave her the whole run down of the day. <br>

There's an option for you as a finder leaving the comment to select <br>
"public" or "private".  So, if you just want the placer to see it, <br>
you can check private.<br>
<br>
If you as a placer have a bunch of "nice stamp" or "thanks" comments, <br>
you also have the option to delete those posts.  Actually, he's <br>
changed it now so that it defaults to moderated.  So, you actually <br>
have to approve all comments before they're posted to your boxes.  If <br>
you don't want to moderate them, you can go to "preferences" and then <br>
miscellaneous to change your settings to display all (with option to <br>
delete later) or display none.<br>

<br>
Yeah, it's good!  It does default to public, so you have to be a <br>
little conscious of what you're saying and make sure you have the <br>
right bullet marked, but it's definitely good to have the <br>
option.  You certainly need to ability to be able to say, "okay so we <br>
look in this specific spot... were we way off or is the box MIA?" <br>
without giving away info to the masses.  I do like the idea of <br>
comments being available on the boxes, though.  Right now, I'm going <br>
to leave mine un-moderated to see what happens.<br>
