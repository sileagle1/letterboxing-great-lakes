Re: goats - When I got all the park information from Jubilee the park manager (Tom) mentioned "no goats". Weird, right? Well, then when my mom and I were down at Jubilee checking out the camping last fall, we saw a farm with a big sign out front that read "No Goats Farm" with a picture of a goat with a o and / through it. Well, we were certainly intrigued and last week I got to the bottom of the goat story...If you'd like to know the rest of the story, keep your eyes open for a box to be placed near the No Goats Farm before the gathering. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Regarding the shelter for the gathering, the only shelter that may be reserved in advance is the Quail Meadow Shelter. We will have our check in & tabletop boxes etc at this shelter. We are planning to grab the shelter that is very near by for the potluck. As mentioned before their shelters are smallish, so we decided to split the eating and stamping. We will update the event listing to include the shelter name. Thanks so much!!<br>
