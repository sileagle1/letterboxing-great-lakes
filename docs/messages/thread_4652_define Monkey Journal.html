                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is a type of handmade logbook that is easy to make and customize to any size.  It is hand-stitched with a simplified variation of the coptic stitch, but the covers are done much easier than stitched journals.  I started making it soon after I began letterboxing based on the desire to make my own logbooks -- that looked nice, could be made any size I needed to fit the container and didn't take forever to make.  At the first Great Lakes Gathering I did a workshop on making it and since then several other people have led workshops on making them at subsequent gatherings.<br>
<br>
I called it the Monkey Journal based on my nickname as a kid.<br>
