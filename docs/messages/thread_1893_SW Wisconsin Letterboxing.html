                    <div class="plaintext-content">The kids had a 4-day weekend this past weekend, so we made a trip <br/>
(mainly to go to the Dells) but also got a few letterboxes.  We were <br/>
pleased that we found all the boxes we were looking for and they <br/>
were all in good shape.  On Sunday afternoon we went to Madison and <br/>
went to the zoo, where we then went on to find "Lions" (placed by <br/>
Ili and Lil).  We then went on to find another box by them: "Peas in <br/>
a Pod" as we walked around the State Capital and Campus Areas (this <br/>
was Find 100 for the kids and me!).  <br/>
<br/>
The next day we drove through Merrimac and found the "I Believe in <br/>
Ferries!" box placed by the Puddlejumpers.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we rode the car ferry and went on to Devil's Lake State Park.  <br/>
We hiked for about 3 hours and found "Vertical Ascent" and "Snake <br/>
Story", both placed by Wisconsin Hiker.  There were tons of people <br/>
on the trails that day, including a school group of about 100 kids.  <br/>
It was a challenge getting to the boxes in between the various <br/>
groups, but we managed--patience isn't always one of our virtues.  <br/>
Then trying to stamp in without looking like we were stamping in.  <br/>
For Snake Story, we were perched on some rocks a little further down <br/>
the trail.  The kids pretended like they were taking notes in their <br/>
journals and sketching plants.  One lady walking by said we looked <br/>
very studious writing in our books, so I guess the plan worked.  It <br/>
was a very foggy morning as we hiked and we feared that we would <br/>
never see any of the pretty views.  Finally, about noon, as we were <br/>
on the final leg of our hike, the fog finally lifted and we had some <br/>
beautiful views of the lake and the bluffs!<br/>
<br/>
Then it was on to the Waterpark at the Dells, so no more <br/>
letterboxing.  I had a few more boxes that I wanted to get but <br/>
unfortunately my family isn't as obsessed with getting boxes as I <br/>
am.  There's always another trip I guess.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently went through Sw Wisc. on a two day boxing binge and found many great boxes by Leapin' Lizards, Puddlejumpers and The Dragon. If anyone hasn't been to the Dragons tunnel series yet I HIGHLY recommend them. My favorite boxes so far. Once you go you'll know why. I can only say this about them. Go alone and don't bring a flashlight!!!!! The creepiest and most fun I've had boxing to date. There are other great boxes in Sw Wisc. as well, I hit so many in two days I can't remember them all without looking at my logbook. Thank you to all the placers in SW Wisc. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. <br/>
