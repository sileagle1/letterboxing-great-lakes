finally have some sun & warmer weather.  We checked on my February Frolic<br>
box (in good shape) and Martini Man planted a new box.  The Frolic box had a<br>
first finder on Sunday, but I did tweak the clues tonight to better reflect<br>
the trail conditions without snow.  (However we actually still have a small<br>
pile of snow at the side of our driveway!)<br>

There are fewer people playing BINGO this year than last year, but the first<br>
3 games were won sooner.  However now the perimeter and full card are taking<br>
longer.  The vagaries of the game.  By this date last year there were 8<br>
winners (due to some ties).  This year there have only been 2 winners (due<br>
to TG winning twice).  Here's a comparison of last year to this year:<br>
<br>
Bingo Winners - 2007<br>
Straight Line<br>
  2/6/ 07 - M&8X & Pastor's Wife (tie)<br>
<br>

<br>
"X"<br>
  4/2/07 - P. Granola<br>

<br>
<br>

If SpringChick would just call a certain word, either Martini Man or I could<br>
call a perimeter tomorrow.....<br>
