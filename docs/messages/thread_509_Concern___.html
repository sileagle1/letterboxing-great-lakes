                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know that even though I'm from Ohio, I like reading all the Michigan stuff (esp. since we're visiting in, hey, less than a week!).  My concern is that now the Michigan stuff is going to go elsewhere.  I could register for the other list too, but then I start to forget where it was that I read stuff so that I post answers to the correct list.  Or I'll end up posting to both lists most of the time now, since not everyone on the Michigan list will be on LbGLK & vice versa and if it's pertinent for the MI list it's most likely pertinent for LbGLK, too, and then I'm busy posting instead of boxing (or, as usually happens, working since I read most of my email during the workday).<br>

Oh, so confusing.  I'm going back to studying my Michigan maps again.<br>

Doodle aka Diane, who by the time I've got our Michigan Letterboxing Itineary planned I'm going to know SE MI better than the East side of Cleveland!<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
