What blows me away about MI is that the UP is filled up, but the most <br/>

How can that be?<br/>

Wisconsin has 16 "boxless" counties left, but Michigan has only 14.  I<br/>
wonder which state will be totally "green" first??  (Wisconsin has a total<br/>
of 72 counties and Michigan has 83 counties).  OK, I can't stop checking<br/>
numbers.... Illinois has a whopping 102 counties, 46 of which have boxes (56<br/>
still need boxes!!)  25% of the Illinois boxes are in Cook county.  MUST...<br/>
STOP... STATISTICAL.... TENDENCIES!!!!<br/>

I'm knee-deep in last-minute gathering details at the moment, but after it passes, I will color up a map for MI like WI Hiker has done for WI.<br/>
<br/>
What constitutes a planted county?  If there is a listing specifying a county at either LbNA or Atlasquest for an active letterbox, it counts -- doesn't matter if there are any status reports from the last year, etc.  Just has to be a listed box that is believed to be active.  I realize there may actually be boxes in some counties that are WOM or mystery boxes that do not indicate the county -- because they do not have a publically specified county, these don't count.<br/>
<br/>
As was previously mentioned, the U.P. already has a box in every county, so the remaining counties are all in the lower peninsula.  So get out the map and dig around a little to find something unique, scenic or interesting about a boxless county that inspires you to plant a box there!<br/>

  I have a little bit of information to share about counties being colored <br/>
  in on the map. There is a letterboxer in GA who helps a great deal with <br/>
  this. Apparently, the shading must be done "by hand" as opposed to <br/>
  "clicking on" when a box shows up on LbNA. That is why there is a <br/>
  delay. Eidolon is the letterboxer's trail name if anyone wants to join <br/>
  me in thanking him! I think it helps a lot when planning road trips!<br/>

ArtGekko has already placed several boxes in WI and we hope to find some of<br/>
the Rhinelander boxes next July when we are up at Martini Man's family<br/>
cottage.  My mom found some of them earlier this month when she introduced<br/>
her sister to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking another MN boxer who is originally from WI might also help out<br/>
our cause now that MI has made this a "friendly competition".  Luckily we<br/>
have more neighbors since we are starting out with 2 more counties than MI<br/>
to populate!  I know it will be harder to get out there in the winter, but<br/>
it would be great if anyone else who might be able to get to one of the<br/>
remaining counties (the "boot" that Dragon noticed:<br/>
http://letterboxing.homestead.com/WIcounties.html ) would help the WI team<br/>
in the effort by placing a box!<br/>

I will do what I can on this front. I live just over the border from<br/>
