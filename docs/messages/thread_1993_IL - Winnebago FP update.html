sent it again today. For those of you who may have boxes placed in <br>
Winnebabo county forest preserves, you might want to get out and check <br>
on them. <br>
<br>
I offered to come in and check on what ones they have. If I recognize <br>
any of them, I will definately let the owners know they are there. :)<br>

Before we could check on Deer Run #1, the rain started so we loaded up the <br>
horses in the rain and went home.<br>
