                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello!  We just went to San Francisco during our spring break and did a little letterboxing while we were there.  There are quite a few around town, but most of them are hidden in Golden Gate Park.  We found the series called "Chorizon"s Journey", (I think that's how it was spelled).  We meant to find a lot more, but I guess we underestimated how big the park really was.  A person could spend a couple days there and still not see everything!  The nice thing that you will have going for you if you visit Golden Gate Park now is the park shuttle.  It's free and it will take you all over the park.  It wasn't running when we were there, so we had to walk everywhere, which got to be taxing after a while.  The Japanese Tea Garden was incredible and a walk around Stow Lake is worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if you've been to San Francisco before, but I have some tips for you just in case:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Food, and everything in general is pretty expensive there.  We packed a six pack of bottled water and a box of granola bars in our suitcases.  Good for snacks and breakfast and better than having to buy it when you get there. (We had one breakfast at a George Web's-type diner and it cost $9.00 for an omelet).<br/>
<br/>
2.  Avoid the trolleys.  Maybe ride one once just to kicks, but it is so much cheaper to ride the buses or the street cars.  The trolleys don't go very far, they stop at almost every block and the cable car dudes pack everybody on there like sardines.  Not very pleasant.  Depending on where you are staying and where you are going, it's better to just walk.<br/>
<br/>
3.  If you like tea, there is a wonderful little shop in Chinatown that will let you sample all kinds of exotic teas for free. I don't remember the name, but it has a big sign out front that says "Free Samples." You can just sit and relax and a cute little Asian girl will tell you all about the teas you are drinking, where they came from, what medicinal properties they have. It's a pretty cool experience.  You can purchase the teas you really like so that you can enjoy them at home.<br/>
<br/>
4.  The restaurant in North Beach called "The Stinking Rose" is awesome!  Great Italian at a pretty decent price considering the area.<br/>
<br/>
5.  If you like kitschy-weird toys and things like that, check out Jeffery's Toys near Union Square.<br/>
<br/>
6.  If you go to the Wharf area, it should be to only eat the Dungeness Crabs and pick up your ferry to go somewhere else.  There is a cool arcade museum to see there that has lots of old games and fortune tellers, (remember the movie "Big"?) Otherwise the whole are is corporate-culture obnoxious!  Hard Rock Cafe, Ripley's Museum, over-priced junk, etc.  Besides it's teaming with people of Summerfest proportions.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Depending on where you are staying, the BART is an excellent and cheap way to get from the airport to your hotel.  About 4.00 a person - can't beat that!<br/>
<br/>
This may be more input than you were looking for, but hopefully you can find some of these tips helpful.  Let me know if you have any other questions.<br/>
