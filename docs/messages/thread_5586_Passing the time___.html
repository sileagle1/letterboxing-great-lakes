exchanges... as I have only met 2 of the 23 others before.<br/>
<br/>
I took Skeeter &amp; Bug-a-Boo with me and they had a good time too.<br/>
<br/>
We attempted 3 boxes before the gathering but the cold weather, snow &amp;  ice <br/>
all contributed to us coming up empty handed.<br/>
<br/>
Either way we had a great time at the gathering and look forward to finding  <br/>
lots of boxes this spring!!<br/>

We spent half of it with our kids around the house and then did a  few <br/>
errands...visited a friend at her bridal shop to drop off some shirts my son  designed <br/>
that she sells for him there. (BTW, if you are interested you can  check his <br/>
t-shirt line out at _http://crimelessclothing.bigcartel.com/_ <br/>
(http://crimelessclothing.bigcartel.com/)  )   Then we stopped for lunch at Panera Bread, came <br/>
home and in the evening some  friends came over for a "Lost" marathon since <br/>
we are all "Lost" fans.  Not  too exciting, but kept busy.  Anyone else?<br/>

actually have his own clothing line?  How old is he?  Sounds totally<br/>
fascinating.  He must be quite the creative and interesting kind of guy to<br/>
decide to do something like that.  By the way, I was wondering if you had<br/>
done anything interesting and fun on Saturday, the 24th, that we might like<br/>
to hear about???<br/>
