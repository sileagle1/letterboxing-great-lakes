                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you all for the wonderful reviews!! It was alot of hard work, <br/>
but it was worth it!! You all buttered me up so much that I think I <br/>
might make this a yearly thing. I love fantasy and was glad I could <br/>
share my interests with some fellow LBers. I must thank Trail Troll <br/>
for all her help, she really came through!!! Those cookies were sooo <br/>
good. I think I might make one of the three sets of clues permanent, I <br/>
have to talk to park guy (hope he isn't like Tiki Mike, lol). If any <br/>
of you want your stamps back let me know! Hope to see you all at the <br/>
mystery gathering!! Hey while I got the rest of the boxes still out <br/>
there if any one is interested in doing a mini meet let me know its <br/>
got to be soon though (next 2 weeks)! It was great meeting all of you!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; okay, so we are the last to chime in, we also had an AWESOME <br/>

what <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; happened with the tiki guy, besides the change in our final <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; All boxes were wonderful and it was evident how much effort <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; put <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; into the boxes.  From each boxes story line to the bonus box <br/>
&gt; which <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we could find by deciphering a code found on map pieces we had <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; put together.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We had fun getting to know team rabbit, and how Cichlid Guy <br/>
&gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; us out on the trail, I'll never know.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We're up for a mini meet.  Doubledragon we can't say enough <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; your creativity!  The event was so incredible we didn't even <br/>
&gt; care <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that we came in last.<br/>

  Well SpringChick if your up to it we are thinking of having a mini <br/>
  meet on the 23rd in the morning, what say you? I would like to get <br/>
  some vets to visit the boxes before they are retired.<br/>

  &gt; Gosh! This sounds like it was just an awesome gathering! Sounds <br/>
  &gt; like it was really well organized and very creative. So glad it <br/>
  all <br/>
  &gt; came together well and congrats to DD for a succesful event! I am <br/>
  &gt; so bummed that I wasn't able to attend -- hopefully there will be <br/>
  a <br/>
  &gt; repeat performance next year.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; You're not the last to chime in! I want to add my praise for <br/>
  &gt; &gt; DoubleDragon's amazing efforts. I can't believe the amount of <br/>
  &gt; work <br/>
  &gt; &gt; that went in to preparing three separate quests, not to mention <br/>
  &gt; being <br/>
  &gt; &gt; prepared for all of us to carve a hitchhiker and make a logbook <br/>
  &gt; &gt; before we could start. The rain that started the day didn't <br/>
  &gt; dampen <br/>
  &gt; &gt; anyone's spirits - besides, LindaFay looked fab wearing a trash <br/>
  &gt; bag <br/>
  &gt; &gt; all day. I will certainly be there for the next one - and will <br/>
  &gt; &gt; volunteer to help more. It's incredible that DD managed to do <br/>
