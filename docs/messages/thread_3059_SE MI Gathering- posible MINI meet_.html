                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you all for the wonderful reviews!! It was alot of hard work, <br>
but it was worth it!! You all buttered me up so much that I think I <br>
might make this a yearly thing. I love fantasy and was glad I could <br>
share my interests with some fellow LBers. I must thank Trail Troll <br>
for all her help, she really came through!!! Those cookies were sooo <br>
good. I think I might make one of the three sets of clues permanent, I <br>
have to talk to park guy (hope he isn't like Tiki Mike, lol). If any <br>
of you want your stamps back let me know! Hope to see you all at the <br>
mystery gathering!! Hey while I got the rest of the boxes still out <br>
there if any one is interested in doing a mini meet let me know its <br>
got to be soon though (next 2 weeks)! It was great meeting all of you!!<br>

you're willing to do this every year, we're definitely there!  Of <br>
course, a team had to come in "last", but SpartanFans teamwork made <br>
for a blast of a time (not to mention the late addition of a <br>
Cichlid)!  The weather tried to spoil it, Miles tried to spoil it, <br>
but nothing could spoil the fun that everyone had!  A perfect amount <br>
of 'boxers, and I couldn't stop eating TrailTroll's cookies - Yum yum <br>
yum!  DD, we're in for the "recovery" meet too, if our schedules can <br>
work - please don't put yourselves out trying to accomodate.    <br>
<br>
Did anyone get some good photos that day?  Most of ours are of <br>
people's backs and folks eating.  Not too flattering...  Hope to see <br>
you all at the mystery place (if we're not dumb bunnies)!<br>

All boxes were wonderful and it was evident how much effort was put <br>
into the boxes.  From each boxes story line to the bonus box which <br>
we could find by deciphering a code found on map pieces we had to <br>
put together.  <br>
We had fun getting to know team rabbit, and how Cichlid Guy found us <br>
out on the trail, I'll never know.  <br>
<br>
We're up for a mini meet.  Doubledragon we can't say enough about <br>
your creativity!  The event was so incredible we didn't even care <br>
that we came in last.<br>
