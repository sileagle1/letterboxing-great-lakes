(but I have to admit it is a purchased stamp -- I really was out taking photographs, not planning to plant a box when I found this place...  didn't have any carving material with me and couldn't let such a beautiful place go without a box).  It's funny how the boxes you aren't sure about -- not sure how good the hiding spot is -- will it be found by muggles, is it high enough to weather high seas and storms, etc., they are the ones that just hang right in there.  The better box, Serendipity's Sister, a mystery box, was located along the bay further north and lasted a couple of years but has now been officially declared missing, even though that hiding spot I thought was much better...  Go figure!<br>
<br>
But hey...  the more the merrier, so plant away!<br>
