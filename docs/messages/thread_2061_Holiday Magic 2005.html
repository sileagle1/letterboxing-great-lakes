experience the Holiday Magic festival.  Even better, you can now get a<br/>
letterbox while you are there!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go to the far northwest corner of the North Parking Lot (off Golfview Road).<br/>
Stand at the corner curb and look NW towards the corner of the fence.  See<br/>
the little Charlie Brown Tree?  A few feet behind it, just about in line<br/>
with where you are standing and the corner of the fence, there is a tree<br/>
with a stump near it and a lot of scrubby undergrowth.  Three guesses (and<br/>
the first two don't count) what is hiding there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're feeling creative and the weather isn't too cold, bring a red,<br/>
yellow, orange, green, blue, and black marker.  Otherwise any old stamp pad<br/>
works just fine.  It is a dark corner, so don't wait until it's time to go<br/>
home to stamp in!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just be alert for zoo security - have an excuse ready for why you are at the<br/>
furthest corner from the entrance to the zoo (uhhh, watching the sunset???).<br/>
If it's extremely heavy snow, it might be hard to find and cover adequately,<br/>
and watch for leaving telltale footprints (you knew that!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Might be a temporary placement, might be permanent, stamp might be<br/>
seasonally changed.haven't decided yet!  <br/>
