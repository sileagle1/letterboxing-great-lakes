How Cool - I never knew there was a calendar!  If you go there (and <br>
haven't before like me) click the tab that says "events" and there they <br>

You can post an event at Atlas Quest, too!<br>

We are patterning this year's MI Fall Gathering after the annual Mystery Gathering on the East Coast and as such the exact date and location will be provided in clues as we get closer to the event.  To help people in planning, at this time we can say that this event is being held during the month of October in the lower half of lower Michigan.<br>

Unfortunately the nature of a calendar indicates that you must choose a date.  At AQ the event is listed as a mystery date.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
I know there are some newer people on the board, so I just wanted to <br>
remind everyone that anyone and everyone can plan gatherings with <br>
whatever theme and whatever date they'd like.  No voting or prior <br>
approval necessary!<br>
<br>
The Great Lakes region does have an annual event that SpringChick <br>
started, and she has stated that it should always be the first <br>
Saturday after Memorial Day and the location should move around <br>
within the region.<br>
<br>
However, any OTHER things you'd like to organize would probably be <br>
welcomed with enthusiasm by the boxers in your area!  Last year <br>
Martini Man and I hosted a Haunted Harvest event in October just <br>
because we felt like it.  If you check out the events section of <br>
AtlasQuest you'll see that there are lots of other events going on in <br>
other areas of the USA at all times of the year.  Some are very <br>
simple and informal and some are pretty elaborate.  SpringChick and <br>
Azobox are hosting an event in MI this fall but that doesn't mean <br>
there can't be other events in WI or IL this fall or winter.  Since <br>
the June regional event is too far away for some people to travel to, <br>
and since most of us like gatherings, I'd like to encourage all of <br>
you to think about hosting something at some point.  Remember - it <br>
doesn't have to be elaborate!  Some winter events in other states <br>
don't even include much "boxing", but focus more on social <br>
interaction or perhaps some sharing of tips & tricks.  I know we have <br>
a lot of enthusiatic and creative people in the region, so I'm hoping <br>
something might materialize in the WI/IL area before the 2007 GL <br>
event in Ohio (because that seems SO far in the future!)<br>

Welcome!  Here's some info I posted as a "Frequently Asked Question" <br>
on a gathering web site in 2006:<br>
<br>
I've never been to a Gathering before.  What should I expect?<br>
<br>
* Friendly folks - Don't be shy, just walk up and say hi!<br>
<br>
* Tasty food<br>
<br>
* Lots of boxes, some will be WOM boxes (Word of Mouth) so stay alert <br>
for verbal hints, unusual questions or clues that get distributed in <br>
ways other than the clue booklet.<br>
<br>
*  More tips can be found here:<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/tips2.html<br>
<br>
We hope to meet you at one of the gatherings!<br>
