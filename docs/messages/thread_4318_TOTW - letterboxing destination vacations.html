the past posts is like a novel....Such characters!...Such plots!  <br>
Sweaty women boxers...SPY's... apologies..."Monty Python's" needing <br>
adoption...Faire boxes missing....and 500 memebers - some with <br>
aliases...imagine that!  <br>
While letterboxing (as we know it) is in a constant state of re-<br>
inventing itself...We went on a "Letteboxing Destination Vacation" to <br>
actually get out there and enjoy all the perfect aspects that <br>
attracted us to the hobby in the first place.  Beautiful hikes, <br>
learning about the historical, geological and cultural points of a <br>
given area...and did we mention BEAUTIFUL, STUNNING hikes????!!!!!<br>
 Unfortunately, we were only able to go away for three days when we <br>
were called for a family emergency that has knocked us out of <br>
commission...(Tiptoe's father is very ill...)<br>
Anyway...as for the "Letterboxing Destination Vacation Getaway"...We <br>
want all of you in the Great Lakes area (and beyond) to consider <br>
Hocking Hills in Southeast Ohio!  Oh My!  We were so impressed with <br>
the area!  Now, we love all of our Midwest area..but, this was a <br>
surprise treat!  <br>
We were able to hike about 25 miles...and not wanting anyone to jump <br>
on us about letterbox counts...we added 43 to our logbook!  Again, <br>
the trip is more about the hike for us, but the letterboxes "told" us <br>
where to go.  Without the boxes there is no way we could've <br>
experienced the area as we did!<br>
The area is comprised of "seven wonders"..actually seven parks within <br>
an area...As we would go to one, Tonto would claim, "This has to be <br>
the main attraction," and then we would go to the next area and it <br>
was equally if not more incredible.<br>
One evening, we traveled 40 min. away to the outdoor theater <br>
production,"Tecumseh".  Beautiful evening  - enjoyable and <br>
informative...but very loud canons - our ears are still ringing. <br>
Tonto really got into it!  We stayed in a marvelous cabin with a hot <br>
tub to soak our tired bones after hiking all day..had a great meal in <br>
a one room log cabin...but, missed our planned dinner <br>
guest...trailtracker...only bad part of the whole trip!<br>
Many letterboxers know about this little jewel of an area...as noted <br>
by the full logbooks...but mostly folks from the Buckeye State...I <br>
think they have kept this a secret to maintain the non-commercial, <br>
rural, and natural feel...it was fabulous!  Except, cell-phone <br>
addicted Tonto was constantly on the lookout for a pay phone...(no <br>
cell phone service in the area except in Logan)..I accused him of <br>
being Amish...inside joke about pay phones!<br>
Trailtracker has to take a lot of credit for making our trip <br>
OUTSTANDING, she supplied us with a key which made it possible to <br>
find our way around...BTW..We planted our own box while down <br>
there...now, if only we can remember the clues to write them down and <br>
post them...this is why some of us shouldn't be allowed to plant <br>
boxes!<br>
As for the TOTW...what other "letterboxing destination vacations" <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a lovely trip! We'll have to add it to our list of places we <br>
want to visit to letterbox in! We were lucky last year in that we <br>
took a letterboxing vacation through OH, PA, NY, CT, and MA. We would <br>
highly recommend CT (obviously, there are so many boxes and some <br>
great parks and hikes! One of our faves was the Old New-Gate Prison <br>
series in E. Granby) and on Cape Cod in MA (we loved Alice in <br>
Orleans). One of the things I love about 'boxing is you end up seeing <br>
areas that most tourists would never venture into. Some of our <br>
favorite memories from that trip center around letterboxing.<br>

why we go there every November for anniversary!!!!! Looking forward to <br>

pick some absolute beautiful locations to plant boxes.  On our first <br>
trip there we hadn't met Trailtracker yet.  I was convinced she had to <br>
be part billy goat LOL!!!!!  :-)  No offense please Barb, you know I <br>
adore you!!!!!!  In my own opinion I think Hocking Hills has to be one <br>
of the most beautiful locations Ohio has to offer!!!!! :-)  ~The Cats <br>

Trailtracker has placed some of THE BEXT boxes in the state.  Great locations, excellent clues, <br>

Funny you should describe the trails this way..Tonto and I both on <br>
several trails thought exactly the same thing!  Almost magical with <br>
the sunlight streaming down in distinct rays illuminating moss <br>
covered bolders to the point they looked phosphorescent!  We half <br>
expected Frodo to pop out from behind a rock....It was sunny the <br>
entire three days we were visiting Hocking Hills, but I don't think <br>
we actually saw the sun except in a few of the parking areas due to <br>
the amazing canopy of trees, cliffs and rocks....<br>
And even more "Lord of the Ring-like" were the huge "slump blocks" <br>
with the giant foot-like roots attached with a towering tree reaching <br>
up to meet the hundreds of other tall trees...Looked just like <br>
the "Walking trees"...or the feet of giant prehistoric birds!  Very <br>
impressive!<br>
<br>
I'm thinking of borrowing one of those fairy costumes from the "fairy <br>
people" at the Ren Faire for my next foray into the Hocking <br>
Hills...I'd look marvelous with my hiking boots, fanny pack...and <br>
gauzy wings...We won't even imagine the tutu!<br>

<br>
Y'all are being very generous with your comments!  Thank you so much.  <br>
The best part about planting boxes down there and putting the key <br>
together for those who want to get the most out of the trip to the <br>
Hocking Hills area is in the sharing of the stunning sights down there. <br>
I know that many agree---that is the essence of letterboxing! Hocking <br>
Hills is truly a gem of the state of Ohio.<br>
<br>
I have been going down to the Hocking Hills area at least once per <br>
month---if not once per week---for at least a couple of decades.  I <br>
never tire of the scenes.  To get to Ash Cave first--at the crack of <br>
dawn is truly a gift from God and helps put everything in perspective.  <br>
Several other letterboxers have now joined in to place some down <br>
there---and I have to say I get a big honkin' smile on my face when I <br>
see that!  ANY excuse to go back down is BONUS! <br>
<br>
It gives me great joy to know others feel the same way about this area <br>
as I do....and as Grandma Gatewood did when she was seen there.  I just <br>
love that she was the first female thru-hiker of the AT at the age of 63 <br>
and her training was at Hocking Hills. <br>
<br>
Tiptoe---I hope your father is okay!!!<br>
The Chicago Dogs---happy belated birthday this past Monday!! =)<br>
(I think I owe you 4 a glass of wine or a beer or two!!---something!!)<br>
