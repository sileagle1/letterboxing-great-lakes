Kind<br>
of weird, but I found a large glass jelly jar in the woods that had<br>
pictures in it and notes, including one saying it was a time capsule<br>
for someone's kid.  Only problem, it had gotten wet inside so all the<br>
photos were ruined.  I rehid it of course, but had never heard of<br>
hiding a time capsule like this in a wooded area.  Anyone else hear of<br>
this sort of thing?<br>
