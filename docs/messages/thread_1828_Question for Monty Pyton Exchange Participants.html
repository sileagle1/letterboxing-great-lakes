                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was just wondering how everyone is counting the boxes from the Monty <br/>
Python Exchange.  Do you count the boxes you receive and plant as <br/>
placed boxes (since you placed them) or as found boxes (since they <br/>
were created by someone else)?  And then how do you count the box you <br/>
create and someone else plants? <br/>
<br/>
I guess it's probably just each person's preference how they count <br/>
boxes but I just wanted an idea as to the general consensus.  Thanks!!<br/>

Since the general senario is that you make one and get to plant one in<br/>
return, two halves make a whole plant.  And since you could use the<br/>
clues to find a box you created, and you have a stamp of a box you did<br/>
not create, two halves make a whole find!  For those not exchanging,<br/>
you might have a 1/2 count in there until the next exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a reminder that clues should be sent to me, not put up on LBNA.<br/>
 Yes, this will undoubtedly mess up some P and F counts on the LBNA<br/>
site for some.<br/>
