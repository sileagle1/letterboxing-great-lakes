it againbut what to do???  Then it came to me.  Why not do the <br/>
series about the Boar's Head Festival that we are all participating <br/>
in this yearI  find it rather amusing that 4 Waltzing PIGS are <br/>
participating in a BOAR's Head Festival :~)   Anyway, the Boar's <br/>
Head Festival is a Christmas celebration dating back to about 1340 <br/>
A.D. in England.  It gets its name from the boar (the most ferocious <br/>
beast in the forest) which symbolized evil and deathand was <br/>
defeated by the birth of Christ.  The first part of the program is <br/>
set in a medieval manor house complete with lords and ladies, court <br/>
jester, serving wenches, dancers, wassailers, good King Wenceslaus <br/>
and his page and lots of entertainment.  Then the mood becomes more <br/>
serious as the Christmas nativity is enacted, with angels and <br/>
shepherds and magi coming to see Mary, Joseph and the Christ Child.  <br/>
In a grand finale, the medieval court joins the scene to pay homage <br/>
to the newborn King. The actual clues explain things a little <br/>
more.      <br/>
<br/>
We are 4 of a cast of around 100.  I am a lowly serving wench, Ball <br/>
Magnet is a singing wait (demanding his figgy pudding from the <br/>
King), MoneyMan is a shepherd and Do-Re-Mi Gal is the Star of the <br/>
East.  Each stamp in the series reflects one of our roles.  The <br/>
fifth stamp will only be available on the two days of the <br/>
performanceand will be at the location of the performance (still <br/>
scouting out a place for that).  <br/>
<br/>
This festival is an awesome evententertaining and also very <br/>
moving.  This is definitely not the type of Christmas program that <br/>
only a parent could enjoy.  Theater professionals are involved40 <br/>
voice choirorchestragorgeous costumes-etc.  With all the chatter <br/>
this summer about the RenFaire, I thought there might be interest in <br/>
a medieval Christmas program.  So, on to the shameless advertisement<br/>
<br/>
Performances will take place on Saturday, Dec. 9 (at 4 and 7 pm) and <br/>
on Sunday, Dec. 10 (at 4 pm).  It will be held at St. John Lutheran <br/>
Church, 305 Circle Avenue in Forest Park, IL (a suburb of Chicago).  <br/>
Advance sale tickets are $12 for adults and $10 for seniors/students <br/>
and can be ordered by calling (708) 453-2654.  Tickets will also be <br/>
available at the door for $15.  <br/>
<br/>
So, we encourage you to look for the boxes in the woods of River <br/>
Forest.  And then come to one of the performances and look for the <br/>
fifth stamp.  Maybe you could think of it as an event stamp, but <br/>
without a gathering.  <br/>

That's the song the choir sings when the court processes in and the <br/>
pages bring the boar's head in.  And that boar's head is U-G-L-Y!  <br/>
Shaggy brown hair/fur and big tusks.  It is a real live (OK, not alive <br/>
anymore) boar's head donated by someone who owned an archery store.  <br/>
So I'm guessing that he actually shot this wild boar.  And now we haul <br/>
it for the Boar's Head Festival.<br/>

 A belated thank you to those who attended the Boar's Head Festival at <br/>
our church (and received stamp #5).  We hope the festival was a <br/>
blessing as you prepared for Christmas.  We had a wonderful time as <br/>
participants.  There were between 1100-1200 people who attended the <br/>
performances that weekend!  <br/>
