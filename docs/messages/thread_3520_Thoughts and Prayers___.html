     I am deeply sorry for all that you are going through right now.  <br/>
I could never imagine loosing my child, and it is tragic that you are <br/>
facing this pain.  Joseph (and Emily) are lucky to have you both as <br/>
parents.  Even though I do not personally know you, I commend you both <br/>
on being so committed to Joseph.  I work in a children's hospital, and <br/>
it saddens me to see parent's who aren't as committed.  I hope <br/>
Joseph's journey is peaceful.  Your family is in my prayers.  God <br/>
Bless you all...<br/>
<br/>
Warmly, Dog Lover     <br/>
