                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were out working on the Circus today here in Menomonee Falls, WI and we <br>
heard, ahead of us, another family (we heard the cry of someone saying "I <br>
Found It" when we were stamping into one - we never did catch up to them, <br>
but their stamp was a book & below was MKE BC and it was signed Aimlesst.<br>
<br>
Then, when we realized the time (about 3pm), we were headed back towards <br>
the parking area and we came across a couple.  The woman was wearing a Red <br>
Fleece pullover and I think either she or the man with her had the MSOE <br>
logo on what they were wearing.  We saw the gentleman slyly moving his <br>
letterboxing equipment around him as we passed by (gave me a giggle) <br>
especially when I looked back and spied the LbNA Logo patch on his <br>
backpack!  I would have gone back to ask who you were and swapped stamps, <br>
but Hubby needed to go into work for a while and the children were cold!<br>
<br>
We found stamps from Boch's Circus Elephant all the way to the <br>
Contortionist before we had to turn back.  The only one we were unable to <br>
locate out of that was the "Trained Lion, WInter" - he evaded us entirely, <br>
hiding quite well under his rock blanket!<br>
<br>
I will say, though, after seeing all the cool stamps out there, my husband <br>
is pretty well hooked now and wants to carve our own personal stamp (vs the <br>
stamp that I had purchased eons ago, LOL!).  He was not nearly as enthused <br>
about this as I am until this series and the ones we located in Peoria, IL.<br>
<br>
We plan to be back out there to finish up the series on Friday afternoon <br>
(sans children! They will be in a History re-enactment in McHenry, IL with <br>
friends of ours - another place to LB on Saturday afternoon when we go to <br>
get them!).<br>

In deference to his patience, you may want to consider how far the hikes are. From <br>
longest to shortest, they go from Moon, Magician, Sun and Star.  Sun and Star are <br>
really pretty quick, but they're in two different parks (about a mile or mile and a half <br>
apart).<br>
<br>
Enjoy your day!<br>

mine.  I could hunt for letterboxes all day. I was lucky to get the 7 or 8 <br>
out of him (and the children) yesterday, LOL!<br>
