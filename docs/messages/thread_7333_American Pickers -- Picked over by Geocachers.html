<br>
**UPDATE 2/26/12 A GEOCACHE has moved into the SAME trunk of the SAME car as my letterbox. While it clearly states on all sides of my box that "THIS IS NOT A GEOCACHE and NOTHING FOR TRADE" cachers nonetheless have been placing crap in my box and writing in my logbook!! I stopped by today with a note to leave at the top of the box, I removed the crap and threw it away!!!!! The cache is obvious, but apparently not to cachers (go figure) SO, I moved my box to the back of the trunk and theirs to the front so they see it FIRST and grab it instead of my box!!! <br>
<br>
It is very important you write on the back of your stamp itself, "NOT FOR TRADE" -- even then, I'm not sure if those cachers who left the crap in my box took off with one or more of the beautiful hand-carved stamps that were already in there. This ticks me off more than I can say, cachers expect US to look on THEIR web site BEFORE placing boxes to make sure that we don't plant our boxes within 30 feet of their crap. Then they hide a cache in the same trunk of a car as MY box and then they violate my box with their crap!!<br>
<br>
If you find this box and there is something other than a stamp in there, please, just take it and toss it -- if they're not bright enough to grab the see through box with the garbage in it then "oh well."***<br>
<br>
And I'll step off my soap box now.<br>
