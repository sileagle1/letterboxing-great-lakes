gathering!<br>
<br>
Boxes are being hidden, clues are being written and things are<br>
starting to fall into place. *insert evil hand rubbing here*  And for<br>
those of you that aren't up for a several hour, strenuous hike (I know<br>
I won't be until my ankle gets a little better), there will be boxes<br>
that aren't so hard to get to.  <br>
<br>
Just a couple of things:<br>
<br>
*Potluck: Lunch will be potluck.  If you know what you would like to<br>
bring, please let me know.  I'm also going to ask that you try and<br>
bring a reusable plate & utensils in an effort to cut down on the<br>
amount of trash. Hey, every little bit helps!  Also, beverages are<br>
bring your own. Please note, alcoholic beverages are not permitted in<br>
Minnesota State Parks.  <br>
<br>
*We have the Visitors Center until 5:30.  The park is open until 10,<br>
so feel free to stick around and find boxes after 5:30.  <br>
<br>
*If you hid boxes and would like them included in the clue packet,<br>
please email the clues to me by the 24th.  <br>
<br>
If you have any questions, feel free to email me: <br>
the_red_cat529@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing everyone on the 31st!<br>
