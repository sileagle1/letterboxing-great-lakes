Sorry to hear about Cars on a stick.  Kate and I had quite a <br/>
memorable experience finding it almost a year ago, and the stamp was <br/>
really cool, too.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh...<br/>

Have you kept impressions of the various versions of that stamp?<br/>
A la the infamous K-Martha, I wonder which version of "Cars-on-a-<br/>
Stick" *I* have <g>.<br/>
FYI SpringChick: I only C-O-A-S via the postal. It was carried away <br/>
by a previous boxer who couldn't replace it due to local crowds. I <br/>
searched and searched the right spot but came up empty. When I read <br/>
her report of "..boxing in the Chicago area.." right before my hunt <br/>
for that box, I began to wonder if maybe I had *just* missed it.<br/>
Turns out, Yup....following the failed attempt to return it to the <br/>
hiding place, it had gone south a ways. Thanks to Yooperann's help <br/>
and intervention, I was a stop along the way for the box's return to <br/>
Chicago.<br/>
Lots of history with that one.<br/>

The worse thing about a new job (especially when you have been a long time<br/>
