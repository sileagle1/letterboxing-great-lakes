Sorry to hear about Cars on a stick.  Kate and I had quite a <br>
memorable experience finding it almost a year ago, and the stamp was <br>
really cool, too.<br>
<br>
Sigh...<br>

Glad to hear you will be replacing it though...  I have another trip <br>

Have you kept impressions of the various versions of that stamp?<br>
A la the infamous K-Martha, I wonder which version of "Cars-on-a-<br>
Stick" *I* have <g>.<br>
FYI SpringChick: I only C-O-A-S via the postal. It was carried away <br>
by a previous boxer who couldn't replace it due to local crowds. I <br>
searched and searched the right spot but came up empty. When I read <br>
her report of "..boxing in the Chicago area.." right before my hunt <br>
for that box, I began to wonder if maybe I had *just* missed it.<br>
Turns out, Yup....following the failed attempt to return it to the <br>
hiding place, it had gone south a ways. Thanks to Yooperann's help <br>
and intervention, I was a stop along the way for the box's return to <br>
Chicago.<br>
Lots of history with that one.<br>

A lot depends on our job situations -- I am just a few days into a new job<br>

opportunities, so a job switch could be in the near future for him also.<br>
The worse thing about a new job (especially when you have been a long time<br>

been a teacher...<br>
