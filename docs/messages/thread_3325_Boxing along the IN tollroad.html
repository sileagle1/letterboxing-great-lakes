                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last week, we went on a little road trip from Chicago to Pokagon <br>
State Park in Indiana.  Along the way, we picked up a few boxes.  <br>
That mapping feature on AQ was nice for plotting out some boxes.  <br>
<br>
Our first stop was a pretty little park to pick up "Century of <br>
Progress", by the Fairy Stamper.  We didn't recognize the many <br>
Hoosier stamps, but it was nice to see a few stamps we recognized <br>
from our neck of the woods.  The stamp in the box was quite nice.  <br>
Then it was on to Maple Woods Nature Center for 2 wonderful little <br>
boxes by Tiptoe & Tonto (I liked the stamps and really liked how <br>
they did the covers of the log books).  The entire forest was <br>
blanketed with fallen leaves, so it was a challenge to find and stay <br>
on the trail for the "Fallen Leaf" box--but we managed it.  Then it <br>
was on to the Sap Bucket Box.  We were surprised to see the word <br>
Letterbox freshly carved into a tree, with a pointing arrow.  <br>
Fortunately, it was pointing in the wrong direction for the box <br>
(which was in fine shape).  We poked around in the direction of the <br>
arrow, thinking perhaps there was a Bonus box--which there wasn't.  <br>
Tiptoe & Tonto were surprised to hear of the carving, so not sure <br>
who did this.  Ball Magnet wanted to try and remove the carved word, <br>
but we figured that would do too much damage to the tree, esp since <br>
the only tools we had were rocks and sticks.<br>
<br>
We stayed at Pokagon State Park--gorgeous park.  I vaguely remember <br>
someone on the list proposing this park as a possible gathering <br>
site.  I would definitely vote "thumbs up" to that.  The inn at the <br>
park is wonderful and is right on the beach of Lake James.  We <br>
didn't get out on a lot of the trails, but the ones we were on were <br>
nice.  When we were at the Nature Center, they had a display about <br>
Geocaching, so they obviously allow these types of activity.  We <br>
looked for the "Family Reunion" letterbox without success, but I did <br>
add 2 new birds to my life list so that was good!!<br>
<br>
They have a 1/4-mile toboggan run that operates all winter, so the <br>
kids definitely want to make a return trip.  <br>
<br>
Not a lot of boxes found, but a nice little trip.<br>

The mention of the toboggan run made me remember the cool luge run in <br>
Muskegon State Park in Michigan.  Unfortunately we were there in the <br>
summer, but it looked like it would be tons of fun.  Has anyone on this <br>
list tried it?<br>

P.S.  We're disappointed we can't make it to the Boar's Head <br>
performances (we have parties planned at our house both days that <br>
weekend), but hope to get down to look for the boxes later in December.<br>

The 2 new birds were both out on the lake--fortunately the ranger <br>
had a spotting scope so we could see them better.  First we saw a <br>
few buffleheads mixed in with a whole raft of coots.  And then we <br>
saw 2 common loons--I was really hoping to see one that day and I <br>
did!!<br>
