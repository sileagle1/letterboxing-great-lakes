Anyway, we headed out early this morning for two boxes.<br/>
<br/>
1.  (Cook County)  2005 GL Exchange: Barn Theater -- placed by FungusWoman<br/>
on May 12th -- originated with Pale Posse Puppy and Naughty Dog.<br/>
<br/>
May 12!  That's a whole 10 days ago!  And we were the first finders!  I<br/>
couldn't believe nobody had been to the box before us who might live closer.<br/>
We took our bikes but when we came to the dirt trail, it just didn't look<br/>
promising for our hybrid bikes.  It's not that I CAN'T change a flat tire on<br/>
the trail, I just don't WANT to. Been there done that &amp; it wasn't all that<br/>
much fun.  So it might have been just fine but we didn't take any chances.<br/>
We walked it.  Nice, pleasant walk.  One chow wanted to get up-close and<br/>
personal with us but he was on a tie-out in his backyard, so he wasn't able<br/>
to come over and say hello.  He seemed so friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Box was in fine condition.  Nice hiding place.  Nice stamp.  We didn't put<br/>
the clue together with the stamp until we found the stamp.  Duh...<br/>
<br/>
2.  (Will County)  Lockport I&amp;M Canal -- placed by Matt the Rat back in Jan,<br/>
2003.<br/>
<br/>
Great hiding spot!  How did he ever find that particular hole???  We love<br/>
the history of Lockport and the various towns along the canal.  "Abraham<br/>
Lincoln's Dog House" threw us a bit.  But we knew where we were going,<br/>
because I knew the "dark cave-like opening" he was referring to.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the box was in fine condition.  And waiting for a whole lot more<br/>
people to come and enjoy the history of Lockport.<br/>
<br/>
Stopped and lunched with a whole mess of senior citizens in town.  Nobody we<br/>
knew -- they just included us in the pack as long as we were in the right<br/>
place at the right time -- very enjoyable lunch -- Lockport tends to have<br/>
some pleasant, friendly folks.<br/>
A few of them were originally from Braidwood.  Filled us in on Braidwood's<br/>
rather "colorful" past.  Braidwood definitely sounds like it needs a<br/>
letterbox somewhere.<br/>
