Thee weather was beautiful, thee boxes were plentiful, thar be many boxers to meet and greet, lots of good grub and lots of booty to plunder. Hearty thanks to th' wenches Housepitality Hostess and Hppy2Bmom, carvers, and everyone else who helped to make this such an enjoyable event.<br>
(Wish I'd had more time to visit with other boxers and exchange ~ oh well, until next time .... happy boxing)  Socks3<br>
