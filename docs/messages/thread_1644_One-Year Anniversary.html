  Wow!  That's quite a year.  Congratulations!<br>
<br>
  There are times when I think that if our kids weren't quite so young <br>
  our stats would be higher, but we're having a blast finding a box or <br>
  two each weekend and enjoying the hobby.  This month marks our one <br>
  year anniversary as well.<br>

both letterboxing and geochaching. The latter was not my cup of <br>

finding the link! Thanks, Yahoo! :-)<br>
