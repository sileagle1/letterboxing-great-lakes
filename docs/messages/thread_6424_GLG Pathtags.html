<br>
I've posted a couple pictures of the Tags for the group so you can see. They will be $3.00 a peice and available at the gathering.<br>
<br>
The pictures didn't turn out as well as I would've liked them too because of the glare. They say "8th Annual Great Lakes Gathering June 5, 2010" and the LBNA logo is in the lower right corner.<br>
