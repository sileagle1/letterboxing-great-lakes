the Great Lakes region.  Tonight we met a few local boxers in South <br>
Carolina.  One was from Georgia and she mentioned meeting a couple from <br>
IL this past summer while vacationing in the Seattle area.  We guessed <br>
right on our first try - Cherokee Rose 2 and Hawkeye!  Ghopper said <br>
that they enjoyed drinking wine and hiking with the IL duo.  We also <br>
saw a fantastic stamp that The Red Cat had sent to Holly of the Talley <br>
Valley Farm crew.<br>
<br>
Enjoying the weather down here - it was low 70s today.  Wishing we <br>
could avoid that WI winter that is on its way.... but unfortunately <br>
we'll be heading back home next weekend.<br>
