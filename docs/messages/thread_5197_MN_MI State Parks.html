state parks have put on regulating letterboxing, wishing we could have<br/>
the job of seeking them out, envious of the stance the CT parks have<br/>
taken embracing letterboxing, I thought I would share a positive<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you in Michigan's U.P. and Wisconsin, schedule a trip to<br/>
Porcupine Mountains State Park in the Western U.P.  The park staff<br/>
there have planted 8 letterboxes and welcome people to come hunt for<br/>
these boxes, as well as others that have been planted by letterboxers.<br/>
 If you wish to plant a box, the only requirements are that it is not<br/>
in a place that would endanger humans or the environment, and you keep<br/>
your box maintained...  no permit needed.<br/>
<br/>
Just goes to show that not all park managers act first and think<br/>
later.  Some actually wish to encourage the public to use the parks<br/>
and trails for their enjoyment and see the benefit that letterboxing<br/>
and letterboxers can bring to their parks.<br/>
<br/>
All hope is not lost...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
p.s.  If you are planning a trip to the Porkies, try to come on Labor<br/>
Day weekend when they are having their annual Hunter's Harvest<br/>
Festival.  Perhaps we'll see you there!<br/>

&gt; &gt; No kidding huh!?!?!?...Just work for the parks and you can spend a <br/>
&gt; bunch of time finding boxes...forget about garlic mustard, purple <br/>
&gt; loostrife, and buckthorn...or the trash that litters some <br/>
&gt; parks...just go get the boxes.<br/>

&gt; wouldnt have happened.<br/>
