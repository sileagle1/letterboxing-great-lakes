I just like the journy along the way. I like puzzle boxes the most, <br/>
because it showes the most creativity. Someone took time to make it <br/>
fun, not just turn here 50 paces. That is also what I like about <br/>
placing a box, the challenge to come up with a new and interesting <br/>
concept to the game. Placing a box, for me, is not enough. I like to <br/>
make it interactive. Also finding a neat and interesting place to put <br/>
it, somewhere you (as a finder) might not have ever thought to go. We <br/>
have gone to some beautiful places that I will remember the rest of my <br/>
life, all thanks to some special boxers. If the game ever turns into <br/>
how many boxes can you get or how many boxes can you place, I don't <br/>
think I would like to play any more. It would become meaningless and <br/>
unchallenging.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here here.  As for our count, I have no idea any more<br/>
- we lost track somewhere after 100.  One day we'll<br/>
count up all our images again, but again, the count<br/>
doesn't really matter to us.  We like visiting the<br/>
places, being outdoors, the thrill of finding the box<br/>
especially after we've been scratching our heads going<br/>
"It must be here someplace!!" for ten minutes, reading<br/>
through the logs to read comments and say, "Oh,<br/>
so-and-so was at this box once!"  And I've said before<br/>
that one of the reasons we love letterboxing so much<br/>
is because of all the places we've been that we never<br/>
would have thought to visit had we not been seeking<br/>
out that box.  Of course, though, we (I) also have<br/>
that "got to catch them all!" fever and so if it's<br/>
planted, I want to find it, no matter if it's a quick<br/>
drive-by or a 5 mile hike.<br/>
<br/>
And like DD, we want our boxes to be a little<br/>
interactive, too.  Not that drive-bys and<br/>
straight-forward clues are bad - sometimes those boxes<br/>
are just what you need after a run of no-finds to<br/>
renew your belief that you CAN still hunt these things<br/>
out.  But one of the reasons we have so few plants<br/>
right now is because I've got some great ideas for new<br/>
boxes, just haven't had a chance to implement them<br/>
just yet.  My goal is to one day have a box that's so<br/>
"wow" it makes the spotlight on Mark &amp; Sue Pepe's<br/>
website ;)<br/>
