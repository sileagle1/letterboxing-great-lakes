                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh my gosh, FungusWoman!!!!  You have no idea how much I appreciate<br>
everything you stuck in that S.I.L.O. return box!!!  I got it<br>
yesterday but didn't realize it as my husband "put it in a safe<br>
place"?!  Late last night I spent well over an hour going through<br>
everything!  My grandmother who passed away a little while back, used<br>
to send me care packages when I was little, since she lived in MI and<br>
I moved to OH.  Even as an adult, and then when she did it for my 3<br>
sons, it was a joy to open these mini treasure boxes!  There were so<br>
many unexpected treasures tucked away in this box, it was just a joy!<br>
<br>
To everyone who attended the S.I.L.O. event, thank you so much, first<br>
and foremost for ALL of the postcards!!!  I am completely taken back<br>
and am so grateful for the great and supportive things so many of you<br>
thought to write.  FungusWoman~that you even took them to your church<br>
as well, is extremely thoughtful beyond what you had already done. <br>
Wow.  YOU have made this a success.  I read each and every single<br>
postcard and I KNOW this will be appreciated by the guys in Greg's<br>
platoon!  I also want everyone to know that I have bought a box of<br>
Girl Scout cookies for each of these soldiers and will be putting<br>
postcards with each box so this is a mini care package for these guys<br>
as well.  Several other letterboxers have also been sending postcards<br>
and even money for postage and cookies as well.  ALL of these things<br>
are so very much appreciated!!!  It helps keep these guys strong.  <br>
<br>
FungusWoman, the icing on the cake was that you sent me a set of the<br>
S.I.L.O event stamps!!!  Each of them is wonderful!!!  I treasure that<br>
fact that you took time to stamp and send them to me!!  It is a<br>
priviledge to have these in my collection! Everyone who contributed a<br>
stamp did an impressive job!!!    You are all very talented carvers!!<br>
 When is the next training session?!  :)  Sign me up!  I am a rooster,<br>
and so I made sure to find that stamp!  Wow, Wisconsin Hiker!  The<br>
detail was amazing!  I loved them all.<br>
<br>
I also LOVED the "fortune cookie" that Brat Pack made for everyone! <br>
What a treat and how very creative!  Where did you find the time for<br>
all of those?  What a great keepsake.  I will be emailing you off post<br>
with a couple of questions. The Chinese good luck penny and little<br>
umbrella all made this event a shining star and hard act to follow!!<br>
<br>
It was also a joy to see all of your signature stamps!  There was a<br>
really great mixture of interesting stamps and I enjoyed paging<br>
through those.  Brat Pack---your entire page of stamps just made me<br>
smile!  :)  God Bless you all!<br>
<br>
A huge thank you to you all for taking time during the S.I.L.O. event<br>
to write those postcards.  I know with everything FungusWoman and<br>
Beetle had there for everyone, it had to have taken away time.  I want<br>
you to know that this does make a difference!! FW and Beetle, those<br>
S.I.L.O. and red Good Fortune lantern event stamps were perfect!!! <br>
Just perfect!<br>
<br>
If anyone included a postcard but did not get the stamped image for<br>
some reason, please let me know.  For anyone else who was not at the<br>
event, who has sent postcards and money, I will be busy sending you<br>
the stamped image this week and weekend!!<br>
<br>
A very grateful....<br>
