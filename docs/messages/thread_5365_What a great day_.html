event yesterday.  Everything was perfectly organized and <br/>
planned.   All the stamps were fantastic.  Loved how they were hidden <br/>
in groups.  The ticket idea was pretty fun! and worked great.  I was <br/>
afraid I wouldn't be able to get enough clues, but  as it turned out <br/>
I had more than enough.   I missed the cake walk, but saw most of the <br/>
stamps later and they were all great, too.  The weather and food were <br/>
amazing, too.  It was wonderful to meet up with some old friends and new!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the amazing day!  Can't wait until next year!<br/>

Thanks to SpringChick and OldShoe for an awesome day and thanks to everyone for such a warm welcome! What a pleasure to meet the people behind the trailnames.
