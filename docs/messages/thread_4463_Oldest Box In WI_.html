                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmm... that's very interesting!  Maybe Dragon can comment.  He adopted both boxes and lists them on his own website.  He has a title indicating that Cave Point is the oldest.  I can confirm that the logbook at Cave Point lists the date 26-SEP-1998, but didn't take any special note of a date in the logbook when we found Mink River 3 years ago.  It might be good to add the date placed (if known) with the clues.<br/>
How do you remember it was placed on 17-APR-1998?  Do you include that info in your notes when you find a box or did you take a photo of the Mink River logbook?<br/>
