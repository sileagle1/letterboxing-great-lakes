heehee), LOL!  I was looking to see if there is anything near where we will <br>
be in the Southern Kettle Moraine and noticed Sussex suddenly on the <br>
list!!!!  However, I have another area in mind - I just have to check for <br>
that lovely 3 leafed plant before I even consider a plant there!  You gave <br>
us something to do tomorrow when my husband has to work (you have to love <br>
overtime at this time of year!).<br>
<br>
Good Luck and Way to go Eric (way to coach him Dragon!!!)!<br>
