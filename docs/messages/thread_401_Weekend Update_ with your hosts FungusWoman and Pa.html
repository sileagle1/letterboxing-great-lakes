                    <div class="plaintext-content">A great letterboxing weekend for us!  We headed out to GS camp early Friday,<br/>
which enabled us to stop by at Silver Springs SP to find Grayfamily's box<br/>
there.  A bit of a last-minute panic, when I thought I left the clues at<br/>
home, but then I realized in my attempt to be organized, I'd stapled them to<br/>
the message Paul sent me with directions to the park.  Phew!  We weren't<br/>
quite sure about the V-shaped tree..."there it is!"..."or is that it?"...but<br/>
we found the box.  There's a bit of a social trail forming, which was a<br/>
tip-off.<br/>
