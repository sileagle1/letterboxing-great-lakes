I also placed my first box at our GS camp.  Now I have to explain to<br>

Does it still count as a Place if it is a private box not available to the<br>
general Lbing public?<br>

Matt, sorry to hear the Portage is gone.  I hope you can replace it soon,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmmm....  I think your GS box counts as a placement because it's  a <br>
letterbox and you placed it.  If democratic availability dictated a <br>
placement count, then would a hitchiker count as a placement, since <br>
it's truly only available to those who are at the right place at the <br>
right time?  What about event stamps that are only out for a limited <br>
time, and therefore not available to everyone?<br>
<br>
Ugh... the whole count conundrum is a just a big ol' wig's worth of <br>
split hairs, if you ask me.  Simple rules are good rules.  So for my <br>
two cents worth, you place it, you count it!  It's up to you.<br>
