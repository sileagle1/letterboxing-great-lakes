Fish Out of Water 2 has been placed in LaSalle County.  My friend Pippin<br/>

I also placed my first box at our GS camp.  Now I have to explain to<br/>

Does it still count as a Place if it is a private box not available to the<br/>
general Lbing public?<br/>

Matt, sorry to hear the Portage is gone.  I hope you can replace it soon,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmmm....  I think your GS box counts as a placement because it's  a <br/>
letterbox and you placed it.  If democratic availability dictated a <br/>
placement count, then would a hitchiker count as a placement, since <br/>
it's truly only available to those who are at the right place at the <br/>
right time?  What about event stamps that are only out for a limited <br/>
time, and therefore not available to everyone?<br/>
<br/>
Ugh... the whole count conundrum is a just a big ol' wig's worth of <br/>
split hairs, if you ask me.  Simple rules are good rules.  So for my <br/>
two cents worth, you place it, you count it!  It's up to you.<br/>
