Thanks for the update, Armadillo Jo &amp; Kimono Girl!  I did find the Explorer Park box <br/>
stampless 2 Sundays ago.  I will go back and get the stamp.  My stamp is already there.  <br/>
<br/>
Drats!  I'm not going to be the first finder for Heartland.  I've been there 2 times and each <br/>
time I pace I come out differently.  Good to know I have to look higher.<br/>
<br/>
You will enjoy the Connersville area boxes!  I have to go back since more have been <br/>
placed.<br/>

Katy and I had hoped to visit the HH Hostel even though we didn't have any hitchhikers with us but we decided that we were running short on time.  <br/>
<br/>
The stamp in the "Explorer Park" box was kind of confusing.  It's foam shapes glued to a plastic mesh...we almost didn't realize it was a stamp at first (especially since there was a bunch of geocaching stuff in the box too).<br/>
