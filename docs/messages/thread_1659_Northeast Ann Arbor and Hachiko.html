we've exhausted the local (Lansing) letterbox population, we went to <br>
Ann Arbor to get a couple of boxes, "Northeast Ann Arbor" <br>
and "Hachiko."  The former involved a fun hike, but I would heartily <br>
recommend that future finders remember to bring insect repellant -- <br>
don't make the same mistake we did and get eaten alive!<br>
<br>
The latter has an amazing stamp, but unfortunately the logbook was <br>
missing.  I wonder what happened?<br>
