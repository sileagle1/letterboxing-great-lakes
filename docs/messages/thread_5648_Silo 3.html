Sorry you won't be able to join us.  We hope to post lots of exciting photos on AQ for all to see.  Last night, Lock and Barrel joined me, and my family, for dinner at the Silo.  After dinner, we checked out the facilities and planned the room set up for the event and especially for the carving workshop.  Lock was telling me some of the techniques he plans to cover in his power point presentation, and I'm pumped!  <br>
