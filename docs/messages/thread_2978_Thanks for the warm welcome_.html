I see lots of familiar names and have met several of the folks on this <br/>
list.  I'm hoping some of you can join me for the BASH.  It's going to <br/>
be a great time!  Thank you to everyone that has searched for my boxes <br/>
and for all the nice comments.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I don't have my ScoutdogsBoxes website any more, I posted a few <br/>
photos of my favorite stamps on my picture trail website:<br/>
www.PictureTrail.com/Scoutdogs<br/>
<br/>
For those I haven't kept in touch with, and by way of introduction to <br/>
folks who don't know me, here are some websites related to what I have <br/>
been doing lately:<br/>
<br/>
My dogs (&amp; cat): www.Dog-Gonehappy.itgo.com (They tend to be a full <br/>
time job with their training and extra curricular activities :-)  The <br/>
Soccer mom's of the world got nuthin' on me!<br/>
<br/>
My Dog Scout Troop: www.DogScoutTroop107.com (I've been slated to be <br/>
the next National Director of the Dog Scouts of America organization! <br/>
and with all my activities, my next available weekend day is...in <br/>
November!)<br/>
<br/>
My book/business: www.SafeHomeVisits.com (the second edition of my <br/>
book should be available very soon- within the month, hopefully!)<br/>
<br/>
My County Animal Response Team- www.TriStateCART.com (we respond to <br/>
save the animals in the event of an emergency or disaster in our area)<br/>
<br/>
All this in addition to over 100 emails per day, keeping the house in <br/>
a relatively livable condition &amp; the 2 acres of grass from over taking <br/>
the house, helping my husband who is disabled and STILL hasn't gotten <br/>
his knees fixed!!- yes, it's been over 2 years) and creating stamps <br/>
and art for various swaps and projects.  Or as some would say- I'm <br/>
sitting around eating bon bons with my feet up :-) (said sacasticly)<br/>
