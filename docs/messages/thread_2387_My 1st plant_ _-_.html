I just planted my 1st letterbox!  It was just SUCH a beautiful day, and <br/>
there were no NEW letterboxes nearby, so I planted one!<br/>

I think I'm almost as excited as when I found my 1st box! ;^)<br/>

Clues are at letterboxing.org.  Also, I don't think I'll post this to <br/>
the big list.  Someone would probably take offense!  (Hee, hee ;^)<br/>
