I'm in cemeteries a lot doing geneological searches for folks, and I have a<br/>
lot of people who have relatives buried in the Chicago area but they have no<br/>
local family anymore to visit the cemetery regularly asking me to check the<br/>
cemetery and make sure their relative is still safe and sound in their own<br/>
grave.<br/>

Cemetery Stroll #3: Forest Park Flapper went missing over a year ago, but I<br/>
decided to recarve it and bring it out of retirement.  I replanted it today<br/>
and updated the clues (basically just the end part).  Cemetery Stroll #2:<br/>
Rocks and Treestones had very recently gone missing and I replaced that as<br/>
well.<br/>
