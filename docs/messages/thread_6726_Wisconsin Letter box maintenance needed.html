                    <div class="plaintext-content">While on vacation in Wisconsin a few weeks ago we hunted down a letter box that is listed on the letterboxing.org site and titled lakeshore lights.  It is located in Manitowoc along the walkway to the lighthouse.  When we found the box it was totally cracked, beyond repair, and someone had tied a white grocery bag aroung it.  I think to help keep it dry?  The ziploc bags had holes and the contents were totally soaked, the log book beyond repair.  I tossed the book, dried off the stamp, made a quick logbook with paper from my log book and bagged the stamp and logbook seperately and then put those in an additional ziplock.  As I didn't have a lock box container on me, I had no choice but to place the ziploc back in the cracked container and then in the grocery bag.  I was hoping that a letterboxer in the area might be able to provide a little TLC and give the letter box a new container.  I sent an email to the placers via letterboxing.org but have no idea if they actually received it or if they did, if they are able to do anything.  I thought I'd cover all the bases by placing a message here.  Hope that's ok.<br/>
