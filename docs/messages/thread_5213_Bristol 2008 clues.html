now in the "Files" section.  Sorry it is there later than I intended.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that the Spellbook of Incantrix and the Tournament<br/>
Chessmen part of the "Dragon" series will not be in place until<br/>
shortly after I get there as I have to give them to people who were<br/>
not around on Monday when I hid the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I am still planning on being there on Saturday, but I may be a little<br/>
late as it is now 1 am and  I am not feeling 100%, so go ahead and<br/>
start seeking the boxes without me.<br/>
<br/>
Remember to be very sneaky in retriving the boxes, and to put them<br/>
back so they fit the clues for the next person.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
