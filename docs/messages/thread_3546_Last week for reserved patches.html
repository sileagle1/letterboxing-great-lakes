<br>
This is the last reminder for those of you  that initially said they <br>
wanted some of the Great Lakes patches(list is below). If I don't <br>
receive your money and envelope by January 15th, I'll assume you <br>
changed your mind and will then make the patches available to someone <br>
else. If your name isn't on the list, please contact me before <br>
sending any money to be sure I have enough patches to satisfy your <br>
request.<br>
<br>
Here's a link to see the final patch and get ordering info:<br>
http://letterboxing.homestead.com/greatlakespatch.html<br>
<br>
(Please don't forget the self-addressed envelope)<br>
<br>
Here is the list of peple that patches are being held for:<br>
<br>
Trail Name - # of patches<br>
<br>
ArtGekko - 5<br>
Bonjan - 2<br>
bunnyslippers - 4<br>
Duca Family - 2<br>
Gooble Gobble - 2<br>
Jigsaw - 2<br>
MC Bear - 2<br>
one-eyed jack - 4<br>
P.Granola - 3<br>
Rock Hoppin' Mama - 5<br>
SingularGirl - 1<br>
SpringChick - 5<br>
Team Mad Dawg - 1<br>
The Cat Herders - 2<br>
Yooperann - 1<br>
<br>
I know some of you told me you sent your stuff in recently, but if <br>
your name is on the list, that means I haven't received it yet.<br>
<br>
If I fill all the current requests, there will only be 14 patches <br>
remaining for new orders.  So if you want a patch, don't wait too <br>
long!<br>

I don't see my name on this list. It was on the one from last week. I <br>
sent my check and SASE today. Could you please check on this for me? <br>
You had me listed with the trail name "Lori" and I wanted 2 patches.<br>

Sorry, we are fairly new to this hobby and this message board. This is the  <br>
first We've heard of this patch and we would like up to 5 patches if you have  <br>
the stock for them. Any number up to 5 would be fine to, but five would get <br>
one  for each of our kids.<br>

I am sending the money for my 4 patches out on Monday. I know that it is<br>
late - we had a bad power supply on our computer and it turned off every<br>
time I tried to get your address. I have it now and the envelope is<br>
waiting to go. I'm so sorry! Thank you for all the time and effort you<br>
