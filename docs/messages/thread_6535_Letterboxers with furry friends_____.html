                    <div class="plaintext-content">OOOOK so I know we have been talking about the tick problem that has been plaguing our letterboxing adventures lately but I just wanted to share a quick story OLJ and myself encountered yesterday...<br>
<br>
So we are back in Milwaukee this weekend from the Twin Cities and one of the boxes we wanted to pick up was the Rocky Arbor box in the dells, I had picked it up over Thanksgiving but OLJ had not had a chance to get it yet...so since its a pretty quick find we set out to get it.<br>
<br>
By the time we were done getting the box, a total time of maybe 20 minutes our dog Finnigan who was along for the journey we noticed had  acquired a few new friends....31 to be exact! <br>
<br>
We spent the next 20 minutes pulling ticks off our dog and ourselves. Thankfully Finn had just had his lyme disease booster and OLJ and myself didn't have any ticks buried yet! But it was NOT our idea of a good time so PLEASE be careful out there and if you do bring your furry friends like we often do make sure you prepare them for what's lurking out there!<br>
<br>
Off to get bug spray....<br>
<br>
Happy boxing!<br>

had the creepy-crawlies ever since!!! And for good reason too. LK and I<br>
continued to letterbox this weekend despite the awful amount of ticks in the<br>
dells, and found that the Milwaukee area was far better. No ticks on the<br>
pooch. But Saturday night, I woke up with a tick crawling on my neck! And<br>
then Monday night, I woke up with a tick crawling up my leg!!! I don't know<br>
where they were hiding, but I'm still constantly checking myself. Currently<br>
hypervigilent about any little tiny sensation on my skin. Ugh! **shudders**<br>
