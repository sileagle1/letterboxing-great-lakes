While I was in the area, I also checked on another box in the area.  I've also updated the clues for this park due to some slight changes in the trail system:<br/>

Most of you already found these boxes at the 10th Anniversary of WI Letterboxing event, but if you haven't I just wanted to let you know they are available with updated clues.<br/>
