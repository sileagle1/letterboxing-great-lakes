Six boxes to be placed along Scioto for game<br>

THE COLUMBUS DISPATCH<br>
<br>
Art and a digital version of hide-and-seek will merge in a project<br>
along the Scioto River in Dublin.<br>
<br>
"Riverboxes" will feature six artist-made containers in parks along<br>
the river.<br>
<br>
Those who want to find the sites will find clues and Global<br>
Positioning System coordinates on Web sites related to Dublin.<br>
"Riverboxes," organized by the Dublin Arts Council, will start Aug. 18.<br>
<br>
"Each box will contain an original artist-created ink stamp and a<br>
journal for letterbox enthusiasts to stamp.<br>
<br>
"And there will be information about the site; it might be history,<br>
some environmental information, perhaps an artist's response to the<br>
site," said David Guion, the council's executive director.<br>
<br>
"Each artist will choose an inconspicuous space. It's a point of<br>
discovery; we're not going to give it (the location) away.<br>
<br>
"We'll have clues to point people in the right direction, but it will<br>
be up to them; they'll be treasure hunters."<br>
<br>
Participants will be encouraged to take their own journals and ink<br>
stamps when they hunt for the boxes.<br>
<br>
They can mark their journals with ink stamps found at the location and<br>
stamp the journal they find with their ink stamp.<br>
<br>
The council is working on the project with the city of Dublin and the<br>
Dublin Historical Society. Mike Utt River Clean-Up and Scioto River<br>
Day will be Aug. 18 in Dublin.<br>
<br>
Clues to the six locations, Guion said, will be posted on the<br>
council's and the city's Web sites, and possibly on the historical<br>
society's site.<br>
<br>
The council also plans to open a blog about the project on its site.<br>
The containers will be kept at their sites indefinitely.<br>
<br>
"Riverboxes" is part of a larger arts-council project, "Ripple Effect"<br>
that has produced arts-related exhibits tied to the Scioto. The river<br>
has roughly 7 miles of shoreline in Dublin.<br>
<br>
Columbus artist Eric Marlow, selected to make one of the containers,<br>
said he likes the "Riverboxes" idea. "It's an opportunity for people<br>
to get out, explore their environment and experience it in a different<br>
way." He's considering ideas for his box.<br>
<br>
"The box will be working with stuff that comes down the river, stuff I<br>
can pick up along the riverbank. I do a lot of work with recyclables,<br>
so I'll probably work that into the river box."<br>
<br>
Others selected for the project are Ron Hirschi of Hadlock, Wash.;<br>
Margaret McAdams of Kingston, Ohio; Jean Magdich of Logan; Patty<br>
Mitchell of Athens; and Angelica Pozo of Cleveland.<br>
