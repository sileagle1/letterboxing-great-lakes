<br>
So two out of town wedding trips and one grad class later, I am ready to start working further on the event for this fall!!  Here is what is set so far.<br>
<br>
I have updated the webpage with everyone who has signed up on atlasquest so far.  The consuite page has a list of potluck items so far, if you are thinking ahead at all. <br>
<br>
The event box page has boxes that are carved so far.  If you want to send a box in for the event, that would be fantastic!  The fantasy theme is pretty broad!  If there is a set started that you want to contribute to, please feel free.  Some of the big series are so sprawling, there is plenty of material out there for carving!  If you have a box you want me to plant, please get it in the mail by September 1st to give me time to plant, write clues, and get the clue packets printed.  Drop me an email if you need my mailing address.  I would like to keep temporary boxes out for several weeks to give people time to get out several days, that worked out really well for Boxacon I and I would really like to run this the same way.   If you are going to plant your own boxes and want to be added into the clue packet, please get your clues to me early in September so I can get everything compiled!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I should note that if anyone wants to catch Dragon, SunnySideUp or Peabody, or the Leapin' Lizards, we'll all be across I-94 at Naga-waukee Park cheering on our respective CC teams at the Laser Relays (although I think Sara's sister has graduated) on the morning of Boxacon.  Thanks for having the event so close by our meet that day so we can scoot over when it is done!  Of course anyone at the event can scoot over for the CC meet and get some boxes at Naga-waukee as well!  Just look out for a mass of runners coming down the trail (especially the boy's varsity as my runner is looking to be in first place)!<br>
