<br>
Sue & I arrived home safe and sound, circus intact as well as our<br>
sanity! It was a 10 day, 2400 mile whirlwind trip through 6 states and<br>
Canada! But we loved every minute of it.<br>
<br>
All we can say is Thank you - Thank you to all of our new friends:<br>
<br>
Thanks to SpringChick and Azobox for encouraging this trip, your tips<br>
and suggestions [and warnings as to the fact that we had WAY to many<br>
boxes on our agenda!] Dartmoor 2007? Let me know!<br>
<br>
Thanks to Team Rabbit for a wonderful gathering. We enjoyed every<br>
minute of it and especially the warm welcome we received from everyone<br>
in attendance. Made us feel very much at home. Your nice comments<br>
about our website truly make it all worthwhile. I'm still amazed at<br>
the number of boxers that read our site from outside the New England<br>
area - I better watch my step! :-)<br>
<br>
Thanks to Tiptoe & Tonto and Doglvrs for boxing with us in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all who provided a very tasty buffet. And thanks to those<br>
devils who hid the most ingenious boxes right there under our faces!<br>
Glad we saw most of them and were able to stamp in! <br>
<br>
Looking forward to another trip to your fine state in a few years -<br>
but this time we won't have any smelly animals or crazy clowns sharing<br>
the ride with us!<br>
<br>
Mark & Sue <br>
