because we all know just how *desperate* the PNW is for more boxers.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is in the area of Rockford, IL on Sunday, the 13th, please <br/>
feel free to drop by Alpine Park (two blocks south of East State <br/>
Street/Business-20) to say goodbye, play a little frisbee, and exchange <br/>
stamps with Der Mad Stamper before he whisks me away to live in sin.  <br/>
As I mentioned in a previous post, he'll appreciate any interruptions <br/>
that stand between him and my mom's icy glares (kidding!  sort of).  <br/>
The part is from 12-5, a casual BYO picnic kind of thing.  There is <br/>
currently at least one box in the park, and I will also have an <br/>
unofficial event stamp with me, available for anyone who asks for it.<br/>
<br/>
It's been really great knowing all of you!  Still hope to see you on <br/>
the trails from time to time! <br/>
