<br/>
My husband held the dog's leash while I planted box #10 of<br/>
Dragon<http: the_lb_dragon="" www.geocities.com=""></http:>'s<br/>
Cambridge Parkway<br/>
Series<http: cambridge_parkway_letterbox_seri.htm="" cambridge_parkway_series="" the_lb_dragon="" www.geocities.com="">last<br/>
night!  This box takes us to the southern end of the Parkway, which<br/>
now<br/>
means that we have to start planting boxes heading back North again!<br/>
<br/>
Box #10 of the series is named "In Memoriam."  Directions:<br/>
<br/>
* * * *<br/>
To find "In Memoriam" --<br/>
<br/>
After finding "Walk On The Beach" box, continue south down the Parkway.<br/>
Eventually, on your left, across the street, you will see the SE WI Vietnam<br/>
Veterans Memorial:  11 granite posts for each year of the war, 5 granite<br/>
benches for each branch of the military, and three Wausau Red granite<br/>
columns together representing those killed in action (22 ft tall), those who<br/>
are missing in action or were prisoners of war (26 ft tall) and those who<br/>
returned home again (30 ft tall).<br/>
<br/>
The Cambridge Parkway ends where the path splits -- there is a signpost<br/>
there with two brown signs on it.  One tells you to go left, under a bridge;<br/>
and one tells you to go right, up a hill.  Trust not the sinister sign, and<br/>
proceed onward dexterously for 66 steps.  Stop, and take out your compass.<br/>
You'll know you're in the right spot when you can see the Vietnam Veterans<br/>
Memorial at 100 degrees, the post with two brown signs where the path splits<br/>
at 60 degrees, and, if you look behind you at 302 degrees, a dead tree with<br/>
holes in the front about 20 feet up the hill.  "In Memoriam" rests at the<br/>
base of this tree, under a twisted branch, hidden by bark and twigs.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of brush and thistles on this hill in the summer!  I<br/>
recommend sending the mightiest member of your letterboxing party up the<br/>
hill to obtain the box, and then stamping in on one of the grassy areas<br/>
nearby.  Use discretion when retrieving it, as this is a busy area; and<br/>
replace it well and firmly so it doesn't wash down the hill with the rain!<br/>
Remember to log your find online, and contact me if any maintenance is<br/>
needed, or just to let me know the status of this box.<br/>
<br/>
Please note -- there is a first finder Frog in the box!<br/>
<br/>
* * * *<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now let's get boxes going north again!  :-)<br/>

<br/>
However, my husband wins for "Stoutest Constitution," as he is frequently<br/>
with me (a) holding the dog's leash so the dog doesn't run away after a<br/>
deer/bunny/other dog  (b) standing by patiently as I try to figure out which<br/>
tree the clue is referring to  and (c) standing alone on a public<br/>
path/sidewalk (holding the dog) trying not to look conspicuous as I am well<br/>
hidden up a hillside tromping down thistles trying to reach a box.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe he's the mightiest after all.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the announcement and posting the clue to the Great Lakes Board!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Question:  Since you planted the box, does that make you "the mightiest<br/>
&gt; member of your letterboxing party"?<br/>
