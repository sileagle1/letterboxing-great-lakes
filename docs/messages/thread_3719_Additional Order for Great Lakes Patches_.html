Oops. I forgot to add, hopefully Van Man has contacted you about<br/>
getting 5 patches??!<br/>
<br/>
I had contacted him offline to let him know it was you who has these.<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As regular readers of this board know, our current stock of Great<br/>
&gt; Lakes regional patches is almost depleted. I'm thinking I should<br/>
&gt; order some more before the gathering in June. Most regular readers of<br/>
&gt; the board have already ordered patches. However it seems that there<br/>
&gt; are a lot of Ohio boxers that don't really participate much in this<br/>
&gt; message board, so I'm not sure if they would be interested in the<br/>
&gt; patch or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can any of you Ohioans that DO read this board tell me if there would<br/>
&gt; be any/much interest? I'd probably order a smaller quantity, so price<br/>
&gt; would be a bit higher (maybe $2 or $2.50 per patch instead of $1.50).<br/>
&gt; However this is still cheaper than most other letterboxing patches.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Looking for feedback...<br/>
