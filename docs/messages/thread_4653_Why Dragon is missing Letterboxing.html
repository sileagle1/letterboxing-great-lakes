<br/>
Since a number of you have asked why I haven't been around much, I <br/>
thought I'd let you know that it is nothing other than work.  I'm in <br/>
the process of teaching an overload including two AP classes and <br/>
creating an online statistics class.  I also just wrapped up having a <br/>
student teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I did get to dwell on some letterboxing stuff over vacation in <br/>
that I wrote a sample statistical study for my students involving <br/>
letterboxing.  I'm including the link to the study for any of you who <br/>
are statistically minded or just plain curious.  For most it would <br/>
probably be just plain over your head, but I think it is an interesting <br/>
study/read on our beloved hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy (or not)!<br/>

We missed you at the big gathering and you've been quite like a mouse for most of the time since then.  Hopefully work will smooth out soon and you can get back to letterboxing.<br/>
