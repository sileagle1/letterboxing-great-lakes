I just went out and got our stuff to make a float and the kids, and Gramma, are excited about making masks for the event!  We plan on wearing lots of beads as well, and have a few stamps to share.  (No cooties, I promise.)  The kids will be making cards to trade, we have 4 designed so far.   Lots of projects to do, and lots of fun!  Hope to see everyone there! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Immediately following Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, and all the family holidays at this time of the year, what we need to do it get out of the house, far far away from the cookies and treats, and hike it off...and maybe find some letterboxes.  But the snow keeps falling and the ice is dangerous, so we stay inside.  <br/>
<br/>
But for those who 'need' an outlet for some artistic, letterbox related, creative inspiration, SILO #3 is sure to get you back on track.  Lock and I hope that the SILO #3 party plans will get your creative juices flowing and inspire you to carve some new stamps for the event. The idea of floats fits the theme of the gathering, but we hope it will inspire you to "think outside the box" with new ways to create letterboxes.  And logbooks...let's see if we can create some fancy logbooks too.  Not mandatory, but always a creative challenge.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to post your new boxes on AQ where the event is listed.  I just posted 4 that I have completed.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear that some people are planning to wear masks and dress up, however it is optional.  Maybe you just want to wear something green, gold, and purple - Mardi Gras colors.  But it's sure to be a festive time, and at this time of the year....we need some festivity!  Will it ever stop snowing? <br/>
<br/>
Cooties?  There are always cooties lurking at a gathering.  But maybe not like the epidemic that broke out at SILO #1.  I bet if I continue to look again in my inner jacket lining I might still find another cootie or two from that event.  Itch! Itch! Itch!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to Lock's carving workshop.  Maybe some of his artistic talent and skills will rub off on us.  <br/>

Just so you know, we were very impressed by those cooties 2 years ago!  They showed a lot of work &amp; creativity, as did those cute gift bags with the origami and "fortune cookies" with stamps inside.  What was even more amazing is that you had just had Brat #6 two-three months before the event!  You obviously also have a lot of energy in addition to creativity.<br/>

What was so funny was that none of us realized that the sneaky little members of the BRAT PACK IL were busy at work hiding cooties here, there, and everywhere.  Such innocent, angelic faces, and all the time they were spreading a cootie epidemic around the loft of the Silo.  Matter of fact, I think I might still have one of those cooties in a fabric covered fortune cookie container.  Epidemics are difficult to cure.  You never know...there might be some residual cooties lurking on 2/15/2009.  <br/>

The Brats had fun making their masks last week.  We're hoping this week, we'll be starting on the float.  Everyone in the Brat Pack is having fun with the theme this year.  =)   Next project is also the LTCs for the gathering.  As always, it will be a GREAT time seeing other LBers, ones we know and new faces as well.   <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WFMary - Seems my level of enthusiasm is a topic of discussion. I could get MORE enthusiastic, but trust me, I'm trying to keep it to some level of normalcy; failing miserably, but trying all the same.  <br/>
<br/>
Brat Pack IL is certainly full of the magic of celebrating Mardi Gras. (Any reason to celebrate is a good reason.)  They have been in contact with me, but I can only imagine all the ideas that they are coming up with.  All that enthusiasm and creativity feeding off each other can only mean one thing....lots of surprises in store!  <br/>
<br/>
Fungus Woman has mailed her event boxes to me and hopes to be able to arrange an early flight home to attend SILO #3.  More great stamps!  But here's another enthusiastic soul....she also sent a CD of the HOTTEST Mardi Gras jazz music for us to play during the event...guaranteed to melt those winter letterboxing blues.  <br/>
<br/>
The list of letterbox party goers is growing, but we're also looking for more event stamps to be hidden on top of tables and other creative indoor places.  Post your boxes and clues on the event listing.  There can never be too many boxes at a gathering and with this theme, the sky's the limit for flamboyant images.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I'm looking forward to Lock's carving tutorial workshop; a perfect indoor winter activity for letterboxers who can't wait for spring searching.  He will spend about an hour or so talking and walking you through some carving tips and tricks that he has mastered.   <br/>
<br/>
The Parade of Floats will certainly be a Kodak moment!  We hope that some of these creative floats will become permanent indoor boxes.  I thought I was done, but no, I decided to add some 'sparkle' today.  <br/>
<br/>
Mardi Gras goers toss and trade beads, but letterboxers attending a Mardi Gras theme event can trade beads and LTCs too.  You can never bring enough LTC "favors" to this event.  <br/>
<br/>
I know the folks at the SILO are just waiting to see what "that group" is planning this year.  They are still talking about SILO #1 and #2.  I guess we left an impression!  The Krewe of Dartmore will be there soon....let the good times roll!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm home after a weekend at Girl Scout camp and some outdoor hiking, sledding, and letterboxing.  I think I have corrupted the minds of 5 HS age girls and possible some parents.  When we arrived at the property, two of the young ladies immediately commented..."I wonder if the letterbox is still here...." and they wanted to go hiking in sub zero temps. to find it.   It was still there too!  To see the smiles on their faces was precious.  Can you say addicted? <br/>
<br/>
Bourbon Street....you've got competition!  See ya'll soon down at SILO #3.  <br/>

I'll paste a portion of an article I once wrote about a fundraiser party to<br/>
benefit a pregnancy center....<br/>
<br/>
"Upon entering the gymnasium, party-goers walked through a tinsel curtain<br/>
and were greeted with metallic beads of purple, green and gold.  These<br/>
triune colors traditionally representing justice, faith and power, could be<br/>
seen throughout the crowds festive attire.  <br/>
A long line of hungry participants awaited the Creole dishes similar to<br/>
those served when Mardi Gras found its way into America via French<br/>
Catholics in the deep south.  Gumbo, jambalaya, barbeque chicken and much<br/>
more filled the plates of many."<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Could we all please hang our heads for a moment of silence to mourn the <br/>
&gt; fact that I have just been scheduled to work on the day of SILO.  I had to <br/>
&gt; remove my name from the list.  It took great effort to have my finger hit <br/>
&gt; that delete button.  Kind of weired that I was sooo looking forward to <br/>
&gt; spending time with a room full of people I don't really know, lol.<br/>

As usual, this was a great time to reconnect with many of our long-time letterboxing friends, as well as meet some new ones.  We sometimes start thinking that we've already met everyone in our area, but then discover that there continues to be more people joining the addiction!  We had 14 new exchanges today.<br/>
<br/>
Tasty food and interesting conversations made the afternoon fly by, but we finally left the restaurant around 5:30 pm.  We're looking forward to seeing many of you again in June!<br/>

P.S.  We hope many of the "game" stamps get planted out on some trails in nearby parks and forest preserves.<br/>

Not enough event stamps for you today?  LOL!  <br/>
<br/>
We checked all the tables at the event after closing time.  Later, I found it!  Size: 1 1/2 inches x 4 1/2 inches.  Tonight, I was struggling to post the image on AQ and LBIL, (with technical assistance from Fungus Woman), but we discovered the problem; administrator access needed to create and load photos into folder.   I'll talk to Mr. Beetle tomorrow.  For those who prefer the inky image, this stamp will be available in the future too.   <br/>
