Hopefully we'll have great weather anyway.<br>
<br>
We are still looking for someone to make the event stamp, so let me<br>
know if you are interested.<br>
<br>
If you want to contribute a box that does not fit the theme, that is<br>
also okay.  The park has its own Mt. Baldy sand dune and there are any<br>
number of nature themed boxes that would also fit the area.  Remember,<br>
the more boxes, the more the fun!<br>
<br>
I scouted out 22 hiding locations on the yellow trail and I also made<br>
note of a number of locations near the shelter.  There is still the<br>
whole black trail and the red trail along the water to scout out yet.<br>
 If you bring a "last minute" box to the gathering, you could use the<br>
clues to one of the spots I already staked out for your convenience.<br>
<br>
I hope to have info on where to mail the completed boxes in the near<br>
future.  In the meantime, just make them and hold on to them.<br>
<br>
As a side note, I was able to drive to the park from my campsite at<br>
Potowanami SP in about a half hour.  I think it would be less than 20<br>
minutes from the Chanticleer B&B.<br>
