idea.  I don't think the reporters are out to get us or ruin the game for<br>
us.  I think they are just clueless and don't want to spend a lot of time<br>
becoming knowledgeable.  They should but they don't.  By giving them a<br>
location with all the information handy for them they will more likely read<br>
it and the articles should be better.  They won't stop writing the articles<br>
so the only hope is to enable them to write better articles without any more<br>
work on their part. <br>

Subject: [LbGLK] Press Information<br>
<br>
I posted this earlier on AQ due to another article.<br>
<br>
Maybe we should be pro active. <br>
<br>
The press does research most information. Maybe AQ and Letterboxing.org<br>
should have a Media/Press information page. It would detail the important<br>
information. The reporters won't have to read the whole website, takes to<br>
long in their eyes, but they would have bullet point info such as not<br>
mentioning boxes by name, printing clues, rehiding well....<br>
<br>
Most articles lately see to be WOM of the families they are interviewing.<br>
and a drive by look at the web sites.<br>
