                    <div class="plaintext-content">Chili sounds like a great idea!  We like it HOT, but we also know it is<br>
easier to add heat to an individual bowl than to take it OUT of a bowl.<br>
Perhaps a bottle of some type of hot sauce or some red pepper flakes on the<br>
side would allow people to increase the heat to their individual<br>
preferences.<br>
<br>
Meat or veggie?  - either is good!<br>
