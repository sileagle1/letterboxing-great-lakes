held on October 18! The location has been finalized and we will be<br>
returning to Pigeon Creek County Park in West Olive, MI again this<br>
year. This location was a hit last year because of the wonderful<br>
enclosed lodge, the great trails and the convenient location. But<br>
don't think just because we are going back to the same place that this<br>
event is going to be the same 'ol thing!<br>
<br>
This year's event theme is "A County Fair" and promises to provide<br>
lots of old-fashioned family fun! In addition to purchasing clues with<br>
tickets, attendees will have the option of participating in a<br>
variation on the cakewalk game, a traditional carnival favorite. An<br>
assortment of carnival themed boxes will await on the trails with<br>
plenty of carnival snacks back at the lodge.<br>
<br>
The AQ event listing has been updated with lots of additional<br>
gathering information. We look forward to seeing you there!<br>
