                    <div class="plaintext-content">In following the recent thread about GL states, and a few private e-<br>
mails I have received, I wanted to comment on the scope of this <br>
group and the stamp image on the home page.<br>
<br>
This group is for LB'ers in the upper Midwest area of the US and for <br>
anyone else who may have an interest in LB'es and LB'ing in that <br>
region.  There are folks who have joined in although they live in <br>
other regions because they have boxes here, because they travel here <br>
or because they are just generally interested in what is happening <br>
in LB'ing in other areas of the county.  There are not meant to be <br>
any boundaries and everyone is welcome.<br>
<br>
I realize the stamp image on the home page depicts only 5 states, <br>
and does not include MN, which is indeed a GL state, as also it does <br>
not include NY, which could easily be considered a GL state also.  <br>
There certainly was no intent to exclude any particular state or <br>
states.  The stamp is from the Great Lakes Gathering last year and <br>
was not made especially for this group.  At the time the gathering <br>
was being organized, the original scope was to have a Michigan LB <br>
gathering.  Once word got around, several people from OH and IL <br>
expressed interest in being a part of the party.  Rather than <br>
calling it a MI gathering -- which I suppose technically could have <br>
been called the GL gathering all on its own, since MI is known as <br>
the GL state, the name was changed to encompass surrounding states --<br>
 and the Great Lakes gathering was born.  The stamp was carved based <br>
on the locations of people who were planning to attend the <br>
gathering.  Originally WI was not even included, not because it is <br>
not a GL state, rather because there were no LB'ers from WI at the <br>
time, or at least none expressing an interest in coming to the <br>
gathering.  At the 11th hour a gal from VA who was originally from <br>
WI decided to make the trip and come to the gathering and I carved a <br>
new stamp which included WI.<br>
<br>
The stamp image is meant to be symbolic of the GL area not <br>
necessarily as an accurate map of everyone included in this group <br>
and certainly not meant to exclude or limit the scope.  That being <br>
said, I think it is an appropriate image for the home page, however <br>
if there is strong feeling that it is exclusionary, I will remove it.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

  The logo is great and I'd REALLY hate to see it removed from the <br>
home page.  Clearly, it's one of the best stamps I've seen.  Perhaps <br>
adding MN and changing the name to "Western" Great Lakes in as much <br>
as the group has evolved into mostly LBers from that geographic <br>
region?  In any case, please don't remove it.<br>

I agree w/Merlin.  I was really impressed with the image and hope it stays. <br>
<br>
I also think it is nice to have a more Midwest focus for the discussion group.  Adding Minnesota would be a good idea since it fits the criteria of a Midwestern GL state.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all your efforts on the regional board!<br>
