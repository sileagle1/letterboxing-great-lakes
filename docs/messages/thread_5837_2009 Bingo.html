I must add, those socks are limited edition -- rumor has it that Mrs. Doglvrs may be taking a break next year and passing on the sock tradition to another very talented knitter within our midst -- we'll see, maybe she will change her mind.  Either way, I'm happy the hand-knit sock tradition will carry on and am sure those donated to the Bingo booty next year will be equally impressive!<br/>

Thanks for playing everyone and for all the great stuff donated to the bingo booty.  I will not be posting photos of the booty items as the spoils the surprise for the winners.  However, upon receiving their prize packages, the winners are free to post photos if they wish.<br/>

Spring Chick ROCKS!  Kudos on such a fantastic idea (that has become a fabulous tradition) for chasing away the winter doldrums.  Part of what makes Bingo so much fun are the crazy posts all along the course of the game.  This group has such creative juices flowing.  It is not only apparent through the great rhetoric on line, but in the great plants -- I was priviliged to see just such an example in two exquisite boxes by Doglvrs found at the Great Literary Quest this weekend!  <br/>
You people (Spring Chick, Doglvrs, The K Crew (hosts of the event)and so many more) ....you all blow my mind with your originality and creativity.  THANKS, THANKS AND THANKS!<br/>
