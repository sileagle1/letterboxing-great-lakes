As in past years, you will need to add your name to the 2011 Bingo database. You will find all the BINGO FAQ's, word list, and grid in the FILES section of the board. IN addition, there is a special ADDITIONAL game to celebrate Springchick as she is NOW PLAYING the game with you (so watch out...I hear she is one tough competitor!) After years of hosting the game, Springchick has passed the reigns on to me. So, get your voodoo dolls ready, pull out those crowns, and get your bingo mojo on. The game officially begins January 1st, 2011 and I need ALL submissions mailed to me by December 31, 2010. Also, make sure you READ the FAQ's carefully. There are some new rules this year in addition to that special game above. Let the BINGO begin.<br/>
