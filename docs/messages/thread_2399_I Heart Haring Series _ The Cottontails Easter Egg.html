                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, this is getting just a little bit ridiculous.  We can't seem to <br>
place a box ANYWHERE!!!<br>
<br>
We went out to Tyler Creek, and oh--the CARNAGE!!  Be still our <br>
hearts.  Yes, it's true, these boxes have been obliterated by a <br>
controlled burn.  For Box 1, even the stump is gone.  For Box 2, the <br>
log that was used as cover for our box is gone.  All that remains is <br>
the metal coil from the spiral bound logbook. :(<br>
<br>
We will carve and replace soon, when we think that the park is done <br>
working up there.  3 park trucks drove up while we were there today.<br>
<br>
Stick a Fork in Me is fine, although we are seriously thinking about <br>
pulling it temporarily because the area around it seems overgrown <br>
and has not been burned.  We might take precautionary measures.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On a hunch, we drove over to Wing Park to check on our Easter Eggs.  <br>
We know that the official Elgin Easter Egg hunt was happening in a <br>
different park, so they were safe from that.  However, with all the <br>
bad luck we've been having with our boxes being melted, we thought <br>
we'd go check up on them. . . <br>
<br>
It's a good thing that we did.  There was what looked like a day <br>
care group, or a neighborhood group with a million little kids <br>
holding easter baskets getting ready for. . . wait for it. . . AN <br>
EASTER EGG HUNT!!!  AAAHHHHH  AAAAAHHHH!!!!!<br>
<br>
We jumped into action and scurried around collecting all of our eggs <br>
before they could be trapped in the clutches of little children.  We <br>
only took eggs 1-7 since the others are hidden in a different area <br>
of the park, AWAY from this Easter Egg Hunt action.<br>
<br>
We will replace these eggs later today, or maybe Monday, for the <br>
duration of our Easter Egg Hunt.<br>
