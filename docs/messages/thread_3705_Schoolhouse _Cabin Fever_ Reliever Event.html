<br/>
Here in Ohio, Dr. Watson has secured a location for one more mini-meet<br/>
before the Columbus Cluz GLK event this June.  We are trying to get as<br/>
many exchanges and PT's out of the way before THE BIG event as<br/>
possible so that we have more time to spend with all of you who are<br/>
coming from out of state!  We cannot WAIT until y'all get here!  (I'm<br/>
from Detroit originally (Royal Oak actually)and so it's always good to<br/>
talk to my fellow Wolverines, Tigers and Red Wing fans!!)<br/>
<br/>
So I have misplaced the post that I saw where there are those of you<br/>
who have Event Stamps that you are willing to share.  SpringChick, I<br/>
thought you might have been one of the ones???<br/>
<br/>
I do solemnly swear...and personally promise... I would take good care<br/>
of your stamps and be sure to get them back to you in a very quick<br/>
turn around time.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if I am not going about this correctly!!<br/>
<br/>
And thanks for any help anyone might give me/us!<br/>
