                    <div class="plaintext-content">Florida had a period of about 5 days when it was abnormally cooland <br/>
those were the 5 days we were there visiting my folks.  We did a <br/>
little letterboxing.  We went to Lakes Park in Ft. Myers and <br/>
confirmed that 2 of our boxes (Warbling Snowbird and Peek-a-Boo <br/>
Seashell) were indeed MIAprobably the victim of park maintenance and <br/>
relandscaping.  We never got to see their logbooks  )~:	  At least <br/>
Sandy Dollar was still there.  We also had a chance to find several <br/>
other letterboxes in the park, placed by StarSAELS.  As we were <br/>
looking through the various logbooks, it was fun to see some familiar <br/>
stamps:  Tiptoe &amp; Tonto, WI Hiker, and Martini Man!  We were able to <br/>
move along a HH that we had found in Michigan.  <br/>
<br/>
We also checked on our Wild Pigs Run Amuck box (those pigs are a real <br/>
problem in my folk's part of FL).  That box was OK as well.  It was <br/>
interesting to see that most of the stamps must have been vacationers<br/>
there were stamps from a number of states.  One entry even said they <br/>
had seen 6 piglets as they were searching down the box.  <br/>
<br/>
While we didn't get a whole lot of letterboxing done this trip, I did <br/>
get to see a lot of birds41 different species.  And one new bird to <br/>
add to my life lista hooded merganser.  I love being able to combine <br/>
these 2 hobbies.<br/>
