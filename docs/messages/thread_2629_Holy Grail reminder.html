Again, do not let anyone outside the Great Lakes know about it yet <br/>
unless they read this board.  Once all boxes have been placed, then <br/>
we'll let others in on it.<br/>

As soon as the bike is back in action, I promise to get right on it (and drive straight to the park to plant the Holy Grail boxes).  They should hopefully be in place by the end of next week.  And I'm working on Flying Dragon too.<br/>

I believe Dragon also created a stripped down version of the page to <br/>
bypass the slow downloading time, etc. Unfortunately, I don't know the <br/>
address, but it should be in the archives. (I would search for a post <br/>
in April or so?)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
