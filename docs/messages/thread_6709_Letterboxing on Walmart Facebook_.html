Walmart Idea #60: Take a hike. Getting the whole family excited to go on a hike can be tough, but letterboxing is one way to keep everyone entertained. It's hiking and treasure hunting rolled into one! Walmart Mom Lynnae McCoy shares her adventure:Our First Letterboxing Hike<br>

Letterboxing is our newest hobby. It's a great way to get kids outdoors and get some exercise. The search for the box motivates even the most reluctant kids. Our first time out was quite the adventure!<br>

No Debbie,  Miss Beetle still thinks letterboxing is the weirdest hobby.  What do kids know anyway?  But when she stumbles upon something letterboxing related, at least she will tell her 'cootie' mom.  <br>
 <br>
No links about Walmart sales.  I'm not particularly interested in shopping at Walmart after the in-store injury.  But I do need more cam tape, so I need to find another supply source.  <br>
