Sadly my twin, Ukusa, in England had to tell me. I would have missed <br>

called me right away, being fully aware of her<br>
daughter's letterboxing activity, but I had to take my<br>
parents to the airport this morning and so she didn't<br>
read the paper over her coffee today.  I'm<br>
hyperventilating here.  Granted, I knew it was only a<br>
matter of time before something like this hit the<br>
paper in our neck of the woods, but still...<br>
<br>
OK, I've calmed down enough to actually READ the<br>
article, and I guess it's not that bad - I mean, the<br>
reporter did include the line about "Secrecy is part<br>
of the letterbox mystique," but there have been much<br>
better articles, too.  Wee Walkers (who I've met<br>
before) line is smacking me with its irony, "Some<br>
people are afraid that it would be spoiled if too many<br>
people find out about it."  So we're gonna do a front<br>
page Metro section story on it!<br>
<br>
It does only mention letterboxing.org, though, not<br>
AtlasQuest.  The map they included as a graphic is<br>
cute, but...but...did they HAVE to list Huntington #1?<br>
 That's one of the oldest boxes in the area.  Wait,<br>
what's that I hear.... I think it's the Cleveland<br>
MetroParks powers-that-be changing their geocaching<br>
policy to include letterboxing now, too!<br>
<br>
And that was very rude for the reporter to oust<br>
Travel'n Turtle's library box.  Especially since we<br>
haven't had a chance to find it yet ;)  How much you<br>
want to bet the librarians are trying to figure out<br>
the clues to that box right now? *smirk*<br>

I checked on my library box in N.Royalton last night and it's all <br>
safe and sound. I moved it to a 10 find, figuring it'd stay a little <br>
longer. I'm going to leave it until it gets muggled though. I will <br>
not give in to the terrorists! :o)<br>
<br>
I stupidly was worried about my three boxes mentioned in the article <br>
when I got an email from a newbie: <br>
<br>
"I read the PD, got on line to know more of LETTERBOXING. This was <br>
my 1st find, so I'm a rookie and not sure what to do. I signed the <br>
log, I have no stamp or did I want your stamp, I just enjoyed <br>
finding the box. I'm a hike leader for the Cleveland Hiking Club, so <br>
I had a good idea where this was from my hikes out that way. Sorry <br>
if I didn't follow procedures." Ahhhh, didn't want my stamps; was I <br>
offering!!! I did at first think he'd took it, so it least they seem <br>
to still be there.<br>
