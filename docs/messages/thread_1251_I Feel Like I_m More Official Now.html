we were out looking for our first boxes.  We've since become hooked. <br>
But a pretty busy life has hampered placing our own boxes.  Until now<br>
that is.  Yesterday I planted our first box.  It's a HH though so<br>
there aren't any clues.  :P  <br>
<br>
I also have a few stamps carved and more ideas in my head.  I'm hoping<br>
that in May our hectic life will slow down enough to have time to get<br>
out and plant some boxes.  We've already scouted out a few places and<br>
just need to write clues and carve a few more stamps.  There's a need<br>
for more boxes on the east side of Grand Rapids.  ;)<br>
<br>
Letterboxing combines many of the things that we're interested in so<br>
I'm really happy we discovered it!<br>
