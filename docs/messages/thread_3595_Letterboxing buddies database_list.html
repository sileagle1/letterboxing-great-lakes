especially for us gals boxing solo.  My kids are too young to go with <br/>
me, so Mr. Lucky Star has to stay home with them... leaves me a <br/>

&gt; Oh, great idea.  I often want to go, but my husband is at work and <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; daughter is at school, and don't want to venture to areas I don't <br/>
&gt; know very well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll put the first call out, I would like to head out to Yorkville, <br/>
&gt; Illinois and hit some boxes out there.  Anyone for Thursday ar <br/>
Friday <br/>
&gt; Afternoon?  Email me off line and we'll  make the arrangements if <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; weather is good.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey, what do you guys think of creating a database of people <br/>
&gt; willing to link up and act as local letterboxing hosts if someone <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; going to be in an area and is looking for someone to box with?  It <br/>
&gt; would have to include the general geographic area the person lives <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; so you'd know who to contact.  (Ooh, a letterboxing escort <br/>
service!  <br/>
&gt; Yikes!)  (Note I said "link up", not "hook up"!!)<br/>
