since I saw you on here I figured I would leave you a message here <br/>
too. <br/>
I went looking for some of your boxes on Wednesday and found them left <br/>
totally exposed, I could see two of them quite a ways away with no <br/>
coverings, luckly those two were in not heavly traveled locations, but <br/>
one I could not find at all. I think I got the full message through on <br/>
LbNA so check their if you haven't for a few days. Hopefully this <br/>
unfound box is a case of a newbie and not a missing box.<br/>
Please let me know what you think. I'll be back on Sunday<br/>
