I know many people here don't read that list, but I thought this post was especially poignant and timely in light of the wave of new members due to the recent publicity pieces.  It was written by a veteran letterboxer on the West Coast and there are many other seasoned letterboxers who share in his sadness.  I think as time goes on and the face of letterboxing is transformed, many new members don't even realize some of the traditions of letterboxing.<br>

Anyway...  food for thought...  not meant to spark debate, rather just informational.<br>

Subject: [LbNA] Saddness<br>
<br>
<br>
The state of letterboxing today saddens me. Having had the pleasure <br>
of recently visiting several out of the way letterboxes I noticed <br>
that letterboxes which require more than a mile or two of hiking get <br>
very few visitors. Now this wasn't a surprise to me but what I did <br>
notice is that the older boxes used to get visitors but no longer <br>
do. The obvious reason is that once upon a time there were very few <br>
boxes and letterboxers tended to seek out all the boxes available. <br>
Nowadays, there are so many drive-by boxes few letterboxers seem to <br>
bother looking for anything else. I find this distressing. <br>
<br>
Hiking is an integral part of the letterboxing tradition. The <br>
original letterbox at Dartmoor required a significant walk to <br>
obtain. Even today while pub boxes are all over Dartmoor, the real <br>
letterboxing remains out on the moors (pub boxes do not count <br>
towards the Dartmoor 100 club). When letterboxing started in the <br>
United States, boxes were placed in special places, usually <br>
requiring at least a short stroll. Even with the advent of drive-by <br>
boxes, they still were placed in special places where you would - by <br>
choice - linger for a good while to enjoy the scenery or learn some <br>
history. I remember one of the first drive-by boxes I ever found. It <br>
was a box hidden near a lighthouse. The clue was clever, the stamp <br>
wonderful, and the location incredible. Not only was there a <br>
lighthouse to visit, but there was also a short walk down to a rocky <br>
beach where we stayed for a good hour enjoying the tide pools, <br>
spotting seals in the water, and watching birds on the offshore <br>
rocks. Today it seems that boxers quickly simply stamp in at one non-<br>
descript playground and drive on to the next for another box. I hope <br>
that at least they are enjoying the stamp images and not just <br>
looking to raise their F counts.<br>
<br>
The proliferation of postal letterboxing also distresses me. There <br>
is nothing wrong with the exchange of art by mail. Indeed, the <br>
first, to my knowledge, postal letterbox was Flutterby. But with <br>
Flutterby, it came to you by surprise: it wasn't something you <br>
competed to sign up for before the list closed. You were grateful to <br>
receive it, and you didn't consider it a letterbox find. Postal <br>
letterboxing is not letterboxing, it is simply an exchange of art by <br>
mail. By all means participate if you like, but please don't confuse <br>
it with letterboxing. <br>
<br>
I wish dearly that everyone would take a few minutes to think about <br>
what letterboxing is. The stamp exchange is integral of course, as <br>
is the clue. However, what many people are missing is that the <br>
location of and the journey to the box are also integral. In our <br>
eagerness to share our stamps by planting boxes, we've come to the <br>
point where we've forgotten about the location and journey. In our <br>
eagerness to collect as many stamps as possible, we've come to go <br>
after the easiest boxes to find and thereby missing the beauty of <br>
the locations of and journeys to the more time consuming boxes.<br>
<br>
Will anyone else join me in a renewed emphasis on the location and <br>
journey?<br>
