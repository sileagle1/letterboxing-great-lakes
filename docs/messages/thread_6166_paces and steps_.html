Yes, the dictionary uses the term 'pace' and 'step' interchangeably.  But orienteering clubs define a pace as every left/right combination.  I read another definition in a Girl Scout outdoor training manual and it states that a pace is approximately 28-30 inches in length; that would be a left/right step combination...or one really HUGE step.  LOL!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If a Lb clue includes steps and paces, it's probably best to state your personal definition in the clue.   <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Pace counting<br>
Counting the number of paces you take to estimate the distance you travel. Paces usually are counted one for every left/right combination. You need to determine your standard pace for various conditions (at least one for walking and one for running) on a fixed course of known length. <br>

Have you ever looked in a dictionary to see the definition of pace? Most<br>
actually define it as ONE step. For some reason a lot of letterboxers<br>
consider it two steps.<br>

No, because that would actually be 14 steps.<br>

I'll still take two steps when I see "pace" in a clue.  It usually gets me <br>

May all our disagreements be polite and peaceable.<br>
