Oh, yes, yes, yes!  Anyone who's ever in that area<br/>
must stop at that park!  It's very amazing, and the<br/>
boxes, esp. the clues, are so fun.  <br/>

do need a life!..But this one suits me just fine!  I predict a mini-<br/>

&gt; &gt; If you're coming from SE Michigan (am I remembering<br/>
&gt; &gt; this right?), I would highly recommend swinging<br/>
&gt; &gt; through Somerset Center for the Intrigue at Aiden<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lair<br/>
&gt; &gt; series. 7 boxes, all recently tended to and<br/>
&gt; &gt; active...and seriously fun! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, yes, yes, yes!  Anyone who's ever in that area<br/>
&gt; must stop at that park!  It's very amazing, and the<br/>
&gt; boxes, esp. the clues, are so fun.  <br/>
