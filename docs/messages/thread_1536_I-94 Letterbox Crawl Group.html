I volunteered to do one for the Detroit/East end too - we should <br>
coordinate, so we don't end up too close together.  Actually, I was <br>
thinking of venturing toward Port Huron to establish an "end point" <br>
to the route.  Can't plant one right at the end - since it's a border <br>
crossing, homeland security probably would interfere with hiding <br>
mysterious plastic containers - but I bet I can find a place close to <br>
the end.  I'll be in touch!<br>
