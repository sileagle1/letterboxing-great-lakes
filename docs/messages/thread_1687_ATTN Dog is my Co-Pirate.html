Don't know if you received my message through LBNA's "Contact the Placer" link.  Am desperate to know if the van with the "Dog is My Co-Pilot" bumper sticker that we saw this past Saturday night in the parking lot at the Timber Rattlers game belongs to you.  If not, then the owner will be very mystified by those little ticket-sized pieces of paper stuck under the windshield wipers with stamped images on them and words like "Papeseed F49 P8 X5" written on them!  Hee hee hee hee.  --Papeseed<br/>
