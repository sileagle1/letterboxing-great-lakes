                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all -- <br>
<br>
I rescued two soaked logbooks back in the fall, and - of course - haven't put them back in their boxes yet, despite the best of intentions.<br>
<br>
Now I'm leaving in a few days to head back to New England for what might be permanently, so I'm reaching out to others to help me get these logs back to their rightful owners and/or boxes.<br>
<br>
The two logs I have are:<br>
<br>
1) Log from "The Great Circus Train Series:  Age of Chivalry."  Located in Waunakee, WI (just north of Madison).<br>
<br>
2) Log and box from "MPHG: "Run Away!"  Located in Gurnee, IL, although I found it open on the ground and the stamp was gone.<br>
<br>
If anyone can help me find The Dragon or Lock Shock n Barrel so I can mail these back to them, OR if anyone lives in these areas and can help replant these, please let me know.<br>
<br>
thanks all, and happy boxing in this weird winter.<br>
<br>
