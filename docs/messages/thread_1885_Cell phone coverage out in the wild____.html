                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since many experienced letterboxers suggest carrying a cell phone<br/>
while in the woods, I'm wondering about your coverage.<br/>
I am about to change carriers due in part to my discovery that upon<br/>
several occasions recently while placing boxes, I was totally out of<br/>
touch. (Those who have searched for "80 Days" boxes may know some of<br/>
the sites. <g>)<br/>
Yesterday I was placing a series for the "Get A Clue" gathering at<br/>
Yankee Springs (in S.W. MI) and was surprised to see that I was not<br/>
able to use the phone despite proximity to reasonably populated areas.<br/>
I am an infrequent cell phone user, but when I want it I don't like<br/>
discovering that I'm out of reach/touch.<br/>
<br/>
So, what's your experience with your phone while you're in the wilds?<br/>
Am I expecting too much?<br/>
<br/>
As I've shopped the various providers I've discovered that they tend<br/>
to (1) badmouth their competition and (2) brag about their own coverage.<br/>
Why am I not surprised?<br/>
<br/>
If you don't mind, please share your thoughts on this.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can rate 3 carriers.  I am in Sussex, WI and my husband works in downtown <br/>
Milwaukee, but is all over the city at times at their differing sites, as <br/>
far out as Oconomowoc and even into Madison on occassion.<br/>
<br/>
My phone: Cingular's coverage is for the birds - that stay put in one spot <br/>
- preferably not in my home.  My phone hardly works without lots of issues <br/>
here in Sussex.  I used to work with a lady who had similar issues in Meno. <br/>
Falls - I get dropped and drive through dead/very weak zones <br/>
frequently.  The only reason we have this carrier is because that is who we <br/>
get the cheap phone deal through my husband's work.<br/>
<br/>
My husband's actual work phone is through Verizon (his boss needed what <br/>
services they offer, LOL, for their jobs).  The coverage is much better. <br/>
Much fewer droppings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
However, Neither of them had good signal's when we went camping at Mauthe <br/>
Lake this fall....thankfully it did not rain - we had planned on relying on <br/>
access to the web through his Blackberry and it was a no go.<br/>
<br/>
Now, our favorite, which we do not currently have was U.S. Cellular. We <br/>
loved them - we never got dropped anywhere, it seemed!  It even worked out <br/>
at Mauthe Lake, LOL!  We had them for years and years before hubby had to <br/>
change jobs.  It worked as we drove to Oklahoma numerous times along the <br/>
whole stretch of highway.  The ONLY place it used to not work and that had <br/>
changed the last time we were there and still had the phone (about 2 ys <br/>
ago) was down near the cave in Meramec State Park Missouri.  It was down in <br/>
a deep valley in the forest and it was surrounded by rock, <br/>
LOL!  Originally, it was a no cell hole, but that is not the case now.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

A note of caution in regards to cell phones. I slipped mine into the same bag that my compass was in and when I went to use my compass at the next site it no longer worked properly. It was almost completely reversed. The only thing I can think that would have caused it was the contact with my cell phone. Anyone have such an experience?<br/>

Don't know if anyone else has mentioned this yet but I found out on my phone it actually has 2 settings. one setting keeps me on my "carrier" towers and the other setting allows access to ALL cell towers available. It is supposed to keep you from paying roaming charges in you don't have nationwide coverage or something.<br/>

<br/>
just another thought.<br/>
