If someone comes to your front door saying they<br/>
are conducting a study on deer ticks and asks you <br/>
to take your clothes off and dance around with your <br/>
arms up, DO NOT DO IT!!<br/>
<br/>
IT IS A SCAM; they  only want to see you naked.<br/>

  DON'T forget check YOURSELF (very carefully) for ticks.<br/>
  A year and a half ago (Oct.'03) while LB'ing with Martini Man and <br/>
Wisconsin Hiker, I picked up a tick.  It attached itself, and I found <br/>
it the next evening.  The area around the bite was red, swollen, <br/>
itchy and about the size of a quarter.  I checked out the tick with a <br/>
disecting microscope (at the local public health office) and it was a <br/>
deer tick.<br/>
  So, I went to the doctor.  The test for Lyme disease was negative, <br/>
but because of the other symptoms I was put on two weeks of <br/>
antibiotics.  I continued to feel fine, but the bite continued to <br/>
itch for several weeks.<br/>
  Last August (10 months later) I started having chills, then sweats, <br/>
then some aches and pains, then fatigue (a walk to the maibox <br/>
required a two hour nap to recover), then drenching night sweats (4 t-<br/>
shirts and 8 towels), then a rash.  During this time I was seeing my <br/>
doctor and tests were being made, but there was nothing conclusive.  <br/>
Then he decided to test for Lyme disease and it came back positive.  <br/>
About 12 hours after starting the antibiotics I was pretty much back <br/>
to normal.<br/>
  BUT... There had been no ticks, no red, itchy spots, in fact, I <br/>
could not find any insect bites anywhere on my body.  Lyme Disease is <br/>
bad stuff and the ticks a very small.  Please be careful.<br/>
