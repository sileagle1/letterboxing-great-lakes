&gt; -----------------------------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This day is call'd GLk 2010.<br/>
&gt; They that outlive this day, and come safe home,<br/>
&gt; Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,<br/>
&gt; And rouse them at the name of Jubilee.<br/>
&gt; They that shall live this day, and see old age,<br/>
&gt; Will yearly on the vigil feast their neighbours,<br/>
&gt; And say 'To-morrow is the gathering<br/>
&gt; Then will they open their logbooks and show the images,<br/>
&gt; And say 'These stamps I had on GLk 2010.<br/>
&gt; Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,<br/>
&gt; But we'll remember, with advantages,<br/>
&gt; What feats we did that day. Then shall our names,<br/>
&gt; Familiar in the mouth as household words-<br/>
&gt; Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.<br/>
&gt; This story shall the good man teach his son;<br/>
&gt; And a Great Lakes gathering shall ne'er go by,<br/>
&gt;&gt;From this day to the ending of the world,<br/>
&gt; But we in it shall be remembered-<br/>
&gt; We few, we happy few, we band of boxers;<br/>
&gt; For those to-day that slip in mud with me<br/>
&gt; Shall be my family; be they ne'er so vile,<br/>
&gt; This day shall gentle their condition;<br/>
&gt; And boxers in the Great Lakes now-a-bed<br/>
&gt; Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,<br/>
&gt; And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br/>
&gt; That boxed with us upon GLk 2010.<br/>
