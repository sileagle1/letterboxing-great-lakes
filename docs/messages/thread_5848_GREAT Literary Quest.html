The clues were fun (although I'm still reading "Gone With the Wind"...LOL!), and the boxes were well-distributed through the park.

Thanks, K Crew, for getting the 2009 gathering season off to a great start!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was indeed one for the "books".  It was my very first event, so I am comfortable in saying it was the best event I have ever attended!  Letterboxers are such gracious people.  Thank you just doesn't seem to cover it, as I'm sure The K Crew and all who helped put on this wonderful gathering went over and above, and gave their all.  Thanks also to everyone for being so friendly and helpful.  Because we had so very much fun, it just makes me even more sad that I will be unable to attend the 2009 Great Lakes Gathering.  <br>
Thanks again ~ well done!<br>
