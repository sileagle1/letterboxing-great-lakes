                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't know if you guys have been following the chat on AQ about the pathtags or not, but I wanted to let you know that I will be coordinating for Illinois.<br>
<br>
Here are the basics:<br>
<br>
1.  You can earn pathtags (quarter sized medallions) for hiking in Illinois.  There will be tags for 25, 50, and 100 miles.  More later if there is interest.<br>
2.  You do not have to be a resident, but miles must be hiked in Illinois.  Yes, your kids and your dog can earn the pathtags.<br>
3.  Hiking must be done after Illinois' start date of 4/24/09.  Each hike must be a minimum of 1 mile.  You cannot string shorter hikes together.  You can however, use partial miles.  1.6, 2.4, etc...no rounding up though.<br>
4.  All miles must be in pursuit of New letterboxes, either finds or plants.  Maintenance does not count.<br>
5.  Once you have 25 (or more), email me here or at AQ and send me a list of the miles and the boxes that qualify the miles.  I'll do a quick check (I'm not going to be the TH police though) to verify.  Then I can mail your tags.  There is a small fee ($3) to cover costs, but believe me, I will not be making any money on this!<br>
<br>
If you want more information, you can visit the website that Dixie created for the Treasure Hiking: http://www.dixiegraphix.com/treasurehikers/main.html.<br>
There is also a message board on AQ just for Treasure Hiking.<br>
I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have, as well.<br>
<br>
I really hope that many of you will be encouraged to get out and hike, find and plant new letterboxes, and enjoy this opportunity.  Our pathtags have been ordered and I will post a picture just as soon as they arrive.  Meanwhile, you can look at the bluepring here:  http://www.atlasquest.com/gallery/viewphoto.html?gPhotoId=69531<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We started our Treasure Hike program here in Ohio as well on <br>
3.01.09---with all of the same basics with one exception.  We decided to <br>
do patches rather than pathtags.  Mama Stork, becohio and I are the <br>
state motivators and if anyone would like to start a program in their <br>
Great Lake state that does not already have one, please let any of us <br>
know and we will get you started!  It has already had a wonderful impact <br>
on getting folks to do more hiking on trails either for finds or placing <br>
of letterboxes in Ohio---and in other states as well!!<br>
<br>
I'm glad you posted this here Stacy!  I should have done the same a <br>
couple of months ago!!  Thank you.  =D<br>
