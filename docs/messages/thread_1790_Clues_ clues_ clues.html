                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've noticed that also when reviewing clues for pending trips (we are headed to RI/CT/MA this fall).  Although you can find some really great boxes anywhere you go across the country -- this is particularly true in the Pacific NW, there are also a lot of what I call "gimme" boxes -- where, as you say, they all but hand you the box.  When I first started boxing I was amazed at reports from other areas where people were finding 15-20 boxes in one day.  I chalked it up to greater box density in places like CT.  But I think it is more than that -- it is also about the quality of the clues.<br>
<br>
It's hard to generalize, but I do think that in the Great Lakes area there are a lot of real quality boxes with clues that make you think and hike, perhaps more so than other areas of the country.  I'm really proud of that about our area.<br>

  OK - do the placers here in the Midwest write more interesting/toughter <br>
