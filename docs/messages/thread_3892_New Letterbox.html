I tend to reply to messages from member of this group rather than initiate and post new messages myself.  However, a little bit of creative cutting and pasting and deleting, and I think this message will get through to the group.  So, here goes my attempt to post a message.  (Computers - making our lives easier through layers of complication!)<br>
<br>
This spring, my first goal is to check my current letterboxes for any necessary first aid and check up care.  My second goal is to place 12 new letterboxes before the end of April 2007.  As a result of my second goal, I'm spending a good amount of time practicing my carving techniques.  <br>
<br>
Today, I posted the first of those 12 new letterboxes, and I'm continuing to work on more as well.  It's listed on AQ as a mystery box, because the exact location is not 'spelled out'  (or maybe it IS, you just have to read the clue very carefully for the cryptic clues!)  <br>
<br>
Now that it's posted, I'm off to place the box.  Did I say first finder certificate? <br>
