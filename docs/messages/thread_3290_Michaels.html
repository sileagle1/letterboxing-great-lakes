"Geez oh pizza..." :-)<br>
<br>
I was actually gonna post this on Sunday but instead got wrapped up in<br>
the whole MI article thingy...<br>
<br>
I you haven't checked the Michaels flyer this week, they got lots of<br>
40% and 50% of coupons (great for the LePlume markers).  I went on<br>
Sunday to use the one-day 50% one, and while there discovered that<br>
they are discontinuing the sale of the individual markers and have<br>
them for $1.50 each ($1 off)!  I picked up a set of 12 for less than<br>
the cost of a twelve pack, and got a 12 pack at 50% off too boot!  I'm<br>
going later this week to get more packs at 40% and 50% off.<br>
<br>
One reason I bring this up, other than general info, is that the<br>
Circus Train stamps (soon to be posted) will REQUIRE the use of inking<br>
pens, so if you don't have some, now's a good time to get some.  (If<br>
you have a "primary" set, that'll do.)  Inking pens also make good<br>
gift exchange items (although a bit more than $10 at 50% off).<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
