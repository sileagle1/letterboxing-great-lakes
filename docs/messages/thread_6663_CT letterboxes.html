I will be in Connecticut next week, about half an hour east of New Haven.  Any suggestions of not to be missed letterboxes in the area?  I'll be on my own and will have probably 4 or 5 hours each day to play.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We enjoyed hiking &amp; boxing in Rocky Neck State Park in East Lyme, CT in 2006<br/>
- lots of boxes there!  We also like Sleeping Giant State Park - north of<br/>
New Haven.  Great hiking &amp; boxing!  I'm not sure how many boxes are still in<br/>
place in Bluff Point State Park (Groton, CT), which is where the "Pirate in<br/>
Every Port" event was held in September 2006. That might be another good<br/>
spot to check out. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Connecticut has so many boxes and a surprisingly large number of great<br/>
hiking trails -you will have a GREAT time!<br/>

Hey all,<br/>

Any suggestions of not to be missed letterboxes in the area? I'll be on my<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was in Middleton, CT visiting some friends almost exactly a year ago <br/>
and found a few boxes out there.  Since my friends aren't boxers <br/>
themselves though, I was "limited" on what ones to find, but like WI <br/>
Hiker said, there are tons out there to pick from that may be closer to <br/>
where you are staying.  We did a series of 3 boxes called "Science 101" <br/>
(which of course I picked just because they were science-themed stamps), <br/>
and it was a straight hike through some nice woods, maybe about a mile <br/>
round trip.  There was no one else there when we were -- very green and <br/>
peaceful with some old rock walls near the last box at least.  We also <br/>
found one called "Alchemy Symbols: Rubber" at a state park where I <br/>
believe the actor (tv? play?) who famously played Sherlock Holmes used <br/>
to live, but he donated the castle/land to the state when he died -- we <br/>
toured the castle too, and it was neat also.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
