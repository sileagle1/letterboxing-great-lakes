Sisu Sue!  What a treat!  And the music was fabulous!  Thanks for <br>
the visit and the great LB'g chit chat.  <br>
We hope to get LB'g this weekend to "release" a certian something <br>
into the wild!  <br>
Unfortunately, we got into town a little past dusk, and didn't have <br>
time to search for her box, so we'll have to plan on getting back <br>
out there very soon.<br>
<br>
Wishing you well Keltic Kara in your new ventures! <br>
