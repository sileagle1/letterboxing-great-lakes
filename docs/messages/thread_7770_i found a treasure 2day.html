Neat game! Take care kids! I repacked it and put it back...<br>

Hidden in a rotten tree, it was in tupperware! And zip locks!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
With 3 pads of paper,, with peoples inkstamps and stampings, and signatures,<br>

But I found it while i was looking for foundation of those cottages from the<br>
1870's, called Palisade Park, were that owner died of typhoid up on-top of<br>
the West Bluff. We used ta see remains of the cottages up there when we were<br>
boys Ronnie! And remember the chimneys and fireplaces! <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The signatures went back in the 3 books to 2005! Many people found it, (Even<br>
a few this year!) Yet all including me re-hid it again! Amazing that not one<br>
single person swiped it since 2005! 8 years of getting hidden and re-found!!<br>
It was in Texas a Georgia, ((Hey Dena Georgia)) and Illinois, and Iowa, etc<br>
etc.... But lots of time at Devils Lake, and gone and back to Devil's Lake<br>
again... I took some fotos of it today before I re-hid it! see the<br>

The tupperware box is broken at the end, and someone duck-taped it, but<br>
water is starting to get in. (And there are no HANDOUTS Left!)<br>

Hi!<br>
<br>
The Demon's Dwelling letterbox always stays at Devil's Lake, but people from<br>
all over the country (& world) follow clues to look for it. When someone<br>
finds it they stamp their "signature stamp" into the box logbook. They also<br>
put an image of the box stamp into their personal logbook and then put<br>
everything back where they found it. My husband and I have found over 6,000<br>
boxes all over the world.<br>
<br>
It sounds like there may also have been a "hitchhiker" in the box. This is a<br>
special stamp & logbook that DOES travel around. People move this special<br>
stamp from one letterbox to another.<br>
<br>
There are several other boxes hidden at Devil's Lake if you want to look for<br>
them. Clues can be found at letterboxing.org.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the report & photos!!<br>

Sounds like a nice gentleman.  Wish all muggles were as sweet.  Maybe he'll begin letterboxing and start his own "adventure".  Here's to meeting him on the trail some day.<br>
