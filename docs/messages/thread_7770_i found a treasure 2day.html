<br/>

The signatures went back in the 3 books to 2005! Many people found it, (Even<br/>

It was in Texas a Georgia, ((Hey Dena Georgia)) and Illinois, and Iowa, etc<br/>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
The Demon's Dwelling letterbox always stays at Devil's Lake, but people from<br/>
all over the country (&amp; world) follow clues to look for it. When someone<br/>
finds it they stamp their "signature stamp" into the box logbook. They also<br/>
put an image of the box stamp into their personal logbook and then put<br/>
everything back where they found it. My husband and I have found over 6,000<br/>
boxes all over the world.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like there may also have been a "hitchhiker" in the box. This is a<br/>
special stamp &amp; logbook that DOES travel around. People move this special<br/>
stamp from one letterbox to another.<br/>
<br/>
There are several other boxes hidden at Devil's Lake if you want to look for<br/>
them. Clues can be found at letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the report &amp; photos!!<br/>

Sounds like a nice gentleman.  Wish all muggles were as sweet.  Maybe he'll begin letterboxing and start his own "adventure".  Here's to meeting him on the trail some day.<br/>

&gt; But I found it while i was looking for foundation of those cottages from the<br/>
&gt; 1870's, called Palisade Park, were that owner died of typhoid up on-top of<br/>
&gt; the West Bluff. We used ta see remains of the cottages up there when we were<br/>
&gt; boys Ronnie! And remember the chimneys and fireplaces! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The signatures went back in the 3 books to 2005! Many people found it, (Even<br/>
&gt; a few this year!) Yet all including me re-hid it again! Amazing that not one<br/>
&gt; single person swiped it since 2005! 8 years of getting hidden and re-found!!<br/>
&gt; It was in Texas a Georgia, ((Hey Dena Georgia)) and Illinois, and Iowa, etc<br/>
&gt; etc.... But lots of time at Devils Lake, and gone and back to Devil's Lake<br/>
&gt; again... I took some fotos of it today before I re-hid it! see the<br/>
&gt; attachments.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The tupperware box is broken at the end, and someone duck-taped it, but<br/>
&gt; water is starting to get in. (And there are no HANDOUTS Left!)<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Demon's Dwelling letterbox always stays at Devil's Lake, but people from<br/>
&gt; all over the country (&amp; world) follow clues to look for it. When someone<br/>
&gt; finds it they stamp their "signature stamp" into the box logbook. They also<br/>
&gt; put an image of the box stamp into their personal logbook and then put<br/>
&gt; everything back where they found it. My husband and I have found over 6,000<br/>
&gt; boxes all over the world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It sounds like there may also have been a "hitchhiker" in the box. This is a<br/>
&gt; special stamp &amp; logbook that DOES travel around. People move this special<br/>
&gt; stamp from one letterbox to another.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are several other boxes hidden at Devil's Lake if you want to look for<br/>
&gt; them. Clues can be found at letterboxing.org.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the report &amp; photos!!<br/>
