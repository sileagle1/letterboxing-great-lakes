                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, my Winter Fun series continues to have bad luck.<br>
<br>
Two of the 4 boxes had previously disappeared, one definitely due to <br>
animals.  Today we checked on the remaining 2 and animals had also <br>
been at work.  We have some very aggresive critters in Waukesha <br>
County!  Last week we were in New England and we found a lot of boxes <br>
that were 4 years old and looked like new.  This is definitely NOT <br>
the case around here!<br>
<br>
The Winter Fun series boxes were planted in JAN 2005 and have seen <br>
hard times.  The blue rubber edges on the Rubbermaid containers seem <br>
to be especially enticing to WI critters (but not Connecticut <br>
critters).<br>
<br>
Today we found the remains of the Winter Fun - Tobogganing box.  Lid <br>
was quite chewed up.  Log book was slightly chopped; stamp was no <br>
where to be found.<br>
<br>
The opposite was true for the Winter Fun - Ice Fishing box.  We went <br>
to check on it today and the tree it was in had totally collapsed and <br>
therefore it took us a while to even find the right spot.  We had <br>
almost given up when I spotted something on the ground. It was the <br>
lid!  I then spotted the stamp laying loose on the ground with a <br>
minor bite out of it.  An animal had obviously attacked the box.  We <br>
managed to find bits of shredded baggies and a part of the plastic <br>
binding from the logbook.  Never found the box itself, nor any sign <br>
of the actual logbook.  We picked up the pieces, threw most of it <br>
away, and brought the stamp home.  I'll probably put a replacement <br>
box (with original, slightly damaged stamp) back out within the next <br>
few weeks.  I'll put the box in the same general area, but obviously <br>
a different resting spot!<br>
<br>
Bottomline:  Of the 4 Winter Fun boxes, 3 are history (Skating, <br>
Tobogganing, Snowshoeing) and I will not be replacing them. The Ice <br>
Fishing box will be replaced within the next few weeks.<br>
<br>
One thing we have noticed - if the Rubbermaid boxes are covered with <br>
camo tape, animals are not as attracted to the box. By covering up <br>
that tasty blue rubber, it diminishes the appeal.  <br>

Hey WI Hiker.maybe you have to stop eating sausage while packaging up your<br>
boxes?  That camo tape maybe keeps the smell in?   LOL-just kidding-it is a<br>
shame that they are getting chewed.  I do know that my dogs seem to have a<br>
special taste for container lids though.I always thought it was because of<br>
the food smell-maybe not?  Terrio<br>

Here in Michigan, We tend to use Lock - Lock boxes, and I can say that even through Michigan's wettest, hardest winters, and rains we have had no problems with them... even with the critters that run around out there in the North Woods.. Sooooo go figure..<br>
