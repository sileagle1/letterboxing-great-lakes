Too funny!  I wish my mom would have eaten OUR pea soup... are you reading<br/>
this, mom?  Actually she did us a favor with oatmeal, which we also didn't<br/>
like (and neither did she).  My dad thought it was good for us to eat it, so<br/>
she cooked it, then added a LOT of brown sugar and vanilla, making it almost<br/>
like cooke dough.  We did manage to eat it after it was "enhanced".<br/>

Do people still make their kids eat certain foods??<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  At least my parents did.  Once we were 10 we didn't have to eat a whole lot of things we didn't like, but we did have to eat some.  Thankfully by then I only had a few food aversions.  Like black eyed peas, and liver...the only food that will induce a gag reflex just thinking about eating it (unfortunately my mom would occasionally get a craving for liver and we had to eat it, blegh).  However I do remember feeling very clever when I was 4 and didn't want to eat something (who knows what it was) and when my parents stepped out of the kitchen (we weren't allowed to leave the table if we hadn't eaten either) I scraped it into the garbage and covered it over with something that had already been in the trash.  But thanks to my dad, I doubt I'll ever starve for lack of something familiar to eat (I'm game for just about anything at least once).  <br/>
