We of course saw The Red Cat during lunch and chatted with a few other<br/>
boxers we hadn't seen before (Sky, Tricky Troy &amp; Fauna).  However we were<br/>
disappointed to miss Gooble Gobble (who we haven't seen since 2006) and<br/>
several others that we have met in the past.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We went back on Sunday to find a bunch more and were surprised we didn't run<br/>
into anyone else out there.  <br/>

We're wondering how many people competed GG's series and claimed a HH from<br/>
his elaborate haunted house.<br/>

Hi Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man,<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry will missed you guys at Harvest and Haunts. I was looking forward<br/>
to seeing you again. Steve (S1 of SZSRocks) got called in to work Saturday<br/>
am, so we didn't make it to the park until later. Hope you guys had fun at<br/>
the event and at the wedding. Red Cat does such a nice job organizing events<br/>
for the frozen northland that is Minnesota!<br/>

<br/>
Just got back from wedding reception, so only a short note. It was FREEZING<br/>
on the trails today!! We were out from about 7:30 to noon on the trails,<br/>
then another hour and half at the shelter trying to warm up with hot<br/>
chocolate, holding our hands over a propane warmer and hot dog coals while<br/>
we ate lunch and did a few exchanges! My toes were almost totally frozen,<br/>
but luckily finally thawed at the church later in the afternoon. It wasn't<br/>
deep snow, but there was sme on all the trails and the paved trail was icy<br/>
in spots.<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice event and we're hoping to return to the park tomorrow to find<br/>
more of the boxes. Today we only had time for the series Gooble Gobble<br/>
planted and 2 others (plus a few right near the shelter). Unfortunately we<br/>
missed seeing a lot of people since they were out on the trails during<br/>
lunch.<br/>
<br/>
There was a cool "severed finger" dish at the potluck and Gooble Gobble had<br/>
assembled an impressive haunted house that contained new hitchhikers for the<br/>
first 14 people/groups that finished his series. I'll post photos later.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Red Cat for organizing the event!<br/>

&gt; TJM - must have just missed you - we got there just after noon. We boxed a<br/>
bit Twila and Little Bitty Pretty One. We seemed to have hit boxes that<br/>
Dramagoon had just hit. I had my better half with me again today, so we had<br/>
much success! 17 boxes. :) By dint of some gonzo letterboxing, we did find<br/>
Shards of Honor. It was not anywhere near where we expected it to be. We<br/>
were able to find Jedi and Flash - be glad Jedi is being relocated - very<br/>
thorny there. The last box was Jurassic Park by cell phone light - kept<br/>
expecting raptors to swoop in, but Peabody said they can't see well in that<br/>
light, plus the cold would slow 'em down cause they're cold-blooded. It did<br/>
flurry briefly, but the sun did come out! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wonder how WiHi and MM and the Minnesota gathering folks are faring.<br/>
