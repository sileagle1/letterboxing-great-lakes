                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning I took great care and many steps in planting a beautiful stamp carved by Electric Medic.  I felt the weight of the responsibility keenly.  <br>
<br>
In part, that weight comes from coming across boxes another person has planted that I don't feel were well-hidden and well-clued.  And it made me frustrated to see that done with an intricate stamp someone else had carved.<br>
<br>
Also, the resposibility comes from knowing I have lost at least two boxes.  One early on was lost, due to an incredibly bad placement, before it was even listed.  I tried to go back to retrieve it but it had been already been muggled.  The second one was better hidden, but got muggled also.  Just heard about that one yesterday.<br>
<br>
Thanks for "listening" to my venting.  The clues to my new plants should be up later today.  Thank you to all of who take great care in your planting and clue writing for stamps carved by others!<br>
