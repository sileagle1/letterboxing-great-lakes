section for member letterboxing pages.  Feel free to add a link to <br/>
your page/clues, etc. if you have one.  There is also a folder in <br/>
this section for links to pages with gathering photos -- Tim I hope <br/>
you don't mind that I added in a link to your photos from the recent <br/>
WI gathering.  Feel free to add to this!<br/>
<br/>
I also uploaded some of the pics from last year's GL Gather to get <br/>
people geared up for the possibility of getting together again this <br/>
year.  For captions with names (and clearer photos) the complete set <br/>
of pictures is here:<br/>

<br/>
Feel free to post other gathering photos you might have.  Also if <br/>
you have stamp carvings you would like to share with the group, we <br/>
would love to see them!<br/>
