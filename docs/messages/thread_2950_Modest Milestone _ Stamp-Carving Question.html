                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Yesterday I found my 100th box!  It only took me 25 months!  heheheh . . .<br>
actually by the end of the day I was at 102 finds.<br>
<br>
I have also screwed up my courage and (encouraged by Shutterfly) am starting<br>
to carve my own stamps.  I hope to replace the commercial stamps in all my<br>
planted boxes with hand-carved ones very soon.<br>
<br>
My question is:  what is a good size for a stamp?  I am finding that I am<br>
not adept enough to carve very small ones . . . if the largest dimension<br>
were about 3 inches, would that be pretty much acceptable for all?  If not,<br>
then maybe 2-1/2 inches???<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

No rules on the stamp size.  Just whatever fits in your boxes, what<br>
you feel comfortable doing, and how much money you want to spend on<br>
carving material!<br>

<br>
Don't worry about size, carve what you are comfortable with.  I think that<br>
generally anything that is within 3.5" x 5" will fit in most letterboxer's<br>
logbooks.  If you have something larger, you can just mention it in your<br>
clues if you'd like.<br>

Well I just wanted to say as you get better at carving I would <br>
highly recomend a lighted magnifying glass to carve under. I think <br>
you went to my red dragon's lair box, I had to re-do it (from when <br>
you were there) so I picked a different image with more detail and <br>
it turned out fantastic! I could not believe I actually carved it! <br>
It really lets you do detail work. Well just a thought.<br>

taken me over 2 years just to get to 102 boxes heheheh.<br>

Thanks for the suggestion of the lighted magnifying glass.  I'm sure I'll<br>
get more confident the more stamps I attempt.<br>
