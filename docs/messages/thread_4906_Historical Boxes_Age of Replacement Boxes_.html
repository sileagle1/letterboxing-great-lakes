  them....How disappointing it would be to find out that they have been pulled. But, how <br/>

<br/>
  This recently happened to us out in Arizona. We had clues for a box that we had taken out <br/>
  with us for the last 3 years that required more than a little bit of scramble and some <br/>
  sleuthing to get to. It had been out there for centuries in letterbox years. I can't describe <br/>
  the thrill that it gave us to see that only Pete and Wanda and a few local folks had found it <br/>
  in all those years. It was so much more satisfying to ink our little boots into that log than <br/>
  the hundreds previous. I know the placer is not local, and it is debatable that they were <br/>
  able to maintain it...and it didn't get visitors often enough to keep it's status up to date via <br/>

Leave it to you to throw a riddle out there. <br/>
<br/>
hmmm, I'd say yes and no. How about that?<br/>
<br/>
If the creator, location and clues are the same, it is to me considered a box dating back to 2004.<br/>
<br/>
However, the stamp itself would obviously not be able to be dated back to 2004. <br/>
<br/>
I've found a few boxes. primarily from Pitties &amp; Pastors Wife? where the stamp image is "the same" but new location and new clues... I consider it a new find -- even the "same images" have differences and the second "John Deere Plow" is not the exact same as the first, neither are "Victory" or "We Are Free" which by the way I'm looking forward to finding the 3rd installment someday.<br/>
<br/>
I did find one box that had the same clues and same location but different stamp altogether and I did *not* list that as a new find... I'd already followed the clues and knew where the box was. <br/>
<br/>
Its all schematics and really gets down to splitting hairs.<br/>
<br/>
All this to answer your question, I'd consider it a box dating back to 2004 with a replaced stamp (even if the box is a replacement as well, its still the same location and same clues).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is an interesting question Beetle.  I have considered this, even now as I pack my bag to head out later today and replace the original Hoffmaster SP boxes -- same locations, same clues, but new hand-carved stamps (they were my first boxes, placed before I attempted carving) and new logbooks only because the dampness of the lakeside locations has all taken its toll on the paper and ink -- this is where one truly sees the value of stamping with permanent ink as so many of the entries have faded beyond recognition.<br/>
<br/>
Are these then the same boxes that have been in place for the past 5 years?  I would have to agree with the previous poster -- yes and no.  Depends on the perspective I guess.<br/>
