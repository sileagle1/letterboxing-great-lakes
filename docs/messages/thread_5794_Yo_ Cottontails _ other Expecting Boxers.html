I am half expecting to hear that Mrs. Cottontails is on bedrest at this<br/>
point. I am roughly guessing she is at least 5-6 mos along. I could be<br/>

yet, I understand the need to get as much done before one cannot get <br/>
anything done.  Mr. Cottontails needs to update that blog, heehee!<br/>
<br/>
I think we are mostly unpacked (although not nearly as organized as I <br/>
would like).  It has not yet been a year since we moved, but I went on <br/>
bedrest (no warning) a couple of months after we moved.  So you can <br/>
imagine....I have no idea where things are if I did not unpack them and <br/>
put them away.  Someday, someday.<br/>
<br/>
However - our Letterboxing backpack is in the van ready to go, lol!  We <br/>
have figured out our little town is prime target area for planting (I <br/>
think 1 box out here!!) and we have some ideas for Mr. CatHerder to <br/>
carve for us. I am not allowed to handle sharp things in our family, <br/>
lol!  Well - I can, but at times, it has not been very pretty...hence, <br/>
it is simply easier to let Mr. CatHerders handle the sharp things in the <br/>
house.<br/>
