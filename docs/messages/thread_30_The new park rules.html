&gt; I understand some of the concerns of the DNR -- in particular spur <br/>
&gt; trails and damage to sensitive areas, and also their current <br/>
funding <br/>
&gt; situation.  However, I question that this latest policy is the <br/>
right <br/>
&gt; approach to solving either of those problems.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have to agree with Richard's comment that spur trails develop <br/>
&gt; whenever trails are used with any degree of frequency with or <br/>
without <br/>
&gt; letterboxing -- just an interesting looking tree can cause a path <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; be worn off the main trail.  We have the good fortune in the Upper <br/>
&gt; Midwest of letting the land recooperate during the off season.  <br/>
&gt; Whatever spur trails formed during the summer generally are no <br/>
longer <br/>
&gt; apparent once the snow melts the following spring.  Further in West <br/>
&gt; Michigan, many of the State Park hiking trails are sand, in which <br/>
&gt; spur trails are all but washed away during the next good rainstorm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the funding situation...  it is politics.  Perhaps the State <br/>
&gt; Parks do need to look for ways to increase their revenue, but this <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; not an effective way to do that.  And that is where I think <br/>
ignorance <br/>
&gt; comes in -- they really have no idea what this hobby is about and <br/>
&gt; think just slapping down a fee is going to generate dollars.  Quite <br/>
&gt; to the contrary, I think it will just send people elsewhere and <br/>
&gt; actually decrease their revenue -- sure not enough to close down <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; parks or anything, but with the situation they are in, I would <br/>
think <br/>
&gt; that every little bit counts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We will have to wait and see what happens.  But I would echo the <br/>
&gt; feeling at the geocaching board -- I'm not moving my boxes until <br/>
&gt; somebody contacts me and tells me I have to.<br/>
