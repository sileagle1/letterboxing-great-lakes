creation of social, or "spur" trails. <br/>
<br/>
The people at the MICHIGAN dept of Parks &amp; Rec do live in this state <br/>
don't they? I mean, they are aware that SNOW makes it impossible to <br/>
use the parks year round, right? Who the heck wants to go to all the <br/>
trouble of finding the perfect place to plant a box, and write up <br/>
the clues only to have to go move it again in a couple of months? <br/>
Seems like people would stop planting boxes with such a high <br/>
nuisance factor and then nobody will be looking for them  where is <br/>
your revenue plan then?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;The Parks &amp; Rec agency has been mandated to both provide <br/>
recreation areas, and also be good stewards of the land. <br/>
<br/>
Good stewards  snowmobiles and camping. Yea, real low impact on the <br/>
land. Compared to those activities boxing and caching are such low <br/>
impact it's not funny. I guess it comes down to numbers. There are <br/>
more of them (campers, etc) so they get the leeway when these <br/>
stewards are doing their duty and "providing recreation areas" and <br/>
those of us who are few in number get it when it comes to the  <br/>
being "good stewards of the land" part of their duty.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Park &amp; Rec bureau has further been mandated by the State of<br/>
Michigan to be entirely self-supporting!<br/>
<br/>
Or what? What happens if the State Parks are NOT able to be self-<br/>
supporting? Do they plan to sell the parks to the highest bidder? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;So the short of it -- still the $35 fee per placement, but that is<br/>
now good for a 1 year placement, although you still need to<br/>
relocate the box every 3 months.<br/>
<br/>
So if you do comply and move your boxes and post new clues, then <br/>
what? Who wants to have the same stamp in their logbook 50 times? <br/>
Just because it's in a new spot doesn't mean people want that image <br/>
again, maybe they'd rather go find a box that they don't already <br/>
have an image from.<br/>
<br/>
This new policy stinks. I was really looking forward to doing all <br/>
the boxes at the lakeshore state parks starting from Muskegon and <br/>
going north this summer! PLEASE DON'T TAKE YOUR BOXES OUT UNLESS <br/>
THEY MAKE YOU!!!!!!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I understand some of the concerns of the DNR -- in particular spur <br/>
trails and damage to sensitive areas, and also their current funding <br/>
situation.  However, I question that this latest policy is the right <br/>
approach to solving either of those problems.<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with Richard's comment that spur trails develop <br/>
whenever trails are used with any degree of frequency with or without <br/>
letterboxing -- just an interesting looking tree can cause a path to <br/>
be worn off the main trail.  We have the good fortune in the Upper <br/>
Midwest of letting the land recooperate during the off season.  <br/>
Whatever spur trails formed during the summer generally are no longer <br/>
apparent once the snow melts the following spring.  Further in West <br/>
Michigan, many of the State Park hiking trails are sand, in which <br/>
spur trails are all but washed away during the next good rainstorm.<br/>
<br/>
As for the funding situation...  it is politics.  Perhaps the State <br/>
Parks do need to look for ways to increase their revenue, but this is <br/>
not an effective way to do that.  And that is where I think ignorance <br/>
comes in -- they really have no idea what this hobby is about and <br/>
think just slapping down a fee is going to generate dollars.  Quite <br/>
to the contrary, I think it will just send people elsewhere and <br/>
actually decrease their revenue -- sure not enough to close down the <br/>
parks or anything, but with the situation they are in, I would think <br/>
that every little bit counts.<br/>
<br/>
We will have to wait and see what happens.  But I would echo the <br/>
feeling at the geocaching board -- I'm not moving my boxes until <br/>
somebody contacts me and tells me I have to.<br/>
