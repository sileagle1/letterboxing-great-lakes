Okay, as I'm sure you've read here and elsewhere, in this game there <br/>
are "no rules".<br/>
That said, here's some history:<br/>
In the late Winter/early Spring of '03, SpringChick floated the idea <br/>
of a Michigan letterbox gathering. Since get togethers were much <br/>
rarer in those days, interest from boxers outside the state quickly <br/>
surfaced. So an event was planned and many came from far and wide. <br/>
Our neighbors in Wisconsin, lead by the intrepid Dragon, offered to <br/>
host an event in '04. The successful "Cooler by the Lake" (McHenry, <br/>
IL) Gathering took place in June. Organization for The Great <br/>
Lakes '05 Gathering (something like "Mo' boxing in Motown"? -- help <br/>
me, Team Rabbit and Delirium) was assumed by dedicated SE Michigan <br/>
folks -- the aformentioned Delirium and Team Rabbit.<br/>
<br/>
So that's the status as I know it.<br/>
Of course, we've since learned that Delirium has had to beg off her <br/>
commitment due to family priorities. <br/>
<br/>
That's a long answer to the question. A short version is that to my <br/>
knowledge there are no plans for a Michigan event prior to the Great <br/>
Lakes Gathering which will be held next Spring/early summer.<br/>
<br/>
There are informal get togethers of course as boxers coordinate <br/>
schedules with others to meet for meals, coffee, etc.<br/>
<br/>
To get an idea of how things have changed, it appears that perhaps <br/>
300 people may show up for the Monster Mash in the East.<br/>

informal get-togethers that azobox mentioned? Doesn't have to be a <br/>
full-blown Gathering with classes and all.<br/>
<br/>
There seem to be quite a few boxers in our area of West Mich and <br/>
many boxes available too. <br/>
<br/>
I'd be interested in coming to a little one-day gathering, as long <br/>
as it doesn't conflict with any of the wedding prep stuff we have <br/>
going on for my daughter, Enders Angel.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
But if someone were to organize another Michigan gathering before the spring one, like, say, *before* December 22nd, then I'm sure letterboxers all over the Great Lake state would rejoice.  I'll even give you a theme to get things started..."Freezing our butts for 'boxing".  Color schemes come with a consulting fee.<br/>

Depending on the scope of the venture, this is not to be taken <br/>
lightly.<br/>
see Silent Doug's excellent article about Planning an Event.<br/>

Doodle aka Diane (who, with Deedle, probably wouldn't be able to make it anyway because we can't even make it to the Ohio gathering this month because our schedules are so crazy right now, but we've got the 2005 GLK gathering inked in permanent marker on the schedule so we can make it to that one!)<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

&gt; El Cajador and I were just reading the description of the Michigan <br/>
&gt; gathering in about two weeks.  We're both ready to buy plane tickets so <br/>
&gt; that we can come.  We certainly wish it was possible.  It sounds like <br/>
&gt; GREAT fun!  Enjoy the County Fair.  We'll be eager to see the <br/>
&gt; pictures.  Someone eat a bratwurst for us!<br/>
