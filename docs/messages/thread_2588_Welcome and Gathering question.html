<br>
Our big regional Gathering for the Great Lakes area is always the<br>
weekend after Memorial Day.  There was a discussion about this some<br>
time ago. (You can check the message archives to bring you up to speed<br>
on some of what has gone on here) <br>
<br>
If I remember correctly, it was decided to keep the dated as a<br>
permanent thing so it would make things easier for vacation planning.<br>
Some members  are employed where schedules are done by the quarter or<br>
even annually, and of course not everyone works just Mon-Fri so<br>
weekends are an issue when it comes to time off requests.<br>
<br>
Not to worry though, there are often other smaller events held and<br>
Michigan seems to have a history of having those kind of events fairly<br>
regularly. <br>
<br>
Best wishes for a successful race -- though since we have friends in<br>
the race again this year, I can't say I hope you win (LOL) Which class<br>
is the boat you're crewing on participating in? (Oh, alright, I<br>
confess ... what I really want to know is which boat!)<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>

No longer sailing-- with my move west years ago I stopped sailing.   Just go <br>
to watch the races and take pictures-- What boat are you routing  for?  I will <br>
try and get a few flicks at the funish and send them to you, <br>
 <br>
I have been going back for the last few years-- usually for the race-- then  <br>
a week on Bob Lo-- last year a nice driive down the west coast.  This year  I <br>
am heading to Big Bay to stay at the kighthouse B & B -- and then to Bay  City <br>
for the Tall ships.  <br>
 <br>
I can make arrangements to come for the larger gathering-- will just miss  <br>
the race--- but would also like to join in on any MI ones I can.  I am new  at <br>
this but it sure sounds like fun. <br>
 <br>
Found my first two boxes this weekend.  How Thrilling.<br>
