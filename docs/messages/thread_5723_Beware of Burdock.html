Removal Tips: If they are dry and crunchy, break them apart into smaller pieces. Don't try to pull them out of your hair.  Next, use your fingers to slowly remove the individual seeds from your hair.  You might have to wiggle them around while you slowly work them out of very small sections of your hair.

I would have had to cut two large chunks out of my hair.  My hair is shoulder length.  These miserable things were so entangled in my hair....GRRRRR!  There were 2-3 on the right side of my head and about 6 on the let side.  DUH!  The other solution is...don't bend down and stick your head in a burdock plant.  Not a fun day for me.  <br/>

I wasn't hiding or seeking.  I was checking up on one of my boxes that was reported as missing, but I found it safe and sound.  I don't normally stick my head into burdock bushes.  I saw the bush, but when I bent down to find the box, I obviously leaned a bit too close to that bush.  You know how it is...we get near a letterbox and our sense of balance and common sense is out the window.  Even while checking up on my own box, I get a rush sticking my hand into dark places and hoping to find a box.  But....I can stop at anytime.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now...the question that we're all wondering....what is Cowboy Magic?  Never heard of it and where do you get it?  Might be easier to wear a bandana the next time I'm in a woodsy area. <br/>

Absolutely!  I wasn't thinking.  When I go camping, I wear a bandana the entire weekend.  Keeps my head cool, keeps away the ticks, and I'll remember about sticking my head into those burdock bushes next time.  Duh!  I get so excited when approaching a letterbox, even while checking up on one of my own boxes, that I completely loose track of my surroundings.  Those burrs are a real pain!  <br/>

No, I was closer to Chicago.  These burrs are really miserable.  I understand that the person who invented Velcro was actually inspired by the burdock plants.  <br/>

Recently, I met some boxers at the SILO #3 gathering and they were from the Milwaukee area, so I plan to take some weekend time and drive up your direction.  <br/>

Hide some boxes!  I'll look for them when I get up that way.  OK.  <br/>

As EVERYONE knows, velcro was invented by the Vulcans long ago and was introduced on Earth when they crash landed.  They needed money, so they sold the rights to make it to a patent office in PA around 1960 for a couple hundred dollars. <br/>
<br/>
Live long and prosper!<br/>

&gt; No, I was closer to Chicago.  These burrs are really miserable.  I understand that the person who invented Velcro was actually inspired by the burdock plants.  <br/>

&gt; Recently, I met some boxers at the SILO #3 gathering and they were from the Milwaukee area, so I plan to take some weekend time and drive up your direction.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hide some boxes!  I'll look for them when I get up that way.  OK.  <br/>

&gt; You weren't in the suburbs of Milwaukee when you got those, here you??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is one in my husband's hometown where ALL of us got them in our <br/>
&gt; hair a few years ago (Duh!!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am so thrilled with the warm up. I have to dig out the baby backpack <br/>
&gt; and we will be out in the warm and the woods tomorrow (even if we have <br/>
&gt; to wear boots, lol!) - after all, with Letterboxing, we get to cover, <br/>
&gt; PE, science/nature study and a couple of other subjects when we are out <br/>
&gt; there!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Warning: Beware of burdock...those porcupine-like balls that stick to your clothes like Velcro. We've all come in contact with those pesty things. But today, I got them in my hair!!! <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Removal Tips: If they are dry and crunchy, break them apart into smaller pieces. Don't try to pull them out of your hair. Next, use your fingers to slowly remove the individual seeds from your hair. You might have to wiggle them around while you slowly work them out of very small sections of your hair. Of course, this also depends on the length of your hair. Then, comb the last of the remaining crumbs out of your hair. Another reason to wear a hat or bandana while hiking! <br/>
&gt; &gt; So frustrating!!!<br/>
