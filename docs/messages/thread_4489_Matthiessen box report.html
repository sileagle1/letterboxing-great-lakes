<br/>
Last night I was excited to discover a listing on AQ of two new boxes in Utica by Shorty, but then saw they aren't ready yet.  Dang!  So close and yet so far....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, despite no new finds today, I was able to do some maintenance on my three boxes there.  Lil Bit of Flutter 1 has been reported missing for a few months - it is now replaced with a stamp carved from the original image.  Moved ever so slightly from its original hiding place, but the clues are still okay.  Dog in the Water: Hershey's Hike was fine and dandy.  One of the baggies was getting a little worn (and smelled really bad - worse than a wet dog!), so I replaced it.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we headed over to Flutter 2, which I was told was very wet and in need of serious first aid.  Not knowing what to expect, I created an entirely new box - new stamp, new log, new container - before I left home.  Good thing I did, because doofus that I am, I couldn't remember exactly where I hid it!  Most of the foliage has died back, so it shouldn't have been too hard to find, but I couldn't.  It was last found on Sept 23, so maybe it has disappeared since then, but maybe it's still there.  Time will tell if someone finds both of them.<br/>
<br/>
I found a location to put another box in that park, to be titled (appropriately) "Four".  Now I need to come up with an opportunity to get back there.  Maybe since the trees haven't really started  turning yet, I can make a fall colors trip to place it.<br/>
