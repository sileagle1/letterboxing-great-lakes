                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kudos to all who worked on putting together another great event! It was a rousing success, as always! Great boxes, great clues, a great collection of boxers and great food! What more could we ask for? The weather was perfect for boxing, too! (My water bottle was still frozen when I got home at 10 pm!) Many thanks to Azobox, Springchick, Doglvrs, Grandvilla and Mobiusklein for putting together this great day of boxing and comaraderie.<br>
Special thanks to our boxin' buddy for the day, TrailTroll, for putting up with us all day and helping us find all the boxes and many 'regular' boxes, too! We really enjoyed her company and swapping boxing stories with her.<br>
It was great to see everyone again and to spend time sharing stories with all of you. <br>
Already eagerly anticipating the next event!<br>

trails....large enough park to do boxes in smaller groups but small <br>

unfamiliar boxers along the way.  Thanks to Azobox, Springchick, <br>
Doglvrs, Grandvilla and Mobiusklein for putting it all together and <br>
sharing some of their older stamps with us!  It was wonderful to meet <br>
all the MI boxers whose names we know but who we had not yet met. <br>

<br>
The park size was great; we spent a good part of the morning by <br>
ourselves and avoiding muggles.  We loved hooking up with Team Rabbit <br>
for a couple boxes and then a ton of people in search of K1P2.<br>
<br>
The stamps with all of the history was AWESOME!  We feel very privileged <br>
  to have gotten these images and the history that goes with them.<br>
<br>
My only wish is that we could have stayed longer or arrived earlier. <br>
Hopefully next year!  I can't wait to learn what is being planned for <br>
next year!!!<br>
