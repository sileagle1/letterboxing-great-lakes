                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all.  Wanted to let you all know that we made a bad decision about placing a box.  We placed a box at a local business in Door Co, WI in the parking lot.  We had not asked permission to do so.  I have received a complaint tonight from the owners of the establishment and they have destroyed the box.  They were apparently very upset, as they live next door and discovered 2 boxers in the parking lot after hours (they close at 6pm).  So anyway, if you have clues already to Hands On Art in Door County, the box is not available and the owners do not wish to be disturbed.  Please do not attempt.  I have deleted the clues on both AQ and LbNA.  I would never dream of placing a box in someone's establishment without permission, but I thought a parking lot would be OK.  I made a bad call, especially considering the rural location.  Sorry to everyone!  It was just such a cool place, I wanted to introduce you all to it.<br>
