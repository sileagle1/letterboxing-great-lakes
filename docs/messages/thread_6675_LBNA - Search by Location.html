<br/>
1.  If you like to search for boxes by location, the LBNA site has added this feature.  To activate it, go to Member Services, then near the bottom (under "Set your preferences"), you need to ENABLE the Search By Location feature.<br/>
<br/>
2.  If you are looking at an individual box clue, there is an icon (circle with dot in the center) next to the LbNA# on the clue page.<br/>
If you click the icon, it will show you a list of other nearby letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to periodically check to see what changes may have been made to the site, go to the LBNA home page, then scroll WAY DOWN to the bottom and click on "Change Log".<br/>
