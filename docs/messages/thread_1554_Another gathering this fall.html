Katy and I had so much fun at the gathering that we decided it was time we had one of our own down here.  So, on September 17 we will be hosting the "Mining for Boxes" gathering at Kickapoo State Park near Danville, IL.  The park is maybe 3 hours from the Chicago area and about 2 hours from Indianapolis.  You can RSVP on Atlas Quest (prefered) or email me or Katy directly.  Even if you can't make it to the gathering, we are looking for people to make event boxes.<br/>
