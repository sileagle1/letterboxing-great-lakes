The First Official Minnesota Gathering will be on May 19th-21st. I like those dates That will work out good for me. I hope it works well for everyone else. Also, My Trail Name Is GOOBLE GOBBLE. It's kind of funny how everyone thinks it's gobble gobble. Not A big deal though, just thought I'd let you know. <br/>
<br/>
 How's this for a small world Fungus Woman, you're Fish Out Of Water 8 box by the M.O.A. was my first find ever! (I think that was the name of the box). I hope to see you and everyone else from Friday May 19th To Sunday May 21 in Minnesota!!!<br/>
