Illinois Prairie Path or the Great Western Trail in northeast IL.   <br/><br/>Saturday,
 April 25th, is the date this year when members of the communities that 
these paths run thru will be getting together &amp; cleaning up litter 
along those trails.  <br/><br/>I know there are a few letterboxes along 
these trails -- I've gone ahead &amp; picked mine up temporarily just to
 be safe -- &amp; I know there are also a lot of geocaches out there 
too.  Some of the caches we've found accidentally just in cleaning up 
the area of the Prairie Path near my Dad's house on our own.  So if I've
 run into them accidentally when walking along picking up litter, 
they'll possibly get found Saturday.  Some people might check them out 
&amp; not toss them into the trash, but other folks won't even look at 
them.  They'll just pick 'em up &amp; toss 'em into a trash bag.  So I 
just wanted to warn folks.</div><div class="" id="yui_3_16_0_1_1429826100044_3141"><br/></div></div></body></html>
