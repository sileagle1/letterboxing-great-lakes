Someone contacted me about whether they could do an "Alice in Wonderland" theme for an event (they noticed I had hosted one) and I said SURE!, I don't own the idea.  I notice someone is planning a Pirate theme event this year and there was a Pirate event last year.  There is also a fairly large monster/Halloween theme being planned again on the east coast.<br/>
However is you do want to avoid having someone do something similar, they'd have to know it existed.  I do check the LBNA site to be sure I'm not duplicating a box TITLE, but it would be hard to always know if I was duplicating a subject/theme.  Even if I was, if it is 1,000-2,000 miles away, I don't see a problem with it.  <br/>
Monty Python is a pretty popular subject, so I think it is very likely there will be more boxes based on it, and there probably were boxes already in existence somewhere before the "Big project".  Based on all the M.P. banter on another board, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they were cooking up their own project...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For the most part I would agree with what WI Hiker has said, particularly when it comes to duplicating a box idea as a postal.  I also consider postal letterboxing to be a completely different hobby -- not that it is bad, just that it is not the same thing and really has grown to the point where it has taken on a life of its own, far beyond the definition of traditional letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
With letterboxing as prolific and widespread as it is, duplication is inevitable.  There was a time 3-4 years ago, particularly when all clues were still being posted to the big list, that it was easier to have a handle on what was happening across the country in letterboxing.  Not only did you see all of the clues as they were posted, but it was not uncommon for people to share ideas they were working on, etc.  But with the way letterboxing has grown by leaps and bounds and monster jumps, it would be nearly impossible to keep tabs on every new box or series that is posted, even sometimes within your own area of the country.  Along with this there is more of a disconnect with other letterboxers across the country, and thus a lesser degree of respect for other people's ideas.  Very rarely do we see a person post about an idea they are working on, because invariably if/when they do, somebody comes along and swoops up the idea for themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
But having said that, I would agree that nobody owns an idea and it is to be expected that if you had a brainstorm that manifested itself into an awesome box or series, somebody else will eventually have a similar idea.<br/>
<br/>
As a box planter, I do generally try to find out if my newest brainstorm has already been done by browsing the clue sites and/or reading the lists, etc.  But this is mostly because I want my series to be original, not because I feel that it is sacred ground if somebody has already done it.  If I find that there is already something similar out there, I may decide to scrap it or I may decide that my execution is unique and do it anyway.  I have written to other planters and asked them if they would be okay with me doing something similar, but if it is in a completely different area of the country and the other box/series is not brand new, I may not even do that.  Depends on the situation.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started letterboxing, one of the first series I did was a Michigan lighthouses series.  I planted a couple right away and while I was busy carving up stamps for the next few, somebody else planted similarly-themed boxes in the exact locations I was targeting.  As I already had the stamps carved and had visions of doing this multi-box lighthouse series, I was disturbed.  But in reality, how could they have known I was doing this?  I ended up writing to this person and asking how they felt about me planting my boxes anyway, as long as I kept the location somewhat removed from their boxes.  She was okay with that and I did plant my boxes.  Little did I know that the whole idea was doomed as these stamps would routinely disappear, no matter how often I replaced them.  I used to joke that there were people out there collecting SpringChick lighthouse stamps, just waiting for me to post a new one.  Anyway, the point is that nobody owns an idea or a location and if you letterbox long enough you will at one time or another find yourself on both sides of the issue.<br/>
<br/>
All this being said, there are a few things that I think a person should try to avoid out of respect or courtesy...<br/>
<br/>
-  Planting a similarly-themed box in the same/very close location that another boxer has a letterbox is not cool<br/>
-  Scooping another person's idea before they have executed it is stooping pretty low (assuming you were aware they were doing it)<br/>
-  Duplicating another person's complete idea is less than creative -- planting a duplicate Circus Train series is one thing, but executing it in the exact way the previous planter did, i.e. clue style, series make-up, etc.is a bit much<br/>
-  Planting a box in very near proximity to another person's box that gives away something about their box -- for instance if their clues are mystery clues and your nearby box solves the mystery elements of the first box (this is tough though because sometimes, particularly when a box is a mystery, it is conceivable that you may not know you are coming behind and doing this)<br/>
<br/>
But hey, when it comes down to it -- nobody owns a letterbox idea or location and we all have different opinions on what is or is not respectful and courteous.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I pretty much agree with what Trekkie Gal, WI Hiker and SpringChick <br/>
are saying.  I just want to point out a few things about the ring in <br/>
question since I happen to be a participant in it:  <br/>
<br/>
It's a Monty Python themed ring.  That means ANYTHING Monty Python.  <br/>
Granted, lots of people chose to do images based on the Holy Grail.  <br/>
But there's also the Arguement Clinic, the Ministry of Silly Walks, <br/>
and my own Spanish Inquisition stamp in addition to a few others.<br/>
<br/>
Out of the 20 or so people in the ring, only three of us are in the <br/>
Great Lakes area.  I wouldn't be too worried about competing Holy <br/>
Grail boxes in the Great Lakes area.  <br/>
<br/>
When my stamp returns, I'll probably plant it out in the wild.  <br/>
Why?  It's a stamp of Terry Gilliam (not to give too much away for <br/>
those other two of you in the ring) and since he was born in <br/>
Minneapolis, it's appropriate.  Now if I had chosen a Holy Grail <br/>
themed stamp, I would definitely check and make sure I wasn't going <br/>
to be stepping on any toes before I planted it since I know about <br/>
the Grail project.  <br/>
<br/>
Overlapping ideas is inevitable, especially with popular things like <br/>
Monty Python, the circus and lighthouses. I don't worry about it <br/>
because the chance of it being carried out in the exact same way is <br/>
pretty slim.  And if it is?  Then I can see being upset and <br/>
complaining.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the most part I would agree with what WI Hiker has said, <br/>
particularly when it comes to duplicating a box idea as a postal.  I <br/>
also consider postal letterboxing to be a completely different <br/>
hobby -- not that it is bad, just that it is not the same thing and <br/>
really has grown to the point where it has taken on a life of its <br/>
own, far beyond the definition of traditional letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With letterboxing as prolific and widespread as it is, duplication <br/>
is inevitable.  There was a time 3-4 years ago, particularly when <br/>
all clues were still being posted to the big list, that it was <br/>
easier to have a handle on what was happening across the country in <br/>
letterboxing.  Not only did you see all of the clues as they were <br/>
posted, but it was not uncommon for people to share ideas they were <br/>
working on, etc.  But with the way letterboxing has grown by leaps <br/>
and bounds and monster jumps, it would be nearly impossible to keep <br/>
tabs on every new box or series that is posted, even sometimes <br/>
within your own area of the country.  Along with this there is more <br/>
of a disconnect with other letterboxers across the country, and thus <br/>
a lesser degree of respect for other people's ideas.  Very rarely do <br/>
we see a person post about an idea they are working on, because <br/>
invariably if/when they do, somebody comes along and swoops up the <br/>
idea for themselves.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But having said that, I would agree that nobody owns an idea and <br/>
it is to be expected that if you had a brainstorm that manifested <br/>
itself into an awesome box or series, somebody else will eventually <br/>
have a similar idea.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a box planter, I do generally try to find out if my newest <br/>
brainstorm has already been done by browsing the clue sites and/or <br/>
reading the lists, etc.  But this is mostly because I want my series <br/>
to be original, not because I feel that it is sacred ground if <br/>
somebody has already done it.  If I find that there is already <br/>
something similar out there, I may decide to scrap it or I may <br/>
decide that my execution is unique and do it anyway.  I have written <br/>
to other planters and asked them if they would be okay with me doing <br/>
something similar, but if it is in a completely different area of <br/>
the country and the other box/series is not brand new, I may not <br/>
even do that.  Depends on the situation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I first started letterboxing, one of the first series I did <br/>
was a Michigan lighthouses series.  I planted a couple right away <br/>
and while I was busy carving up stamps for the next few, somebody <br/>
else planted similarly-themed boxes in the exact locations I was <br/>
targeting.  As I already had the stamps carved and had visions of <br/>
doing this multi-box lighthouse series, I was disturbed.  But in <br/>
reality, how could they have known I was doing this?  I ended up <br/>
writing to this person and asking how they felt about me planting my <br/>
boxes anyway, as long as I kept the location somewhat removed from <br/>
their boxes.  She was okay with that and I did plant my boxes.  <br/>
Little did I know that the whole idea was doomed as these stamps <br/>
would routinely disappear, no matter how often I replaced them.  I <br/>
used to joke that there were people out there collecting SpringChick <br/>
lighthouse stamps, just waiting for me to post a new one.  Anyway, <br/>
the point is that nobody owns an idea or a location and if you <br/>
letterbox long enough you will at one time or another find yourself <br/>
on both sides of the issue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All this being said, there are a few things that I think a person <br/>
should try to avoid out of respect or courtesy...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -  Planting a similarly-themed box in the same/very close location <br/>
that another boxer has a letterbox is not cool<br/>
&gt; -  Scooping another person's idea before they have executed it is <br/>
stooping pretty low (assuming you were aware they were doing it)<br/>
&gt; -  Duplicating another person's complete idea is less than <br/>
creative -- planting a duplicate Circus Train series is one thing, <br/>
but executing it in the exact way the previous planter did, i.e. <br/>
clue style, series make-up, etc.is a bit much<br/>
&gt; -  Planting a box in very near proximity to another person's box <br/>
that gives away something about their box -- for instance if their <br/>
clues are mystery clues and your nearby box solves the mystery <br/>
elements of the first box (this is tough though because sometimes, <br/>
particularly when a box is a mystery, it is conceivable that you may <br/>
not know you are coming behind and doing this)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But hey, when it comes down to it -- nobody owns a letterbox idea <br/>
or location and we all have different opinions on what is or is not <br/>
respectful and courteous.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I think it is very likely there will be duplication of <br/>
ideas/themes all across the county. Many people don't have a chance <br/>
to travel that much, so if a subject was only in one state/region, <br/>
that would prevent them from ever having fun with that theme. <br/>
Someone contacted me about whether they could do an "Alice in <br/>
Wonderland" theme for an event (they noticed I had hosted one) and I <br/>
said SURE!, I don't own the idea. I notice someone is planning a <br/>
Pirate theme event this year and there was a Pirate event last year. <br/>
There is also a fairly large monster/Halloween theme being planned <br/>
again on the east coast.<br/>
&gt;   However is you do want to avoid having someone do something <br/>
similar, they'd have to know it existed. I do check the LBNA site to <br/>
be sure I'm not duplicating a box TITLE, but it would be hard to <br/>
always know if I was duplicating a subject/theme. Even if I was, if <br/>
it is 1,000-2,000 miles away, I don't see a problem with it. <br/>
&gt;   Monty Python is a pretty popular subject, so I think it is very <br/>
likely there will be more boxes based on it, and there probably were <br/>
boxes already in existence somewhere before the "Big project". Based <br/>
on all the M.P. banter on another board, I wouldn't be surprised at <br/>
all if they were cooking up their own project...<br/>
&gt;   Wisconsin Hiker<br/>
&gt;   P.S. I wouldn't even consider stamps exchanged as "stamp art by <br/>
mail" any real "competition". In my opinion it is a totally <br/>
different hobby, not really letterboxing. (No offense to those of <br/>
you who like to send each other stamps!)<br/>

to 2 years and the Grail boxes still weren't/aren't listed on the major<br/>
sites, right?  And this postal letterbox is likely going around the country,<br/>
right?  It's not restricted to the Great Lakes area.<br/>
<br/>
I think if people really wanted to "protect" the Grail idea, as least in a<br/>
hopeful if not ethical or legal sense, it should have all been done much<br/>
much quicker so that a much higher level of publicity could get out there<br/>
faster to the general public. (Heck, I even offered to help do some boxes if<br/>
it would help speed things up and was turned down.)  I think some have even<br/>
gone missing already and have had to be redone already, no?  And is the<br/>
series really yet out there to the general public?  Sometimes ya just have<br/>
to get movin' on somethin'. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But even if the boxes were placed the day after the idea was conceived, can<br/>
one really plagiarize an "idea" in this situation?  Take the War in Iraq and<br/>
all the books and movies being currently written and produced taking<br/>
monetary advantage of what's going on overseas.   The writers are all<br/>
playing with the same theme but they're not plagiarizing each other.  Or how<br/>
much has been written on migrant farm workers.  But they're not plagiarizing<br/>
Steinbeck.  Van Gogh painted several canvases of sunflowers.  Should that<br/>
mean nobody else should paint sunflowers?   Things like circus trains and<br/>
Monty Python are pretty common themes in general.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if the creator(s) of the Postal Letterbox are taking the<br/>
stamp images from LbGLK's series and outright copying them for the postal<br/>
box, that, to me, would be wrong wrong wrong.  So would be actually copying<br/>
any fancy logbooks, if there are any.    Obviously, since it's a postal,<br/>
they can't copy the clues verbatim.<br/>
<br/>
And with your Circus Train boxes.   I don't do postals at all, but why<br/>
shouldn't someone else be able to do something along the same lines in their<br/>
own way?<br/>
<br/>
The geocaching analogy, in my opinion, doesn't fit.  Taking the same spot<br/>
and removing your letterbox or stealing your stamp, that's one thing.  But a<br/>
postal box isn't taking your same spot, nor are they stealing the physical<br/>
materials that you placed at that spot.<br/>

There have been lots of great thoughts and points made here about about <br/>
duplication of themes and boxes, but your ford analogy was the best one <br/>
of all!!  How true, how true!!!  Well said!  :)<br/>

&gt; If an idea was set in stone, with no one allowed to change it to their<br/>
&gt; own individuality, we'd all be driving Fords. But as it is, we have<br/>
&gt; the best example of same........but different. Each person puts their<br/>
&gt; unique thumb print on a stamp, or the clues written. As letterboxers<br/>
&gt; we all look at places, events, movies and books with the same<br/>
&gt; objective, how can I turn this into a letterbox. But its the<br/>
&gt; individual that makes the idea/box unique. Personally I like finding<br/>
&gt; boxes of the same theme. Take boxes placed at old grist mills. I've<br/>
&gt; probably found 4 boxes hid at four different mills. I even placed one<br/>
&gt; myself. But each stamp and experience was very different. I<br/>
&gt; personally enjoy looking at how the same concept can be so unique to<br/>
&gt; reflect the individual doing the box. It shows our diversity in a<br/>
&gt; common hobby! ~The Cats Meow~<br/>
