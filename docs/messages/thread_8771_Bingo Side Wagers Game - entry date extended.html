Wagers 2019</span></b></p><p><b><span>(thanks

Wager coordinators!)</span></b></p><p><b><span> </span></b></p><p><b><i><span>Side
Wager: </span></i></b><i><span>A wager made beyond the normal rules of
the game. A hedge bet.</span></i></p><p><i><span> </span></i></p><p><span>If you'd
again like to add more excitement to the letterboxing bingo game (or another
way to win), enter the Side Wagers Game. When will AtomicBeans pull the term
that finally and completely fills in some player's card? Pick the right day,
and you WIN! Again, this is the Big Game here, not the interim games. The date
will be determined by the claiming of a successful full card by a BINGO player
(and its certification by AtomicBeans).</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>To enter
the side wagers game, decide what day you think the first full card winner will
be crowned.<span>  </span>Send me your guesses.</span></p><p><span>Your
guess must be submitted before January 10, 2019.</span></p><p><span>Email:  baliddletoo@yahoo.com</span></p><p><br/><span><span class="ygrps-yiv-1968127381ydp23e473e9MsoHyperlink"><a href="mailto:baliddletoo@..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></span></span></p><p><span>PLEASE DO
NOT POST TO THE YAHOO BOARD</span></p><p><span>In the
subject line, put "</span><b><span>Bingo Side Wagers Game</span></b><span>"</span></p><p><span>In the
body, please indicate:</span></p><p><span><span>1.<span>  
</span></span></span><span>the date you have selected as a first choice,</span></p><p><span><span>2.<span>

multiple people in your household use the same trail name, you can submit one
entry for each person.<span>  </span>Please
differentiate the entries to clarify each entry.<span>  </span>For example:<span> 
</span>Team Rabbit: Brown Rabbit; Team Rabbit: Rainy Day Rabbit; or Hartx6: Becki
and Hartx6: Matt, etc.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>If two or
more players choose the same date as a 1<sup>st</sup> choice, the first entry
is given the date and the 2<sup>nd</sup> choice backup date will be assigned to
anyone else who chooses the initial date. <span>  </span>If both of a player’s choices have already
been selected by other entrants, they will be assigned a date close to their 1<sup>st</sup>
choice.<span>  </span>This will be done by moving
earlier *or* later until the next available date is found.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>After you
submit your entry, I will email you with confirmation of your officially
selected date.<span>  </span>Each person will be
assigned one date only.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Once the bingo
game gets underway, you will see me posting some mysterious messages.<span>  </span>These messages are clues to who is currently
in the running for side wagers fame.<span>  </span>If
you figure out the messages, please do not post answers to the message board in
order to keep the mystery alive for others.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>The
winner of the side wagers game is the person who is closest to the day (without
going over) the Bingo Game ends or hits the date on the dot. <span> </span>For example: If you choose February 15th, and
someone else chooses the 12th, but the game ends on the 13<sup>th</sup>… <span> </span>you will win.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>The
winner gets fame, glory and bragging rights.<span> 
</span>As a bonus, a prize will be awarded to the lucky winner!</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Finally,
no purchase necessary to enter, and you do not need to be a player in</span></p><p><span>the BINGO
game to participate. <span> </span>One entry per
person. <span> </span>Neither BaliWho, nor her aloof
calico sidekick Chia, assume any responsibility for the order of words chosen
by Atomic Beans! AtomicBeans has no responsibility or knowledge of the dates
selected in the sidewagers game. Send questions to BaliWho.</span></p></span></div></div></div><p><span><br/></span></p></body></html>
