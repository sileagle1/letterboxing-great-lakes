Stamps" or "Other," they are listed under those types of finds.  If they <br>
are listed as normal boxes, they are logged as such.  For example, many <br>
of the boxes at SILO were listed as "Event Stamps" or FW's "Remembering <br>
Boxer: HH or Thumbs Up" is listed as an "Other."  These logged finds <br>
don't go into your listed PFX count. <br>

These are some of the most detailed stamps and I wouldn't want to forget them by just filing them away in the books and not "recalling" them by who carved, by what they represented, etc.  <br>

  Guess we all need to realize we bring who we are to our hobbies, our homes, our jobs and our relationships. I am here mostly to have fun!!<br>

  Would it be possible to post a list of the TESS stamps and who carved <br>
  them here? I stamped a bunch of them at the St. Nick gathering, but <br>
  the writing on the backs of them was pretty worn, so I couldn't tell <br>
  who did most of them.<br>
<br>
  Thanks,<br>
