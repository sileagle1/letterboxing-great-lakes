We will miss you at the NE Iowa Gathering . . . I had high hopes of meeting you :-)<br/>
<br/>
The only other gathering in Iowa, at this time (that I know of) is the Wild Goose Chase gathering on Oct. 6th. Just around the corner, but you are more than welcome :-)<br/>
<br/>
The Letterboxing Wedding will be in Chicago on Nov. 10th, if you are close to the Twin Cities that would be a quick (sorta) drive down I-94.<br/>
