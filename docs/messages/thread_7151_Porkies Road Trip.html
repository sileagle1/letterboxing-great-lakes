                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent a letterboxing weekend at Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park two weeks ago.  If you stop by the PMWSP Visitor's Center, talk to the Park Rangers at the info desk.  They have a ready made packet containing clues to all of the letterboxes located in the state park.  One of the rangers is a letterboxer (Sunshine).  They are really excited about letterboxing in the park.<br>
<br>
Spending a day and a half letterboxing, we had time to find 17 of the 20 letterboxes that were on our list.  The views in the park are awesome!  We especially liked the Union Mine Interpretive Trail and the Lake of the Clouds.  A nearby box that we highly recommend is "Grandma's Favorite Game" in White Pine.<br>
<br>
As for the bugs, some locations were bearable, while others were downright miserable.  I typically am not fond of using mosquito repellant, but it was necessary.  We also wore hats and, even though the weather was steamy, chose long-sleeved shirts on some of the trails due to the hordes of ravenous mosquitos and horse flies.<br>
<br>
Have fun in the UP!<br>

I can recommend Hancock Park, plus Minoquip in Minocqua.  On the way south, you can look for my Shurtle LB in a rest area just south of Coloma.<br>
<br>
SZS Rocks - thanks for the kind words about Grandma's Favorite Game!  I've met Sunshine also - she was thrilled to see my logbook.  I just saw that the park rangers have new boxes this year - way cool!<br>
<br>
SpringChick - if you're going out to the Porkies again this fall, let me know - I have a yen to go on a road trip!  I could meet you, get the new boxes - and maybe visit some relatives.  :)<br>
