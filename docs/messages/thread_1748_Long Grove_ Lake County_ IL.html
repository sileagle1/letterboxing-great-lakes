                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just rec'd a report from a boxer that they couldn't find one of my two <br>
adopted Long Grove boxes -- "Bridges of Lake County".  Box #1 is the <br>
one possibly missing.  Just a  heads-up if anyone planned to go looking <br>
for them in the near future.<br>
<br>
Will get up there next Sunday to check.  I'm sure hoping that maybe it <br>
was just put back in the wrong place.  That stamp spells out "Long <br>
Grove."  Pippi carved the original and I'm not looking forward to <br>
having to carve it to replace it.  I hate doing letters.  If I had to <br>
replace a box, I'd much rather carve Box #2, the covered bridge. <br>
