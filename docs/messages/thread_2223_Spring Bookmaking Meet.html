                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay it is official!  The details are worked out for this exciting <br>
event!  Thanks to those who provided feedback and offered to lead <br>
workshops, and of course to Speedsquare for providing the meeting <br>
place!<br>
<br>
The first Great Lakes Bookmaking Meet will be held on March 18, 2006 <br>
in Clear Lake, IN.  This is in the extreme NE corner of Indiana, <br>
just off the tollway before the Ohio state line.  This is a private <br>
residence that was generously offered for our use for this event.  <br>
Specific directions will be given to attendees once they are <br>
registered.  While it would be impossible to find a location <br>
convenient to everyone in our region, this location is centrally <br>
located among the majority of those who had expressed interest in <br>
the bookmaking event.<br>
<br>
This is an all-day event consisting of 4 hands-on bookmaking <br>
techniques, including:<br>
<br>
Stab Binding (by Acorn)<br>
Buttonhole Stitch Binding (by Boot Prints)<br>
Single Needle Coptic Stitch (by SpringChick)<br>
Intro to Altered Books (by Doglvrs)<br>
<br>
There will also be a Bookmaking 101 session in the morning to get <br>
everyone familiar with terms and general information.<br>
<br>
To keep class size manageable, it is necessary to limit <br>
participation to 10 attendees.  Through February 5, 2006, sign-up <br>
will be open only to members of the Great Lakes Yahoo! group on a <br>
first-come, first-served basis.  After that date, sign-up will be <br>
open to all letterboxers until seats are filled.<br>
<br>
There is a cost of $10 per attendee for the day.  This covers the <br>
cost of project specific materials.  <br>
<br>
To register, please e-mail springchick@letterbox-mi.com.  As seats <br>
are limited, please sign up only if you are sure of your commitment <br>
to attend for the full day.<br>

techniques!  There are still some spots open for the bookmaking meet <br>
being held on Saturday, March 18, 2006 in Clear Lake, Indiana.<br>
<br>
This is an all-day event consisting of four workshops teaching various <br>
bookmaking/bookbinding techniques suitable for use with letterbox <br>
logbooks.  This is geared for beginners, so even if you have no <br>
previous experience with any type of bookbinding, we'd love to have <br>
you join us.<br>
<br>
There will be an event stamp and a couple of theme-related <br>
letterboxes.  Lunch is potluck.  For additional information and <br>
