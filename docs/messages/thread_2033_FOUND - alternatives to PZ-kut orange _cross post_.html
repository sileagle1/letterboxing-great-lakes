I'm posting this here as well; forgive the cross-post.<br/>
<br/>
After the folks at PZ-Kut ran into quality problems with their<br/>
supplier, they were forced to switch to a new formula, which is<br/>
orange. The carvers on Team Bindlestiff do not care for the new<br/>
PZ-Kut material. We find the waxy consistency difficult to work with.<br/>
<br/>
So, while mourning the loss of our favorite carving material, we began<br/>
to search for alternatives and replacements to the old PZ-Kut.<br/>
<br/>
We came up with five products we think will be acceptable and have<br/>
created a file listing the products with price comparisons.<br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing is that the prices for these carving materials<br/>
range from 2 cent per square inch all the way up to 38 cents per<br/>
square inch.<br/>
