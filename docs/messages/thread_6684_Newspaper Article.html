Best advice that was once shared with me was this....<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
When a newspaper article causes newbies to rush out and find letterboxes, sometimes without reading all the do's and don'ts, when they log their 'finds' and contact us, it's up to us to welcome them to the hobby and coach them. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
All in all, it's a good article.  Just thought people in northern Illinois might be interested in reading the article and knowing that there might be a sudden influx of newbies in the area. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Remember, we were all newbies at one time.  <br>

WH,<br>

Ironically, that is the same wording that caught my eye.  After reading the paragraphs about geocaching and "trinkets you can take..." the article explains letterboxing and how "avid letterboxers collect stamps from all over the world..."  True, we don't collect the stamps; only the stamp images.  I doubt the author of the article is a die-hard letterboxer.  I would have preferred for her to ask people to create and hide more letterboxes for us to find.  LOL!  <br>

Yeah, there really wasn't much info in the actual article - basically just a<br>
pointer to the websites. However I wish they would have said collect stamp<br>
IMAGES, rather than just stamps. Some may mistakenly think the stamp can be<br>
removed. I personally doubt this article result in much activity.<br>

Hmm, this could go very good or very bad! <br>
We could have new family-or singles boxing and becoming amazing carvers and<br>
planters.<br>
Or we could have a lot of newber newbie letterboxers that will find and not<br>
put back right-and tell lots of people-and boxes go missing(I hope not!)<br>
<br>
But we will see! <br>

Thanks WH for finding this on line article. First attempt, I was unable to<br>
use the link, then I saw that the last 5 letters of the link dropped down to<br>
the second line and that explained the problem I was having. This should<br>
work now. Beetle<br>

The secret is out there for the public to read. There is a full page<br>
newspaper article about geocaching, letterboxing, and hunting alphabet<br>
painted rocks(?) The article is appearing in the Pioneer Press Newspapers in<br>
suburbs in Lake County, Illinois. This chain of newspapers may also print<br>
this feature article in their Cook County suburban papers too. The author<br>
lists both www.letteboxing.org and www.atlastquest.com (SIC)- spelled<br>
incorrectly. OOPS! She made a mistake. Has anyone else seen the article?<br>
Your thoughts...<br>
