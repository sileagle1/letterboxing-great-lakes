<br>
One thing I have concluded about my letterboxing during the past year -- I<br>
spent way too much time doing box maintenance.  ...  I've considered<br>
retiring a bunch of boxes, but have a hard time choosing because I look at<br>
the list and think, "yes, but people really liked that box..."  I'm not sure<br>
what the solution is, but something has to give...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll chime in with Dragon and Leapin Lizards that using the "contact the<br>
placer" feature to report on a box status is SO helpful!  We really<br>
appreciate everyone that does this for our boxes, even those boxes that are<br>
nearby.  We keep a list on the computer of all the boxes we've placed and<br>
have a column for "last checked/found".  Every time we hear from someone we<br>
update the date for that box.  This gives us a list (all in one place) of<br>
our boxes and dates.  When we see that a box hasn't been reported on in a<br>
while, then we'll go out and check when we have a chance.  By relying on<br>
"the kindness of strangers" to keep us updated, we have more time to place<br>
new boxes since we're not always worrying about the existing boxes.  [Side<br>
note: We've even had someone contact us BEFORE they went to find one of our<br>
adopted boxes (Hawaii).  They volunteered to do any maintenance if we knew<br>
if it needed something.  LBers are great!]<br>
<br>
We keep notes on box status when we're doing a major LB roadtrip so we can<br>
send an accurate report to all the placers when we return.  (If we're LBing<br>
for a week, there's no way we could remember "what was what" without taking<br>
notes!)<br>
<br>
Since we really like to take our seat/packs with us on most LB excursions,<br>
we have plenty of room to carry along extra baggies, blank logbooks, napkins<br>
for drying out boxes, duct tape wrapped around a pencil and a spare<br>
container.  We have put these "emergency repair" items to use on several<br>
occasions.<br>
<br>
We're glad some of the original placers of the early WI boxes didn't retire<br>
them even when they moved from  the area and apparently are no longer<br>
involved in letterboxing.  It was exciting to find the very first box placed<br>
in WI!<br>
