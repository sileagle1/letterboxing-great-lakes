<br>
Well, yeah, that idea has been done several times. (We've done it <br>
ourselves.)  But I don't think that ought to stop you from going <br>
through with the series. After all, "there's nothing new under the <br>
sun", right?  Even if the idea isn't exactly unique, your stamp will <br>
be because you made it.  And, let us not lose sight of the simple <br>
fact that puzzle boxes RULE, and we could always use more of them! <br>

Although it's been done before, I don't think there are many like that, and I think it's really great idea.  To me it's kind of a bonus, esp. if I don't know that the stamps work that way before starting out.<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>

Subject: New series idea. What do you think?<br>
I thought of an idea for a new series. I am not sure if this has been<br>
done before, so I am asking everyone what they think. The series will<br>
contain four micro boxes. Each microbox will contain one piece of a<br>
stamp. When you find all four you will have the complete stamp.<br>
