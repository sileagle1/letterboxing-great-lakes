                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to say thank you to m&8X and eagleEyes for hosting this <br>
event.  They were the most gracious hosts and we enjoyed ourselves very <br>
much.  Since this was the first letterboxing gathering we've been able <br>
to attend we really enjoyed getting to meet some fellow boxer.  I think <br>
I can safely speak for everyone who attended that a great time was had <br>
by all.  They put alot of thought and organization into the event!  <br>
Thanks again!!!! You did a great job!  The Cat's Meow<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Granny Butterfly, my son asked me on the way home if I knew who you <br>
were.  He was the very tired/bored looking teenager in the livingroom <br>
you were talking too :-)  I told him your trail name and showed him <br>
your beautiful stamp.  He said you we very nice lady and he was just <br>
wondering.  I think having him come to the event made him enjoy <br>
letterboxing a little bit more.  Sometimes he will come with us, but <br>
not normally.  But getting see some of the folks whose boxes we've <br>
hunted, and getting to talk to some of the people, made it more <br>
personal to him.  He really liked the poker game.  So I just wanted <br>
to let you know there is a teenage out there who thinks you're very <br>
sweet.   <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know how difficult being a teenager and putting up with the habits of a Mom, Dad, or a Granny can be and I do so appreciate your comments.  If you see us in Chillicothe in October there may be an 8 year old with us, A. Skywalker.  <br>
   <br>
  He was very excited about the event but had to spend time with Daddy and sometimes Granny just needs a break too.   <br>
   <br>
  Thank you for your kind words.  <br>
