But remember, even if you don't win the 10-pack, the other games (6-pack, + and 4 corners) depend on strategic placement, not quantity.  It is still early in the game and you are all in the running for fabulous prizes!<br>

The only way I could be close to a 6 pack or 10 pack is if all the words you've called that I "thought I picked" were actually ON my bingo sheet.  Did an imp come erase/replace them?  Did I pick them in prior years?  Who knows, but I just checked the words for this week and haven't had any new additions to my sparse sheet despite my momentary excitement at seeing certain words.<br>
<br>
I added you to my allowable peeps list, so hopefully you won't be spamified anymore.  I miss having the words in my email each day.<br>
