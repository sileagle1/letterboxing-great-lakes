I attended a meet planned by the Chicago Orienteering Club a couple years ago.  They are the perfect hosts!  This event is well thought out and planned. They usually draw a large attendance and teams are sent out a couple minutes apart.  I'd recommend this event to anyone interested in learning more about orienteering and learning to find the trail markers.  However, finding hand carved stamps is sooooo much more satisfying.  <br/>

As for mischievous little itches.....they DO need to be scratched.  Don't let a little itch hold you back.<br/>

  The Chicago Orienteering Club is hosting an event at the Silver <br/>
  Springs State Park near Plano and Yorkville, IL on the 12th from 7-<br/>
  11pm. It might not be the best time to go looking for boxes (the park <br/>
  closes at dusk anyway), but it does give me a mischievious little <br/>
  itch...;)<br/>
