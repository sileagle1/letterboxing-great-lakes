now to have his own AQ account, which we set up this morning.  So, if <br/>
you've ever exchanged with him, you can now log it.  Or just send him a <br/>
message -- he would be soooo excited to get mail!  He messaged a couple <br/>
of you this morning and checked back every 2 minutes to see if anyone <br/>
had answered.  Then he decided to send a message to himself to get <br/>
immediate results.  Hee hee hee<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who signed in to his 3 impromptu boxes yesterday.  He <br/>
carved them on his way to the gathering in the car and was chomping at <br/>
the bit to see who all found them at the end of the day (and in the <br/>
middle of the day...and 2 minutes after he'd hidden them...and 4 <br/>
minutes after he'd hidden them....you get the idea.)<br/>
<br/>
We had a BLAST yesterday!  We echo the thanks to DRAGON and to all else <br/>
who helped out in any way!!!  <br/>
