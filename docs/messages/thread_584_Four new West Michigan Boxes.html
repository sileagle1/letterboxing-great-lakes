<br>
Thought I'd pass along word that I've planted four new boxes in West <br>
Michigan (Muskegon and Newaygo).  The clues for two of them (Music in <br>
Motion) are up on the main website.  Eventually this will be a four <br>
stamp series.  I've also hidden two boxes at the Coolbough Natural <br>
Area just northeast of Newaygo.  Eventually this will be a six box <br>
series, and the clues for these first two boxes will be up soon <br>
(today or tomorrow).  Also, keep a look out for a Mystery Box that <br>
will be out soon (I need to hide it yet, and I'm really excited about <br>
this stamp).  It wasn't going to be a mystery box - I decided to take <br>
SpringChick's TOTW advice and try to plant one.  It should be out <br>
within the week.<br>
<br>
Peace, and happy searching!<br>
