                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, I'll throw this out here now -- because I need advice.<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on hosting another gathering!! As mentioned before, the rain and wind can be scheduled closer to date, however, due to all the red tape I need to get working on the tornados now!!<br/>
<br/>
The gathering will be sometime next year. I was thinking October, however, I'm open to having it during the summer to for more folks could make it.<br/>
<br/>
It will be at Black Hawk State Park in Rock Island, IL with the theme, "Between Two Rivers" as Rock Island is nestled between the Mississippi &amp; Rock Rivers. The stamp images will be anything related to either of the rivers -- Mark Twain, Great River Road, Black Hawk, etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
Black Hawk State Park won an award a few years ago for being one of the "7 wonders of Illinois" and has about 6.5 miles of hiking trails. I have much time to iron out details and will keep you all informed.<br/>
<br/>
Here is where I need advice, the park only has a couple smallish shelters -- not large enough for 30 - 50 folks let alone if more sign up.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of renting out the lodge. Here are the rental fees;<br/>
<br/>
Friday - Sunday      Rental Fee: $700 - $150 damage deposit<br/>
Weekday 9 am - 5 pm    Rental Fee: $150 - $100 damage deposit<br/>
<br/>
SO, are weekday gatherings well attended? I've never been to one. If I have it in October, that's in the middle of the school year and might drop attendance . . . if I have it in the summer attendance should be good.<br/>
<br/>
I will be putting a fee on this gathering to help with the costs. The lodge would really make the gathering special, but that's a whole lotta money.<br/>
<br/>
So, here is what I'm asking . . . week day or weekend? I really can't please everyone as far as the when is concerned. I'm well aware of the school year and how that might affect attendance and I may slide the gathering back to the summer months for "optimal" attendance.<br/>
<br/>
If I rent out the lodge, it would be rather empty with only 50 - 75 people there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any words of encouragement/advice.<br/>
<br/>
Weekend or Week day??????<br/>

Oct, Nov and Dec usually have the lowest number of tornados per month ... so you will have to work harder to create a tornado!  <grin>!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is a tough one.  On the one hand, Flying Dragon and I both much prefer hiking in October but an October gathering would definitely fare much better on a weekend.  I would also prefer a weekend gathering since Rock Island is 3-4 hours from us and we would have to take two days off to attend a weekday gathering or else go to work exhausted the next day.  A weekday gathering would stand a much better chance during the summer, but it's not as great a time for hiking.  But a $550 difference in rental fees is significant!<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did notice on the website, the weekday rental is only from 9am-5pm and the website states that week night rentals vary depending on the organization/activity...so if we did a weekday gathering we would have to be packed up and cleared out by 5pm or I imagine there would be an additional rental fee for staying later.  Depending on what that evening rental fee is, it might make the difference between a weekday rental for more than 8 hours not significantly different from a weekend rental.  <br/>

If it is in the summer, weekday or weekend wouldn't matter for me other than the specific date.  Just a thought - make use of the longest day of the year, June 21st - so we have optimal time to box.  In the fall, for me it would have to be a weekend in early October for me to have any chance of attending.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that the date of the GL gathering in MI might affect your choice of a summer date for this.  Still no word on any takers for the GL gather in MI next year?  (Personally, I think it would be neat to have it in the UP! Yah dah heh?)<br/>

I am curious as to what kind of lodge would rent for such a high price?  I <br/>
had looked into the Atwood Park Lodge here in this area for a possible <br/>
event, but their rental fee was $200/day.  That includes dorm rooms <br/>
(sleeping bunks, etc.), a huge dining room with cafeteria-style kitchen, <br/>
deck, rest rooms, etc.<br/>

&gt; So, I'll throw this out here now -- because I need advice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm planning on hosting another gathering!! As mentioned before, the<br/>
&gt; rain and wind can be scheduled closer to date, however, due to all<br/>
&gt; the  red tape I need to get working on the tornados now!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The gathering will be sometime next year. I was thinking October,<br/>
&gt; however, I'm open to having it during the summer to for more folks<br/>
&gt; could  make it.<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
<br/>
Due to the distance from our home, I'm pretty sure that our family <br/>
wouldn't be able to attend a mid-week event.  The only possibility would <br/>
be if the event happened to coincide with a week-long school break.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I will be putting a fee on this gathering to help with the costs. The<br/>
&gt; lodge would really make the gathering special, but that's a whole<br/>
&gt; lotta  money.<br/>
<br/>
Fees to participate are fine.  We chip in to help with such costs at <br/>
other events. Setting the amount and/or collecting money up front is <br/>
fine with us.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So, here is what I'm asking . . . week day or weekend? I really can't<br/>
&gt; please everyone as far as the when is concerned. I'm well aware of<br/>
&gt; the school year and how that might affect attendance and I may slide<br/>
&gt; the  gathering back to the summer months for "optimal" attendance.<br/>
<br/>
For a weekend event, we'd prefer a holiday or school vacation weekend to <br/>
help with the travel time.  Unfortunately our school hasn't yet posted <br/>
the school calendar yet but it usually includes:<br/>
* 3 day weekend in October (sometimes coincides with Columbus Day weekend)<br/>
* winter break (late February)<br/>
* spring break (usually week before or after Easter -- Apr 24, 2011)<br/>
* Memorial Day weekend (4 days)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any words of encouragement/advice.<br/>
&gt; ...<br/>
Obviously, don't schedule the event based on my family's schedule since <br/>
the distance is definitely a factor for us (even though I've been very <br/>
anxious to do some boxing in Illinois).  We will come some day (event or <br/>
not).<br/>

<br/>
p.s. Be sure to invite boxers from MO and IA (who may not be on this list).<br/>
