                    <div class="plaintext-content">I keep checking the forecast and there is still a 40% chance of showers and thunderstorms for Saturday.  That is NOT the type of water we want!!  (We're bringing a small canopy tent &amp; lawn chairs just in case.)<br/>
<br/>
However the forecast also keeps showing warmer and warmer temperatures - currently mid-80s.  So as Atom118 suggested, it would be a very good idea to bring several LARGE water bottles to take with you out on the trails.<br/>

afternoon/evening thunderstorms on Friday and 50% showers on Saturday, <br/>
although the morning forecast shows sun.  Hopefully that storm brewing <br/>
out northwest of us will disintegrate or else decide to stay north of <br/>
us!  Plus, I'm also hoping that since we're NOT camping on this trip <br/>
that the rain will hold off since it seemed to rain about 80-90% of the <br/>
previous times we've gone camping!<br/>
