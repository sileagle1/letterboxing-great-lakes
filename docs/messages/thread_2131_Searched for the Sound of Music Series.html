                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all.  My husband and I spent the day today in the Cuyahoga area <br/>
searching for boxes.  One of the series we tried was the sound of <br/>
music.  Out of the 8 boxes we only found 1, and we found a camo lid to <br/>
one but no box.  :-(  Has anyone else recently looked for these and not <br/>
able to locate them?  I was wondering if our clue reading skills have <br/>
gotten rusty.  I will say, the location was absolutely beautiful and we <br/>
did enjoy the nice weather we had for January.  :-)  What a great way <br/>
to start the New Year!!! On New Years Eve we planted 3 new boxes in our <br/>
area, and on New Years day, we hunted!!!!! 2006 IS OFF TO A GREAT <br/>
START :-).  We hope everyone has a wonderful year, and good luck to all <br/>
in bingo!!!!!!   <br/>

and the tree was cut down...<br/>
