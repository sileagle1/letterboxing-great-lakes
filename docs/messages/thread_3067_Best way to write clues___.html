There's a great explanation in the FAQs on letterboxing.org  here... <br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html#007  Read the "what do I <br>
need to hide" and "writing clues" topics<br>
<br>
Basically, it ways to find a place you want to hide the box first, <br>
then work backwards in writing the clues.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What I do is come up with a basic story line (if that's your thing) <br>
then I find a spot I like. I walk through the trails that lead me to <br>
the spot that I wanted to hide the box and write down anything I see <br>
that looks like it would fit in my storyline as a clue (i.e. 5 trunk <br>
tree is a 5 headed hydra). I write all the major clues down in order <br>
from begining to end in a book (compass readings, signpost numbers, <br>
ect.) and then go over them at home. I make up a storyline with the <br>
clues and when I'm done I go back out to the location and make sure <br>
they are right. I hope that helps <br>

make the box.  Then when placing the box, I walk along writing only the<br>
physical clues including description of the area (ie field on left, tall<br>

Then at home I get creative using MS Word. Do a spell check an then cut and<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do it a couple of different ways, depending on the location.  If it is a park with a well-developed network of hiking trails, I don't usually scout the area first (especially if I have been there before and am familiar with the general nature of the park), rather I create my box/series and then head over there, often walking several trails in the park before I choose the hiding spot.  In this case, I usually find the perfect spot (one can hope) and then write the clues backward as I head back to the trailhead.  I make general notes for clues -- paces, degrees, identifying landmarks, etc. and then work them into a story, puzzle, etc. once I am home with the information.  One thing I look for when choosing *the perfect hiding spot* is some kind of an identifying landmark nearby.  It is all good to find the perfect spot along the trail where there are no stand-out trees or benches or turns in the trail, etc.  It is very difficult to get people to the right spot -- this is when you end up with frustrated seekers trying to figure out *which* two-trunked maple tree in the sea of two-trunked oak trees you are actually referencing.  One thing to be careful of when writing your clues backward from the hiding spot back to the trailhead -- everything is backward and your left is your right.  I also find it helpful to number the clue notes as I write them.<br>
<br>
If I want to plant a letterbox at a specific place, often in the case of an historical landmark, interesting spot, etc. but there is not really a trail system there, I usually try to scout the location first and find a couple of hiding spots before I even begin creating the stamp/box.  This enables me to see what I am working with -- is the only hiding spot a very tiny place that would require a microbox?  If I can't find a good hiding spot at the location I want to put the box, I will sometimes require the user to go there and obtain information (i.e. numbers from a placard, etc.) and then send them to a nearby park where there are trails and places more appropriate for hiding a letterbox. I will then work in the information that they were required to gather at the original location as part of the clue.<br>
<br>
The type of clues I end up writing is driven by the location, the box theme and my mood at the time -- most often a combination of all of the above.<br>
