that I get to be the first to post a report!<br/>
<br/>
Awesome!<br/>
<br/>
(That is both a comment on the fac theat I am first to post a report<br/>
and my report itself.)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man for organizing a fantastic<br/>
gathering.  Thank you to all who brought food for a delicious lunch. <br/>
Thank you to all who created boxes (unfortunately, I didn't have time<br/>
to finda as many as I would have liked).  Thank you to all who stamped<br/>
into The Blue Dog and made a donation.  I will be purchasing three<br/>
more Walmart gift cards and sending them to a GS council in Houston<br/>
which is serving a large number of displaced Scouts from Louisiana to<br/>
help them get their lives on track.  Thank you to all who exchanged<br/>
images with me.  Thank you to all who are still reading this missive!<br/>
<br/>
The best thing though was that Mr. FungusWoman, AKA "I'd rather be<br/>
fishing" had a great time too.  He enjoyed himself (unfortunately for<br/>
him, he just returned last night aroung 9 pm, after a 14 hour car<br/>
ride, from a week long fishing trip, so he was exhausted).  He said he<br/>
was glad he went with me "to see what those letterboxing people are<br/>
like", to which he added, "you're  right, they are really nice!"  I<br/>
refrained from saying "I told you so!"  If we didn't have to get home<br/>
because of Papillon's homecoming dance tonight, we certainly would<br/>
have stayed longer.<br/>
<br/>
So now I await the reports of how the rest of the day went!<br/>
