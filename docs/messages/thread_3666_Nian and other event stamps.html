Speaking of event stamps, we have some fabulous guest event stamps coming.  Well, not completely "Guest", since two are coming from our very own Scoutdogs!  Woo hoo...wait until you see "G is for Gathering".  I had the pleasure of receiving it as a postal.  My logbook is still a little damp from the drooling I did while stamping it in (okay, even I admit that's more than just a little gross!).  Seriously, this is one heck of a stamp.  I'm working on a few other leads as well.   <br>

Like Beetle keeps reminding me, "I thought you were the one who kept saying, 'Keep it simple'!"<br>

PS:  I'll bring some nametag stickers...you can stamp them with the appropriate animal stamp.<br>
 <br>
Cmoon and Kookaburra can't make it, but they're still on the RSVP list.  So that's two less....<br>
