Just back from our second trip, so here's my take:<br>
<br>
It's rainy all year round on Dartmoor (except <br>
when it's snowy), so you'll need solid rain gear <br>
from head to toe to fingertips, and will probably <br>
want to avoid the winter season altogether. The <br>
wind atop the tors can be brutal -- I have a <br>
photo atop Brat Tor of Clueless's long tresses <br>
sticking literally straight up and out -- so make <br>
sure you're prepared for high winds, as well, or <br>
you'll likely loose your hat. The weather changes <br>
rapidly and a sunny day can turn into pea soup <br>
with alarming speed, so dress in layers and <br>
always be prepared for any kind of weather. An <br>
Ordnance Survey OL-28 map is essential, along <br>
with a compass (and the knowledge of how to use <br>
it). Almost all the UK letterboxers we went out <br>
hiking with had GPS units, since once the mist <br>
rolls in, a map and compass isn't going to do you <br>
much good. If you step into a bog, it could <br>
easily reach past your knees, so waterproof <br>
boots, gaiters, and rain pants should be worn <br>
much of the time. A trekking pole will help you <br>
poke under rocks, test for boggy ground, find <br>
"plugged" boxes, and (potentially) alert you to <br>
any adders hiding in the rocks. Leave any <br>
aversion to scat at home, since sheep, cattle, <br>
and ponies roam freely on the moors and leave <br>
evidence behind in quantities that you might have <br>
thought improbable. Gloves are good for turning <br>
over rocks or for reaching into gorse; the thorns <br>
on the gorse bushes are nasty and can tear <br>
through heavy nylon. There's no real bus or train <br>
service that will get you anywhere near most of <br>
Dartmoor, so you'll have to fly into London, hire <br>
a car, and drive 3-4 hours to Dartmoor (or, <br>
alternatively, do the same in Bristol, which is <br>
about 2 hours from the southern end of the <br>
moors). Brush up on the UK driving regulations <br>
and signage schemes and be sure to specifically <br>
reserve an automatic transmission car, since the <br>
standard is standard and driving a stick while <br>
shifting with your left hand and sitting in the <br>
right side of the car and keeping on the left <br>
side of the road might be a challenge <br>
(apparently, I had enough trouble staying on the <br>
correct side of the road while driving an <br>
automatic transmission minivan). Pack lightly, <br>
too, since cars are much smaller in the UK and <br>
two large suitcases might not fit in the boot of <br>
an English auto. Give up now on any chance of <br>
visiting on a budget -- the pound to dollar <br>
exchange rate means that everything is about <br>
twice as much as it would be in the states after <br>
you convert from pounds sterling to dollars <br>
American. Gas is presently about 0.97/litre, and <br>
even though vehicles may get 40 mpg, fuel is <br>
still pricey, which you'll notice when you fill <br>
up your tank for 55 and convert that amount to <br>
dollars. A pub lunch might typically be 8.95  -- <br>
before you add on the cost of a pint -- so <br>
dropping more than $20 on lunch per person isn't <br>
uncommon. You won't find any American-style <br>
motels (thank God) -- accommodations are <br>
typically English country hotels or inns (similar <br>
to what we would call  "bed and breakfast") and <br>
generally include breakfast. Self-catering <br>
cottages are also available, usually for rent by <br>
the week only. With a self-catering option, you'd <br>
do your own grocery shopping and cooking in a <br>
room or cottage with an equipped kitchen. There <br>
are some larger towns just outside the boundary <br>
of the Dartmoor National Park (which, unlike <br>
national parks in the US, is largely <br>
privately-owned), and most of the villages inside <br>
Dartmoor have lodgings of one kind or another. <br>
Princetown/Two Bridges is pretty close to the <br>
center of Dartmoor; Plymouth is the closest city <br>
and is to the southwest of Dartmoor. Okehampton <br>
is a large town and a good base for exploring the <br>
north of Dartmoor; while Ivybridge is the same at <br>
the southern end and Tavistock on the western <br>
end. Dartmoor is about 368 square miles, so you <br>
can get from one end to the other without too <br>
much trouble, though it may take time since the <br>
roads inside Dartmoor are almost all 2-lanes <br>
(except when they're just 1 lane). ATMs are <br>
common and US credit cards are accepted with no <br>
trouble at most establishments, but it's always <br>
good to check first since some establishments do accept only cash.<br>
<br>
As far as letterboxing goes, you could buy a copy <br>
of the catalogue and use your siting compass and <br>
map to triangulate the location of the <br>
letterboxes contained therein, or you could <br>
simply scavenge. Every Dartmoor letterboxer will <br>
give you a different answer about which tors are <br>
best on which to scavenge, and sometimes they've <br>
been known to lead newbies astray, so pick a <br>
popular one and start hiking up the track and <br>
look under every rock on the way up and see what <br>
you find. Letterboxes are commonly hidden in pill <br>
pots, and are either commercially-made or <br>
store-bought (with the rare hand-cut stamp). If <br>
you can get your hands on a charity walk <br>
cluesheet, you might have better luck that way, <br>
but you'll have to come up with some way to remit <br>
the 5 or so to the charity sponsoring the walk <br>
in order to get the clues. Letterboxes are <br>
*never* hidden in or near any stone wall, ancient <br>
ruin, or remains of a structure, so check the OS <br>
map first to be sure that the pile of stones that <br>
you're picking through isn't of archaeological <br>
importance. Letterboxers are not typically hidden <br>
in the actual tors, though this rule is not <br>
observed so thoroughly in practice. The northern <br>
end of the moor is used as an artillery range by <br>
the army, so check the firing schedule in advance <br>
before planning a trip to the north. The <br>
boundaries of the firing range are marked on the <br>
OS map, and red flags are flown on the perimeter <br>
on days when firing is underway. Certainly don't <br>
touch any mortars that you might come across in <br>
this area; they've been known to sink in the bogs <br>
and then resurface later after several <br>
freezing/thawing cycles, and some are found that <br>
still have live rounds. Dartmoor letterboxers are <br>
exceptionally secretive and don't believe in <br>
letting anyone know what they're doing. They <br>
won't approach you -- and in fact will most <br>
likely avoid you -- and they believe that all <br>
letterboxers should adhere to the code of <br>
secrecy. Box thievery is rampant and a concern to <br>
many, and many remember that Dartmoor <br>
letterboxing was banned at one time, so there is <br>
a tradition of trying to keep the activity "under <br>
the radar." In any event, I'd suggest that you <br>
don't obsess with the letterboxing to the point <br>
where you miss enjoying the beauty of the moors <br>
and tors. Humans have been on Dartmoor for 8,000 <br>
years in rugged and inspiring terrain, and there <br>
is history everywhere you turn, from the leats <br>
and clapper bridges, to the roundhouses and <br>
blowing houses, to the stone crosses and boundary <br>
stones. You'll make the most of your trip if you <br>
take the time to appreciate the timelessness of Dartmoor.<br>
