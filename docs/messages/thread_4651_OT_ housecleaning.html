But nothing beats OldShoe's habit of cleaning *before* the cleaning lady came... yup, when I first met him he had a cleaning woman who came once a week and the night before he would run around and clean the house.  Perplexed, I asked why he was cleaning if his cleaning woman was coming the following day and he answered that if he did the easy stuff then she could concentrate on the harder stuff...  okay, so that's how it works.  Didn't take long after I was there and the cleaning lady took a leave to have a baby and he figured we didn't need her back.  But, now that I am the cleaning woman, do you think he runs around and cleans before me?  Are you kidding?  No way!<br/>

Definitely raising my hand.  In fact, I should stop raising my hand <br/>
(and reading all these posts) because we have our last Christmas get-<br/>
together of the year this Saturday and I should be cleaning!!  I just <br/>
cleaned for Christmas Day and it is already a mess.  It doesn't help <br/>
that our old house is a dust magnet.  You dust one day, and you can <br/>
write your name in the new dust the very next day--ugh!<br/>
<br/>
The other cleaning frenzy I get (which drives my husband crazy) is <br/>
right before we go out of town on vacation.  I have this compulsion <br/>
to get the house all straightened up before we leave--as if packing <br/>
isn't stressful enough.  I've never quite decided if I do this <br/>
because I want to come home to a straightened up house -- or because <br/>
I don't want my house to look a mess in case we're in an accident and <br/>
someone needs to come in to our house (kind of like that "put clean <br/>
underwear on in case you're in an accident" mentality.)<br/>

Oh, I had to laugh when I read this part!! I do the exact same thing <br/>
when we go out of town. My husband always laughs at me while I run <br/>
around cleaning, stressing myself out. I too like to come home to a <br/>
clean house after vacation. Although I've never thought about <br/>
the "accident" angle...now I have one more thing to worry about!! LOL <br/>
