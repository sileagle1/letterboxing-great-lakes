discovered<br>
letterboxing thanks to the article in Family Fun magazine this past summer &<br>
thanks to Cindi of the DUCA family when she mentioned on another board that<br>
they were going to Michigan to letterbox over the weekend.  (Thanks,<br>
Cindi!!)<br>

We have actually gone out boxing twice.  The first one we found was<br>
Armadillo Jo's Seven Pillars of the Mississenewa.  (I look forward to find <br>
her Angry Woodchuck too, as I know the general area he's in!!)  The kids <br>
were not real enthusiastic about going again, but Mom wanted to!  We did 2 <br>
series a short time ago, and I bribed the kids to cooperate to find the <br>
boxes themselves - with Mom & Dad tagging along.  We found our first HH! <br>
They enjoyed this hunt a little more, and now we HAVE to go out again.<br>

We are starting to think about carving our signature stamp.  How does one <br>
decide?  (I'm not very creative!)  And do most groups or families have one <br>
sig or one per person?<br>

Robin, I have my signature stamp and I made one for my daughter (2 yrs. old) who's always with me, but her only contribution is allowing me to carry her and playing with my stamping markers. My thinking was that some day she'd be excited about stamping herself in or seeing where she'd been. So, I suggest having the kids make/buy/make for them a stamp so they're excited about it. Just a thought! Although I did see an awesome "Copse of Trees" stamp that had a name written above every tree for each family member that I thought was perfect. What ever works for you!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We do all of our boxing together. Ok I did do one box by myself but that means that Jeff dropped me off at one end of the walkway and we worked thru the clues via phone until I found the box and stamped in and then we chatted until I walked to the other end of the walkway. So it was by myself right?? We would have done it together but the kids were sleeping and we weren't really sure where we could legally park??<br>
   <br>
  Anyways we have one sig stamp for the family. When Nick got old enough to want to stamp in on occasion he wanted his initial so I just went and bought an 'N' stamp. He decided for Claire's birthday she should get her own stamp too so that's what he got her. Neither of them have gotten to the point where they want to stamp into every box but they carry their own backpack/fanny packs with their own logbooks, ink dot and stamp. I think Nick gets more excitment writing his name in the logbook when I let him. :)<br>
   <br>
  It's all a personal thing. Do you think you'll be going as a group all the time?? If you do then maybe one stamp would be best. Maybe they could all have their own logbooks but not stamps that way they could write or take pictures of whatever they want to do in it.<br>

We have both.  When all 4 of us are boxing together, then we stamp in <br>
with our family stamp (which is also the stamp we use when placing <br>
boxes, since that is a family affair).  We each have our individual <br>
stamps as well, which we stamp in with when we aren't all there.<br>
<br>
It is nice to have the family stamp, because it really shortens the <br>
time spent stamping in.  Plus it doesn't take up as much room in a <br>
logbook.  <br>
