                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a great day!  First, the dogs and I went to Kennekuk Cove County Park to scout some new locations Tatsu's series (I'm still working on it, I don't even have images to carve yet).  We hiked the Lookout Point trail (7/10 mi) and the Lake Mingo trail (7.3 mi).  While on the L. Mingo (everytime I saw one of those signs I wanted to take chalk and draw an F before the L. and an A after it!) trail, about 2.5 mi in, I saw two otters playing in the water!  I tried to take a picture, but all I had was my phone and the sun was behind them, so I'm pretty sure it didn't turn out at all.  So now I'm looking for otter images for another stamp.<br/>
<br/>
After hiking 8+ miles at Kennekuk (Lookout Point may only have been 7/10 mi on the trail, but we did a lot of off trail exploring), we stopped at Kickapoo on the way home (might as well, the road to the interstate runs right through Kickapoo).  I replaced the contents of the dog box of the Aina series as well as the recarved "NA" box (in a slightly different location, hopefully it won't go missing again as this is the third time I've had to carve that stamp) and the bonus box.  The only snafoo is that the bonus box isn't quite where the clues say it is (it's in the other end of the log) and I forgot to put the part of the bonus clues that is supposed to be in the fourth box back into the box.  Oh well, with a few good stamp and hiding ideas for Kennekuk I'm sure I'll be back in the area soon and can take care of that then.  We didn't see quite as much wildlife at Kickapoo as usual.  Maybe it was because we didn't actually travel the trail as we usually do, or maybe it was<br/>
 because it was 3pm...or maybe the large group of noisy children (who all though the dogs were "scary" when they were sitting on the other side of the road by the car...and Tatsu had to confirm it by growling at them because they were yelling and acting like idiots and freaked him out when we had to pass them on the trail).  But on the drive to the parking area we did see a young buck with velvet antlers standing on the side of the road (how could we miss him, the car in front of us had stopped to take his picture!).<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a good day for hiking and doing letterbox maintenance in spite of the heat.<br/>
