First things first ... It has been suggested that the Cherokee <br/>
Resturant would be a good meeting place for our 11am start time.  <br/>
However, I need to know how many people to expect before I can speak <br/>
with them about accomodating our group. So, if you plan to attend, <br/>
please send me an email at bindlestiff underscore boxer at yahoo dot <br/>
com (bindlestiff_boxer)<br/>
<br/>
Note: Red Fox and Wulfies, I don't have an email address for you, <br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
Next ... have you checked out the list of boxes that are available <br/>
in the Muskegon, Whitehall/Montague area on letterboxing.org? We <br/>
need to make some decisions on where we want to go boxing. As <br/>
SpringChick has placed most of the boxes in our target area, I've <br/>
emailed her and gotten some suggestions.  She highly recommends that <br/>
Sandy Seasons and Muskegon Beach boxes in Lake Harbor Park, so this <br/>
seems like a good place to start. (Added bonus for me ... I haven't <br/>
gotten any of these boxes yet!)<br/>
<br/>
So, knowing we're trying to end up in Montague for our <br/>
dinner/campfire around 6 or 7pm ... what other boxes does everyone <br/>
want to chase down? Start making your lists and checking them twice.<br/>
<br/>
Also .... I know there are some Mystery Boxes that fall within the <br/>
scope of our route.  I've placed or gotten one or two of them, and <br/>
have been niggling around with the clues for a couple more.  How <br/>
about checking out the Mystery Box list, too?  Hate to walk right <br/>
past a box just because we didn't know it was there!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of dinner .... The long-range forcast for Saturday is <br/>
partly sunny, 30 percent chance of scattered rain, high around 50 <br/>
degrees, over night lows in the 30's. My vote goes for dinner at a <br/>
resturant ... Based on that forecast, I think I'll want to sit down <br/>
and warm up a little while by then. Bindle Bum has offered to start <br/>
the campfire for us if we give him a call when we get to the <br/>
resturant.<br/>
<br/>
I have the event stamp carved, if anyone wants to take an advance <br/>
peek, it's in the photo section of my yahoo group.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend was too nice not to go sailing ... so I still haven't <br/>
unpacked the banquet tables that I had planned on setting up <br/>
with 'stations' for paper cutting, coil binding, and stamp <br/>
mounting.  LOL ... for that matter, I still haven't found some of <br/>
the items I'm going to need for the stations!  Not to worry, I'll <br/>
keep working on it.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
These boxes are fine with us...we haven't found to many in Muskegon, so majority rules is perfect!  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't mind if we were able to add in "East meets West" - I think the kids would love to see that "one big thing"...<br/>
<br/>
Other than that - we're game for just about anything.  Just need directions to the meeting place, and we're all set!<br/>
<br/>
Excellent stamp!  Looking forward to it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

Sure wish we could attend this gathering - sounds like it's going to <br/>
be lots of fun.....but our daughter is getting married the following <br/>
weekend and there's too much last minute stuff to check on.  We <br/>
haven't done any boxing in the Muskegon area yet - in fact, I've <br/>
never even been to the area having only lived in western MI for a <br/>
couple years and most of our travelling weekends are back to the <br/>
Detroit area to see family.  Hope you guys have great <br/>
weather .......and I'll just hope that another small gathering comes <br/>
up in the future!<br/>
