realize I'm getting too emotional over letterboxing....Maybe I need <br/>
letterboxing therapy!<br/>
<br/>
I actually had little tears in my eyes thinking how awesome it is <br/>
that our wonderful hobby has grown into a national pastime shared by <br/>
so many.  Heart felt thanks are due to such visionaries as portrayed <br/>
in the video who had the gumption to step out and be a little daring <br/>
and plant those first boxes of Tupperware in the great outdoors!  <br/>
How crazy was that?<br/>
<br/>
Also, a big thanks to those who have spent (and still are spending!) <br/>
time, money and technical know-how to make the clues available to <br/>
all of us on the Internet.  Without them where would we be spending <br/>
all of our discretionary time?  I shudder to think!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Mark, for bringing this all full circle to us through <br/>
your blog...<br/>
Maybe letterboxing IS all the therapy any of us really need!<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to convince Tonto of this fact as I am begging to go out <br/>
letterboxing today after a good 6 inch snowfall last night....He <br/>
claims he is a little tuckered out from shoveling....But, I'm <br/>
desperate for some LB therapy!<br/>
