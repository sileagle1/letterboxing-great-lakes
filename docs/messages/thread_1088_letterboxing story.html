message that was in our inbox this morning.<br/>
<br/>
What to do, what to do?  Actually, the first thing I<br/>
did was call my friend, who USED to be a reporter for<br/>
the Sun Newspapers before he got burned out &amp; quit, to<br/>
get the inside scoop on this reporter.  (I love having<br/>
connections.)  My friend told me that this reporter is<br/>
a pretty fair guy, that he should treat the story<br/>
well.  Just from my knowledge of the paper, this piece<br/>
will be more of a Community Life cover-story.  This<br/>
reporter doesn't have a home office per se, he writes<br/>
what are known as general interest "enterprise"<br/>
stories.  <br/>
<br/>
(For those not familiar with the Cleveland area Sun<br/>
Newspapers, it's a once-a-week newspaper with several<br/>
different offices, supposed to focus on specific<br/>
communities.  So section A stories that appear in the<br/>
Old Brooklyn/Brooklyn edition won't all necessarilly<br/>
appear in the Westlake/North Olmsted edition, but then<br/>
other stories, like community life features, will.)<br/>
<br/>
So I guess we will talk with him eventually - it's the<br/>
quandry that some of the rest of you have faced - you<br/>
don't necessarily want Letterboxing to be out in the<br/>
open, but if you don't talk to the reporter he'll find<br/>
other means.  My biggest worry, esp. with him wanting<br/>
photos, is that boxes will be put in jeopardy.  Maybe<br/>
we'll just plant a box specific to the occasion that<br/>
we can use as a "demo."<br/>
<br/>
If anyone who's dealt with this before has some<br/>
insight they'd like to share, please pass it on to us.<br/>

&gt; Hi:<br/>
&gt;  I'm doing a story on letterboxing for Sun<br/>
&gt; Newspapers and I'd like to interview you guys. <br/>
&gt; There's not a huge rush -- the story will run<br/>
&gt; sometime this summer.  But I'd like to interview you<br/>
&gt; guys in person (maybe at one of your 'plants'?) and<br/>
&gt; get a few photographs.  Please e-mail or call with<br/>
&gt; your contact information, including phone and<br/>
&gt; residence city/cities.  I look forward to hearing<br/>
&gt; from you.  Thanks.<br/>
