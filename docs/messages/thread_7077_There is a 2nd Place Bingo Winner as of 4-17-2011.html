<br/>
Here is what she won with:<br/>
<br/>
B: Green Tortuga, declination, 100 club, slink boxing, Old Poop<br/>
I: Doglvrs, Smithsonian Magazine, Boston Terrorists, tor, Leapin' Lizards<br/>
N: "Wild Card", topgraphic map, kittens, noxer, Eleanor Spicer's Treasure Hunt<br/>
G: Springchick, The Luck of the Draw (MI), Atomic Beans, pathtag, Cherokee Rose<br/>
O: fullmoonbunny, huffing, Archaeofrog, The Toes Are Cold and The Fingers Numb (MI), Team Awesome Pants<br/>
<br/>
TrailTroll was waiting for Speedsquare to finish up the N column but won with her wild card (just like the 1st place winners.)<br/>
<br/>
One game is left to go...and that would be full card, 3rd place. Let the rat race begin!<br/>

You make the most fabulous picks<br/>
Pulling each word<br/>
As your devoted herd<br/>
Each day waits for your magic tricks.<br/>
<br/>
One hundred and six days I waited<br/>
To see what the bingo chief fated.<br/>
Hopes soaring - then dashed -<br/>
I pled, unabashed,<br/>
For favors (tho' oft I berated). <br/>
<br/>
Then last Sunday "pathtag" was called.<br/>
and I was so over-enthralled<br/>
for now second place <br/>
in this exciting race<br/>
was mine  I was no longer stalled!<br/>
<br/>
So thank you, oh captain of games<br/>
for fulfilling all my bingo aims<br/>
You made this exciting<br/>
so now I am writing<br/>
to praise your most wonderful name.<br/>
<br/>
And now who will finish third place<br/>
in this wildly exciting race?<br/>
I'll offer a prayer <br/>
for an east Michigan player <br/>
And we'll fill up a whole trophy case!<br/>
