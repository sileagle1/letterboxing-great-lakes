My daughter and I where letterboxing today in Waukesha,WI at Minooka Park and found Zuzu's Petals #4 letterbox by accident. It was in a very small container with no logbook. There are no clues for the box on Atlas Quest or LBNA. Does anybody out there no anything about this lettebox? It was across the road from Picnic Area 3 on the red trail, just a short distance from the trailhead. Not far off the trail on the left side, hidden in a downed tree.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello guys! Yea I also reconized the series, I completed it solo in April of<br/>
2009, I had no problem finding all the boxes.... however One Love Journeying<br/>
completed it later that summer and couldn't find the "suitcase" box so<br/>
Sophie might want to recheck her boxes, looks like they need a little TLC :)<br/>
