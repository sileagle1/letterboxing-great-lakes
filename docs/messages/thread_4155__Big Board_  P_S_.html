is shortly after the first Wisconsin letterbox was placed.  It is STILL <br>
there and it looks like someone found it only a week or so ago.  I <br>
believe Wisconsin was one of the earlier states to have some <br>
letterboxes.  There is a lot of fun in learning about the original <br>
boxes and history of the sport.  Also nice to keep up some traditions, <br>
including the "big board".<br>
