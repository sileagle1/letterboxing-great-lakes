Ok, so what happened yesterday??<br>
<br>
I had my hopes set on Madison, had the boxes plotted in the GPS and my backpack on the ready.<br>
<br>
When I got to work all heck broke loose.... we had a Madison, Kankakee, 2 Chicago stops, West Burlington, IA -- WoW, we had a lot of looooonnnnggggg deliveries. I got the one I was least interested in . . . West Burlington, IA (I've been there many times already), however, there were 4 new boxes PLUS a 5th box I was unable to find last time I was in town.<br>
<br>
I used my 1/2 hr lunch + two 15 min. breaks (one hour total) to collect all 5 boxes!! <br>
<br>
I got back to the office and spent the last two hours of my day there :-(<br>
<br>
I leave for the day at 5:30 and at 5:15 we got a call from a patient having trouble with a food pump. The pt lives in . . . . . . . Danville, IL!!! Holy smokes, 3 1/2 hrs ONE WAY!! I cleared it with Becki and got the green light to take it myself (even though I'm not on-call).<br>
<br>
I printed a bunch of clues for Bloomington, Champaign/Urbana & Danville and headed out.<br>
<br>
The beautiful thing of having a route after hours is that I can take my time and box without rush to get back to the office -- of course I subtract the time I boxed from the total time so I don't get paid for play!!<br>
<br>
I found "Dorothy Gage" by Walkabout in Bloomington and found a couple great Cemetery boxes by CroWoman in Urbana . . . unfortunatly, I forgot my glasses and couldn't read the names on the stones in the dark. As all the clues were based on the names on the stones I had to give up after finding 3 (I count myself lucky to get 3 or the 8).<br>
<br>
I headed straight for Danville to make my stop by the time I told the patient I would be there and grabbed a bite to eat. Then more boxing..... I WASTED an entire hour in Danville with no luck.... including the rest area just over the boarder in Indiana -- I would've LOVED to found a box in each Iowa, Illinois & Indiana all in one WORK DAY!!<br>
<br>
Shucks!<br>
<br>
Back to Champagn/Urbana where I picked up another 4 boxes -- a total of 13 boxes in one working day (by far a record)!!<br>
<br>
I clocked myself out at 1:30 in the morning, but didn't actually get home until 3:30!! <br>
<br>
What a GREAT day yesterday was!!<br>

Ok, so what happened yesterday??<br>
<br>
I had my hopes set on Madison, had the boxes plotted in the GPS and my backpack on the ready.<br>
<br>
When I got to work all heck broke loose.... we had a Madison, Kankakee, 2 Chicago stops, West Burlington, IA -- WoW, we had a lot of looooonnnnggggg deliveries. I got the one I was least interested in . . . West Burlington, IA (I've been there many times already), however, there were 4 new boxes PLUS a 5th box I was unable to find last time I was in town.<br>
<br>
I used my 1/2 hr lunch + two 15 min. breaks (one hour total) to collect all 5 boxes!! <br>
<br>
I got back to the office and spent the last two hours of my day there :-(<br>
<br>
I leave for the day at 5:30 and at 5:15 we got a call from a patient having trouble with a food pump. The pt lives in . . . . . . . Danville, IL!!! Holy smokes, 3 1/2 hrs ONE WAY!! I cleared it with Becki and got the green light to take it myself (even though I'm not on-call).<br>
<br>
I printed a bunch of clues for Bloomington, Champaign/Urbana & Danville and headed out.<br>
<br>
The beautiful thing of having a route after hours is that I can take my time and box without rush to get back to the office -- of course I subtract the time I boxed from the total time so I don't get paid for play!!<br>
<br>
I found "Dorothy Gage" by Walkabout in Bloomington and found a couple great Cemetery boxes by CroWoman in Urbana . . . unfortunatly, I forgot my glasses and couldn't read the names on the stones in the dark. As all the clues were based on the names on the stones I had to give up after finding 3 (I count myself lucky to get 3 or the 8).<br>
<br>
I headed straight for Danville to make my stop by the time I told the patient I would be there and grabbed a bite to eat. Then more boxing..... I WASTED an entire hour in Danville with no luck.... including the rest area just over the boarder in Indiana -- I would've LOVED to found a box in each Iowa, Illinois & Indiana all in one WORK DAY!!<br>
<br>
Shucks!<br>
<br>
Back to Champagn/Urbana where I picked up another 4 boxes -- a total of 13 boxes in one working day (by far a record)!!<br>
<br>
I clocked myself out at 1:30 in the morning, but didn't actually get home until 3:30!! <br>
<br>
What a GREAT day yesterday was!!<br>

If you're looking for drive-bys, cheekee monkey is a very good carver (and<br>
also has very nice logbooks). She has two boxes in Madison, but they are in<br>
FULL view of office building windows and/or numerous cars.<br>
<br>
Or figure out this one by archaeoFrog: <br>

<br>
The Naughty Trolls also have 2 quick boxes: Fondue Fun and<br>
Cupcakes-a-Go-Go.<br>
<br>
Windows<br>

We will have a stop for my work in Madison, WI either tomorrow or Tuesday.<br>
<br>
If it goes tomorrow, there is a good chance I will get to take it - if it<br>
doesn't go until Tues. then I have a 33% chance in taking it.<br>
<br>
Either way, being I will be at work, I can't devote much time to boxing, but<br>
would like to get a few if possible. Any recomendations for good drive-bys<br>
--or-- parks with more than one box in them.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly, I have no idea where within Madison the stop will be. I hope<br>
to have a few boxes plotted in my GPS this evening so if I get to go I'll<br>
have a few options.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
