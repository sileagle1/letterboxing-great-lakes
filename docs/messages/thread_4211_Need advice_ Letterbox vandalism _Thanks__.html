                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All... Thanks for your insights concerning this issue. Flotilla...<br/>
it's the Witch's Hat Depot and the Baseball (Junior League) ones. Yes,<br/>
they are in very populated areas. I knew this was risky from the<br/>
moment I thought about the spots. And I did it anyway. Live and learn,<br/>
right? Although in my clues I took pains to warn the finder to look<br/>
out for [people] and try to be sneaky, it looks like that just doesn't<br/>
work. <br/>
<br/>
Another box of mine is missing (I think; haven't personally verified<br/>
it yet, but have been emailed about it,) near Clarkston. It's not near<br/>
the South Lyon ones, but it's NOT in a populated area either... so it<br/>
just may be a string of bad luck; I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Again thanks for all the thinking on this... I really trust everyone<br/>
on this list and feel that maybe I should only post clues here?!?<br/>

&gt; Sadly, I have to agree with Bali - I found both of these wonderful <br/>
&gt; stamps, but I had great difficulty retrieving them with any stealth <br/>
&gt; at all.  I'd suggest hiding places that aren't as exposed.  (Besides, <br/>
&gt; if you place them someplace different, that gives me an excuse to go <br/>
&gt; find them again!  I'm more about the hunt, so I don't even care if <br/>
&gt; it's the same image - I'll go find it again.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I can re-carve of course, and replace these boxes. But should I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;wait a while before I do so? I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;wondering if I try to replace them too quickly the same thing will <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;happen by the same person<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;(or people. I suspect kids considering the location of the two <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;boxes that are gone.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; PP,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just looked at your site to see which boxes were missing.  I've <br/>
&gt; &gt; found both of them in the past. I think maybe they were both in too <br/>
&gt; &gt; open of areas where people could be seen too easily retrieving <br/>
&gt; &gt; them... <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I suspect both of your hiding spots have been compromised and boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; will continue to be ruined if you replace them in the exact same <br/>
&gt; places.<br/>
