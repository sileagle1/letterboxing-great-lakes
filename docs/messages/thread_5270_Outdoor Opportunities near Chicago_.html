<br/>
My husband, Fearless Fox, has the opportunity to go to Chicago for a<br/>
conference next Thursday.  We won't get into my personal opinion about what<br/>
a total bum he is that he is getting to go and I am not, and that all his<br/>
expenses will be paid and he can even stay a few extra days and explore<br/>
while I will be stuck at home working and looking after Lightning and doing<br/>
scout stuff and NOT going anywhere interesting, or at least different.  We<br/>
won't go into my slightly bad attitude about this, generally triggered by<br/>
envy.  ANYWAY...<br/>
<br/>
Fearless Fox is a hiker and generally an outdoorsman, but he's not a<br/>
letterboxer - he goes along with me because he knows I enjoy it, but it's<br/>
not something he would ever wake up one morning and decide to do, nor would<br/>
he spend precious time on a cool trip somewhere he's never been before<br/>
letterboxing.  He's a good guy in spite of that.  And again, ANYWAY...<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone suggest somewhere that someone like him would enjoy?  Somewhere<br/>
within an hour or two of Chicago (I imagine a little further would be fine<br/>
with him, if it's a really cool place)?  Also, what sorts of temperatures is<br/>
he looking at?  Surely it's cooler than our 101 degrees today in East<br/>
Texas.  He would probably enjoy a long trail he can overnight on, but if<br/>
that's not a possibility, he would enjoy doing shorter day hikes and camping<br/>
in a state park or other nice park.<br/>
<br/>
Funny how he COULD stay a few more days in a really nice hotel, but the<br/>
first thing he thinks about is getting out in the woods and finding a place<br/>
to hang his hammock...lucky dog.  Grrrr... (Oh yeah, I wasn't going to go<br/>
there).<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's lots of outdoor stuff to do within a few hours of Chicago. Unfortunately, being from east/central IL (about 2-3 hours south of Chicago area) I'm not particularly familiar with most of them though. I have been to Starved Rock and Matthiessen State Park are both in northern IL near Utica and they shouldn't be more than 2 hours from Chicago. They are both very scenic. If he really wants back-country camping, Sand Ridge State Forest (in west central IL (about 3.5 hours south of Chicago) has 55 miles of backwoods hiking trails with 12 primitive camp sites. He would need to get a permit from the forest headquarters first though.<br/>
<br/>
As for weather, it is certainly cooler here, with highs in the mid 80's lately and lows down to the upper 50's and lower 60's at night. It is however much more humid here, which can make it feel like nearly 100 during the day. Next week it's supposed to be around 80 during the day with lows right around 60 and a chance of rain.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I suppose it depends on where you plant. I'm not sure how busy Sand Ridge is, but I have found several of my boxes in some of the less busy parks out in the open on the trail (usually because someone has done some sort of maintenance which resulted in the removal of a structure they were hidden under) but in perfect condition. I've also had a few that I have chosen not to replace because they consistently turn up missing. Probably the biggest thing to be careful of is to not plant too close to a river unless you are able to make it a seasonal box and pull it about mid-winter to avoid the late winter/spring flooding. While the river trails are very nice and some of them have great hiding places they tend to be highly prone to flooding (I think I've lost more boxes that way than to muggles or wildlife). Closer to the Chicago area there are probably more good hiding places, down here in Central IL we have a lot of flat land and not very many large<br/>
 rocks except in the flood plains so we sort of have to make do with tree stumps and fallen logs.<br/>

usually not a huge issue for us.  This box sure can't be seasonal, so we'd<br/>
better make it good it sounds like!  Fearless Fox is an LNT Trainer, so he<br/>
is really good at reading the surroundings and finding evidence of potential<br/>
problems like high water and unusual erosion, so hopefully he'll spot a good<br/>
location (in fact, I've learned to give him final choice of location for my<br/>
boxes since he spots 'em better than I do).  Hopefully with a little warning<br/>
about what to expect, he'll be able to pick a good spot up there too!<br/>

&gt;   I suppose it depends on where you plant.  I'm not sure how busy Sand<br/>
&gt; Ridge is, but I have found several of my boxes in some of the less busy<br/>
&gt; parks out in the open on the trail (usually because someone has done some<br/>
&gt; sort of maintenance which resulted in the removal of a structure they were<br/>
&gt; hidden under) but in perfect condition.  I've also had a few that I have<br/>
&gt; chosen not to replace because they consistently turn up missing.  Probably<br/>
&gt; the biggest thing to be careful of is to not plant too close to a river<br/>
&gt; unless you are able to make it a seasonal box and pull it about mid-winter<br/>
&gt; to avoid the late winter/spring flooding.  While the river trails are very<br/>
&gt; nice and some of them have great hiding places they tend to be highly prone<br/>
&gt; to flooding (I think I've lost more boxes that way than to muggles or<br/>
&gt; wildlife).  Closer to the Chicago area there are probably more good hiding<br/>
&gt; places, down here in Central IL we have a lot of flat land and not very many<br/>
&gt; large<br/>
&gt; rocks except in the flood plains so we sort of have to make do with tree<br/>
&gt; stumps and fallen logs.<br/>

&gt; Thanks a million for the link - he wound up having to work this weekend, so<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'll check it out for him. As a side note, he's agreed to plant a box for<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; me while he's up there. How box-friendly is IL?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don't know how far in advance you need to get a permit. I wouldn't<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; think it's too late, but I honestly don't know. There is both a phone<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; number and an email on the DNR website (<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; http://dnr.state. il.us/lands/ Landmgt/PARKS/ R4/sand.htm) if he is<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; interested in getting a permit.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks for the suggestions! Is it too late to get a permit? Does he need<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do it in advance or is it something he can do on the spot?<br/>
