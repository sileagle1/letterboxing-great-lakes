FungusWoman's Room Service box will be available at the Country Inn by <br/>
Carlson at 6003 Hudson Rd, Woodbury, MN 55125.  It will be behind the <br/>
Front Desk, all you have to do to get it is inquire at the front <br/>
desk "Do you have Box lunches?"<br/>
<br/>
Not the traditional request for this box, but as they do have room <br/>
service, the manager thought it best to come up with a different phrase.<br/>

Just moments ago I left the two Front Desk people with very confused<br/>
expressions on their faces. I had indeed asked appropriately for the<br/>
aforementioned 'meals-to-go'. The Front Desk *did* tell me that the<br/>
restaurant could provide me with food items in a sack. I did not laugh<br/>
out loud.<br/>
<br/>
Alas, no "Box Lunches" however.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the morning crew will not be clueless?<br/>

Good thing we didn't ask for the box when we checked in. Maybe tomorrow will be a better bet.  How long will the box be at the hotel?<br/>

P.S.  We got to MN with enough daylight to hide our boxes, but unfortunately it started to RAIN just before we crossed into MN.  We'll therefore be out early tomorrow morning, planting our boxes instead of hunting GG boxes.  The  GG trek may have to wait until Sunday....<br/>

When I think back to that first one in MI that SpringChick organized -- it was Memorial <br/>

I recall the only artistamp had gloves -- undoubtedly left in a jacket pocket from winter.<br/>

It looks like a great day in MN today for another Great Lakes Gathering.<br/>
