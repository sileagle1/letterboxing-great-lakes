While I was in the ambulance, they paged out a call for all personnel to report to the station...it was going to be a busy night for them.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much to Gibson Girl for being my impromptu ambulance and triage prior to their arrival, to HowD Girl and Lampwick for taking care of my tent, gear, and car, and to Hx6 for standing guard (knowing him, throwing a few appreciated prayers my way).  They did a regular and 12-lead EKG, monitored my BP, O2 saturation, and glucose level.  They found nothing obviously wrong with me, and thought it might have been hyperventilation.  (When my left arm started to tingle and go numb, then my right, by thought was heart attack of course, thinking of how rapidly I lost my Dad to the same thing.)  They let me sign a release to forgo a trip to the hospital (since they had more serious things to deal with than an overstimulated letterboxer), so HowD, Diana Dolphin, and I (Lampwick and Red Sea Biscuit already had gone home) headed to a very comfy Holiday Inn Express not far from a hospital (just in case).  We tried to convince Gibson Girl to join us, but she opted to drive home, and had quite a harrowing job of doing so, chasing one storm system and being chased by another.  Thankfully all's well that ends well (though I was pretty upset that I dropped and broke the bottle of wine I bought at the winery in Jubilee as I unpacked my car).  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you Pitties, Shorty, and Hx6 for a weekend we won't be forgetting for a long time!<br/>

&gt; According to our local news, the tornado touched down in Elmwood (about 10 miles from the park).  The 10:00 news didn't have much to share, but said they were being updated by the minute of the storm damage.  Lots of prayers were being shared for the group yesterday &amp; last night.  So glad that everyone was safe!  <br/>
