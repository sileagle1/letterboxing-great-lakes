I am volunteering to carve the goat or the snake.  I had sent out a desire to carve the monkey earlier today, but I think Coffee Beans has hexed my account from earlier emails...<br/>
<br/>
I am definitley in the moddle of the group at 31, but it doesn't stop me from feeling the youngest.<br/>
<br/>
I will be coming from work that day, so barring any chiropractic emergencies, I should be there by 1-1:30 ish.  <br/>

P.S.  I remember my grandmothers wearing a lot of rings the older they got.  Maybe we can count age that way.<br/>

I must have missed your previous post claiming the Dragon. I will have to  <br/>
see wether or not we can make it, I'm pretty sure that we can't. Let's keep our  <br/>
fingers crossed, there's always hope.<br/>
