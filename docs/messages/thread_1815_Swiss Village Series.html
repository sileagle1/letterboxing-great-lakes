Clues to be posted soon.  An attempted post was recently thwarted by <br>
the servers of letterboxing.org.<br>
<br>
Congrats to Riiyak and River Rat for heading out to find the original -<br>
 and now retired - Swiss Village stamp.  Their stamp-ins remain intact <br>
in Box #4's logbook, although Box #4 has a new, radically different <br>
stamp.  <br>
<br>
(Unfortunately, I think I may have also unintentionally left the <br>
orginal stamp there as well in the semi-open.  If someone finds it, <br>
could you please let me know.)<br>
