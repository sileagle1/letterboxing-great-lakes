I've been through all of the great lakes states... and found at least one<br/>
letterbox in each! I've lived in WI my whole life, except for a very brief<br/>
stint in IL. Soon, Lighthouse Keeper and I will likely be living in MN. I<br/>
considered moving to the UP of MI for a second last summer, as one of my<br/>
best friends lives there. Needless to say, I've been up that way a lot!<br/>
Boxed out most of Marquette county too! Oh, and my cat lived up there with<br/>
my friend for almost a year! (though now she is back in Milwaukee with<br/>
Lighthouse Keeper!) And of course I've been and boxed (even camped) in<br/>
downstate MI.<br/>
<br/>
Yep. Proud to be a Great Lakes Letterboxer! And looking forward to meeting<br/>
more of you all from my home and sister states!<br/>

<br/>
IL - Of course, this is where I have lived all my life.  Born in Aurora <br/>
(before Naperville had a hospital, Edward was only a TB sanitarium)  , <br/>
raised in Naperville, college at U of I - Urbana Champaign, worked at <br/>
Chicago area companies.  Dad, Grandma and G Grampa all grew up in IL.  G G <br/>
Grampa moved here from New York, fought in the Civil War, and served as a <br/>
juror on the famous Chicago anarchist trial pre-1900.  A true flatlander.<br/>
<br/>
MN - My niece, my "adoptive" daughter because her mom lives in Ireland, goes <br/>
to U of MN and is just finishing her doctoral thesis in violin performance <br/>
and Suzuki teaching.  My parents lived there after the war and 3 sisters <br/>
were born in St. Paul.  Lots of relatives lived in the Winona area.<br/>
<br/>
WI - We have a lake home in Minocqua!  (3 boxes too, so far)  Our family has <br/>
owned it for 4 generations now - and my siblings and I co-own it.  We built <br/>
a new house there last year.  It's great and beautiful and we have Bald <br/>
eagles and loons and bears and all kinds of fun.   I have a sister in <br/>
Madison and one in Rhinelander - My husband went to Marquette (Milwaukee).<br/>
<br/>
IN -  My mom was born and raised in Alexandria.  We still go there to visit <br/>
my aunt who is 86.  And we still say we are going "down home" when we visit. <br/>
I think I am related to most of that little town.  I also worked in South <br/>
Bend for a year - commuting from Hinsdale.  (Not recommended.)<br/>
<br/>
MI - My father-in-law grew up in Grosse Pointe and DH has lots of cousins up <br/>
there.  Oh yeah.  DH's first wife also grew up in Grosse Pointe, lives in <br/>
Kalamazoo now, I think.   My Grandpa was from Sault Ste. Marie.<br/>
We love the UP and try to get to Black River Harbor every summer for a <br/>
picnic and to see the water falls - and to buy pasties in Ironwood.<br/>
<br/>
OH - Well, here it breaks down.  Since I am an Illini, I am not fond of <br/>
Buckeyes.  The only time I cheer for Michigan is when they are playing OSU! <br/>
However, when I was in college, I and a group of sorority sisters drove from <br/>
Champaign to Columbus, topless, just to see how many cars/trucks/people <br/>
would notice.  We did re-dress when stopping for gas and/or refreshments! <br/>
(I was young - and it was the '70's!  What can I say?!)  Did anyone see us??<br/>

-We thought this thread interesting regarding how many of us have similar Great Lake State connections...so here are ours:<br/>
<br/>
IL - We have spent all 29 years of our married life here in the Chicago area.  Tonto was born and raised on the south-side of Chicago - a true White Sox fan!  Although, his older brother went to Illinois, he is the biggest Illini fan.<br/>
<br/>
IN - Tiptoe was born and raised in Indianapolis. Graduated from the greatest Big 10 school - Purdue!  (Boiler-up! ) Unfortunately, all her siblings and in-laws all went to that other school in Indiana.... IU!  Her parents still reside in the state.<br/>
<br/>
OH - Tiptoe's parents moved for awhile to Cleveland and both of her sisters live in the Cincinnati area.  The Ohio State Buckeyes are one of Tiptoe's "most disliked" (only 2nd to Notre Dame!)!  ...BTW Sara of Jeffers Clan...that was Tiptoe in Lafayette, likewise dressed in the early 70's when you passed on your way to Columbus!  Just kidding...wink, wink...she was at Purdue in her pep girl outfit that only occasionally got shifted.<br/>
<br/>
WI - Growing up, Tiptoe had family that lived in Door County and spent many pleasant times up that way before all the tourist hype.  Likewise, Tonto spent every vacation growing up at the "Big House" that belonged to his parent's best friends on lovely Lake Geneva.  It is still one of our favorite spots.<br/>
<br/>
MI - Tonto received his under grad degree from Calvin College in Grand Rapids.  His best friend (also our best man in our wedding) lives in Holland.  Tiptoe's adventurous grandparents would load her in the car and drive up to Michigan just to eat lunch and return to Indy before dark!  Happy memories.<br/>
<br/>
MN - Tiptoe's Swedish great grandparents immigrated to Montevideo, MN in the late 1800's.  She still has roots in that area.<br/>
<br/>
IA - Tiptoe also has ancestors that laid down homesteads on their way to the Dakotas from eastern New York in several locations in Iowa.<br/>
<br/>
We happily have letterboxed in all of the states ...but, MN...(Uh Oh...Tonto just rolled his eyes when we realized that fact...he's getting the car warmed up!)...Most of all we've met the most wonderful people from all of them!<br/>

<br/>
I'm an army brat, so lived in many places, and when my dad retired we moved to Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
Michigan:  Moved to the southwest corner of Mich in my teen years.  Lived in the Detroit area my entire married life.  Also have a place in the Manistee area.  Visit Mackinac Island every summer for a week with Mackinac Island Honor Guard. Always go to Camp Arcadia for a week every summer (is that where you were engaged Bird Woman?)<br/>
<br/>
Indiana:  Went to South Bend quite a lot to do shopping (we had no major malls in our area), to go to concerts at Notre Dame, and to go to the movies (our theatre had only one movie and usually not very current).<br/>
<br/>
Illinois:  My best friend from high school lives in the Chicago area.  We used to go into Chicago for music concerts.  But what I remember most was going to Tower Hill on lake Michigan and the line of cars was mostly from Illinois.  We Michigan teens always wanted a separate line at the beach for Michigan cars  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Ohio:  Every summer we made a trip to Sandusky to get our thrills on the rollercoasters at Cedar Point.<br/>
<br/>
Minnesota:  My only connection to this state was a canoeing trip at Boundary Waters.  We started off in Duluth, MN.  What spectaular beauty there is to see there.<br/>
<br/>
Wisconsin:  Sadly, I have no connection with this state, but dream of letterboxing in Door County.<br/>

<br/>
Ohio - Both Deedle &amp; I were born in Ohio, lived in Ohio all our lives, went to college in Ohio, met in Ohio, got engaged in Ohio, got married in Ohio (but we went on a cruise for our honeymoon, although a honeymoon in Hocking Hills would have been lovely), and we still live here. <br/>
<br/>
And that's it. Oh, OK, let me see if we've got any connections to other states... <br/>
<br/>
Michigan - My alma mater has a "field station" in the UP, and I took a one week class there one summer, and it was absolutely amazing. The location had no electricity, no running water (but if you wanted to shower, you could pump water to fill the water reservoir<br/>

--&gt;  tank), and I had never seen so many stars in my life. On the last night there, the four of us (it was a small class) took a rowboat out on the lake, and we stopped in the middle of the lake and just sat there. It was so quiet our ears were burning because there was nothing to hear, and then an owl hooted and scared us all. <br/>
<br/>
As for the rest of Michigan, a friend of mine used to live in Adrian and we attended his wedding there, been to a Great Lakes Gathering there, and I'll be going back in June to see U2 there, because U2 does not love Ohio like I do. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Illinois - My cousin's family lives there, been to visit them once. Also went to see the Cleveland Indians play there back in the 90's when the team was awesome and you couldn't get tickets to see them play in Cleveland. Oh, how fun it was taking the train (the L, is that what it's called in Chicago?) and at every stop, more and more people wearing Indians gear kept getting on. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wisconsin - I visited Milwaukee once, went to a wedding with a friend for one of her former grad school classmates. We ended up leaving the reception early because the Bastille Day festival was going on, and she really wanted to check it out. I really loved Milwaukee (because it reminded me of Cleveland ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Indiana - Um, drove through there to get to Illinois.... and we attended the Great Lakes Gathering there last year!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Iowa - Never been, but we really want to make a journey to the "Field of Dreams" one of these years. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Minnesota - Never been there either... but I love A Prairie Home Companion!<br/>

WI - I grew up in Rhinelander. My mom still lives there so I visit often. We'd also spend two weeks every summer on Lily Bay in Door County. I was there for the first time in 15 years last July. I cried when we had to leave!<br/>
<br/>
MN - Where I live now and probably will for the rest of my life.<br/>
<br/>
MI - In high school I had a friend w/ a cabin in the UP, so we'd road trip up there in the summer. Also skied up there quite a bit. Have drive through the LB, but no real connection<br/>
<br/>
IA - My brother's in Iowa City. I love the Maquoketa Caves park<br/>
<br/>
IL - sisters in Libertyville and Elmhurst. Had the pleasure of boxing with Nitrocat once.<br/>
<br/>
IN - One sister used to live in Bloomington, and I visited once. Beautiful county - I loved the rolling hills. She took me to a lake that had geodes all over the shores, and a cute little artisan town (Nashville?).<br/>
<br/>
OH - Brother used to teach at OSU, so I've visited Columbus. He took me turkey watching in the hills. Very pretty. And my sister got married south of Cleveland about 20 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I've only actually boxed in WI, MN and IL, though. Must remedy that....<br/>

Indiana - well, I've always thought it appropriate that the state signs say,<br/>
"crossroads of America" because mostly I just tend to drive through this<br/>
state.  I did enjoy the GLG there last summer and many of my early finds<br/>
were in Indiana, because those were the closest letterboxes.  My<br/>
sister-in-law is from Indiana, but I don't hold that against the state.<br/>
<br/>
Illinois - where I lived for far too long while getting my PhD and also<br/>
where I learned about letterboxing.  And where I'm currently stuck because<br/>
of the falling snow (thanks, KG and FD for putting me up!)<br/>
<br/>
Iowa - I drove through Iowa when moving from NY to CA.  I have a friend who<br/>
maintains that Iowa is full of vampires and people in the witness protection<br/>
program, but I'm pretty sure he was just trying to dissuade his wife from<br/>
getting a job there.  Occasionally my mom would ask me about the weather in<br/>
IA when I lived in IL, because in her mind IA, IL and IN are all, "those<br/>
@#&amp;*% I states."<br/>
<br/>
Minnesota - I went to the Mall of America with my mom and sister-in-law a<br/>
while back, drove through Minnesota when moving from CA to IL, and one of my<br/>
former roommates lives in Minnesota.<br/>
<br/>
Michigan - birthplace of my parents, residence of all of my extended family,<br/>
summer vacation destination when I was a child, and the reason we have<br/>
arguments over where Canada is (south, north, or west?).<br/>
<br/>
Wisconsin - camped and did field work here while working on my dissertation,<br/>
and drove through it on one my cross country migrations.  Another state with<br/>
a former roommate of mine, plus a few years ago, there was a mass migration<br/>
of many of my friends from Illinois to Madison.  I haven't ever letterboxed<br/>
there - so I guess I may have a summer destination.<br/>
<br/>
Ohio - Joyously, the first place I've lived where the majority of the boxes<br/>
are not mine and are not more than 2 hours away!<br/>

<br/>
MI - I've lived in West Michigan all of my life and attended all of my schooling here except for time spent abroad as an exchange student.  Since the time I was very young my family camped extensively in Northern MI and the UP; I have a special place in my heart for the UP and would love to end up there someday...<br/>
<br/>
MN - That brings me to MN, which is the other place I would consider living out my retirement -- North Shore, MN.  I dated a guy in Thunder Bay, ON for several years and spent a lot of time hiking, canoeing and exploring at Boundary Waters and throughout the North Shore area... it is where I experienced my first winter sauna and had my first adventures in sailing!  About 10 years ago I was all set to move to this area, but then I met OldShoe and I'm still in MI ;-)<br/>
<br/>
WI - Have been here only as a tourist and a letterboxer, in particular several trips to Door County... it is the only place I have ever worn a life jacket while we were boating -- because Green Bay kicked up a terrible storm so quickly when we were heading out to see Pottawatomie Lighthouse on Rock Island, and I honestly thought we would capsize before making it back to harbor!  A few years back OldShoe found a little [ghost] town in northern WI named Springstead (his surname).  In the middle of nowhere is the Springstead Historic District, which has some very interesting historical lore and a cute little rental cabin where we stayed and visited with the caretakers for a few days. The place is now for sale and about a year ago OldShoe got the odd notion that it would be a "fun" adventure to buy it and live there -- ah yah...  an adventure maybe, "fun"?  not so sure...<br/>
<br/>
IL - Chicago is definitely my favorite large city! In my previous job I spent a lot of time in the greater Chicago area, doing network conversions for banks that were purchased by the bank I worked for over the course of several years.  OldShoe and I make frequent trips to Chicago for weekends and concerts and sometimes just for dinner...  it is also the place where we had our first adventures in letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
OH - Made several trips to Cincinnati for work when the bank I worked for was purchased by a bank headquartered there -- had my first Krispy Kreme donut there before they made their way to Michigan.  Have made several trips to Cedar Point over the years, a visit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and hunted up several letterboxes in the greater Cleveland area on the way through to the East Coast.<br/>
<br/>
IN - My ties here are the weakest...  let me see...  A very good friend and former co-worker lives in Indy; as a kid we used to go to Goshen, IN on spring break -- what an odd place to spend spring break!<br/>

What great reads these have all been!<br/>
<br/>
Here is our connection to the Great Lakes states:<br/>
<br/>
    OH          I was born, raised, &amp; married in Ohio ... eastern suburbs of Cleveland; our sons were both born in Akron. We love going back for visits and letterboxing!<br/>
    IN            I went to college in Indiana … Taylor University, so lived there for 4 years.  Hope to letterbox in that area (Marion) later this spring!<br/>
    IL            Where we live now, outside of Rockford. We love letterboxing all over the state!<br/>
    MI           Not any connection in the LP … have visited and letterboxed at Porcupine Mtn (&amp; vicinity) in the UP.<br/>
    WI          Where my husband (new trail name is Steering Lives) was born and raised. Also, we visit the Eagle River area every year and box our way up and during our stay.<br/>
    MN         Our son did a college internship in Mpls; our nieces &amp; families live in MN … one of our nieces is married to a nephew of Garrison Keillor.<br/>
<br/>

PS ... Looking forward to seeing some of you at the "Dead of Winter" Mini-Meet on the 16th!<br/>

MI - Lived here in west Michigan all my life (GR area). Spent much of my childhood and now adult life camping in northern Michigan (LP and UP). Found my first letterbox in the UP at Kitchi-it-Kipi (or something like that....it was planted by TJ_Mich)<br/>
<br/>
WI - Have only been there twice. Both times to visit a good friend that I scrapbook and camp with. She was the one who introduced me to LB'ing (while we were camping at Indian Lake State Park this summer).<br/>
<br/>
IL - Have been there many times, usually to Chicago. Love that city but could never live there. Waaaaay to busy for me. Have also visited many times to scrapbook with several ladies I met online at a parenting messageboard.<br/>
<br/>
OH - Have visited Cedar Point several times. I don't think I've been there for any other reason.<br/>
<br/>
IN - Aside from driving through whenever we drive to Chicago, I can't think of much. Been shopping at the outlets once &amp; gambled a the nearby casino once.<br/>
<br/>
MN - I got nuthin! Well, I've been there once. Flew in for a scrapbooking weekend with my friend from WI (her mom lives in MN and we used her mom's house for the weekend). Haven't even ever been to Mall of America. Should I go?<br/>
<br/>
Pretty boring here. Michigan is where we spend most of our time.<br/>

&gt; Some of my connections are a little weak, but I can think of something for each state at least...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MI - I've lived in West Michigan all of my life and attended all of my schooling here except for time spent abroad as an exchange student.  Since the time I was very young my family camped extensively in Northern MI and the UP; I have a special place in my heart for the UP and would love to end up there someday...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MN - That brings me to MN, which is the other place I would consider living out my retirement -- North Shore, MN.  I dated a guy in Thunder Bay, ON for several years and spent a lot of time hiking, canoeing and exploring at Boundary Waters and throughout the North Shore area... it is where I experienced my first winter sauna and had my first adventures in sailing!  About 10 years ago I was all set to move to this area, but then I met OldShoe and I'm still in MI ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WI - Have been here only as a tourist and a letterboxer, in particular several trips to Door County... it is the only place I have ever worn a life jacket while we were boating -- because Green Bay kicked up a terrible storm so quickly when we were heading out to see Pottawatomie Lighthouse on Rock Island, and I honestly thought we would capsize before making it back to harbor!  A few years back OldShoe found a little [ghost] town in northern WI named Springstead (his surname).  In the middle of nowhere is the Springstead Historic District, which has some very interesting historical lore and a cute little rental cabin where we stayed and visited with the caretakers for a few days. The place is now for sale and about a year ago OldShoe got the odd notion that it would be a "fun" adventure to buy it and live there -- ah yah...  an adventure maybe, "fun"?  not so sure...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IL - Chicago is definitely my favorite large city! In my previous job I spent a lot of time in the greater Chicago area, doing network conversions for banks that were purchased by the bank I worked for over the course of several years.  OldShoe and I make frequent trips to Chicago for weekends and concerts and sometimes just for dinner...  it is also the place where we had our first adventures in letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OH - Made several trips to Cincinnati for work when the bank I worked for was purchased by a bank headquartered there -- had my first Krispy Kreme donut there before they made their way to Michigan.  Have made several trips to Cedar Point over the years, a visit to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and hunted up several letterboxes in the greater Cleveland area on the way through to the East Coast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IN - My ties here are the weakest...  let me see...  A very good friend and former co-worker lives in Indy; as a kid we used to go to Goshen, IN on spring break -- what an odd place to spend spring break!<br/>

&gt; Ooh, this is a fun topic. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WI - I grew up in Rhinelander. My mom still lives there so I visit often. We'd also spend two weeks every summer on Lily Bay in Door County. I was there for the first time in 15 years last July. I cried when we had to leave!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MN - Where I live now and probably will for the rest of my life.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MI - In high school I had a friend w/ a cabin in the UP, so we'd road trip up there in the summer. Also skied up there quite a bit. Have drive through the LB, but no real connection<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IA - My brother's in Iowa City. I love the Maquoketa Caves park<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IL - sisters in Libertyville and Elmhurst. Had the pleasure of boxing with Nitrocat once.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; IN - One sister used to live in Bloomington, and I visited once. Beautiful county - I loved the rolling hills. She took me to a lake that had geodes all over the shores, and a cute little artisan town (Nashville?) .<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OH - Brother used to teach at OSU, so I've visited Columbus. He took me turkey watching in the hills. Very pretty. And my sister got married south of Cleveland about 20 years ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've only actually boxed in WI, MN and IL, though. Must remedy that....<br/>

Just thought of several more times in IN. For several years, my friend (who lives in WI) and I (living in MI) would get together for a weekend to scrapbook. Merrillville IN was almost exactly the same distance for both of us to travel, so we spent about 3 weekends a year holed up in a hotel room scrapbooking till 3 or 4 am. We became quite familiar with Merrillville.<br/>

I like this topic too. There for a period of about 5 years our annual family vacation was to drive around Lake Michigan visiting family and enjoying Holland, Traverse City, Mackinac Island, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Illinois -- I was born and raised and lived in Illinois my entire life. Lived in Lake County for the first 22 years of my life with many trips to Chicago, Great America, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Wisconsin -- Many many trips to Lake Geneva, my Dad worked there for summer camp a few years when he was much younger. Many trips to Kettle Morraine and Door County as a kid too. My grandfather pastored churches in Potosi &amp; Lancaster back in the late 40's and early 50's.<br/>
<br/>
Michigan -- My ancestors lived in New York and crossed over Ontario to Michigan just after the Civil War in the 1860's. My great great great grandparents lived in Jackson (that's where my grandfather was born) and my gggrandparents on my other side lived in Grand Rapids. My great grandfather was a police officer in Detroit during prohibition -- needless to say, he didn't keep the law as his brother had a distillery in his basement. I still have many relatives in Grand Rapids, Battle Creek, Lansing, Detroit, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Indiana -- Indy was just a pitstop on all our trips to Michigan. We used to stop at a little truckers restaurant for lunch . . . great food. Been to Indianapolis a few times and Bloomington where my brother-in-law worked for a time.<br/>
<br/>
Ohio -- In youth group we went to Montreat, NC every year. Actually, I went there 5 years in a row. On our drive back from NC we would stop the night in OH and go to Kings Island the next day!! The Beast is still the best rollercoaster I've ever been on. I've also driven across the state east to wet and west to east.<br/>
<br/>
Minnesota -- I went to a Promise Keepers event in the twin cities when I was 18. Becki and I also went to a Downpour event, also in the twin cities. We went to the GLG at Afton a couple years ago and made a trip of it.... mostly based on the Little House on the Prairie books/tv series and stopped in Walnut Grove.<br/>

What a great post!<br/>
<br/>
I'm an army brat, so lived in many places, and when my dad retired we moved to Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
Michigan: Moved to the southwest corner of Mich in my teen years. Lived in the Detroit area my entire married life. Also have a place in the Manistee area. Visit every summer for a week with Mackinac Island Honor Guard. Always go to Camp Arcadia for a week every summer (is that where you were engaged Bird Woman?)<br/>
<br/>
Indiana: Went to South Bend quite a lot to do shopping (we had no major malls in our area), to go to concerts at Notre Dame, and to go to the movies (our theatre had only one movie and usually not very current).<br/>
<br/>
Illinois: My best friend from high school lives in the Chicago area. We used to go into Chicago for music concerts. But what I remember most was going to Tower Hill on lake Michigan and the line of cars was mostly from Illinois. We Michigan teens always wanted a separate line at the beach for Michigan cars :-)<br/>
<br/>
Ohio: Every summer we made a trip to Sandusky to get our thrills on the rollercoasters at Cedar Point.<br/>
<br/>
Minnesota: My only connection to this state was a canoeing trip at Boundary Waters. We started off in Duluth, MN. What spectaular beauty there is to see there.<br/>
<br/>
Wisconsin: Sadly, I have no connection with this state, but dream of letterboxing in Door County.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; WI--in my younger single days, my girlfriends and I would rent a cottage in Door County for a week every summer<br/>

MI:  If we could live anywhere, we would definitely pick the UP of MI.  We spend lots of time up there, and it's our home away from home during the summer.  We are  Yoopers at heart!  We haven't spent much time in the lower part of the state.<br/>
WI:  We love cheese!  Love the fact that Bret Favre is now a Viking.  Have enjoyed many trips to Door County.  Have friends in Madison.  Love Milwaukee and also enjoy Greendale (the hometown of Taste of Home).  Two of our favorite restaurants are in Hudson (Pier 500 and Mama Maria's) along with lots of great art galleries and boutiques in downtown.<br/>
IL:  Have visited Chicago many times.  It is probably our favorite big city.  One of  Z's college roommates lives in the Chicago area.  Last summer Z and S2 needed to visit the Italian Embassy in Chicago to get a student visa for S2.  It was a very eventful weekend, we did some LBing and also attended the Team Bearcat Comes to Chicago! LB meet-and-greet.  It was so fun to meet other letterboxers!  We also have spent time in Hardin County (lower part of the state) looking for flourite.  We are rockhounds.<br/>
IN:  Everyone sing now..."Gary, Indiana; Gary, Indiana"  The Music Man is a favorite musical.  S1's aunt and uncle live near South Bend and we have visited them several times.  We also enjoy attending the Parke County Covered Bridge Festival whenever we can.<br/>
<br/>
OH:  A good friend moved to Ohio several years ago.  We have enjoyed visiting the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland; Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky (screamed on the roller coasters till we were hoarse!), and had fun making a basket at Longaberger near Dresden.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't letterboxed in Indiana or Ohio. ..maybe this coming Summer!<br/>

&gt; Minnesota -- I went to a Promise Keepers event in the twin cities when I was 18. Becki and I also went to a Downpour event, also in the twin cities. We went to the GLG at Afton a couple years ago and made a trip of it.... mostly based on the Little House on the Prairie books/tv series and stopped in Walnut Grove.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
Seeing your comments on Little House brought back memories of our own Little House vacation--and helps fill in some of the Great Lakes states I missed earlier.  On our Little House trip, we hit WI (Little House in the Big Woods) and Iowa.  She didn't write a book about her time there, but her pa worked in a hotel in Burr Oaks.  It is the only home she lived in that is still there and in the same spot.  Our favorite stop on that trip was MN (Little house on Plum Creek).  We went wading in Plum Creek (fortunately, no leeches!) and we spent the night in a sod house.  And we went to the Spam Museum, which is hilarious.  We also hit DeSmet in SD, but that is nowhere near the Great Lakes.<br/>
<br/>
It's been fun reading all the Great Lake States connections.<br/>

Here goes another Great Lakes story:<br/>
<br/>
"born, bred and buttered" in Indiana.  Put my toes in Lake Michigan at the dunes while attending college in South Bend.<br/>
<br/>
-kissed Indiana good-bye and headed to the Big City, the Windy City after graduation.  Lived in IL for 12 years.  Since then I found out BirdWoman knows my aunt in Forest Park, and there is a letterbox about 1/2 block from my first house in Berkeley.<br/>
<br/>
-left the Flatland for God's Country (WI) where we worked and lived for 4 years.  Had I known at the time, I could have found some letterboxes of Antiquity.  A couple of summers ago we were in Racine County and decided to visit a lighthouse.  We overheard others with GPS talking about caches and (letterboxes!) in the area.  I didn't come prepared!<br/>
<br/>
-Another relocation and we were goin' Back to Indiana in 2000.  Almost 10 years later were are still here, but as close as we can be to the Buckeye State.  I could walk!  We spent holidays in Ohio.  There still are large areas I haven't boxed, so that will be my goal this year.<br/>
<br/>
Minnesota -- what can I say?  I was on a plane in 1980 when we had to make an emergency stop in the Twin Cities.  I don't count that because we never left the airport.  Visiting the Apostle Islands is on my bucket list.<br/>
<br/>
The first letterboxers we encountered on the trail were Acorn and Golden boy at Turkey Run SP.<br/>

&gt; DOH!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just thought of several more times in IN. For several years, my friend (who lives in WI) and I (living in MI) would get together for a weekend to scrapbook. Merrillville IN was almost exactly the same distance for both of us to travel, so we spent about 3 weekends a year holed up in a hotel room scrapbooking till 3 or 4 am. We became quite familiar with Merrillville.<br/>

What's up with Indiana???  <br/>
<br/>
I keep seeing that everyone "drove through" or "passed by" etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like it's time for a gathering of some sort here at the Indiana Dunes.  It's beautiful here.  Lots of seagulls, sand, hiking trails, woods, bogs, and much, much more.  You can see Chicago on the other side of the lake even.  <br/>

Anyone game for some fun here sometime in 2010?<br/>

MCPastorsWife - The Porkies are my ancestral homeland - can't wait to get up there to LB and plant one in honor of my grandfather - might even put a pic of him and Grandma at the Lake of the Clouds overlook on the cover of the logbook.<br/>

CPJenks - if we meet in person, ask Peabody about our bad luck in Merrillville - it involved him towing my car with a cable and I had no steering - obviously the story turned out okay but it was REALLY scary.  Oh, and I do the 3x year scrap at a hotel thing too - in Watertown, WI.<br/>

The Dunes would be a wonderful spot.  One of the best places EVER that we have camped is the national (not the state) campground at the IN Dunes.<br/>

Wisconsin - born, raised, nearly always lived (except for college on the<br/>
East Coast) on the 60-ish mile line from Madison to Milwaukee.  Love to be a<br/>
cheesehead and all that quaint stereotypes that entails!  Majority of my<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Michigan - my husband hails from West Michigan, so we spend a lot of time in<br/>
the Holland to Grand Rapids area.  Astounded to discover that there was a<br/>
letterbox mere blocks away from my in-laws.  It made me almost want to<br/>
visit!  Planted my first out of state box in MI too!  Have yet to make it up<br/>
to the UP but that is definitely in the game plan.<br/>
<br/>
Iowa - my sister spent six years of college there, which entailed multiple<br/>
visits and fun stops like Amana and whatnot.  Also have several friends that<br/>
lived/attended college there.  (I enjoy mocking them, I'll admit it.  WI<br/>
pride.)<br/>
<br/>
Illinois - sister and the boyfriend are now in the Chicago area, and I spent<br/>
a summer doing contract archaeology in the suburbs of the suburbs of Chicago<br/>
(Plainfield, anyone?).  It's kinda like letterboxing but with no clues and<br/>
far fewer finds.  You spend a lot of time watching your feet while walking<br/>
through corn fields.  Chicago is the constant bane of my "driving from<br/>
Madison to Grand Rapids" existence.  Who else wants a chunnel under Lake<br/>
Michigan?!<br/>
<br/>
Indiana - drive in, drive out.  No really, I very nearly went to Notre Dame,<br/>
and recently spent a lovely weekend watching the sandhill crane migration in<br/>
Jasper-Pulaski ... 10,000 plus cranes all in one little field put up quite a<br/>
racket!  Have also spent time at the amusement park that promised me<br/>
"there's more than corn in Indiana!"<br/>
<br/>
Ohio - drove through multiple times on my way to Boston.  Also came once for<br/>
a good friend's wedding and enjoyed spending time on the shores of yet<br/>
another Great Lake.<br/>
<br/>
and Minnesota - visited friends in Minneapolis, took a high school spring<br/>
break trip to the Mall of America (yikes), and watching a cop pull a 180<br/>
turn up and down and through a divided median to pull my husband over<br/>
shortly after entering Minnesota from the more speeder-friendly South Dakota<br/>
(where I DID letterbox).<br/>

<br/>
Hooray for the Great Lakes!<br/>
<br/>
Wisconsin - born, raised, nearly always lived (except for college on the<br/>
East Coast) on the 60-ish mile line from Madison to Milwaukee.  Love to be a<br/>
cheesehead and all that quaint stereotypes that entails!  Majority of my<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Michigan - my husband hails from West Michigan, so we spend a lot of time in<br/>
the Holland to Grand Rapids area.  Astounded to discover that there was a<br/>
letterbox mere blocks away from my in-laws.  It made me almost want to<br/>
visit!  Planted my first out of state box in MI too!  Have yet to make it up<br/>
to the UP but that is definitely in the game plan.<br/>
<br/>
Iowa - my sister spent six years of college there, which entailed multiple<br/>
visits and fun stops like Amana and whatnot.  Also have several friends that<br/>
lived/attended college there.  (I enjoy mocking them, I'll admit it.  WI<br/>
pride.)<br/>
<br/>
Illinois - sister and the boyfriend are now in the Chicago area, and I spent<br/>
a summer doing contract archaeology in the suburbs of the suburbs of Chicago<br/>
(Plainfield, anyone?).  It's kinda like letterboxing but with no clues and<br/>
far fewer finds.  You spend a lot of time watching your feet while walking<br/>
through corn fields.  Chicago is the constant bane of my "driving from<br/>
Madison to Grand Rapids" existence.  Who else wants a chunnel under Lake<br/>
Michigan?!<br/>
<br/>
Indiana - drive in, drive out.  No really, I very nearly went to Notre Dame,<br/>
and recently spent a lovely weekend watching the sandhill crane migration in<br/>
Jasper-Pulaski ... 10,000 plus cranes all in one little field put up quite a<br/>
racket!  Have also spent time at the amusement park that promised me<br/>
"there's more than corn in Indiana!"<br/>
<br/>
Ohio - drove through multiple times on my way to Boston.  Also came once for<br/>
a good friend's wedding and enjoyed spending time on the shores of yet<br/>
another Great Lake.<br/>
<br/>
and Minnesota - visited friends in Minneapolis, took a high school spring<br/>
break trip to the Mall of America (yikes), and watching a cop pull a 180<br/>
turn up and down and through a divided median to pull my husband over<br/>
shortly after entering Minnesota from the more speeder-friendly South Dakota<br/>
(where I DID letterbox).<br/>

I had proton radiation there several years ago, which at the time was only available 3 places in the US - Massachussets General (Harvard), Los Angeles, and Bloomington, Indiana.  Apparently Indiana University is a mecca for physicists from around the world - who knew?  Love the town too - a small town, but because it's a college town it has lots of cultural events.  And your trivia for today: it used to be the population center of the United States - back in the 1910 census.  So here's to Indiana!<br/>

I was born and raised in Plainfield, IL, and spent about 30 years of my life there.  Awesome place!  I go back there all the time to visit another (infamous) letterboxer on here (ahem).  <br/>
<br/>
I grew up right next to what is now the heron rookery.  Do you recall that cool place at all?<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, the crane thing you went to in Indiana was an event hosted by the State Dunes nature center.  I go there all the time and live about five minutes from there.  I've never been to one of their crane events, however, since they travel a bit farther for that one.  But I see them flying overhead in groups now and then.  They are LOUD and huge!<br/>

<br/>
Visited Ohio a number of times (Cedar Point, Kings Island, drove through it to go to NC in 2008, picked up some letterboxes there in September.  <br/>
<br/>
My first trip to Illinois was in 2001 to a convention.  Visited again in 2003, 2004, 2005, and drove through the state to go to Vegas/LA in 2008.  <br/>
<br/>
When visiting Illinois in 2005, to save money, we stayed at a hotel in Indiana.  Possibly stayed in a hotel in Indiana on the way to get those letterboxes in Ohio (it was too close to the Michigan border).<br/>
<br/>
Wisconsin - only stayed there when my step grandfather passed in 1995.  He was buried in Ironwood, MI and we stayed in Hurley, WI.  There is a letterbox over there that I've been eyeing.  <br/>
<br/>
Never been to Minnesota.  I'd like to visit there someday.  I have been to PA and NY, which technically are Great Lakes States too.  <br/>
<br/>
Like someone else mentioned, I don't think Iowa is a Great Lakes state, but I was there in 2008 on the way to and from Vega and LA.  Drove through during the flooding in June.  Iowa looked like a lake then.  <br/>
