Azobox and myself will be there between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. so<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Hey Tonto, how do you feel about bribery?" Tiptoe asked.<br>
<br>
Huh? <br>
<br>
"Bribery, arm twisting...you know, providing a little influence for our well being!  We're <br>
from Chicago...we know how things are done!"<br>
<br>
"What on earth are you talking about?"<br>
<br>
"Spring Chick has sent out an invitation to visit her and Azobox at the Grand Rapids Public <br>
Museum today where they will be manning a letterbox information table. I was thinking <br>
maybe we could pay them a little visit and personally persuade Spring Chick to pick our <br>
remaining BINGO words....if ya know watt-a-mean!"<br>
<br>
"Grand Rapids is two and a half hours away...and not to mention the price of gas.."<br>
<br>
"PLEASEEEEEEE.....After all, it is BINGO and we WANT those Doglvr socks!<br>
<br>
So went the conversation....until Tiptoe finally came out the victor!  <br>
<br>
We drove up and surprised the GLK letterboxing duo...(aka the King and Queen as noted <br>
by their little crowns after their names as "moderator"!)<br>
<br>
We spent the day at the museum, which by the way, is wonderful...found four <br>
letterboxes...had a great dinner at Charlie's Crab...stopped in South Haven at our favorite <br>
ice cream shop..Sherman's (double chocolate malt!!!!)....now open for the season...(A <br>
definite sign that the WARM weather is coming!)  A great day...EXCEPT...Spring Chick <br>
wouldn't agree to "fix" our call...If we happen to win those socks, it will be wholly on our <br>
own luck!  She was not to be bought, bribed or cajoled into any under the table deals!  So <br>
those of you reading and thinking of the same...forget it!  BUT, if you can get up to the <br>
museum to get those boxes...Go for it...they are so worth the trip!<br>
Thanks to those fine carvers of stamps hidden at the museum...And as usual, thanks to <br>
Azobox and Spring Chick for making our day with your bright smiles!  It warmed our cold <br>
little hearts more than you know!<br>
Tiptoe & Tonto<br>
