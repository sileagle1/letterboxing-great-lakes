                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've got our clues posted for the 3 boxes we placed last weekend.  Our <br>
new goal is to get a box in every county that borders WI.  We therefore <br>
planted boxes in two MN counties on MAY 5 & 6.  We're planning to get <br>
to the other 2 "boxless" MN counties that border WI in early July, as <br>
well as the one remaining Iowa "boxless" county that borders WI.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see how long it takes for someone to find <br>
these boxes, since they obviously aren't a hotbed of letterboxing <br>
action.  We still haven't heard anything about 3 of the boxes we placed <br>
in northwestern WI in November.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, my latest WI box is right along I-90/94 for those of <br>
you who might travel that route this summer and are looking for a <br>
diversion....<br>
