<br>
We'll meet at Champps on Friday night at 6:30 pm.  If you're a bit later, no big deal - I'm sure we'll be there for a while. We will be in the patio room (don't worry, it is INDOORS).  Just ask for Debbie with the hiking group if you need help finding that area. They DO allow separate checks, so be sure to tell your server who should be included on your check when you first order. Champps is located on Moorland Rd in Brookfield, just south of I-94. The address is:<br>
<br>
Champps <br>
1240 S Moorland Rd<br>
Brookfield, WI<br>
<br>
Details on menu here:<br>

===============================================<br>
We also have reservations at Matteo's Italian Ristorante on Saturday at 6:30 pm.  It is just a few blocks west of the park. They also  allow separate checks. The address is:<br>
<br>
Matteo's<br>
1608 E. Sunset Drive<br>
Waukesha, WI<br>
<br>
They have pizza and other Italian sandwiches, pastas, entrees. More info here:<br>

I have created a .pdf file that shows a map of these locations, including the park that the event is at. This might get you to the map:<br>

<br>
One last reminder:  Be sure to dress somewhat warmly on Saturday during the day (or bring layers).  Even if the rain holds off, temperatures are only expected to be in the low to mid 50s.<br>
