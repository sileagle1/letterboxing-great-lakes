                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for keeping us updated on this issue and posting the results <br/>
of the meeting(s) between the geocache community and the Parks Dept.<br/>
<br/>
I am also disappointed to learn of this new policy and agree with <br/>
those who feel it is short-sighted.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; Seems like they are actually standing to lost money this way. For<br/>
one, they need somebody to deal with the permits and fees and<br/>
paperwork, and to routinely check out the boxes in the park, whereas<br/>
now, they just go about peacefully co-existing. Seocndly, if I<br/>
planted a box (for free) and myself plus only 5 other letterboxers<br/>
paid the daily usage of $6 for that, they would net $36 without<br/>
having to hire anyone to do anything. By instating the charge, I<br/>
pull all of my boxes and they get nothing.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
With such a limited budget, I think the current staff will just be <br/>
expected to take on the extra burden in regards to paperwork and <br/>
implimenting the new policies.  I'm not sure the Parks Dept will be <br/>
hiring anyone extra to check out the boxes. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; On a more positive note.. I got another email from my letterboxer <br/>
friend who works at the State Park here and apparently although <br/>
there is a policy, there is room for individual decision-making on a<br/>
per park basis, and if the ranger decices to, he can look the other<br/>
way. Perhaps that is why I have not received the official "come get<br/>
your boxes or be prepared to pay" notice.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
We might get lucky and have the Rangers in the more popular parks <br/>
that have a high traffic volume, be willing to leave us alone, as <br/>
they are more likely to be able to meet the new self-sufficency <br/>
policy.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think, is it a good idea for all of the Letterboxing <br/>
community to simply leave our boxes in place until we are asked to <br/>
move them, or is the risk of confiscation with possible destruction <br/>
too great? <br/>
<br/>
More in the next post.<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>
