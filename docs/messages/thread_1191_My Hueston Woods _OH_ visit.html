This weekend my husband and I drove to the Cincinnati area to <br/>
visit Kings Island.  Before going home we stopped at Hueston <br/>
Woods State Park.  It's a sentimental spot for us because we <br/>
used to live nearby and often visited the park to picnic and fly <br/>
kites.  We didn't have a lot of time but we did look for a few <br/>
letterboxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
First we looked for and found Seuss #1.  We were the first <br/>
finders on that one.  Then we looked for, but were unable to find <br/>
Sno.  I hope we just overlooked it.  Finally, we looked for, and <br/>
found the Thrasher.  As an added bonus, it had a hitchhiker <br/>
hiding in it.<br/>
<br/>
Two new boxes plus a hitchhiker for us -- and a fun day at Kings <br/>
Island.  I'd say the weekend was a success.  <br/>
<br/>
On Friday before we left, we went and checked on the new box <br/>
we planted last week at the Capitol in Lansing.  It had only been <br/>
five days since it was planted, but we were already antsy to see if <br/>
it was still all right -- we're like new parents!  Anyway, it was fine, <br/>
still in its hiding spot, although no one had stamped in yet.<br/>
