 I know at least a few of us have had some bad<br>
 experiences when geocachers find one of our boxes, but today<br>
 I got this note from one that actually took the time to read<br>
 the info in a box I planted in Kansas in<br>
 2013.  ====================================My son and I were on the<br>
 trail last weekend and found<br>
 your container.  As experienced<br>
 geocachers we assumed we stumbled onto one. I hadn't<br>
 heard of letterboxing and<br>
 decided to look it up using the links you provided. Very<br>
 interesting! <br>
  I noticed it<br>
 was last found over a year ago but am<br>
 writing you simply to report that it's in great<br>
 condition and is located right<br>
 where your clues lead!   Cheers!  <br>
