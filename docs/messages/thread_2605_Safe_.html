Looking Glass" safe & sound tonight when we went to collect two of <br>
the other temporary boxes.  It was in the exact spot we originally <br>
hid it and was well covered.  No need for G.G. to be sad any longer- <br>
we will be mailing his box to him in the next day or two.<br>
<br>
I forgot a few other thank-you's in my first message.  We really <br>
appreciated the special tea box created by FungusWoman and logged <br>
into by the rest of you.  A great memento of the weekend!  <br>
<br>
Many thanks also to mom (Tabby Tales) who brought several handy <br>
things to the event.  The extra trash receptacles definitely came in <br>
handy and the chafing dishes helped rescue some of those hot dogs <br>
from becoming total cinders!<br>

We're still waiting to hear if Gooble Gobble & Jigsaw did go out for <br>
