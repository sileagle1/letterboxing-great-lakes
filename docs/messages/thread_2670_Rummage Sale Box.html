Four brave groups of letterboxers went to the lemonade stand in 90+ degree weather and asked for 'hot chocolate'.  It was wonderful to see letterboxing friends in the midst of our driveway full of toys.  Special thanks to Beetle who arrived along with a down pour and as I was yelling 'Someone grab the other end of this table' she replied 'Okay!' and helped me into the garage!<br>
<br>
Thanks Dragon, for a great idea!<br>

Just wrote you about possibly of getting this box for the 29/30th of <br>
July.  I'm having a garage sale that day in preparation for my move to <br>
the PNW (yes, the rumors are true).  <br>
<br>
While I'm at it I might as well put a 'save the date' out there for <br>
Aug. 13th.  Friends and family are throwing me a going away/birthday <br>
shindig at Alpine Park in Rockford, if anyone wants to come by for an <br>
exchange.  There's at least one box in the park and several more that <br>
are a short drive away.  It's gonna be a pretty casual BYO kinda thing, <br>
if anyone's interested in cooking out.  There will be a very special <br>
guest in attendance who will probably be very happy at the prospect of <br>
this turning into a mini-gathering, since it'll help him avoid the evil <br>
glares of my mom ;).  I don't know a lot of you that well, since I'm <br>
not the most social person on this list, but I'll still be happy to <br>
have ya!  <br>
