Deedle & I tried to find it last night, and we searched and searched and searched, and either that's a very well hidden box, we didn't follow the clues properly (but all the landmarks fell into place, so we think, unlike our 100 Acres trip, we were on the right path), or alas, it's gone.  I've emailed the placer, but out of curiosity thought I'd ask the list if anyone found it recently.<br>

To assuage ourselves, we went to get ice cream afterwards.  I had a Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Cone...as in, the cone was actually made out of chocolate chip cookie dough.  Yummm....if you're on Pearl Road in Strongsville, Ohio, visit Olympia's :)<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>

How sad, because it was a neat, little out-of-the-way place.
