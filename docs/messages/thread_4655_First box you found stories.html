<br/>
When did you find your first box? June 2005<br/>
Which box was yit? The NEA2 box<br/>
Who was the placer? I have no idea. I don't think they were big boxers <br/>
(maybe even high schoolers?). We chose it because it was on our side of <br/>
town. <br/>
Where was the box (general location, don't give away secrets)? In a <br/>
very wet, very buggy, very deserted area near the train tracks. Oh <br/>
yeah, did I mention it had just poured about an hour before we went <br/>
out? It was VERY wet and buggy. <br/>
Was anyone with you? B, of course. <br/>
Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox? That <br/>
despite the wet and bugginess we were hooked and went on a mad <br/>
letterboxing spree for the rest of the summer. :-)<br/>

still remember the excitement of spotting the container, sneakily <br/>
nabbing it and going off to see what was really in these containers.  I <br/>
remember marveling over all the sig stamps and how great they all <br/>
looked.  Of course, we didn't know who any of those people were at that <br/>
point--wish I could go back to that logbook now and see who was in it. <br/>

Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox?  This was our 1st box. The Wormy Wanderers were just a few feet ahead of us, and we were SO excited to actually meet other Letterboxers on our 1st time out.  We got to get one of their Signature stamps, and we traded our stamps with them as well, and at that time we didn't have a trail name yet.  By, our 3rd box that day, we came up with our trail names and our grup trail name, Brat Pack IL.  My parents, the kids and I love it so much, we plan in the winter what boxes we're going to try to find in the summer, and we make a full day of it on the weekend!  =)  <br/>

When did you find your first box?   8/20/2004   You never forget your first time!<br/>
<br/>
Which box was it?   Lake Bluff Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Who was the placer?    Wayfaring Stranger and Ramblin' Boy<br/>
<br/>
Where was the box (general location, don't give away secrets)?   In a steep ravine leading to the beach.  <br/>
<br/>
Was anyone with you?  My husband came along as my protector.  He seems to think that I would go to any extreme to find and retrieve a letterbox.  (He's almost right too.)  <br/>
<br/>
Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox?    <br/>
<br/>
The first box I attempted to find while I was on vacation in Door County, WI. was Mink River.  That was an ambitious undertaking because it took me 3 return vacation visits to finally find that box...and it was sooooo worth it!  After my first failed attempt to find that box, I returned home from vacation only to find there was a letterbox in the village where I live.  The Lake Bluff Letterbox was placed on 4/13/2003 and it's still there because it's in a well thought out location.  No idea who Wayfaring Stranger or Ramblin' Boy are, but I'd love to thank them for giving me that first 'rush' of excitement we all feel when we discover our first find.  I still get that feeling when I creep up on a box and find it.  <br/>

Well, it was kind of my second.  But it was the first one that I <br/>
actually had a real stamp and log book.  The very first one I found was <br/>
with my aunt and cousins and it wasn't actually in the right spot.  My <br/>
cousin and I saw this little piece of white paper in a tree and it <br/>
turned out to be a clue that someone had left when they moved it from <br/>
where the actual placer had planted it.  I went back to get this stamp <br/>
later on once I had made my stamp and got a log book.  Since that day, <br/>
this hobby has turned in to a bit of obbsession for me.<br/>

couple of clues, grabbed a couple of Stampin' Up stamps and went out.  <br/>
The girls and I found three that day and then came home and placed our <br/>
first order for MasterCarve.  We found more the next day...and the <br/>
next...<br/>
As soon as the MasterCarve arrived, I carved our sig stamp...and 10 <br/>
stamps for boxes to plant. <br/>
Funny thing is, the friend who introduced us really isn't boxing much <br/>
anymore.<br/>

It was actually a pretty amazing find because, as we later found out, <br/>
we weren't using our compass correctly.  We also jumped the gun, <br/>
heading for the wrong side of Milwaukee entirely because we hadn't read <br/>
the clue as carefully as we should have.  It was an adventurous day, <br/>
capped (thankfully) by a wonderful box and stamp.<br/>

snow.  We were crazy. Our research skills have<br/>
improved considering we drove around for an hour<br/>
trying to find the place we needed to be...and then<br/>
found it was in the same park that a portion of our<br/>
first date was spent in.  Sara got really excited when<br/>
she saw the box.  I'm told that it's the same reaction<br/>
she had when she got a huge stuffed Big Bird as a two<br/>
year old.  Also it was similar to the reaction I got<br/>
from her when I proposed...so you know...marriage<br/>
proposal...tupperware with a stamp...they are about<br/>
the same! :D<br/>

looking <br/>

my first letterbox was found 12/30/06<br/>
it was stuck on you by stripey in holland michigan<br/>
 i got into letterboxing after reading an article in my local paper <br/>
about it - i decided it would add a nice twist to my 2-3 hour daily <br/>
walks.and , i can say - after the first couple - i am hooked. most of <br/>
my boxes were planted by mrs.dglvrs- she plants in most of my <br/>
stomping grounds - i usually go out by myself - my first one i found <br/>
by myself-<br/>
 i love to gather the clues in batches according to where i <br/>
walk ,then take off after work each day and hunt - sometimes i spend <br/>
a whole weekend just boxing - relaxing fun exercise!!!<br/>
i am awaiting my first postal letterbox - so exciting!!!<br/>

Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox?  We were in<br/>
Madison to visit the annual Art Fair on the Square.  I had heard about<br/>
letterboxing from a friend in May and immediately figured it was something<br/>
we'd like.  I read as much as I could about it, but thought carving sounded<br/>
complicated.  I therefore ordered some custom stamps for us and we finally<br/>
were ready to go out on our first hunt.  We were in flip-flop sandals which<br/>
wasn't too good for off-trail walking, but we managed to find it after we<br/>
went well past it and had to backtrack. We concluded the planter must have<br/>
counted steps by putting heel to toe each time - those were the shortest<br/>
steps we've ever run across!  We were thrilled that we actually found the<br/>
hidden box and it was fun to read the logbook.  That was the start of our<br/>
obsession.... (we're still certified addicts since we ended 2007 by finding<br/>
our 2,700th box!)<br/>

Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox?  I<br/>
had read about letterboxing several months earlier in the blog of a<br/>
New England web friend and immediately got excited about this thing<br/>
that combined everything I loved (hiking, art, puzzles, clues,<br/>
treasure hunts).  Imagine my disappointment when I discovered there<br/>
were no letterboxes anywhere near me (at the time, Michigan had only a<br/>
handful of boxes on the east side of the state).  I kind of forgot<br/>
about it until we were planning a weekend trip to Chicago later that<br/>
summer.  I checked for clues and sure enough there were a couple of<br/>
boxes in Chicago (back then, there were literally only a *couple* of<br/>
boxes in the metro Chicago area).  I found a suitable rubber stamp (I<br/>
actually found a stamp that said "Spring Chicken" and cut off the "en"<br/>
part), and we stopped en route at an office supply store to pick up a<br/>
notebook that sufficed as our first logbook.  At the time, OldShoe was<br/>
not really buying into the whole thing and insisted he did not need a<br/>
stamp of his own.  Fortunately for me, it rained most of the weekend,<br/>
so hunting for a letterbox *underneath* the streets of Chicago made<br/>
perfect sense.  Our journey to the box was part comedy and part<br/>
creepy.  Imagine two middle-aged, middle-classed, touristy types (i.e.<br/>
camera, khaki shorts, Birkenstocks) walking around in the underbelly<br/>
of Chicago, poking around in support posts looking for a rubbermaid<br/>
container.  For a while, we had a scruffy guy with a cart following us<br/>
and had to ditch him before we could continue looking for the box. <br/>
But we found it, actually OldShoe found it, which made him a convert<br/>
and left him asking, "where is the next box?"  So we left there and<br/>
headed to the Magic Hedge, another Matt the Rat box which is an even<br/>
creepier story for another time (needless to say we have a deep<br/>
respect for Matt the Rat boxes).  Despite the unsavory aspects of<br/>
those first two finds, we spent the whole 3 hours back home plotting<br/>
where we would plant letterboxes in West Michigan... and the rest, as<br/>
they say, is history.<br/>

Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox? We had been with Trail Rider and her husband in Lake Forest and she found a letterbox there.  It seemed like a great hobby and a lot of fun ... and I've been hooked ever since.  Our first box was the 2nd in a series.  We hadn't bought a compass yet, and a compass was needed for the first box.  We tried to find it (without a compass) but couldn't, so we went on to the 2nd and found it.  What great fun it's turned out to be, and I've now letterboxed in 9 States!<br/>

Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox?      Not the tears that Mrs. Doglvrs may or may not have shed, but there was definitely a chill of excitement down my spine when we found them.  I wasn't quite sure how to log in...I hadn't yet carved a sig stamp, but had an old stamp that was made when I was a kid (long ago) from a picture of me when I was little.  I also brought along a stamper with my real name and address.  I stamped both into the logbook, but once we got home, I freaked out about including my personal info.   (In fact, I believe I posted here asking about it, and I think azobox responded).  Deb graciously went back to the box and obliterated the info for me.<br/>
     Flash-forward two months to the 2004 GLK Gathering in northern Illinois.  Who was the very first letterboxer I met in person?  None other than DebRocks herself!  (cue TZ music)  Was that cool or what?<br/>

When did you find your first box?<br/>
I'm a Newbie, Oct., 10 2007 <br/>
<br/>
Which box was it?<br/>
Abraham Lincoln<br/>
<br/>
Who was the placer?<br/>
Snakes on a Plane<br/>
<br/>
Where was the box (general location, don't give away secrets)?<br/>
Carpenters Park just north of Springfield, IL<br/>
<br/>
Was anyone with you?<br/>
My almost husband, and the two dogs Kate &amp; Zelda<br/>
<br/>
Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox?<br/>
I was the first finder of my first LB! it was so cool.  I had found <br/>
some clues online, but put off going until i had carved my sig stamp. <br/>
(the way too large one that is still missing, but that i still want to <br/>
find.)  So i looked up the clues again and there, low and behold was a <br/>
new box!  I had had many delays in getting out to get the other two <br/>
boxes i knew of and a couple more delays once i found the clues to this <br/>
one.  But the obsession was so bad (yes even before finding a single <br/>
box) that i got up early  and played hookie for a couple of hours to go <br/>
get this new box.  On the way out of the park,we read the sign, NO DOGS <br/>
ALLOWED!  Horses on the appropriate path, but no dogs.  We got out of <br/>
there without any trouble and the clues now reflect the no dogs status. <br/>
<br/>
It's a good thing it turned out that way as just a few days later my <br/>
daughter was hospitalized for a month, and then lots of PT after that. <br/>
(all better now) But the joy of that first box (and FW's kind words and <br/>
encouragement) kept me going until i could get back out after <br/>
Thanksgiving. (now have a grand total of 12 finds, and 1 HH.)<br/>
<br/>
Now i'm looking forward to a Big Boxing 2008!!<br/>
<br/>
PPE, who should be carving a new sig stamp!  I'm going, I'm going,  <br/>
never fear,(FW &amp; Stacy) i will have a stamp for Sat.! (might have to <br/>
take tomorrow afternoon off lol!, but i will have a stamp.)<br/>

was (a pretty open spot) they didn't understand the concept of moving a rock <br/>
to  find a box so I did that honor. Afterward we all walked back to the van to <br/>
stamp  in and I told Katie and Alex that there was a little doggy in the <br/>
box.... Katie  started to actually tremble and she gave my leg a hug as she hid <br/>
behind me...  fearing a little dog would jump out of the box. I had to reassure <br/>
her that it  was just a stamp of a dog.<br/>

Actually, the first box we started to solve is from Springchick called<br/>

everywhere. My kids were in heaven!(Reminds me of a TJ_Mich box at<br/>

It was 23 degrees outside and our 2nd attempt of the day. We'd learned about letterboxing from a newspaper article one week earlier, and in the interim we carved a stamp and got ready to head out.  We looked really hard for another box, The Secret Garden, in Royal Oak, MI but were unsuccessful.  So we were thrilled to find this one!  (At this point there were 116 letterboxes in Michigan, but only 18 in the southeastern nine-county area.)  As we headed back to the car, J made a rule that it had to be at least 40 degrees for future letterboxing attempts -- which we have mostly, but not always followed.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, out of our first 6 letterbox attempts, in Michigan and Colorado, we only found 2 of them (and the others were all subsequently confirmed missing).  Since then, thankfully, our ratio has improved quite a bit!!<br/>

I only had one daycare kid that day so the kids and I decided to try <br/>
for another box (first attempted was missing) It was a hot day but <br/>
the woods made a cool shade on us. the two 2-year-olds were happy to <br/>
be walking on the trails and all 5 of us were very excited. The noon <br/>
day heat made the walk a lot longer than I remembered this park ever <br/>
being before but we found the box. But once we found it I was so <br/>
scared someone would discover what we were doing I didn't even take <br/>
the time to look at any of the other stamps, I just wanted to get <br/>
that thing hidden and get us out of there. but the walk back, well, <br/>
the coool of the trees wasn't so cool anymore and the toddlers were <br/>
not as excited to walk. since I hadn't brought the stroller I ended <br/>
up walking the whole way back carrying both of the little kids. We <br/>
were so hot and thirsty we drove home to get drinks (and strollers) <br/>
before we attempted the 2nd box in the same park, unfortunatly the <br/>
second one was in full sun and we never found it due to exaustion.<br/>

This box was planted by azobox, and let me tell you, when we found it, <br/>
it was cold, cold, cold, with no snow on the ground.  We said, "Why are <br/>
we doing this?"  But when we found it, it was like, all of a sudden, it <br/>
got warm outside.  A miracle happened, and so a hobby was born.<br/>
<br/>
We are most impressed that springchick and oldshoe's first find was <br/>
Chicago Underground. It took us three tries to find that box.  Lots of <br/>
construction in that area at the time.  That's our excuse and we're <br/>
sticking to it.<br/>

  WHAT A THRILL. We actually started looking for the Sherwood Point <br/>
Box which was in the same general area. Unfortunately due to the <br/>
trickiness' of the clues for that box at least for a beginner <br/>
(getting dj vu, finding the correct trail sign, and sighting the <br/>
reverse azimuth of B) that it ended up being our second find. The <br/>
Door County Tradition was on the same trail and was an easier find so <br/>
it was officially our first. While we sat there marveling at our <br/>
first box and checking out the log book in preperation of stamping in <br/>
3 deer walked up just below the rock that we were sitting on. What a <br/>
GREAT start. We went on to find 11 boxes and 1 hitchiker during our <br/>
first week of boxing in Door County. We're now up to 28 finds, and 2 <br/>
HH. I guess it will be a while befor we see 1000 boxes but we're <br/>
hooked so we'll keep looking for them.<br/>
<br/>
I would like thank all of you boxers out there for all of the help, <br/>
encourgement and good will that you have given me as I am getting <br/>
into this great new hobbie.<br/>

Which box was it?  Treasure Hunt (?).  It was before we got our official logbook.  We went back after we designed our family stamp to re-stamp in, but it was gone<br/>

Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox? Our 3 year old (at the time) absolutely loved it!  It was a short one, but written just for young kids...we were pirates searching for our treasure.  We've been boxing ever since.  Our favorite find so far (and we've been boxing all over on vacations, etc.) was right in our own backyard...TJ Mich's M Go Blue on North Campus.  Great clues for adults and fun things for the kids, too...they loved the hills!  We are the ones that the dad can't box right now without a wheelchair.  Long story short, we were boxing on a mountain hike in GA in June (he had the 3 year old in a backpack and the baby in the frontpack at the same time hiking up a steep trail...it was great!).  And now he can't even go to the mall without a wheelchair.  Spent a month in UM hospital and was diagnosed with Stills.  Still hasn't been back to work.  So, we haven't boxed since he got sick in August.  And we had to take<br/>
 Spring off because he was recovering from rotator cuff surgery (had a worse than avg tear and was in a sling for over 6 weeks). Needless to say, 2007 wasn't a fun year...except for the baby, of course.  I have been living vicariously through you all so keep telling your stories please.  We will be back out there in the spring.  I noticed on AQ boxes are listed as Handicap Accessible.  Thanks for that!  Looking forward to meeting you all...almost made it to Hell, but doctor's appt's got in the way.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting in 2008!<br/>

<br/>
When did you find your first box? May 24, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Which box was it? Interlochen<br/>
<br/>
Who was the placer? Esperanza<br/>
<br/>
Where was the box (general location, don't give away secrets)? <br/>
Interlochen, MI...in a stump<br/>
<br/>
Was anyone with you? Brown Rabbit (no Rainy-Day Rabbit yet) <br/>
<br/>
Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox?<br/>
We had read the article about letterboxing in the Free Press that <br/>
previous winter, and we knew that this hobby was for us! So, for our <br/>
4th wedding anniversary I (Gray Rabbit) surprised Brown Rabbit with a <br/>
trip up to Traverse City for some letterboxing adventures! (In those <br/>
days there really weren't all that many boxes in our neck of the <br/>
woods.) I put together a package of all the essentials (stamp, <br/>
logbook, clues, compass etc.), wrapped it up nice and drove to the <br/>
location of our first what would-be-attempt ("Cherry Capital" in <br/>
Traverse City). Once there, I handed Brown his gift, and with a <br/>
completely confused look (What the heck are we doing in a parking lot <br/>
in downtown Traverse City.and what does it have to do with our <br/>
anniversary?) he opened it  and was ecstatic when he found out what <br/>
was going on.and that we could start adventurin' immediately. Like I <br/>
said, we didn't find that first box, but we headed out first thing <br/>
the next day to Interlochen in the pouring rain, armed with compasses <br/>
we didn't really know quite how to use (Probably should have read the <br/>
directions before heading out. :-)), saw a porcupine, and somehow we <br/>
found the box after searching in numerous stumps! Yay! It was <br/>
actually there!! It was a very exciting day! We have been completely <br/>
hooked ever since!! (And even know how to use our compasses now! ;-) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great topic.and letting us relive and share those <br/>
early boxing memories! It has been so interesting hearing about <br/>
people's first boxes too!<br/>

&gt; We are most impressed that springchick and oldshoe's<br/>
&gt; first find was <br/>
&gt; Chicago Underground. It took us three tries to find<br/>
&gt; that box.  Lots of <br/>
&gt; construction in that area at the time.  That's our<br/>
&gt; excuse and we're <br/>
&gt; sticking to it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I went with a group of 4 and that dang box took us all<br/>
day!<br/>
I wish I had some of the video they took of us that<br/>
day... 'eh FungusWoman, Jacks?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When did you find your first box? August 26, 2004.  Wow!  Reading these posts I'm somehow a little surprised to find that so many of the boxers I've looked up to as mentors and role models have only been boxing for a year or so longer!<br/>
<br/>
Which box was it? Blue Triceretops of the Dinosaur Hunt series (now listed as Green Triceretops)<br/>
<br/>
Who was the placer? It's listed as Stinkerbell on LbNA, but I seem to remember a different name when we originally looked up the clues...all I remember for sure was that the placer was from outside of the GLK region, I want to say she was from the pacific northwest<br/>
<br/>
Where was the box (general location, don't give away secrets)?Off the bike trail at Lake of the Woods in Mahomet, IL<br/>
<br/>
Was anyone with you?Katy, along with her dog Claire and my dog Aina (this was before the time of Yuki and Tatsu) and before Flying Dragon got into letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox? When we found this box, this series was the ONLY one within an hour of Champaign!  Originally we started out on the wrong side of the park (there's a highway that runs through it...the west side of the park has the bike trail and lots of natural prairie area...the east side has the lake and a golf course and more bike trail but not really any natural areas.  After hiking a mile, we realized the mile markers were going in the wrong direction and turned around to find the right part of the trail.  After driving to the other side of the park and starting in the middle of the clues, we went for the last two boxes in the series.  We found the triceretops no problem, except that the box and it's contents were scattered across the floor of the woods.  We went on to find the next box, only to look for "what might be a (some kind of tree...I don't remember the exact species" and see nothing but an entire grove of those<br/>
 darn trees!  It was starting to get dark, so we gave up and decided to try again another day.  On our next attempt, we only found one of the other boxes (Orange Ankylosaurus)...and ran into a woodchuck who was acting VERY strange.  It was walking right down the middle of the bike path and didn't even seem to notice the dogs.  On our way past that same spot when we were headed back towards the car we had forgotten about him...until Claire found him and proceeded to chew on his back!  He didn't react to it much...just a little squeak now and then...which REALLY made us nervous.  We call it Claire's rabid groundhog adventure!  The clues for this series are still up (and have been heavily revised)....maybe we'll have another go at it this year.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
When did you find your first box?   4-13-03<br/>
Which box was it?  Architectural Mystery Box<br/>
Who was the placer?  Yooperann<br/>
Where was the box? It is a mystery!<br/>
Was anyone with you?  No, I was alone (unless you count the 5-6 <br/>
squirrels that were running around the bench where I was sitting).<br/>
Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox?<br/>
It was good Friday and I had the day off of school.  I had recently <br/>
learned about letterboxing from a classmate while I was working on my <br/>
Master's but had been too busy to get out and try. When I realized I <br/>
had the day off I couldn't wait get started.  Back then there weren't <br/>
very many boxes in the area to choose from so I started reading <br/>
through the clues. When I found Yooperann's I was fairly certain I <br/>
knew the area where it was located and off I went.<br/>
I will never forget how the excitement built with each clue that I<br/>
found, in fact my heart actually started beating faster the closer I <br/>
got! When I found it I couldn't believe it. I remember thinking that <br/>
hundreds of people walked past that spot everyday but I knew a secret <br/>
that they didn't...it was too cool, I was hooked. <br/>

Actually, this would actually be my second attempt, but first find.  I <br/>

it anywhere.  Then I did Green One/Calatrava, but at the time, Green <br/>
One was MIA, so I was kind of getting discouraged.  When I found <br/>
Calatrava I was so excited.  The next day I found 5 more boxes right <br/>
away, and Ive been addicted ever since.  I did go back a few weeks <br/>
later and attempted to find Lucky Leprehaun, and found the box <br/>
destroyed, but the stamp was still okay.  I got it back to Wisconsin <br/>
Hiker and she replanted the box, I believe.<br/>

I remember finding this box and thinking, boy this is cool!  It was the start to a healthy addiction.  I am now at about 200 finds on the Letterboxing site, but I think I have a few more than that if you add the ones I've found at events and such.  <br/>

By the way, anyone know of any events coming up in the SE Wisconsin area?  I need something like that to look forward to.  If anyone is thinking of planning one, I'd love to help in any way that I can....<br/>

&gt; &gt; When did you find your first box?   February 3, 2003<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which box was it?   War Correspondence: Box 1 of the South Mountain Trinity<br/>
&gt; &gt; Who was the placer?  The Apple Dumpling Gang<br/>
&gt; &gt; Where was the box (general location, don't give away secrets)?  Burkittsville, MD<br/>
&gt; &gt; Was anyone with you?  Together as usual..Tiptoe &amp; Tonto<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox?  Tiptoe found out <br/>
about letterboxing in the summer/fall of 2002 by searching for carving sites for her art <br/>
students. At that time there were only about 20 boxes in all of northern Illinois..including <br/>
Chicago, but many more where on the east coast.  We needed to go out to Washington DC <br/>
shortly after Christmas that year for a family affair and decided to try our hand at this <br/>
crazy idea.  We love history, art and hiking...what could be better than letterboxing?  We <br/>
remember our first letterboxing event with more detail than our first kiss!  At least Tiptoe <br/>
didn't cry at the first kiss like she did upon finding that first box on the AT.  There was <br/>
snow on the ground and when we removed the lichen covered rock noted in the clue, and <br/>
spied our first tupperware, we froze, just staring down at the treasure in utter disbelief!  <br/>
We looked at each other with such amazement before diving into the hole to retrieve our <br/>
prize!  We couldn't believe that the clues actually did lead to such treasure!<br/>
We didn't have a stamp so we just signed in...We're not sure by what moniker..our real <br/>
names or if that is where we came up with Tiptoe &amp; Tonto on that very site.<br/>
<br/>
We were hooked!  We came home and we remember wondering what on earth Matt the Rat <br/>
and Spring Chick were like....We were in awe with their plants...But, just like <br/>
nowadays..most of our boxes are found outside of Illinois..I guess we equate letterboxing <br/>
with travel...<br/>
