Well, since that day is Mr. FW's and my anniversary, I suggest "27 years of<br/>
Krankiness" for the theme....  (Or maybe not...that makes me feel too old,<br/>
since a good number of members of this group haven't even been ALIVE that<br/>
long!)<br/>

The first thing I said to him Saturday when he returned from a fishing trip was "Hey, I know where I want to go for our anniversary...Door County. There's a letterboxing gathering that day." He agreed right away. He actually is more interested in bringing his metal detector up there, but will be bringinghis fishing gear too. (Are there any rules against detecting in Door County parks?) Told work not to schedule me that weekend, informed The Kid she's going to have to come home from college to house/dog sit, so we areall setto go!<br/>

Just like Fungus Woman, I've been planting the same seed of thought....Hey honey, let's go for our fall trip to Door County on (specifically) OCTOBER 4!!!  My husband automatically knew that there must be something letterboxing related for me to be that specific in my request.  <br/>
He's right too.  I guess we've been married too long.  He knows how I think.  <br/>
<br/>
So, Beetle is planning to come to the 10th Anniversary LbGLK Gathering!<br/>

Thanks Dragon.<br/>
