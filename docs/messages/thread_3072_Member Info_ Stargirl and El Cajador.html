                    <div class="plaintext-content">My trail name is Stargirl and I started letterboxing about a year ago. My husband, El Cajador, wasn't much interested in this obsession of mine at first.  Once our passport arrived for the Around the World Series he was hooked.    He is actually better at locating the boxes at the end of the search than I am so I'm glad to have him along on my boxing adventures!  Of course, he's good company for the journey too.<br>
   <br>
  We're getting ready to plant our first box and are also eagerly looking forward to attending our first gathering.  <br>
   <br>
  Once in a while we take El Cajador's son boxing with us.  He usually mopes along the path at first showing us that he certainly isn't interested in hiking through the woods.  Then he gets caught up in the clues and is almost running down the path to find the box.  <br>
   <br>
  We're eager to meet some of the people whose trail names we run into in the log books.  <br>
   <br>
  Thanks for planting boxes.  We certainly are enjoying our quests.<br>
   <br>
