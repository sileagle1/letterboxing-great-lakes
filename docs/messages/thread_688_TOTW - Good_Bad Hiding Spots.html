What do you consider to be the elements of a good letterbox hiding <br/>

The boxes of Finding Your Way seem to survive although it would defy<br/>
all common sense.  Some of the boxes are right out in the open for all<br/>
to see and many are in very busy locations where sneakiness would be<br/>
very difficult - although since the box is right there in plain sight,<br/>
there seems to be no need for sneakines!  The boxes are huge and could<br/>
not be easily hidden in little holes, etc.  Personally, I was<br/>
surprised all of the boxes were still in place when I went to look for<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Although these boxes break all of the traditional "don'ts", they seem<br/>
to have survived just fine.  I would not suggest trying it yourself. <br/>
Maybe the people on Grosse Ile are just very nice about respecting<br/>
other people's property.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great topic, as I was just going to mention something<br/>
about this after a letterboxing experiencing I had<br/>
yesterday. One should not hide boxes in a place where<br/>
someone could get seriously injured trying to obtain<br/>
the box. I'm not talking about up a mountain or<br/>
anything, as most people who go up a mountain do so at<br/>
their own risk. I'm not even talking about sand dunes,<br/>
as everyone knows how fond I am of those. The scenario<br/>
i'm talking about involves hiking on a flat, paved<br/>
trail. Okay, so you get the clue and head out on the<br/>
paved trail. You eventually find the spot where the<br/>
box is, the clue is very specific....and it apparently<br/>
is on the underside of a bridge support. Now, there is<br/>
no way to get to the spot to even have a look without<br/>
crossing the safety rail and sliding down a very short<br/>
and steep embankment of gravel. One false move, and<br/>
you're heading about 15 feet down into a creek. You<br/>
try to see if the box *might* be hidden as such where<br/>
you can get it from the main trail. Nope. This is a<br/>
bad hiding spot, you declare! I tried to get down the<br/>
embankment (foolishly) to have a look, but gave<br/>
up....again...I would rather live than have box in<br/>
hand and be dead. Placers should keep in mind the<br/>
general safety of the finders. If your box is placed<br/>
in a rugged area (mountain, dune, cliff) fine, warn<br/>
the finder in the clue. As long as the powers that be<br/>
say you can be there, it's game. However, don't make a<br/>
find unnecessarily difficult by placing it somewhere<br/>
that humans should not be in the first place. A box<br/>
should never be on the other side of safety rails,<br/>
guard rails, or anywhere already sectioned off by<br/>
rangers due to safety concerns. <br/>

Although I've never been lucky enough to go on one of these hunts, I think my favorite hiding spots are in really open, populated places.  Like hidden under a bench with magnets, or in a book tucked in a library, or under the lose floorboard in a building.  Those.  Yeah....those kick butt.  Or I *think* they'd kick butt, since, as I said, I've never found one of those boxes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The boxes that stink are the ones Dragon mentioned.  I get angry when I think of those.  Like they *offend* me or something.  It's probably just jealousy, that a big old honking box just placed right on the ground, with no attempt to cover would remain, but super well hidden boxes go missing.  Argh!  And the thing is, it's a *good* series.  There is some really really great historical information and the story is fun...it's just those dang "hiding" spots (and if you can't hear the sarcasm in my voice, then you need to hang out around more adolescents).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good hiding places -- In the woods, not on main trails, not off trail <br/>
in areas where dense undergrowth would facilitate a social trail.  <br/>
Interesting historical sites are great, but not right at the place, <br/>
rather off on a side trail or at the edge of the property.<br/>
<br/>
Bad hiding places -- Very busy public areas are a bad idea both for <br/>
the longevity of the box and also for potential finders.   I once <br/>
found a box located at a very busy public place and had to wait over <br/>
2 hours to replace the box because the coast was never clear.  Being <br/>
from out of town, I knew I wouldn't be back and didn't want to take <br/>
the box with me.  The placer also was not from the area, so mailing <br/>
it back to them for replacement was also not a viable option.  I <br/>
would have much rather spent that 2 hours hiking a 4-5 mile round-<br/>
trip letterbox than sitting on a bench waiting for an opportune time <br/>
to replace the box.  Another box I found was located along an outdoor <br/>
stairway at a busy public place.  The finder was clearly in view to <br/>
people both at the top of the stairway and at the bottom of the <br/>
stairway.  Once I spotted the box in its hiding spot, I was hoping to <br/>
be able to non-chalantly bend down and tie my shoe and swoop up the <br/>
box.  No such luck -- the reach was more than my arms could get to.  <br/>
I actually ended up having to climb over onto the other side of the <br/>
stairway railing to get the box.  Again, there was significant time <br/>
waiting for a time where people were not within eyesight -- both to <br/>
retrieve the box and replace it.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that sometimes there is a scenic or interesting place you <br/>
want to bring people to with a letterbox that doesn't have a trail <br/>
system or a good out-of-the-way hiding spot -- those are hard, but <br/>
easier to understand why the planter chose the place they did.  What <br/>
I don't understand is why a person would choose a park with a great <br/>
set of hiking trails, and then place the box in an open area within <br/>
plain view of the picnic area, rather than off on one of the trails.<br/>
<br/>
People are by nature suspicious of anyone who doesn't quite fit in.  <br/>
Even with a camera in hand, there are some places where it is almost <br/>
impossible to not look out of place just because you are lingering or <br/>
searching (no matter how discreet you try to be).  Especially in this <br/>
day and age where security is heightened and everyone is more on <br/>
guard, I am not sure why it would be worth the risk.  Not only is <br/>
there potential for losing the box or the finder and/or placer <br/>
getting in trouble, but it also gives letterboxing a bad name.<br/>
<br/>
Another place where letterboxes don't belong is private property -- <br/>
unless the clues very clearly state that it is private property and <br/>
that permission has been obtained.  Likewise, instructing finders to <br/>
walk over private property to get to the box, even if the box is not <br/>
on private land, is a bad idea.  Following clues to a letterbox on <br/>
private property in cases where permission has not been obtained is <br/>
trespassing.  I recall hunting a box that required one to walk across <br/>
private property along Lake Michigan.  A property owner's rights to <br/>
the beach extend about 3 feet into the water.  I guess in summer it <br/>
would be possible to get there without trespassing by swimming or <br/>
walking in the water, but any other time of year, walking across the <br/>
beach is trespassing.<br/>
<br/>
I personally do not care for urban boxes or boxes at roadside rest <br/>
areas, although I admit there is a time and a place -- urban boxes <br/>
can provide great historical and architectural exposure and roadside <br/>
stops are nice leg-stretchers on long expanses of highway.  I guess <br/>
the reason these do not appeal to me so much is not having the <br/>
element of nature.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Deedle is a very big fan of the "round trip letterbox" - a box that sends you one way to find it, and then provides an alternate route to get back to your car rather than retracing your steps.  Of course, our first plant Kumbaya doens't necessarily fit this description, but that box was mainly my idea and plant, so he can deal with that.<br/>
<br/>
I love it when the box takes us to a very scenic place, or historic place, some little gem we never knew existed.  Esp. if it's along Lake Erie.  But, like SpringChick said, you've got to make sure there's then a place off-the-beaten path (that won't create a new beaten path) to hide the box.  If the search for the box takes you past an ice cream stand, that's always a bonus for me ;)  Someone else mentioned having a good place to stamp in close by, yes, that's always a good thing, esp. if the box is hidden in a more secluded area where you can take your time to read through the logbook, which is one of my favorite things to do when I find a box.  <br/>
<br/>
What I don't like is when the box takes you too far off the trail and I feel like Uncle Travelling Matt in the woods needing a machete.  (Anyone get the Fraggle Rock reference?)  I've become a very big spaz about stepping on plants when we go off-trail and am always snapping at Deedle, "Watch where you're stepping!  You just smashed that plant!"  It took him a few minutes once to reassure me when I accidently snapped a tree's branch when holding on to it for support during a letterbox walk up a hill.<br/>
<br/>
Living by Lake Erie, I love visiting the lake.  There are already a handful of boxes hidden at lakeside parks.  I'm slowly developing ideas to populate the rest of the lakeside parks that don't have boxes hidden there yet.  Then you can all come visit us and do a Lake Erie Letterbox Tour :)  I think it would be neat to hide a box by the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame.  There's a park next to it, but it's a city park (ie, no trees, manacured grass).  We need to take a trip down there one day to see if there are any feasible hiding places....<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

areas around rivers and lakes, my favorite hiding places tend to be in<br/>
fallen logs, trees, and under wooden trail-side structures (such as<br/>
bridges or stairs) on less-used paths.  I also like to use animal<br/>
trails to take people off main trails becuase it prevents/masks social<br/>
trails.  <br/>
<br/>
In recent outings to Starved Rock and Turkey Run, I've taken a strong<br/>
dislike to hiding boxes on busy trails.  There are two boxes in Turkey<br/>
Run that are very well hidden and the locations would be excellent<br/>
except that they are both right on one of the busiest trails in the<br/>
