Your pictures were a refreshing visual distraction from the damp, <br/>
gray sky and white ground that we are presently peering at!<br/>
It was fun to see images of places we've visited along the way with <br/>
other letterboxers.  Kind of like sharing visual DNA with you all!<br/>
...Dragon's "45-90" box covered in snow?...For sure not the same shot <br/>
we have taken during an August rain storm!  But, I think we have the <br/>
exact shot of the famous French icon!<br/>
But our favorite has to be Doodle &amp; Deedle's picture from Marian Park <br/>
in Ohio of the blooming redbud tree (a sure sign of spring!)... No <br/>
doubt pointing the way up those awesome wooden steps to letterbox <br/>
heaven!<br/>
It has been so long since we've been able to letterbox that it is <br/>
certain we will be more rusty and pathetic than usual at decoding <br/>
easy clues...things are so bad that Tiptoe has even resorted to <br/>
carving stamps!  Some may have seen the introduction of our new <br/>
series...but others may not have...<br/>
<br/>
In tribute to those who made the journey of us reaching "500 boxes <br/>
found" so delightful, we have introduced a series called "Tiptoe &amp; <br/>
Tonto's Favorite Letterboxers."  Needless to say, this could include <br/>
ALL of you...but, at the current carving rate we will have moved into <br/>
a letterboxing-assisted living environment before even a few get <br/>
finished AND planted!(BTW, our answer to SC's TOTW "What we want to <br/>
accomplish"...)<br/>
<br/>
But, we are going to try our best to plant a few this spring...Be on <br/>
the lookout!...Our placement in no way shows favoritism!... It is <br/>
strictly dictated by our travel schedule coinciding with the chosen <br/>
letterboxers completed stamp...Our #1 and #2 have been planted in <br/>
Arizona...#3 and #4???? ...your guess is as good as ours!  All chosen <br/>
letterboxers will remain a mystery until you actually stamp <br/>
them...Please don't spoil it for anyone by telling who exactly is <br/>
depicted.<br/>
Tiptoe....and Tonto<br/>
