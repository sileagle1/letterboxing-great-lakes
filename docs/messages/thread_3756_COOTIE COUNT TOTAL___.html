How many cooties were at the SILO event?  How many cooties do you currently have in your possession after attending the SILO event?<br>

  Yeah, and for me being a microbiologist and all, the Infection <br>
  Control practices were pretty slack. I brought home two cooties <br>
  myself, and I was hit by I think at least three others besides.<br>
<br>
  You know, I think we'd better give those Brats some inoculations <br>
  before we let them in to any other gatherings....<br>

  Sweet little Skeeter! She was playing so nicely.  Little did we suspect her as one of the culprits spreading cooties at the Silo.  We've got to watch those children....they are obviously having a tremendous amount of fun pulling tricks on us and hiding cooties in our items.  <br>

I didn't know they were being found and passed to the next person already.  I didn't want anyone left out.  Bubba and Peanut were the culprits in my group of hiding them, and I think we came home with 4 from ours that didn't get passed out, plus Lil "A" got his 1st cootie in his seat!!!  I'm sorry if there were too many, like I said thought they wouldn't be found until later.  My bad.   I promise the next gathering no cooties.  (Fingers not crossed either.)  I'll go sit in a corner for a time out now.   At least I thought carving all those stamps kept me out of trouble....I guess I find it anyway!!! =)  LOL<br>

But I still went home with 5 cooties. Plus, Fungus Woman now reports that she has two cooties. That means that between the three of us, there were at least TWELVE COOTIES at this event! And I'm sure that there were more than 12. Let's keep this count going. <br>
 <br>
 How many cooties were at the SILO event? How many cooties do you currently have in your possession after attending the SILO event?<br>
 <br>
 Dragon - 5<br>
 Beetle - 5<br>
 Fungus Woman - 2<br>
 Add you name and cootie count here!<br>

ok ok..I got a little cootie crazed. I didn't think anyone find them until they got home. I made 36 cooties so everyone would get 1. I didn't know they were being found and passed to the next person already. I didn't want anyone left out. Bubba and Peanut were the culprits in my group of hiding them, and I think we came home with 4 from ours that didn't get passed out, plus Lil "A" got his 1st cootie in his seat!!! I'm sorry if there were too many, like I said thought they wouldn't be found until later. My bad. I promise the next gathering no cooties. (Fingers not crossed either.) I'll go sit in a corner for a time out now. At least I thought carving all those stamps kept me out of trouble....I guess I find it anyway!!! =) LOL<br>

Sweet little Skeeter! She was playing so nicely. Little did we suspect her as one of the culprits spreading cooties at the Silo. We've got to watch those children....they are obviously having a tremendous amount of fun pulling tricks on us and hiding cooties in our items. <br>

I made 36 stamps for the gift bags, made 36 cooties, the Nian Chinese Dragon event stamp, then I made us a PT and a smaller stamp for the HH and the cooties to stamp.  So I think I made about 75 stamps in the last 2 weeks for the gathering.  I did this when the kids were asleep, or I went over to my parents' house and carved them there while the "pack" played over at Gramma and Papas.  =)   Being up at all hours of the night with the baby has some advantages and disadvantages too...LOL<br>

  Measure Jeep Wrangler Unlimited and calculate the square feet inside, Find/Make as many cooties as humanly possible without losing mind, Go to gathering and get someone to distract Doodle and Deedle Bug with an awesome series, find enough people to quietly place all the cooties inside their jeep, filling to top, and hiding more under seats and in glovebox/armrests hehehehee<br>
