                    <div class="plaintext-content">The latest upgrade to letterboxing.org added status logging.  As a finder you now have the ability to log the boxes you have found (found or attempted), and as a planter you have the ability to log the status (i.e. condition) of a box you have planted.  To log a find or plant status, you click on the green flag.  For boxes whose clues are hosted at letterboxing.org, the little green flag is found on the clue page.  For boxes that automatically redirect to an alternate site for clues, the flag is found next to the box name in the region list.<br/>
<br/>
When a box has comments (i.e. somebody has logged a find), the status comments will display under the flag -- it will show the name of the person who last recorded a find OR attempt and the date.  If you do not wish for these status notes to show up for the boxes you have planted you can disable this by going to the Member Services page (it is at the bottom of the page).  Even if you disable status for the boxes you have planted, you can still log your finds and make status notes on your own boxes -- these will not show up anywhere if you have status disabled (I think the default is enabled).<br/>
<br/>
The state maps are also being updated and some new search features will also be added as part of these upgrades.  Most of the other changes are behind the scenes and will hopefully make the site more stable and reliable.<br/>

  I went to letterboxing.org today to check out if any<br/>
  new boxes were in the Cleveland area, and I noticed<br/>
  little green flags on the page by some of the clues. <br/>
  I haven't been a member of The Big List in a while, so<br/>
  I missed any announcements that were made there about<br/>

assumption is ideally it would be the first finder??  (Probably it would<br/>
work for new postings, but now on existing boxes maybe just the first person<br/>
to log in that they found it?)  I don't read the big list either, so I don't<br/>
know what the scoop is for sure.<br/>

I did notice there are a lot more boxes in Illinois than when I last<br/>
checked!  Now, who is going to find me some time to look for them?<br/>
