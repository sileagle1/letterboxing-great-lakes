Alas, we are still looking at rain in the forecast for Saturday.  Sunday looks lovely for those of you staying for the entire weekend.  If anyone has any canopies we could put up to provide extra shelter, it would be great if you could bring them along.  You may also want to bring a towel to sit on if the picnic table benches are wet.  <br>

I have a question about the potluck, however... What time are we eating? Or is the food just going to be there for whenever? And are there any outlets? (I'm just wondering about keeping it warm!)<br>

Or bring your lawn chairs if you want some dry & more comfortable seating<br>
under canopies!  We'll bring a smaller canopy and I'm checking w/my brother<br>
to see if he still has a larger one that we could borrow.<br>
<br>
The forecast I'm looking at shows a 60% chance that it WON'T rain.  Trying<br>
to be optimistic!<br>

Even better - my brother & his wife said they would come and set up the<br>
canopy FOR us!!  Maybe they'll stick around for a bit since they have found<br>
a few boxes over the past few years.  They are very casual boxers, not the<br>
OBSESSED sort like most of us.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I listed the potluck for noon.  Usually someone has some pastry type stuff, trail bars or other type stuff that is out in the morning while people are stamping in and getting clue packs.  If I remember correctly there are 8 outlets, so plenty of plugins for crockpots.  If the rain will cooperate I'll throw a bag of charcoal on the grill.<br>
