I just found out recently that she broke her ankle letterboxing with <br/>
her daughter on Feb 12.  She slipped on some mud in Doctor's Park.  <br/>
She had a plate, four screws, and one pin inserted in her ankle. She <br/>
is now off the crutches but needs to wear a short boot.<br/>
<br/>
I told her that I hoped she hadn't completely given up on <br/>
letterboxing after this incident and she replied with this email:<br/>
<br/>
"Right before I broke my ankle, my daughter found the letterbox. She <br/>
wanted to drive me to the hospital right away but I made her complete <br/>
all the stamping in the letterbox before we left. She still <br/>
letterboxes and I'd join her again to find another one. She won't <br/>

I just wanted to let people know that someone in our area sustained an<br/>

only gone out letterboxing a few times with her 20- something year old<br/>

I just found out recently that she broke her ankle letterboxing with her<br/>

<br/>
Our friend appreciates the kind thoughts I forwarded to her, but she doesn't<br/>
consider herself an "official letterboxer" (yet).  She does however enjoy<br/>
going out with her daughter (I don't know her daughter's trail name).<br/>
<br/>
For those that were wondering, I also found out what box it was that she got<br/>
injured.  It was the "Whoo-hoo-too-hoo" box.<br/>
