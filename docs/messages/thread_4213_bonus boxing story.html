                    <div class="plaintext-content">While I was in Georgia last month, I stopped at a park to find a<br/>
particular letterbox on my way back to the hotel from work.  I brought<br/>
dinner with me and was sitting at the picnic table eating when an<br/>
older gentleman got out of his car and started down the trail.  He was<br/>
the only other person I saw with a backpack and I noticed there were<br/>
patches/badges on it, but I couldn't make out what they said.  I<br/>
thought to myself, "Gee, he looks like a letterboxer."  Then I<br/>
finished my dinner and thought no more about it.<br/>
<br/>
Two miles later, I went through a tunnel and across a small stream and<br/>
started looking for the clearing the letterbox is in.  As I approached<br/>
the clearing, this very same man came out of the bushes - but no where<br/>
near where I thought the box should be.  I didn't want to ask him,<br/>
because if he'd been taking a leak and not finding a letterbox.... <br/>
But I was curious enough to look in that spot after he left - and I<br/>
found a completely different letterbox than the one I was after, one<br/>
for which I cannot find clues online.  The last stamp indicated it was<br/>
found a few weeks prior, so I'm guessing he is the placer and now I'm<br/>
kicking myself for not risking the potential embarrassment and talking<br/>
to him.<br/>
<br/>
The recent talk on the list about stealth has me wondering if I'm<br/>
somehow being obvious in ways I've never thought of.  Other than the<br/>
fact that we were the only two people with backpacks in the entire<br/>
park, there really isn't any reason I can pinpoint for IDing him as a<br/>
boxer;  any one else ever just get the idea from looking at a person<br/>
on the trail that they might be boxing, too?  And what gives it away?<br/>
