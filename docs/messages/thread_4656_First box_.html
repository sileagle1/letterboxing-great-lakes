Anything else you want to share about that first ever letterbox? Nature Nerd finally talked me into letterboxing and I was hooked.  It took us awhile to find this box because we both forgot our compasses and had to guess at the bearing we were suppose to take.  After searching everyplace we thought it could be we found it.  <br/>
Great topic for the last few cold days.  Found my first box of the year today.    Can you believe this weather, 40's and 50's.  <br/>

  Jake's Third Birthday was our first, too. About a year after you, <br/>
though (April '06). We found it before going to Chuck E. Cheese's to <br/>
celebrate our son's 5th B'day!<br/>
