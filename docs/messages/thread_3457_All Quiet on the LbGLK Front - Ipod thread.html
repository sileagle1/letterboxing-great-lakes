What type do you have?  We are thinking of getting one - not so much <br>
for plugging into our ears, but for using in conjunction with a Bose <br>
speaker system.  We saw a system at our local Best Buy and thought it <br>
looked like a great compact solution that would allow us to customize <br>
some music and not need to change CDs during a party, etc.<br>
<br>
We'd appreciate comments/feedback from anyone that has a device!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also have the 4th gen 20 gig color iPod.  I mainly use mine when I'm <br>
analyzing data at work, so I can tune out my annoying co-workers! ;)  <br>
But occassionally I hook it up to speakers at home too.  I mainly just <br>
like having all of my music in one place, and I use the shuffle feature <br>
a lot.<br>
<br>
Since the newer, video model got released though, I don't think you can <br>
buy the older iPod versions unless you can find them used on eBay or <br>
something (not recommended).  But Atom just got a 30 gig video iPod a <br>
month or so ago, and he likes it.  Since you're mainly just looking to <br>
hook it up at home, the 30 or 60 gig one is probably your best bet.  The <br>
nano and shuffle models are mainly for the convenience of being teeny <br>
tiny and easier to carry around.<br>
<br>
Some people complain about their iPods breaking or crashing, but the <br>
only firsthand knowledge I have of that happening is from my old <br>
roommate who was constantly dropping hers on the ground and leaving it <br>
in her bag/purse which she would casually throw on the floor. :P  Within <br>
the first year though, she returned hers at least 2 (maybe 3) times and <br>
got replacements each time from Apple with their 1 year warranty.  I've <br>
had mine for a year and a half, and it did freeze up once earlier on for <br>
no apparent reason, but I plugged it into the wall charger and it reset <br>
itself. *shrug*<br>
<br>
Hope that helps!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just recently traded up to the new 80gb 5g video.  I know it sounds impossible (and crazy) to fill up an 80gb iPod, but the 30gb I had was full.  I'm about 42 gb on the new one.  I am a music junkie (that OCD thing) and lately am overly obsessed with coming up with the perfect playlist -- just the right mix of favorites, new stuff, forgotten stuff, good old stuff, etc.  I'm still working on it...  <br>
<br>
The Bose speakers would be awesome!  I have the JBL on-stage speaker dock that I use on my desk at work and I love it.  At home I just use iTunes on my computer.  If you are not really looking for a portable music player, rather want to use it at home, you might think about just using iTunes on your computer and hooking that into some killer speakers.  You don't need an iPod to use iTunes.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, don't get me going on earphones...  I have the hardest time keeping the darn things in my ears, even though I do that twisted contortionistic move where you reach behind your head and tug on the top of the opposite ear as you insert the earpiece with your free hand.<br>
<br>
Shortly after getting my first iPod, I took the advice of Azobox and OldShoe, both of whom love their Shure earphones, and paid the bucks for my own pair of these babies.  I will admit that the sound is excellent and they even stay in my ears once I get them positioned in there good, but they are the most uncomfortable things...  I feel like I am walking around with a square-end steel beam in my ear, and they hurt.  I thought I might get used to them if I could just grin and bear it for a while...  well I'm still bearing it (but no longer grinning).<br>
<br>
So on the advice of a co-worker, I got myself a pair of Sennheiser "twist-to-fit" headphones.  Again the sound quality is excellent and these are much more comfortable, but I can't for the life of me get the "twist-to-fit" thing right -- either I twist too far or not far enough and they fall out if I do anything even remotely active.<br>
<br>
I now have tried about 6 different pair of headphones and still am searching for the perfect ones.  The closest I have come is a relatively cheap pair of Sony earphones that have decent sound (although not as rich as the Shures or Sennheisers), are comfortable enough (as comfortable as anything can be while shoved in your ear canal) and they even stay in my ears -- so what's the catch?  They have the funkiest lopsided wire in which one side is longer than the other and the short side is so short that the weight of the iPod is constantly pulling the earpiece out.<br>
<br>
Speaking of the contortionistic move that is considered the *proper* way to insert earphones...  I never noticed people doing this until I got an iPod.  On my recent trip to Rhode Island I saw several people in the airport and on the plane doing the reach behind your head move...  <br>

<br>
I have all my iTunes on my computer and I don't have added speakers.  I<br>
would love to have an iPod, but I cannot stand anything on or in my ears. <br>
I always seem to forget that when I'm in the stores, but I have an old CD<br>
Walkman and a very old early 80's Cassette tape walkman that did not get<br>
used much (expensive lessons).  I've tried all types of headsets, but<br>
they're very irritating to me.  It's good that I have a mac and I<br>
downloaded music early before I lost my mind and bought that toy.<br>
<br>
I'm listening to some music right now as a matter of fact.  I made a CD<br>
from 18 daisypicking songs of the 60's and 70's.  Best $20 I ever spent on<br>
music.  "Reflections" is playing right now.<br>
<br>
Anyone going letterboxing tomorrow? - it's unseasonably warm this weekend<br>
and we are venturing into Ohio again.  Gotta steal the days while we can. <br>
If all goes well I will near 400 finds!<br>

I want an Ipod so bad I can just about taste it - and being the music girl that I am...I'm sure I would need the 80gb or bigger!!!  Can you possibly image all the Beach Boys songs I could get onto one of those?!?!...I own nearly every CD already! (as well as many on vinyl)<br>
<br>
*sigh*  alas there is no possible way of purchasing one at this time...so I kindly thank you for stopping all chit chat on this subject!  Unless of course there is a "raise $$ for Mrs. Doglvrs to get an Ipod" thread.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Mrs. Doglvrs<br>
(of course I'm teasing)<br>

  I just recently traded up to the new 80gb 5g video. I know it sounds impossible (and crazy) to fill up an 80gb iPod, but the 30gb I had was full. I'm about 42 gb on the new one. I am a music junkie (that OCD thing) and lately am overly obsessed with coming up with the perfect playlist -- just the right mix of favorites, new stuff, forgotten stuff, good old stuff, etc. I'm still working on it... <br>
<br>
  The Bose speakers would be awesome! I have the JBL on-stage speaker dock that I use on my desk at work and I love it. At home I just use iTunes on my computer. If you are not really looking for a portable music player, rather want to use it at home, you might think about just using iTunes on your computer and hooking that into some killer speakers. You don't need an iPod to use iTunes.<br>

  What type do you have? We are thinking of getting one - not so much <br>
  for plugging into our ears, but for using in conjunction with a Bose <br>
  speaker system. We saw a system at our local Best Buy and thought it <br>
  looked like a great compact solution that would allow us to customize <br>
  some music and not need to change CDs during a party, etc.<br>
<br>
  We'd appreciate comments/feedback from anyone that has a device!<br>

I have purchased reconditioned Ipods right off the<br>
Apple website.  They are guaranteed for a full year. <br>
And I have had absolutely NO trouble with the two that<br>
I purchased :-)<br>
<br>
Of course, they are discounted - the Nano I bought was<br>
$150 as opposed to the $200 for brand new.  Deals are<br>
varied!<br>
