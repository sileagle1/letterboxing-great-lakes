The management at Bristol has changed significantly, and I no longer have any usual contacts.  I'm working with Kate (Kiss Me Kate/Kate the Wench) who is involved with the wench guild again this year to get approval for the boxes this year.  Hopefully we'll have some good news early next week.  I'm working on the group discount information as well.  I will be going opening day anyway if anyone wants an exchange.<br/>

<br/>
Anyway, there WILL be Bristol boxes again this year starting next weekend.  Huzzah!<br/>
