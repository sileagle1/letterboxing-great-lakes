&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Another successful event behind us, it is time to begin looking forward to our next annual Great Lakes event, at least to get the basics nailed down so a venue can be reserved and people can plan ahead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   First I would like to take the opportunity to thank Speedsquare and her helpers, as well as everyone who has hosted the GLG Gathering over the past 6 years. Hosting a gathering is a lot of planning and hard work and each one of you has done an awesome job! Each year the GLG has been thoughtfully planned and has provided an exciting opportunity for Great Lakes letterboxers to come together for a day/weekend in celebration of this hobby we enjoy. The event has come a long way since our first little get-together in Michigan 7 years ago!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Having come full circle, with all of the states in the region hosting the event, we are at a crossroads and before moving ahead, I would like some feedback and discussion with the intent of making the annual event for our region continue to be one of the premier letterbox gatherings in the country. I'm hoping to see some good discussion over the course of the next week or so and then if there is anything requiring a decision, I will put up a poll for voting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   A few things I'd like to throw out and see ideas on...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   - As letterboxing grows in popularity within the region, we've seen the annual GLG gathering become larger and larger, to the point where it is becoming more difficult to acquire a venue large enough to accommodate the group. Most states already have their somewhat annual state get-together, as well as many smaller events throughout the year. Is the continuation of the annual regional event desirable and realistic or have we gotten to the point where we have outgrown it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   - I realize the timing of the event makes it difficult for some people to attend. With a group this size, there is never going to be a time of year that is good for everyone, and I do think it is important to establish a date and stick with it so people can plan ahead. That being said, as we move into a new cycle, I am interested in what the group thinks about the possibility of moving the gathering to another time of year to hopefully make it accessible for some of the folks who have not been able to participate in previous years. The caveat would be that if the event is moved, the new date would remain consistent throughout the next 6-year rotation.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   - A plan for choosing location moving forward... two options are 1) open it back up for bids from any state or 2) use the rotation that has been established and start again at the beginning (i.e. Illinois would host in 2010, then Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, Indiana...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   - Any general feedback about what works really well and what could be improved to make the event even better!<br/>
