who helped with planning and contributing boxes for putting on a <br>
wonderful gathering in Northville, MI yesterday.  The weather was <br>
absolutely perfect -- sunny, on the cool side, and the park was <br>
beautiful with a really nice network of trails and lots of spring <br>
wildflowers blooming.<br>
<br>
It was fun to see some old friends again, and great to meet so many <br>
new letterboxers, mostly from eastern MI, but a few from other <br>
areas.  In some cases it was finally being able to put a face with a <br>
name that has been familiar on the list, in my letterboxes or in my <br>
e-mail box, in other cases, completely new acquaintances.  I always <br>
love hearing the stories of how people got started in letterboxing, <br>
their trail adventures and also seeing new signature stamps.<br>
<br>
Azobox and I didn't have time to hunt down all of the boxes before <br>
hitting the road back over to the west side of state, but those we <br>
did find were great fun and I absolutely loved the "May Days" series <br>
idea.<br>
<br>
If anyone has pictures, please feel free to post them in the photos <br>
section.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for a great time!<br>
