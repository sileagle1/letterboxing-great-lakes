Concerning the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering, my personal<br/>
selfish request is to please have it as far away from<br/>
Cleveland as possible, because then I won't be upset<br/>
that it was reasonable for us to get to but d'oh,<br/>
we're getting married and can't make it :)  (I know,<br/>
we should have taken the Great Lakes Gathering into<br/>
consideration when we set our wedding date.... ;)<br/>
<br/>
As for disbanding the Great Lakes Gathering all<br/>
together - no!  Please, please no!  Even though, based<br/>
on the state that's hosting it, it won't be feasible<br/>
for everyone to always attend, it's part of life.  We<br/>
were able to attend this past year's gathering and it<br/>
was amazing.  We loved meeting all these people from<br/>
all over that we otherwise might not have, and all the<br/>
fun, hidden boxes, word of mouth boxes, all the neat<br/>
things people came up with to make the gathering<br/>
great.  Now, we attended the Lake Eerie Gathering this<br/>
past October, too, and it was also amazing - all the<br/>
work that bibliophile &amp; crew put into it had us in<br/>
awe.  Comparing these two "types" of gatherhings, I<br/>
think we need both types.  We need the smaller<br/>
state-based gatherings - it helps build ties between<br/>
local area boxers, and is also always a treat when<br/>
someone from out of state takes the time to attend the<br/>
gathering, too.  Taking the Lake Eerie gathering as my<br/>
example, it was much smaller than the Great Lakes<br/>
Gathering and allowed for a more intimate setting.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, considering the big Great Lakes Gathering,<br/>
someone made the comment about letterboxing<br/>
conventions, and I guess in a way the Great Lakes<br/>
Gathering is already our group's unofficial<br/>
convention, where those who are able to travel to meet<br/>
on a larger scale to have a grand event.  One of the<br/>
things I loved most about the 2005 Great Lakes<br/>
Gathering is that it was so big, and we saw first hand<br/>
that hey, letterboxing IS a big thing that we're<br/>
involved in and there are lots and lots of others as<br/>
crazy as we are.  Akin to the Blind Melon music video<br/>
for "No Rain," where the BumbleBee Girl is searching<br/>
for others like her and finally finds them at the end<br/>
of the video.<br/>
<br/>
OK, that's all for now.<br/>

&gt; Okay, I made my post about the GL Gathering before<br/>
&gt; reading the <br/>
&gt; previous post about the MN gathering having been<br/>
&gt; scheduled for the <br/>
&gt; end of May (for some reason that did not come<br/>
&gt; through in my e-mail).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not sure how to proceed with this now...  Since<br/>
&gt; there is <br/>
&gt; definitely geographical overlap and if a significant<br/>
&gt; number of folks <br/>
&gt; will be heading to MN (i.e. particularly those in WI<br/>
&gt; and IL), do we <br/>
&gt; want to continue with plans to hold the Great Lakes<br/>
&gt; Gathering at the <br/>
&gt; beginning of June as has been done for the past 3<br/>
&gt; years?  I don't <br/>
&gt; want for the two gatherings to compete with one<br/>
&gt; another for <br/>
&gt; attendees, especially if the GL Gathering were to<br/>
&gt; end up in WI.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As another option, we could set the location for the<br/>
&gt; GL Gathering to <br/>
&gt; be in the eastern half of the GL region (IN, MI, OH)<br/>
&gt; as those are <br/>
&gt; the folks less likely to make the trip to MN.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps in future years I will just set a location<br/>
&gt; and date for the <br/>
&gt; Great Lakes Gathering rather than take the time to<br/>
&gt; democratically <br/>
&gt; solicit input and volunteers, as it appears that he<br/>
&gt; who snoozes, <br/>
&gt; loses...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thoughts?<br/>

No, no, no, we're right here, right here!  *waving<br/>
arms wildly from the back of the room*  Our contact<br/>
information should have been listed in The Wandering<br/>
Rocker's logbook.... I only check AtlasQuest for<br/>
messages about once a month, since we get mail so<br/>
rarely through there.<br/>
<br/>
We do NOT want this hitchhiker listed on AtlasQuest or<br/>
at letterboxing.org.  We're tracking his travels<br/>
through our personal webpage at<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/doodle_n_deedle/hitchhikers.html<br/>
 He's also listed on Pete &amp; Wanda's Hitchhikers page<br/>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/travelers.html<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox that we released this hitchhiker in was<br/>
our contribution to the 2005 Great Lakes Gathering,<br/>
the Cleveland Rocks! box.  This box is not listed<br/>
anywhere because as we explain on our website, we were<br/>
going to replant the box locally here in Cleveland<br/>
after the gathering, but it got lost in the mail (or<br/>
more likely, the punk who used to live upstairs swiped<br/>
the package when the mailperson left it in front of my<br/>
apartment door, which the mailpeople were told not to<br/>
do, grrrrr).  (So if you found the box at the<br/>
gathering, that image is now a collector's item ;)<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what you mean by the "Please let me know<br/>
if his owner abandoned him or if he would like him<br/>
returned to Green Bay" since we're from Cleveland,<br/>
Ohio, but The Wandering Rocker is a hitchhiker and<br/>
meant to be placed in another traditional letterbox<br/>
for another letterboxer to find.  Reading your<br/>
AtlasQuest message just now, sounds like you've got<br/>
plans to send him on his way soon, so please do.  With<br/>
Ohio blood in his veins and his guitar in tow I'm sure<br/>
he can withstand hanging out in Minnesota for a bit<br/>
until someone else picks him up.  We're amazed that he<br/>
made it so far so quickly!  If you could help us track<br/>
his travels, please send us a private email at<br/>
doodle_n_deedle @ yahoo.com and let us know where he's<br/>
been since The Christmas Elves found him at the<br/>
gathering.<br/>
