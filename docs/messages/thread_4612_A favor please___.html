my online time has been very limited, and I have a small request that I <br>
know has been brought up before.  When replying to another post please <br>
try to delete all but the most relevant bits of that post.  It can get <br>
very confusing, especially with two and a half months of posts, to keep <br>
track of where stuff starts and ends, not to mention a lot of scrolling <br>
for some of the posts on longer threads.<br>
<br>
There was a lot of stuff I would have liked to comment on, but that <br>
stuff is very stale by now, so I will just like to comment on what we <br>
are "thankful" for from letterboxing...<br>
<br>
Boxes, getting outside, the people we have met, and friends made, and <br>
most importantly the support and kindness we received during a very <br>
difficult time.<br>
