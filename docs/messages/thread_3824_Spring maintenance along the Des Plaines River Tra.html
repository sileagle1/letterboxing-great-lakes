                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since the forecast for the weekend includes warmer temperatures,  Coffee <br/>
Beans and I are going to start our spring maintenance along the Des <br/>
Plaines River Trail.  This will include pulling and rewriting a few of <br/>
our clues for our Singing and Boxing series.  If you have plans to find <br/>
them this weekend, let us know ASAP and we can make mutual <br/>
plans...otherwise, please look for updated clues (and maybe a few more <br/>
box plants) early next week.<br/>
<br/>
For those interested, we are retiring a few boxes since: (A) a few <br/>
questionable box placements by us (B) a box or two being missing and (C) <br/>
we are rewriting the clues so they are a straight hike rather then the <br/>
original 'loop' hike.  The straight hike is important because we are <br/>
going to link several boxes (including our HHH series, Beautiful Flower, <br/>
Future Noble, Squash, and a few new boxes)  into one LARGE hike along <br/>
the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone has a nice weekend!<br/>
<br/>
And with today's BINGO box...I no longer have any unbingos!!!!<br/>
