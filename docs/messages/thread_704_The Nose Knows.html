Nose Knows in Commerce twp has been pulled.  We were over there, the logbook was full up and, oh yeah, I'M BEING DRAGGED TO MEMPHIS SOON!  So I figured no time like the present.<br>
<br>
This morning, the two-year-old was playing outside, took a rock from the garden, put it on the ground, and then put on the following one-act drama:<br>
<br>
Lotus: (picking up rock and looking under it) Stamp!  Stamp!  Look, Mommy, stamp!  <br>
<br>
Me: (puzzled and groggy- still morning) Stamp?<br>
<br>
Lotus: (impatiently) Stamp!  (puts rock down, then presses on it) Stamp!  I stamping!<br>
<br>
Me: (finally getting it) Stamping!  You're letterboxing?!<br>
<br>
Lotus: (nodding) 'boxing!<br>
<br>
Now if she would just behave during REAL boxing  trips.....ok, that's the only "precious moment baby edition I'll put you through"<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
