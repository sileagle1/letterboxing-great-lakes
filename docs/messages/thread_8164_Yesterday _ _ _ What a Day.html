                    <html><body><p><span>I had to go to Chicago for the second time in 6 days yesterday. This time, I had my eye on a particular series . . . a long hike series.<br/><br/>I went for Waltzing Pigs "Journey's of St. Paul" -- 4 mile hike series.<br/><br/>I woke up at 2:45 in the morning, left at 3:00. Pulled in the parking lot at 5:20 before the first rays of sun crested the horizon. Within 10-15 minutes they sky started turning from black to dark blue, and within half an hour it was pretty much light out.<br/><br/>At the second box, I heard a scuffle of coyote's. There was a minimum of 2, but I think there were at least three. They were hollowing and "fighting" amongst themselves -- and they were CLOSE to me, even though I never actually saw them. I was stamping into the second box (involving coloring more than one stamp), and I kept expecting the coyotes to make their appearance -- so between markers, I kept looking up and making sure that I was still alone. I couldn't move along fast enough to box #3.<br/><br/>I made the entire 4 mile hike finding 3 of the 6 boxes . . . and no wild animal attacks. The hike was beautiful, taking me around serveral sloughs - which that had a mist/steam coming off of them in the early morning sunlight. It was a beautiful hike that I was glad to accomplish so early in the morning.<br/><br/>I spent 3 hours there . . . it was now 8:30 in the morning and my day was just getting started.<br/><br/>(technically, on paper, I clocked myself into work at 7:00).<br/><br/>So, I attempted a drive-by that doesn't appear to be there anymore ("The Big Red One") and then made it to my patients home and made my delivery.<br/><br/>After making my delivery I drove to ISH's home to pick up another drive-by. Not nearly enough of you have found this box . . . and I recommend you stop by and grab it -- she doesn't live to far off of I-80 -- FYI she has moved.... if you've already plotted this box, be sure you get the updated address.<br/><br/>Next I drove to Joliet for another short (1/2-3/4 mile) hike to find "Mom's Hummingbird," and attempted "Elvis- Viva Las Vegas."<br/><br/>I had one more stop for work in LaSalle on my way back. I decided that was enough boxing for the day -- primarily because I'd already eaten up my 4 hour early start, my lunch and one of my breaks. I made my stop in LaSalle and headed home.<br/><br/>On the way home, I got a call from HowD Girls and Kruzboxers who were in the middle of the Wizard of Oz Series. They found many of our boxes that hadn't been found in years -- in fact, they found every box they looked for -- YIPPEE!! Either way, I'd told them to call me if they found a certain box that had a bonus box, as the bonus box clues had been changed and I never got around to hiking back to that particular box to update the logbook. <br/><br/>They called me just as I was coming up to the closest exit to that box off of I-80. I quickly took the exit as I told them the new clues over the phone. I was able to catch up to them, help them along the way, and hike to the bonus with them. Lisa &amp; Amy, my only regret was having used up all my "spare" time already and I didn't get to stick around to spend more time with you.<br/><br/>I got back to the office, wrapped up my day and headed home at 3:30.<br/><br/>Was that the end of my awesome day? Nope.<br/><br/>Got home and Becki says, "since you're home early, you want to go anywhere? 5 Guys in Peoria (that's the closes 5 Guys to us) sounds good." I responded, "if we go to Peoria, there's a box I want to get."<br/><br/>Off we went. <br/><br/>Getting in Peoria just after 5:00 we ate first. Then drove down for "100 Ways for Barbie to Die: Thin Ice" by Wisconsin Hiker. I'd found it this past winter, only it was encased in ice and I couldn't budge it. I knew right were it was and didn't bring the clues with me.<br/><br/>After dinner, the sun was already getting low.... and we had a bit of a drive to get to Pekin. Got there at about 7:00 and busted tail for about a mile to get the box. Ups and Downs, and a fallen-tree "bridge" we had to climb at an angle to get to the other side of the creek.<br/><br/>We stopped only briefly to watch a couple of white tailed deer... and Will spotted a Great Horned Owl. The rest of us didn't see the owl until it flew to another tree top.<br/><br/>After logging in, we busted tail to get back (stopping to watch 4 more deer who seemed just as curious about us as we were of them) to the van just before the sun dipped below the horizon (about 8:00). I officially boxed from sunrise to sunset. Drove near 600 miles and was away from 2:45am-10:30pm, and all told, hiked somewhere between 7-8 miles. Woo.<br/><br/>Got home took a shower and went to bed. <br/><br/>My legs will be sore for a while.Â  <br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p></body></html>
