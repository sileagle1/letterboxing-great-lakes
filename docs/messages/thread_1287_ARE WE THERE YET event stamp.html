Rabbit, here it comes.  I am still trying to figure out how to get to the June Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Just when I was lamenting the thought that I couldn't possibly collect all the stamps in <br/>
Marshall and Fulton Counties in a single day, now I have been distracted by sugar cream <br/>
pie!  Well, I might have to make another trip in June (provided we actually get some <br/>
vacation this year.)<br/>

&gt; traveling down US 31 in between Plymouth and<br/>
&gt; Rochester, IN (Flagbearer is on a planting frenzy, so<br/>
&gt; you *might* end up this way searching for some of<br/>
&gt; hers)there's a diner on the west side of US 31 (the 4<br/>
&gt; lane "bypass" as the locals call it) near the town of<br/>
&gt; Argos called the Logcabin. Fabulous food, and probably<br/>
&gt; the best sugar cream pie ever! Amazing! You will<br/>
&gt; rethink the whole Wicks thing...trust me, I did!!!<br/>
