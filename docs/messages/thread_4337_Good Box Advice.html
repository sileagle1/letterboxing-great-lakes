                    <div class="plaintext-content">Keeping the original image on file is a good idea and has saved me many times when it came time to recreate a lost stamp.  But I'm not so sure I would go so far as to say that one should only put forth a mediocre effort in anticipation of the stamp being lost.  With every stamp I carve, I am always striving to do better than my last, just as much for personal growth as for a desirable product.  I would think that a person would want to always strive to put out their best effort, not that every stamp you carve or every box you place is going to end up being your best...  things don't always work out the way we envision them and the best ideas sometimes fizzle or even fall flat during implementation.<br/>
<br/>
If they go missing, oh well, such is life.  Hopefully there were letterboxers that did get some enjoyment out of the hunt and the stamp before it was lost.<br/>
