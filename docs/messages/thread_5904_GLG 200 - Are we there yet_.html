I'll be taking a leisurely drive north in the morning. Maybe stop in a few furniture stores in Berne. Should be at Clear Lake lunch time/1PM. If you're in the area for my letterbox and see a white cloud, walk lakeside (it's okay). I might be relaxing, but if the Gute Fahrt is out, I'll be on the water. My folks enjoy visitors to the box.<br/>
