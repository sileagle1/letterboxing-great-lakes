                    <div class="plaintext-content">I started with an under-the-radar box at Brookfield (IL) Zoo.  I'd heard in the past they were not receptive.  A while back CinemaBoxers said she'd gotten permission to place boxes there, but then she dropped out of the letterbox community, so I contacted the person she spoke with (a PR-type person).  I assured her letterboxers follow zero-impact, and we would do no harm to zoo property.  She gave me her blessing (they like any idea that brings in paying customers!) and I have since placed a total of four boxes there.  It is kind of funny though - she must not have informed grounds crews or anyone else about it, because I've since spoken to some of the groundskeepers and they knew nothing about their existance.<br>

My guess is that they might be okay with a box UNDER THEIR CONROL.<br>
In sensitive areas like zoos, nature centers, and some urban parks, it<br>
seems that we see a greater desire for authorities to more actively<br>
oversee and regulate activities within their boundaries.<br>
<br>
But, you could check into the caching program and see how they're<br>
