box from the quiz contest? and  (2) residents of other states <br>
requesting if they can play in the MI county Quiz Game.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the input guys, I appreciate it and agree  let's <br>
separate the placing of a box from the quiz portion and throw the <br>
quiz open to everyone on the Great Lakes yahoogroup.  <br>
<br>
Just FYI ... the entry that arrived today by Trail Troll ~REALLY~ <br>
had me busy writing out slips for their points! Congrats<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>

<br>
WHO CAN PLAY:<br>
1. Players must be members of the Great Lakes yahoogroup  and there <br>
is no longer a requirement to get a box placed in MI by Thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
2. You can play as an individual, a family, or a team but please <br>
don't enter yourself in more than one category (ie: individual <br>
answers as well as team and/or family answers) <br>
<br>
PRIZES for the Quiz Game:<br>
1st prize  a gift certificate from Stampeaz, the PZ Kut folks<br>
2nd prize  a Staedtler-Mars Grand eraser<br>
3rd prize  #11 carving blades<br>
4th prize  #1 carving nibs<br>
<br>
<br>
RULES:<br>
1.  Go to http://tinyurl.com/yn38r2  where you will find a file <br>
called, " Unboxed MI counties QUIZ GAME" (if the link doesn't work, <br>
you can just go to our group homepage and click on files in the left-<br>
side menu)HINT: there was another message posted that you might find <br>
helpful.<br>
<br>
2. Find the answers to the quiz questions and email them to me <br>
privately. DO NOT POST YOUR ANSWERS TO THE LIST!! <br>
<br>
3. There is a question for each "unboxed" MI county plus at least one<br>
bonus question and even a few extra credit points available.  For <br>
each correct answer you will be awarded a "point" which will <br>
translate into your name on a slip of paper (ie: the more points, <br>
the more slips of paper with your name)  All slips of paper with <br>
names will go into the drawing.  Winners will be selected at random <br>
by my Grandson in two weeks ... on Saturday, November 4th  (2006) <br>
and announced on the list by 11pm that night.<br>
