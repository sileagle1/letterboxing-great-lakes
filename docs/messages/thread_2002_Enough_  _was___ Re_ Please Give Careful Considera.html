                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree that this has gone far enough.  I also was taken <br/>
back by references in the last e-mail regarding "crappy" stamps and <br/>
the elite letterboxing artisans, etc.  In my opinion, there is no <br/>
place for that kind of attitude in letterboxing, and certainly not <br/>
here on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I think we need to agree to disagree on this issue.  Undoubtedly we <br/>
all have reasons that seem logical and valid to us as to why we see it <br/>
the way we do.  None are more wrong or right than the other, just <br/>
different.  Enough has been exchanged to realize that there are vastly <br/>
differing opinions on this and very little chance of seeing eye-to-eye.<br/>
<br/>
I do not see further discussion on this subject leading to anything <br/>
productive so I am asking that it be dropped.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your cooperation.<br/>
