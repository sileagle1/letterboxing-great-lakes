                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, it doesn't sound like anyone is going to take over for Sidewagers<br>
this year....so I'll give it one more go.<br>
<br>
I'll use the same set of rules for last year, so please check the files<br>
section and read the sidewagers 2011.pdf file if you are unfamiliar with<br>
this game.<br>
<br>
Side Wager: A wager made beyond the normal rules of the game. A hedge bet.<br>
<br>
Basically, if you'd like to add more excitement to the letterboxing bingo<br>
game (or another way to win), enter the Side Wagers Game. When will<br>
FamilyOf6 pull the item that finally and completely fills in some player's<br>
card? Pick the right day, and you WIN! Again, this is the Big Game here,<br>
not the interim games. The date will be determined by the claiming of a<br>
successful card by a BINGO player (and its certification by FamilyOf6).<br>
<br>
Your guess must be submitted before January 1, 2012.<br>
<br>
PLEASE PUT, 'SIDEWAGER' in the subject line, and send your guess to me at<br>
aatom118@gmail.com<br>
<br>
Given the lateness of this email, I may not reply to your date request as<br>
promptly as last year (and my first post to this game might not come right<br>
away on Jan 1).  However, I should hopefully confirm your date by the first<br>
week of January.<br>
<br>
As of now, the game is OPEN.<br>
<br>
GOOD LUCK!<br>
<br>
Atom118 of Atomic Beans<br>
<br>
(and if you want to know what kind of prize you might have in store...talk<br>
to last year's winner, Prairie Dog)<br>
