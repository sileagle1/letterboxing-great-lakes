<br/>
I'm back at home now and want to first publicly thank my wonderful <br/>
wife for sending you updates on me -- something I hadn't asked her to <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to thank each and everyone of you for your thoughts, <br/>
prayers and Emails.<br/>
<br/>
When I woke up Sunday morning and an elderly man walked in with a <br/>
STACK of Emails . . . all from the Great Lakes board (I mean really, <br/>
not even a single one from a family member . . . geesh). This <br/>
morning, another stack of Emails came to my room (this time some <br/>
family members did write).<br/>
<br/>
You guys all brought the biggest sense of community and belonging <br/>
I've felt in my entire life, and I thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently all this ruckus was caused by pneumonia. The pneumonia <br/>
settled into my lower right lung and dragged it (my lung) down past <br/>
my diaphragm and onto my liver.<br/>
<br/>
Once my lung hit my liver it started killing off liver cells (I guess <br/>
that's a bad thing) and my liver went into hyper drive and sent out <br/>
all these enzymes (so I'm told) apparently my enzyme count was over <br/>
400 I just googled what's normal and for an adult should be between 0-<br/>
42 with an optimal enzyme count of 21.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I went through a lot of tests and one showed my right <br/>
lung sitting on top of my liver. As soon as I got some medication to <br/>
lower the inflammation in my lung my pain started going down.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to be on a couple of medications for the next 8 days -- one <br/>
to fight the pneumonia and one to fight the inflammation. That puts <br/>
us right up to the day that we leave for MN!!<br/>
<br/>
To paraphrase one of ya, "If you can box in the pouring rain, this <br/>
wont keep you back." <br/>
<br/>
God willing, we will be in MN boxing our hearts (and livers) out :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all again for being such wonderful people and caring so <br/>
much for me, Becki &amp; the Kids. I'm truly touched!!<br/>
