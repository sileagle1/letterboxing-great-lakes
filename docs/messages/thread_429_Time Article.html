the Time article.<br/>

I picked up the mag for about $5 yesterday, and personally I want my <br/>

article.  I could go into a long diatribe about what I felt was bad <br/>
about the article, but I'll spare you.  Actually, it was pretty much <br/>
what I expected, but it was not what I was led to believe it would <br/>

Personally, if we are going to have mags and newspapers do articles <br/>
on our activity, they should let the article writing to the people <br/>
that actually DO the activity.  Time showed their lack of knowledge <br/>

article quite well.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In some ways, the Time article was just what I expected, but in <br/>
other ways it was better than I expected.<br/>
<br/>
It was better in that it emphasized the trinity of "art, athletics and <br/>
mystery."  In that aspect, I was pleased that they "got it."  <br/>
<br/>
It was also better in that pictures from our gathering were used.  <br/>
I think this was because the photographer lucked into a <br/>
gathering (rather than the photographer who followed the <br/>
Maplines), and so had lots of variety for the photo editor to <br/>
choose from.<br/>
<br/>
What was just as I expected bears on the realities of magazine <br/>
publishing.  I thought it possible that this article would never be <br/>
published at all.  Such an article would be pretty low on Time's <br/>
list of priorities when you consider what is going on nationally <br/>
and internationally (was it bumped from the previous week?).<br/>
<br/>
Based on the nature of Time Magazine, I thought one page, <br/>
including pictures, would be the upper limit of the space alloted <br/>
for a piece on an unusual sport/hobby, and there is only so <br/>
much one can say in one page.<br/>
<br/>
An editor in such a publication sometimes assigns a journalist <br/>
to the story based on her pitch. It's possible that this was Deirdre <br/>
Van Dyk's story from the beginning, hence the East Coast focus.  <br/>
If the article is not pitched but comes from the editor, she or he <br/>
neverthless assigns the story to one main journalist, often <br/>
someone with whom they have cultivated a strong working <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not it's a particular journalist's story, the editor may <br/>
contact a couple of stringers for local color.  One of those is <br/>
Elizabeth Coady who was at our gathering.  Such freelance <br/>
writers work hard and often see very little of their work in print.  <br/>
Freelancers have strong fortitudes in order to combat being <br/>
undervalued, overlooked and outright rejected so often.<br/>
<br/>
Of course a journalist is going to lead an interview subject to <br/>
believe that everything she or he says will have a major influence <br/>
on this important story appearing in a major publication.  Would <br/>
people spend the tedious time to be interviewed if the journalist <br/>
said, "Well, I don't really know if this will be published or not.  <br/>
Chances are about 5% that we'll quote you."?  Not when the <br/>
alternative is to actually letterbox rather than talk about it.       ;o)<br/>
