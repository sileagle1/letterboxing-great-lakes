<br/>
-  Fifty "50's" songs on the CD that Safari Man created for a box he planted in conjunction with the 2007 Great Lakes Gathering in Ohio.<br/>
<br/>
- All the "Bird" themed songs on the CD that Trail Rider, Pastor's Wife and GGGHiker created for the Birds of a Feather event they hosted in 2008.<br/>
<br/>
- 3 different "Olympics" themed CDs created by Familyof6 as a prize for the Winter Olympics event they hosted in 2010.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of fun times at the events and another THANK YOU to the creators of these music mixes!<br/>
