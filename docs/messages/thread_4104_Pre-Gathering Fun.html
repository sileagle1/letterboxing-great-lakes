<br/>
Looking for some pre-gathering fun?<br/>
Well than try to solve this one.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to find a stamp,<br/>
Than you will have to find our camp.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you look up the map on our scheduled weekend date,<br/>
So as not to confuse the campgrounds booked state.<br/>
<br/>
The chinese zodiac was fun last year<br/>
But our site will have none of those hear.<br/>
<br/>
Santa's helpers are very near,<br/>
But not the same lettered section I do fear.<br/>
<br/>
When we have to answer natures call<br/>
We wont be but 3 site over from the stall.<br/>
<br/>
In our lettered section there is only one to be seen<br/>
And in the morning you will see us going there to get quite clean.<br/>
