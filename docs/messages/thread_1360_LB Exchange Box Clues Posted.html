keep up with letterboxing.  Thanks, everyone, for acknowledging my F-200.<br>

I've been trying to solve SpringChick puzzles for almost three years<br>
now and I see that she's hatched another with the Speedsquare exchange<br>
box.<br>
If you haven't looked yet, check it out (link in her msg). What I want<br>
to know is, *how do you do it?* I'm not crazy about even attempting<br>
crosswords generally, but I do marvel at how they're constructed --<br>
especially in the creation of letterbox clues.<br>
Sometimes, it's all I can do to write a story to surround the<br>
box/clues, let alone figure out how to make "6 down" mesh with "14<br>
across."<br>
<br>
I'd like to know a bit more about the process involved. Can you share?<br>
Or is *that* another SpringChick mystery?<br>
<br>
Please?<br>

puzzles conjunction with mystery letterboxes. Making up puzzles, <br>
codes, riddles and mysteries is one of the things I enjoy most about <br>
doing letterbox clues and I would probably do so for all of my boxes <br>
if people were more into solving them.  But alas, mystery boxes in <br>
this neck of the woods seem to be destined for a lonely existence -- <br>
I think I currently have at least 3 mystery boxes that have never <br>
been found and 3-4 others that have not had a finder within the past <br>
year.  I was overjoyed to receive an e-mail from Team Rabbit the <br>
other day sharing that they had recently cracked the Case of the <br>
Missing Salmon.  They also completed the Wine Country puzzle to find <br>
those 2 boxes, as well as finding the Pink Cadillac mystery box.<br>
<br>
The only reason I gave the city on the Tuckaway box and didn't make <br>
it a true mystery box was because I made the "rule" that the exchange <br>
boxes couldn't be planted as mystery boxes and had to at least give <br>
the city to ensure that they would have some finders.  No fun for the <br>
creator if nobody ever finds their box!  <br>
<br>
Anyway, about the puzzles...  if you want an inside peek at the <br>
process, plan on attending the Building a Mystery workshop at the <br>
June GL Gathering.<br>

get when I'm able to figure out where a mystery box is<br>

hours away, out of state, etc. etc.  But yeah, I'm one<br>
of those people who then tucks those clues away in the<br>
