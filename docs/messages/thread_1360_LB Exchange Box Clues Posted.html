keep up with letterboxing.  Thanks, everyone, for acknowledging my F-200.<br/>

I've been trying to solve SpringChick puzzles for almost three years<br/>
now and I see that she's hatched another with the Speedsquare exchange<br/>
box.<br/>
If you haven't looked yet, check it out (link in her msg). What I want<br/>
to know is, *how do you do it?* I'm not crazy about even attempting<br/>
crosswords generally, but I do marvel at how they're constructed --<br/>
especially in the creation of letterbox clues.<br/>
Sometimes, it's all I can do to write a story to surround the<br/>
box/clues, let alone figure out how to make "6 down" mesh with "14<br/>
across."<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to know a bit more about the process involved. Can you share?<br/>
Or is *that* another SpringChick mystery?<br/>
<br/>
Please?<br/>
