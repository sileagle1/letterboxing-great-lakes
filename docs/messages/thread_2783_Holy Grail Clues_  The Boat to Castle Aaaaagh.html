<br/>
The Clues to The Boat to Castle Aaaargh:<br/>
<br/>
Location:  Berea, Ohio<br/>
<br/>
Since a boat is what you seek, find the place where<br/>
boat rentals occur at Wallace Lake in Berea.  Leave<br/>
your steed in the parking lot and begin your quest<br/>
at "Richard's Rest."  From here, head south towards<br/>
the<br/>
woods.  When a doorway to "Danger" rears its ugly<br/>
head, be like Brave Sir Robin and flea straight<br/>
ahead, up the dirt path and over the hill.  <br/>
<br/>
Cross the field southeast to the pines.  At the<br/>
bench take a rest and a reading of 130*.  You'll see a<br/>
narrow path.  Follow it down, if you dare.  It twists<br/>
and turns, snakes and curves, until you end up at<br/>
water and a square rock (and perhaps a few dead<br/>
fish, no doubt victims of the Killer Rabbit!).<br/>
<br/>
Ready to launch?  Standing at the square rock, with<br/>
the rock to your back and water in the front, walk 5<br/>
paces to the right.  Head up this path; about 4 paces<br/>
in the path comes to a fork (the right branch may not<br/>
be noticeable given the time of year).  Walk 3 paces<br/>
along the left branch.  Look to your right.  See the<br/>
Siamese Tree?  Your vessel is docked here at its base.<br/>
<br/>
If after finding the boat you chose not to sail but to<br/>
return to your trusty steed instead, head back to the<br/>
water.  Face the path you were just on.  Take 3 or 4<br/>
steps to your right (towards the square rock). <br/>
There's another path that leads straight up to the<br/>
road and a dirt Bridal Path.  Head north on this path<br/>
back towards your steed.  <br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
