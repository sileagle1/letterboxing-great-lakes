 I'm sorry for the mix-up with your previous email, I never received it. My<br/>
 internet provider implemented a new anti-spam filter for email and it took<br/>
a time to get the bugs out. Unfortunately, in the process I lost some mail.<br/>
So sorry! Please resend.<br/>
<br/>
 I was just out to the park this weekend and picked up box number 1. I<br/>
looked for box #2, but didn't find it. When did you see it last and where may I<br/>
 ask. It appeared as though there was some brush cutting in the area and<br/>
 someone may have discovered it. I am currently in the process of checking over my boxes and doing some cleaning, etc... My next stop is the Independence Oaks set.<br/>
<br/>
 I didn't know about the gathering until your email! Things are a bit<br/>
hectic right now, but it would be fun to get together with some other folks.<br/>
<br/>
 THANKS =))<br/>

&gt;Hi!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'm sorry for the mix-up with your previous email, I never received it. My<br/>
&gt;internet provider implemented a new anti-spam filter for email and it took<br/>
&gt;a time to get the bugs out. Unfortunately, in the process I lost some mail.<br/>
&gt;So sorry! Please resend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was just out to the park this weekend and picked up box number 1. I<br/>
&gt;looked for box #2, but didn't find it. When did you see it last and where <br/>
&gt;may I<br/>
&gt;ask. It appeared as though there was some brush cutting in the area and<br/>
&gt;someone may have discovered it. I am currently in the process of checking <br/>
&gt;over my boxes and doing some cleaning, etc... My next stop is the <br/>
&gt;Independence Oaks set.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I didn't know about the gathering until your email! Things are a bit<br/>
&gt;hectic right now, but it would be fun to get together with some other folks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;THANKS =))<br/>

&gt;   I just found the hearts abound #1 box about a week ago. It should be<br/>
&gt;   there. When I found it it was sitting out in the open :-( . I could<br/>
&gt;   not find the number 2 box though. I will have to go back and find it<br/>
&gt;   again sometime.<br/>
