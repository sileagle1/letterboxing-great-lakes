<br>
 I'm sorry for the mix-up with your previous email, I never received it. My<br>
 internet provider implemented a new anti-spam filter for email and it took<br>
a time to get the bugs out. Unfortunately, in the process I lost some mail.<br>
So sorry! Please resend.<br>
<br>
 I was just out to the park this weekend and picked up box number 1. I<br>
looked for box #2, but didn't find it. When did you see it last and where may I<br>
 ask. It appeared as though there was some brush cutting in the area and<br>
 someone may have discovered it. I am currently in the process of checking over my boxes and doing some cleaning, etc... My next stop is the Independence Oaks set.<br>
<br>
 I didn't know about the gathering until your email! Things are a bit<br>
hectic right now, but it would be fun to get together with some other folks.<br>
<br>
 THANKS =))<br>
