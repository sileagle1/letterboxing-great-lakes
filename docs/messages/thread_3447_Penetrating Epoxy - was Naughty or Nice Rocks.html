Here is a link:<br>

No, I don't think a craft store would carry it. I do know that West <br>
Marine carries it ... or you might try a hobby shop.<br>
<br>
Not affilated, etc, etc.  Haven't paid attention to this thread so I <br>
don't know if this product would be advisable for your project, just <br>
wanted to let you know that such a product exists.<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>

   Here's another product.  It's not epoxy, but it's available at paint and <br>
hardware stores.  I used it a few years ago to repair a rotting window sill:<br>

  And another one I've used on a kitchen butcherblock table that is really <br>
pretty tough.  A dried wine stain wipes right off and hot,wet pans don't <br>
leave rings or marks.  It's also safe for food.<br>
