that the landscape in the forest DOES change from time to time. I have <br/>
two boxes that have clues I have to fix because of A large tree <br/>
falling over and a small path being swallowed up again by under <br/>
growth. I remember getting frusterated looking for older boxes because <br/>
the clues weren't just right. Now I realize that if the older boxes <br/>
aren't really maintained the chances of the landscape varying from the <br/>
clues are good. <br/>
