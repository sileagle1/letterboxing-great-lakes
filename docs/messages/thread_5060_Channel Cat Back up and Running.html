                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, as I sat there with knees together in pain my wife suggests we <br>
drive to Kewanee (an hour away) to find Pitties new box. I can hardly <br>
even walk to the door . . . we dismissed boxing for today (though the <br>
weather is perfect).<br>
<br>
Contemplating a kid friendly image of a new box to plant <br>
titled, "Saddest Little Weiner in Town," while driving over the I-74 <br>
bridge we saw the Channel Cat out and about.<br>
<br>
Back home we went to pick up the "Channel Cat" box and it is now up and <br>
running for another season. The Channel Cat runs from Memorial Day to <br>
Labor Day weekend and I have several stamps in the series, one on the <br>
boat and at least one at every stop the Cat makes along the Mighty <br>
Mississippi. http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/showinfo.html?gBoxId=43364<br>
<br>
I hope many of you make the Quad Cities a travel (boxing) destination <br>
this summer and get an opportunity to ride the Channel Cat.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
