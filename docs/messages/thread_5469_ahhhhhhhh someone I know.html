Yes I recognized those trail names !!!!!!!! :) Probably the only exchange from your region and I think Wisconsin Hiker came to CT. <br>
Things( letterbox adventures) do slow down here in New England so BINGO seemed a great way to still participate in letterboxing .<br>
Although 6 of us plan to attend the O letterboxing Tree Event held in Massachusetts next Tuesday. snow and all we have 8 inches on FRiday and another 2 to 4 today .<br>

We didn't see Rod Blagojevich listed in the database????<br>
<br>
Some of us from IL would rather choose the state of their birth...Tiptoe says let's here it for <br>
IN!<br>
Tonto has to remain from IL along with Rod! So, as soon as you get our booty there will be <br>
at least 2 Illini!<br>
Freezing with the same temp and wind chill as Hrtx6 on this side of IL...Tiptoe & Tonto<br>
<br>
BTW...We are so excited that PineCone from CT will be playingBINGO along with all of us here <br>
in the Great Lakes!!!! Give a hug to Pine Needle for us..tell her Tonto is still looking for boxes <br>
around the inn!<br>
