controlled burns in some areas of this park, burning all undergrowth.  <br/>
I know of at least two boxes that have been turned into ashes.  Any <br/>
box hidden on the ground covered by dead twigs and leaves is <br/>
vulnerable.  These piles of wood seem to be favorite targets for the <br/>
fire shooting rangers as they traipse all over the park.  <br/>
<br/>
Make sure when you are planting boxes in a park that does controlled <br/>
burns that they are off the ground, in a stump, under a rock, or <br/>
otherwise protected from the fire happy rangers.<br/>

Did you get any sense for the safety of the boxes already out there?<br/>
(And *you* know where they are!)<br/>
Do we all now have toasted cereals?<br/>
<br/>
Yipes! It's curious with the state of MI in such dire straits<br/>
money-wise  that there is time and funding for the roasting of the acres.<br/>
