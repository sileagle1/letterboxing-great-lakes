Hey SpringChick, are you going to post the rest of the words in the <br>
order they would have been called?  That way maybe we can curse about <br>
how we would have had the next word!<br>
<br>
Of course, I am assuming that both of these are valid full card <br>
bingos and that the game is now over. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually I think these winners are simply tied for the 2nd place Full <br>
Card.  I think there will still be another word called for 3rd place.<br>
It will be interesting to see how MANY people might tie for that one!  <br>
However "chick legs" will have to provide the definitive answer on <br>
whether the game is stil in play.<br>
