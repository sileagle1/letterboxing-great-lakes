                    <div class="plaintext-content">I checked my "River Fauna" letterboxes this afternoon, not too worried as I knew they had all been found in late March.  But much to my chagrin, I found that Box #1 has been washed away by the recent high water in the Kishwaukee River after all the recent rain.  I was unable to check the status of Box #2 as I didn't care to wade through standing water.  However, Boxes #3, #4, and #5 (with the logbook) are safe.<br/>
<br/>
I will replace Box #1 in a HIGHER spot soon, and #2 if need be.  In the meantime, if anyone has printed up the cluesheet for this series, be aware it is incomplete at this time.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Nam Vet and I checked this series of 5 boxes today.  Boxes 1 through 4 were in place, but when we reached Box 5, we found the container wide open and the contents laying on the ground several feet away.  Despite the triple bagging, EVERYTHING is soaked.  I have brought the stamp and logbook home to see what can be done, but the logbook with all the sign-ins is a sodden pulpy mess.  I doubt if it can be salvaged :(<br/>
<br/>
I will let the lists know when I have replaced the stamp and logbook.<br/>
