It's only day three.  You're not the only one with an empty card. My card is plant too.  But if we start pouting and getting anxious now, we'll be climbing the walls once the Bingo cards start filling up.  Awh yes, I remember the feeling well from years past.  But if it makes you feel less anxious, I do think there is something to that theory of newbie luck.  No proof, but hang in there. This is the slowest Bingo game you will ever play.  LOL!<br/>

I guess I should get back to carving as a way to deal with my <br/>

to go - and 3.5 sheets of PZKut available to me...What to carve, what <br/>
to carve.... Isn't there a Plant a LB Day?  When is that?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I actually tossed around the idea of a consolation prize for the person with the least spaces filled at the end of the game, but based on previous years, it would have been a multi-way tie between several people who had 4-5 items not called.  I couldn't figure out a way to narrow it down to the likelihood of a single individual so abandoned the idea.  But it does go to show that once the game gets in swing things even out and most people do about as well as the next person -- just usually comes in famine and draught patterns like Martini Man had said.  Hang in there!<br/>

  Whew, I was starting to panic, thinking I was the only one who hadn't had a word yet. I was starting to wish there was a prize for the last person to get the first word on there card. :)<br/>
