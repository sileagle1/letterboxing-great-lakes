                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, since SpringChick and azobox often find themselves<br>
writing to each other in code and intentionally planning to confound<br>
their readers, it's not surprising that confusion has surfaced<br>
with the event planned for October 22 at Yankee Springs Recreation<br>
Area.<br>
<br>
So here's a quick breakdown of what's planned and how you can<br>
participate.<br>
<br>
First, there is the Fall Michigan Letterbox Gathering, called<br>
"Get a Clue". Like many other gatherings, all are welcome and<br>
there will be a potluck, opportunities to exchange stamps with others,<br>
and letterboxing galore!<br>
<br>
An additional activity will be a game based on the board game<br>
"Clue" that we're calling <br>
"Rhyme Tyme Clue Exchange Game".<br>
This is an opportunity for both new and experienced boxers to interact<br>
with each other in a different way. You'll try to solve the<br>
mystery of "Who Killed Mother Goose?" by discovering the<br>
killer, the weapon and the place in which the dreadful deed occurred.<br>
See message 4551 on the Yahoo chat to read Sgt. Grimm's report. A<br>
more complete description of how the game is played and how you can<br>
participate can be found the link below.<br>
<br>
FAQ's:<br>
*Can I do one thing and not the other?<br>
Sure. We're happy to have you involved however you'd like to<br>
be.<br>
Come and play the Rhyme Tyme Clue Exchange Game and solve the mystery,<br>
"Who Killed Mother Goose" and then hang around and chat all<br>
day.<br>
Or play the game and then go out to box. Or come and do some<br>
exchanges, have some lunch, and box `til you drop!<br>
<br>
*Can I make a box and place it myself at the park before the gathering<br>
or do the organizers have to plant the boxes?<br>
Either way is fine.<br>
You can visit Yankee Springs between now and then and plant the box<br>
yourself. Or you can mail the box to the planners and they'll get<br>
it planted for you.<br>
(Be sure to let us know if it's intended to be a permanent box for<br>
Yankee Springs or if you want it returned to you after the event.) <br>
<br>
*Do I have to carve a stamp about Mother Goose?<br>
Nope. But if you want to play the Clue Exchange Game, you'll have<br>
a better chance of having stamps to play with if you bring some. (Read<br>
more about this on the link below.) Plus you'll have the fun of<br>
getting lots of images from other playes. The Mother Goose Murder<br>
Mystery stamps are not regular letterboxes. They are part of the Clue<br>
Exchange Game.<br>
