                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks to Dragon for organizing yet another event!  Although it <br>
got a bit nippy at times, plodding through the deep snow warmed us up, <br>
as did the cider & chili.   Of course we also enjoyed the many other <br>
tasty treats people brought, especially those Atom 118 bars! <br>
<br>
There were some very nice stamps in the boxes we found, so thanks to <br>
all of you who created them.  Once again at a WI "fall" event, it ended <br>
up that two boxes were unknowingly hidden in the very same spot.  Very <br>
funny!  It was nice to get together to wrap up the day over an evening <br>
meal.  Chatting in the comfort of a warm restaurant after being out on <br>
the trails was great.<br>

I didn't take a ton of photos, but you can view the few I have at this <br>
