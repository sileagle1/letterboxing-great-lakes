<p>Oh, he is not the first. He is carrying on the TX tradition of someone getting bit at their annual event. On Friday night we talked with Lucy Locket who got bit a few years ago. We saw her again on the trail Saturday afternoon and jokingly asked her if she had seen any snakes and could warn us where they were. Unfortunately only a couple of hours afterward we found out where one was.<br/>

Yikes! So sorry to hear that!  I hope he has a full and speedy recovery!  <br/>

That may be a Letterboxing first.  I almost stepped on a Mississauga rattlesnake a few years back.  I remember a story from Preboxed {   :(   } and Front Range Hiker in Colorado about snakes. But, I've never heard of anyone getting bit!<br/>

Send him my best!<br/>

&gt; For those who haven't already heard via Facebook, Martini Man was bit by a snake Saturday at a LB event in TX (probably a baby copperhead). <br/>
