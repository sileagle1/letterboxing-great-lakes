Today, a group of us meet up in Long Grove for a day of Irish festivities, food, music, crafts, a legs in kilts contest, and - LETTERBOXING!  It's fun to meet and chat with other letterboxers.  Sorry you won't be able to attend the Door Co. gathering.  But I'm sure Fungus Woman and I will be putting our heads together for the 3rd Annual S.I.L.O. Gathering in mid-February, and you are absolutely invited to come.  It's open to one and all!  <br/>

  Hi Beetle!<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry, I can't make the 10th anniversary meet up in Door County this <br/>
  year. I have a quality audit that Thursday and Friday, and I won't <br/>
  have time to make the trek up there for one day. :( Sure sounds like <br/>
  fun though! I had a blast a few weeks ago with the Milwaukee mini-<br/>
  meet when Front Range Hiker came into town. Met some wonderful <br/>
  people and learned a ton.<br/>
<br/>
  Count me in if you still do your mini meet in February. If the <br/>
  invite is still there, I'd love to come!<br/>
<br/>
  Have a great holiday!<br/>
<br/>

  &gt; I have complete a couple stamps for the 10th Anniversary Gathering <br/>
  too. They are ready to mail off to The Dragon soon. Not sure if we <br/>
  should mail a freezer container too, or just the contents. I hope <br/>
  Popcorn Lady signs up. I have been contacted by several new <br/>
  letterboxers in the Lake Co. area of NE Illinois too. I love to talk <br/>
  with them about letterboxing because their enthusiasm reminds me of <br/>
  how I felt when I first started to find boxes. Years later, I still <br/>
  get a rush when I find a box. Letterboxers are good people! <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; For the Door County Gathering, I have already made reservations at <br/>
  The Wagon Trail Resort in Rowleys Bay, WI. for Fri-Sun. Looking <br/>
  forward to three days of fun, friendship, boxes, and relaxation in <br/>
  that peaceful area.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Several people, including the Brat Pack, are planning to meet in <br/>
  Long Grove at Village Tavern at 4:00 on Saturday. Some new boxes are <br/>
  anticipated, so I'm looking forward to finding them. We can enjoy <br/>
  the Irish Fest all afternoon and then, after we meet and eat, there <br/>
  is a men's best legs in kilts contest. LOL! Just some additional <br/>
  silliness for the day. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Looking forward to seeing other letterboxers, newbies too, at Long <br/>
  Grove tomorrow. <br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Yay! I just finished carving my "Malted Milk" stamp for the <br/>
  event, <br/>
  &gt; which is now only 5 weeks away. I have also received 5 stamps <br/>
  from <br/>
  &gt; other out-of-state contributors who carved images related to <br/>
  either a <br/>
  &gt; Wisconsin "First" or an impression of Wisconsin. A few more guest <br/>
  &gt; carver contributions are expected for the event, so we should <br/>
  have a <br/>
  &gt; nice variety of carvings when we find those boxes.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; We're looking forward to a nice time in the always scenic Door <br/>
  &gt; County, and are especially looking forward to seeing several of <br/>
  our <br/>
  &gt; LB friends to hear about their summer adventures (such as CR2 &amp; <br/>
  &gt; Hawkeye). <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; We're also hoping to meet some of the newer boxers in our area. <br/>
  So <br/>
  &gt; far I see Kermit signed up. We're looking forward to meeting this <br/>
  &gt; dramatic playright. What about Popcorn Lady? or WalesFlyerMary? <br/>
  &gt; Terrio? It also looks like someone from Texas is signed up?! Snow <br/>
  &gt; Cat?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Hopefully everyone will be able to get out this holiday weekend <br/>
  to <br/>
  &gt; find a box or otherwise enjoy the great outdoors as the summer <br/>
  starts <br/>
  &gt; winding down!<br/>
