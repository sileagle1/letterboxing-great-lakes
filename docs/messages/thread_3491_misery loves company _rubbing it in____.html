Christmas festivities with our families are finished, we'll be switching to<br>
boxing mode in honor of "Boxing Day" (December 26).  We'll probably just be<br>
doing some planning tomorrow, but will soon head "south" to hunt some boxes.<br>
Unfortunately we won't be heading far enough south to get some nice warm<br>
temperatures, but will only be making it down to Illinois.  At least the<br>
lack of snow makes winter boxing easier.  The forecast looks OK for<br>
Wednesday & Thursday.  We'll see what happens after that....<br>

My home will be filled with the sights and sounds and smells of Christmas for a couple more months.  Inside and out, my home is decorated to the max!!! I get to share some special time with friends.  We pretend that it's still Christmastime.  This is a fun time for me.  <br>
<br>
December 26 - Happy Boxing Day! It's not really a day to celebrate letterboxing, but we can pretend that it's actually "our hobby day."  Tee Hee!<br>
<br>
December - No snow - this feels odd.  But we've had so much rain that I would welcome some snow.  Right now, the ground is just muddy. <br>
<br>
Merry Christmas to everyone.  Keep the Spirit of Christmas alive.  <br>
