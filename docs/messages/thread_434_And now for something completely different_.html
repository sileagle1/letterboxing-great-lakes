                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh wow.  This is kind of scary, because without knowing there was an organized organization for visiting these historical markers, a few months ago I actually came up with the independant thought that I'd like to visit as many Ohio historical markers as I could.  I was trying to find a list on the Ohio Historical Society website of exactly how many markers there are in Ohio, and their locations so I could tick them off as I visited them...on my way to visit my friend who lives in Lisbon, Ohio (future site of a letterbox, if we ever get it carved ;) I pass a historical marker on Route 14 and purposely stopped one day just to read it.  Then, after I got back in my car, turned back around and went back to the sign because I realized I didn't bother reading the other side, assuming that it had the same information as the front. :)  <br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
