                    <div class="plaintext-content">  My computer is dead.  My hard drive is failing, and won't load Windows.  It is currently now in the (hopefully) capable hands of the Geek Squad who will (hopefully) be able to retrieve my personal data before Dell talks me through restoring the system.  Keep your fingers crossed!<br>
   <br>
  I won't be talking to you guys for at least a few days (I'm at work now), so don't talk about me behind my back.  Okay, I know you will anyway, so make sure it's some good stuff!  Talk about my stupidity for not backing up my files (photos, music, etc.)<br>
