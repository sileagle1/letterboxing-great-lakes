So the best Mother's Day present a girl could be given?  Husbandly indulgence and a day trip for letterboxing.<br>
<br>
My husband, daughter, mother-in-law and I all loaded up in the Escape to make the trek to Rochester Hills for the famiglia Gonzalez boxes.  I say "trek" because from Dearborn Heights to Rochester Hills there are only 29 miles, but 45 minutes by car.  Along Telegraph.  Ug.<br>
<br>
The first one, "Peace in Nature" is alive and well. But the box was cracked.  Will contact the placer to advise them of this.<br>
<br>
"Skipping Stone Gully" and "Rochester Falls" are also alive and well.  The rope swing in that path provided much fun for all.  Particularly my 2 year old daughter, who found it HILARIOUS when her grandma swung from the rope and collided with the tree.<br>
<br>
"Guardian's Point" was also alive and well.<br>
<br>
Then, the bottom dropped out.<br>
<br>
"Eugene the Fortunate" proved too complex and convoluted for us.  Plus, my daughter had reached her saturation point, and began baby meltdown (the park has been adopted by paintballers, and my daughter kept trying to eat the spent paintball shells.  ewwww!).  We gave up on this one and went to find "Dinosaur Hill"<br>
<br>
"Dinosaur Hill" was a mean trick in the most beautiful park ever.  Found the spot, only to learn that we needed the ability to determine GPS cordinates, which the clues do not mention.  So that one is alive, we guess.  No GPS= no box.  :(<br>
<br>
However, I do have to say that we had the the priviledge to see some of the most beautiful city parks.  In fact, Rochester Hills rivals Kalamazoo in sheer beauty and profusion of green space.  Of course, we were much more sucessful in Rochester Hills than we ever are in K-zoo (*grin* Azobox).<br>
<br>
All in all, a perfect mother's day in a beautiful city.  Thanks to the famiglia Gonzalez!<br>
