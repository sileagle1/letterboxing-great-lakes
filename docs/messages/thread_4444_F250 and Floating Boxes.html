Grove last weekend.  After our walk, we did a little more walking to <br/>
find some letterboxesall with a covered bridge theme.  We found <br/>
Beetle's box first with a nice stamp and HH.  Unfortunately, the <br/>
interior of the box also came with some mud and water.  We were able <br/>
to leave it in a drier and cleaner condition, fortunately.  Then it <br/>
was off to find 2 of Mosey's boxes.  We couldn't find the first box <br/>
we looked forwe were the "experienced" boxers she mentioned in her <br/>
post.  If she discovers that the box really was therewell, it won't <br/>
be the first time we've missed a box!  Then it was on to her second <br/>
boxwhere we did find another nice stampand which happened to be <br/>
F250 for me! (the rest of the family is a little or a lot behind that <br/>
number).  <br/>
<br/>
Reading FungusWoman's updated clues for 2 of her boxes (basically, <br/>
get in a canoe and start paddling) made me think of those 2 boxes.  <br/>
Right after we found our first box, we went on an afternoon of boxing<br/>
basically finding a lot of FungusWoman's boxes (and being amazed at <br/>
the beauty of hand-carved stamps.)  One of those finds was "Swinging <br/>
Bridge" --the 3rd box we ever found.  "Hoffman Towers" (a gorgeous <br/>
stamp) was F50 for me.  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, our boxes near the DesPlaines River had NOT floated <br/>
away.  However, I will be updating the clues for UGRR #1Broken <br/>
Chains because there are some big fallen trees totally blocking the <br/>
path.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, enough of the rambling note (I need to do more rambling in the <br/>
woods looking for boxes!)<br/>
