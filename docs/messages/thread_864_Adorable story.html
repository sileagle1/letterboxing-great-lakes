I just had to share this.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have indirectly addicted a new family to letterboxing.  They found Potter's Bridge 2 <br/>
weekends ago and Saturday the went to find my Dora the Explorer series.  I replaced two <br/>
stamps that Swiper took.  I love the way the leaves hide the boxes in the fall.  The group: <br/>
Mom, Grandma, and 2 little ones: ages 7 and 4, went out to explore.  They had a very <br/>
successful day and the 4-year-old is convinced that Dora put those boxes there.  They are <br/>
"Dora's boxes".  I was told the story was very clever.  I could not have been told a more <br/>
heartwarming story about something I created (with help from Dora).<br/>
<br/>
I am still smiling,<br/>
