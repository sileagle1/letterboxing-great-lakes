                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I was a busy gal today!!!  I checked on all my planted <br>
letterboxes and just wanted to give you the update:<br>
<br>
A Puppus Among Us is still pulled.  I did a check on the old hiding <br>
place today and it's just not going to work anymore.  We will find a <br>
new hiding spot and replant as soon as possible.  <br>
<br>
Adult Swim Series:<br>
Harvey Birdman, Aqua Teen Hunger Force & Sealab 2021 were all in <br>
their hiding places waiting for more visitors.  <br>
<br>
Futurama has been pulled.  The area it was hiding in has been <br>
flooded with water.  Luckily the letterbox was ok and will be <br>
replanted somewhere new soon.  <br>
<br>
Space Ghost Coast to Coast has been replanted after going missing <br>
over the winter.  It's in a new hiding place so be sure to print out <br>
the updated clues.<br>
<br>
Family Guy was in its' hiding place as well however the clues have <br>
been updated due to the new hiding place for Space Ghost.<br>
<br>
<br>
Holy Grail Exchange Series:<br>
When Danger Reared its Ugly Head was hiding safely awaiting more <br>
brave knights.<br>
<br>
Catapulted Cow has been confirmed missing.  I have emailed the box's <br>
creator about carving a replacement stamp.  I will let you all know <br>
once this box is back in circulation.<br>
<br>
Well there's the update and I will let you all know once the pulled <br>
boxes are back out in the wild.  <br>
