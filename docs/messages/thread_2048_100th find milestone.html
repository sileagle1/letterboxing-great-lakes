No dog with us yesterday but there was a whole family with their dogs <br>
on the beach when we arrived. (Kookaburra's dog, Doodle the Burr Ball, <br>
is only about 9 pounds. TINY footprints). We sat on the large boulder <br>
watching the lake in the fog until they finished up and moved on. A <br>
very fun day and the rain stayed away. We will be heading back that <br>
way on our next opportunity also. Many boxes left to explore!<br>
<br>
Congrats on your 100th!<br>
