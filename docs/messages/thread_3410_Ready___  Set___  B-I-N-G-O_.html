You're doing better than me!  The only person I know on the list is <br>
myself (Yeah!), no gatherings and none of the boxes... although at <br>
least one is on my "to do" list.  LOL   So, all but one of mine would <br>
be from the general list.  Aren't the words called completely <br>
randomly regardless of what category they're under?  I would assume <br>
so, so it wouldn't really matter which words you used.  It'd be pure <br>
luck, not weighted toward people who've been around longer to <br>
accumulate those boxes/gathering/exchanges.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Don't feel that people who can choose from several different boxes, <br>
gatherings, etc. have an advantage in the game.  The purpose of that <br>
really is more so that people are choosing from unique subsets of the <br>
words and there is less chance of duplicate cards.  This was a common <br>
misconception last year too and in the end, several people who did <br>
have a lot of the extra stuff to choose from and thus used less of <br>
the general words, did not come out nearly as well as some who used <br>
primarily the general terms.<br>
<br>
Also when you consider that we are a 6-state region and there are <br>
only 5-10 boxes from any one state in the game, taken somewhat <br>
proportionately from across the different areas of the state, there <br>
will be many people who will not be able to claim any of them for <br>
their list.  <br>
<br>
When it comes down to it, every word is equal and has an equal chance <br>
of being called, no matter what category it is in.<br>

You're exactly right - and last year it did seem that all the GENERAL <br>

You're doing better than me! The only person I know on the list is<br>
myself (Yeah!), no gatherings and none of the boxes... although at<br>
least one is on my "to do" list. LOL So, all but one of mine would<br>
be from the general list. Aren't the words called completely<br>
randomly regardless of what category they're under? I would assume<br>
so, so it wouldn't really matter which words you used. It'd be pure<br>
luck, not weighted toward people who've been around longer to<br>
accumulate those boxes/gathering/exchanges.<br>

That's what I'm thinking too :(  I have only found ONE of the boxes on <br>
the list, haven't exchanged with any of those listed, and haven't been <br>
to ANY events.  Rats.><br>

Hello all! Anyone want to meet in the Cleveland area for a mini-<br>
