did some light letterboxing along the way. On Saturday<br>
evening, we found the "Miller Park" box at a scenic<br>
overlook over the Menominee. My friend, who has been<br>
to Miller Park a zillion times, didn't even know it<br>
was there! It got dark pretty quickly, so we attempted<br>
"Creative Writing: The Neverending Story" and the "WI<br>
Hitchhiker Hostel". Got all of the parts to the<br>
clues...but the library was closed! So we made note of<br>
the hours and called it a night. Sunday, we went to<br>
Hart Park for some "Squished Pennies" action. It was a<br>
beautiful morning, and the woods here are very<br>
interesting. Lots of twisty and busted up trees. Only<br>
one train went by, so we didn't get to squish any<br>
pennies. Retrived the box and then headed to the other<br>
side of the park for "Watery Grave". We really enjoyed<br>
this area as well, got the box first<br>
(an-ti-ci-pation!) and then spent some time looking at<br>
the actual watery graves. On our way back to the car,<br>
I said to my friend, "Hey Brad, this is an example of<br>
a good place to put a letterbox" referring to a nearby<br>
log. So I lift out the bark, and voila a geocache was<br>
living there! The more you box, the more obvious<br>
hiding spots become I guess. Then we headed to a neat<br>
little preserve and park in Wauwatosa and found<br>
"Figure Eights". We didn't run, but we did enjoy the<br>
scenery. That afternoon, back to the library for the<br>
Neverending Story. What fun! Also visited the Hostel.<br>
Headed home, and got the "Grosse Point Lighthouse"<br>
right before dark. Can't wait to get back to<br>
Milwaukee!!!<br>

You found the Miller Park box!?!  We've been out looking for that one <br>
at least three times over the past year!  We assumed it was missing. <br>
We contacted the placer, but they never got back to us about it.  Can <br>
you give me a clue to its whereabouts?  We looked directly under the <br>
porch structure but found nothing, then looked around to the left of <br>
it among the rocks and brush.  Still nothing.  Please let me know if <br>
we were close to where you found it or not, because this has been <br>
really bothering me!<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Sophie & Me<br>
