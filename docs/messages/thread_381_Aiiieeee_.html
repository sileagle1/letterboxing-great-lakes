I just read an email on the LbNA Announce List that there were 2 new boxes planted in Ohio's Cuyahoga County yesterday - _my_ county - based on The Chronicles of Narnia - my most favorite series of books as a child - in the area where Jeff & I were riding our bikes with friends yesterday!!!  <br>
 <br>
Oh, the pain, the pain....I think the only cure to this is to do some letterboxing tonight...<br>
 <br>
But Jeff's going to the KISS concert, & we vowed to never box without the other.  Maybe I'll do some carving so we can finally plant some boxes of our own....we've got lots of great ideas!<br>
