Iowa after being there all week for work.  Looks like the Burlington <br>
DOT actually cleaned everything under that bridge and it's spotless.<br>
<br>
As far as I know, I was the only finder, but unfortunately, now I'll <br>
never know as I hadn't had the opportunity to check since last <br>
October.  I'll be contacting the placers to let them know.<br>

We need more boxers in western Iowa!<br>
