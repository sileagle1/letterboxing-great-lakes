2008 at Whitefish Dunes State Park---see you then! But we will need our <br/>
energy and folks gotta eat, so we are planning a pre-gathering meet and <br/>
greet Fish Boil the night before on Friday October 3 at The Wagon Trail <br/>
Resort, 1041 County Road ZZ in Rowleys Bay, WI. Check out their web <br/>
site at www.wagontrail.com or call 1-888-559-2466 for directions.  Easy <br/>
way to find this quiet gem is to find the Sister Bay Bowl in downtown <br/>
Sister Bay.  It's located the corner of Hwy. 42  and Hwy. ZZ.  Follow <br/>
the signs and take ZZ to the Wagon Trail.  The pre-gathering will start <br/>
at 5:00 pm.  Meet in front of the Wagon Trail on by the fish boil pot. <br/>
There are some local letterboxes posted on AQ and LbNA, so check out <br/>
the clues.  And yes, there will be several special temporary boxes that <br/>
will be placed for this special pre-gathering as well. Those clues will <br/>
be available at the dinner.  The theme of the series of boxes for this <br/>
pre-gathering will be....Famous Fish! Dinner is a full buffet with <br/>
several main entrees. So even if you don't think you are a fish eater, <br/>
you can sample the fish boil and choose other items too.  Questions: <br/>
Contact Beetle.  The pre-gathering event will be posted on AQ and LbNA. <br/>
There are approximately 22 people who have already contacted me, so the <br/>
more the merrier! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Wagon Trail Resort has confirmed our reservation for Friday, <br/>
October 3, 2008.  The Fish Boil "boil over" will be at 4:45 pm.  Come <br/>
for the blaze--then enjoy the fish.  <br/>
<br/>
The Fish Boil Buffet Dinner will be served at 5:00 pm SHARP!  Normally, <br/>
there is not a fish boil on Friday night; only on Saturday night.  But <br/>
with advance notice of a group of 24+ guests, they will do a special <br/>
Fish Boil for us. <br/>
<br/>
You might even want to arrive in the area early and look for the <br/>
permanent local letterboxers. I will be staying at the Wagon Trail <br/>
Friday until Monday. I plan to arrive early in the afternoon and hide <br/>
the Famous Fish Series.  So if you see someone in a Beatles T-shirt <br/>
sitting in the lobby or on the front porch of the Wagon Trail on Friday <br/>
afternoon, around 4:00 pm. --- that's me! (Unless there are other <br/>
Beatles fans in the area too and they are also wearing Beatles t-shirts <br/>
at the Wagon Trail - LOL!)      <br/>
<br/>
Cost: The complete buffet dinner is $15.99 per person + tax and <br/>
gratuity = $19.91 per person.  Beverages, not normally included, WILL <br/>
be included for us....makes it easier for the waitress and the guests.  <br/>
However, alcoholic beverages will be extra.  So far, no one has <br/>
indicated bringing children for the Fish Boil Buffet Dinner, but there <br/>
is a lesser charge for children.<br/>
<br/>
MMM...I can almost taste that fish!  But there are other entrees on the <br/>
buffet for those who want to 'sample' the fish, but enjoy the <br/>
additional homecooked foods too.  <br/>
<br/>
See everyone on Friday....and again on Saturday at the 10th WI <br/>
Gathering at Whitefish Dunes State Park.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing<br/>
