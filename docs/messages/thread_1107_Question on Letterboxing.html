Hi!  I have a question and maybe someone might be able to answer.  If <br/>
someone puts out multiple boxes in one park, should you take all of <br/>
the first finder certificates OR should you just take one, visit the <br/>
other boxes and allow someone else to get the first finder <br/>
certificates.  I know that defeats the "First Finder" certificate if <br/>
you visit the box and don't take it.  Thanks for taking the time to <br/>
answer this question.     <br/>

I don't put first finder certs in my boxes (I did a couple way back when I first started letterboxing) and haven't really run across many in the boxes I find (maybe because I'm very seldom the first finder -- by choice).<br/>
<br/>
I would think that by right they belong to the first person to visit the box, regardless of how many other first finder certs you already got in that park.  It might be considerate to leave them for somebody else -- although they would see that you had already been there and that they really weren't first so the first finder cert probably wouldn't carry much significance to them.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever feels right to you...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If the certificate is for First Finder, it seems appropriate that you take it.  We often include a "first finder" prize of some sort in the boxes we place, but when we hide a series we only put a FF prize in one box of the series, assuming it will be the same person to find all the boxes in the series.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting side note:  We once found a box that also had a prize for the SECOND finder.  The prize was related to whether the finder was male or female.  Since our niece found the box, she took the female prize and we put a note in the log book that the THIRD finders could have the remaining prize.  (The prizes really weren't gender specific, but simply had a pink ribbon around one and a blue ribbon around another.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to say I agree with those who say that the first finder certificate is yours by rights regardless of how many other FF certificates you may find on the same day at the same park.  After all, it's unlikely that anyone else would know that the box even had a certificate unless you wrote about it in the logbook.  However, I doubt this sort of a situation is all that common.  Around here, people aren't so much into certificates (at least not yet) and it's unlikely that most letterboxers would hide a bunch of boxes in the same park at the same time that weren't part of a series.  Now, if the boxes were all hidden at different times and have FF certificates because no one has bothered to go looking for them yet, then I would definately take them.  Anyway, like many parts of the hobby, you just have to do what feels right.    <br/>
