                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I was excited to see a package on our porch when we came home <br>
tonight.  Yes, it was from SpringChick...  However I never expected to <br>
receive such a huge treasure trove!  You guys donated some FANTASTIC <br>
prizes.  The box included Lock'n'Locks, all the ingredients to make a <br>
box, carving material, ink, freezer baggies, camo tape, camo <br>
fingerless gloves w/mittentop covers, gift certificates to a <br>
letterboxer's favorite stores, a certificate for a handcarved stamp <br>
and a few other items.  In other words - a letterboxer's dream!<br>
<br>
Many thanks to all of you that played the Bingo game and BIG THANKS to <br>
SpringChick for her efforts in creating and conducting this <br>
entertaining winter diversion for all of us on the Great Lakes board.  <br>
I hope it remains an annual tradition!<br>

The fact that I don't care for the game of BINGO just meant I deleted all but <br>
a  handful of Emails with BINGO in the subject line.<br>
 <br>
After reading what WI Hiker got it looks like I will be the first to sign  up <br>
for next years game <br>
