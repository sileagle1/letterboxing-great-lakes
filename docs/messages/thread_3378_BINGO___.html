letterboxing terms, box names, trail names, etc. From this list of<br/>
150 items, you will choose 30 items based on the criteria explained<br/>

You can count Team Rabbit in again for some Bingo fun! I also <br/>
wouldn't mind the same format.....it worked out pretty well last <br/>
time ;-) Seriously though, the length of the game just added to the <br/>
suspense! Of course, new ideas are always fun too! I know that we <br/>
really enjoyed SpringChick's 2 for Tuesday picks!<br/>
