&gt; Yes, it was a GREAT EVENT!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I, too, found an unexpected box - this one was called "The Bridge", and it<br/>
&gt; had no logbook.  It doesn't seem like it'd be a SCI-Fi related bonus box.  I<br/>
&gt; heard rumors that someone found the Mad Cow LB that has eluded me forever.<br/>
&gt; If it was you, please send me a message so I can ask some questions about<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went out again today for a bit - the event is still making me smile!<br/>

&gt;&gt; WOW, A GREAT EVENT!  The boxes were plentiful, well spaced, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; beautiful!  We had a great time roaming the trails on Saturday finding<br/>
&gt;&gt; boxes and bumping into the occasional group of boxers.  However, since<br/>
&gt;&gt; there were SO MANY boxes and a decent amount of trails, it didn't seem<br/>
&gt;&gt; like there were so many people at each box.  We managed to get out again<br/>
&gt;&gt; on Saturday, and again had a wonderful day (I think we saw Aimlesst and<br/>
&gt;&gt; her group from a distance, in addition to bumping into the Christmas<br/>
&gt;&gt; Elves, Martini Man, and Wisconsin Hiker).  Unfortunately, we had a to<br/>
&gt;&gt; leave a few boxes for next time (doht!)...but we did come away with at<br/>
&gt;&gt; least a few extra boxes other than the ones we were actually actively<br/>
&gt;&gt; hunting (a benefit of: 1. dual 'interpretations' when reading<br/>
&gt;&gt; clues....'you look over there at x steps, and I'll look at x double<br/>
&gt;&gt; steps'...and 2. lots of boxes lurking!) which is always fun!<br/>
&gt;&gt; We had a fun time reconnecting with boxers we already know, as well as,<br/>
&gt;&gt; those we met for the first time on Saturday.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thank you to everyone for the AWESOME weekend!<br/>

Of course, the contrary side of me (my given name IS "Mary" after all!) would like to point out that the image had to have been recarved because it is slightly different from the one I found in August '08.  The goody-two-shoes side won't count this as a find, but it was a fun consolation prize - especially since we colored it it up nice and purty.  :)<br/>
