                    <div class="plaintext-content">My LB ego is a little deflated and embarassed - I actually have found that entire series - just didn't recognize the stamp.  Of course, the contrary side of me (my given name IS "Mary" after all!) would like to point out that the image had to have been recarved because it is slightly different from the one I found in August '08.  The goody-two-shoes side won't count this as a find, but it was a fun consolation prize - especially since we colored it it up nice and purty.  :)<br>
