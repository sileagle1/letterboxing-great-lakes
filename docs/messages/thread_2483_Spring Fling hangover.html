many thanks to TJ_Mich for organizing this - you had everything set up <br/>
so beautifully, the rest of us just had to show up and enjoy.  It was <br/>
great to see some familiar faces, and meet several new ones.  Much to <br/>
my surprise, I managed to find all of the stamps in the park, including <br/>
two permanent ones I'd missed before.  Thanks to TeamRabbit for being <br/>
such fun 'boxing companions.  Thanks to all who were there for a really <br/>
great day in the park!<br/>
