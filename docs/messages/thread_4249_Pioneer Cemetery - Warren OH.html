                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to post here, in case anyone had clues printed out for <br>
this box, that it has indeed come up missing.  I had checked on it June <br>
23rd and it was fine.  July 3rd I received a report that it was <br>
missing.  Come to find out from my local newspaper, a boy scout troop <br>
and volunteered to clean the cemetery up.  Go figure, I would come <br>
accross the ONE scouting troop that doesn't know what letterboxing is, <br>
and pitched the box in spite of notes on the outside/inside asking it <br>
stay in place.  Talk about one of life's little ironies.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure if I'll replace the box or not.  In the process of <br>
cleaning up, they moved a large rock that was part of my hiding spot. <br>
So I'll have to look to see if I can find a new spot.  <br>
<br>
Both web pages have been updated with the new status! <br>

Thanks, <br>
