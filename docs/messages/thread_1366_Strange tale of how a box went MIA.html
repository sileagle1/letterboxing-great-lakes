                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not long after hiding some of the boxes in our Hauntings series, <br>
several of them in the Traverse City area went missing. We planned to <br>
re-carve and replace them to keep the Hauntings series alive.<br>
<br>
Today I found this in my email box:<br>
"My name is (removed on purpose) and I am a student at the University <br>
of (removed on purpose). Every year we do a Scavenger Hunt that <br>
involves items around Chicago and even around the US. This year part <br>
of our team had to drive around Lake Michigan looking for certain <br>
items. One item they had to find was the Traverse City State Hospital <br>
Letterbox. However, we did not totally understand what letterboxing <br>
was and accidentally took the box. We feel very badly about this and <br>
would like to know where we can mail the box to so that it can be <br>
returned to the State Hospital Ground. Please let me know so that I <br>
can mail the box to you or to someone else in the area. Again, we are <br>
very sorry that we took the box."<br>
<br>
Of course I sent a nice note thanking them for the honesty and giving <br>
a mailing address as well as a link to some letterboxing info.<br>
<br>
However, I'm still sitting here feeling stunned. <br>
<br>
I have questions like, "Who the heck was responsible for organizing <br>
this Scavenger Hunt?" and "Why on earth didn't they provide info to <br>
the participants about letterboxing if they were including boxes in <br>
their hunt?" swirling around in my head.<br>
<br>
And I'm a little bit mad because ALL of my clues include <br>
this, "Copyright (year): Please do not publish or post this <br>
information anywhere without obtaining prior permission." So I wonder <br>
what part of that statement was not clear to whoever decided to add <br>
my letterboxes to this hunt?<br>
<br>
At least I have a chance of getting one of the boxes back.  Of course <br>
it means a 3 hour drive to replace it.  Opps .. shouldn't grump about <br>
getting a MIA box back! Thanks for letting me vent.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Strange indeed!  I would be a bit miffed too if it were my box, and <br>
agree that if somebody is going to include a letterbox in something <br>
like this, they should give some basic information about letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Glad you are getting the box back though!  It was a good one!  They <br>
aren't by any chance responsible for the demise of the other missing <br>
TVC hauntings box, are they?<br>
