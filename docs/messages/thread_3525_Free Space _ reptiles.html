husband and I are on vacation in Hilton Head, SC.  While out <br/>
letterboxing at a forest preserve on the island what should we see <br/>
about 15 feet from us but two good sized alligators and 4 rather large <br/>
turtles all out enjoying the sun together! How cool is that? Being a <br/>
born and raised Chicago area girl this was quite a novel experience!<br/>
Then we went down to Savannah to sight see and picked up two boxes <br/>
while in the city.  Remarkably enough, when I stamped into one box I <br/>
saw that Sew-Sew Busy had stamped into that same box earlier that same <br/>
day! She being from Virginia and I from Chicago that is pretty neat. <br/>
What makes it really fun is that she is on my bingo card because I met <br/>
her at a gathering...I took it as an omen(plus her space is <br/>
strategically located on my card)and chose her space as my Free Space.<br/>
I love this hobby!  By the way it is really nice to be out boxing in <br/>
74 degree weather in January....not gloating...just sharing.<br/>

Now y'all should plant a box in Chicago with an alligator stamp, in<br/>

<br/>
well - can you really be formerly southern?  I mean, isn't is some <br/>
like "you can take the girl out of the south, but you can't take the <br/>
south out of the girl"?  When I go back south to visit family, that <br/>
Southern accent comes back all over again for about a month<br/>

cross trails at the same time in GA! -- and the BINGO game - which <br/>
I'm obviously too late to join.  Don't get over to this board too <br/>
