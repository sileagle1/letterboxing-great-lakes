Yes, it was a GREAT EVENT!  <br>
<br>
I, too, found an unexpected box - this one was called "The Bridge", and it had no logbook.  It doesn't seem like it'd be a SCI-Fi related bonus box.  I heard rumors that someone found the Mad Cow LB that has eluded me forever.  If it was you, please send me a message so I can ask some questions about it.<br>
<br>
I went out again today for a bit - the event is still making me smile!<br>
