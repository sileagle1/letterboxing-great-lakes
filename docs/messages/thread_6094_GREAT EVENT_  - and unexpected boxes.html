Yes, it was a GREAT EVENT!  <br/>
<br/>
I, too, found an unexpected box - this one was called "The Bridge", and it had no logbook.  It doesn't seem like it'd be a SCI-Fi related bonus box.  I heard rumors that someone found the Mad Cow LB that has eluded me forever.  If it was you, please send me a message so I can ask some questions about it.<br/>
<br/>
I went out again today for a bit - the event is still making me smile!<br/>

&gt; WOW, A GREAT EVENT!  The boxes were plentiful, well spaced, and <br/>
&gt; beautiful!  We had a great time roaming the trails on Saturday finding <br/>
&gt; boxes and bumping into the occasional group of boxers.  However, since <br/>
&gt; there were SO MANY boxes and a decent amount of trails, it didn't seem <br/>
&gt; like there were so many people at each box.  We managed to get out again <br/>
&gt; on Saturday, and again had a wonderful day (I think we saw Aimlesst and <br/>
&gt; her group from a distance, in addition to bumping into the Christmas <br/>
&gt; Elves, Martini Man, and Wisconsin Hiker).  Unfortunately, we had a to <br/>
&gt; leave a few boxes for next time (doht!)...but we did come away with at <br/>
&gt; least a few extra boxes other than the ones we were actually actively <br/>
&gt; hunting (a benefit of: 1. dual 'interpretations' when reading <br/>
&gt; clues....'you look over there at x steps, and I'll look at x double <br/>
&gt; steps'...and 2. lots of boxes lurking!) which is always fun!<br/>
&gt; We had a fun time reconnecting with boxers we already know, as well as, <br/>
&gt; those we met for the first time on Saturday.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you to everyone for the AWESOME weekend!<br/>
