Thanks for reporting this HH FungusWoman.  We hadn't heard anything about<br/>
him.  Could you contact me off list and let me know where he's b<br/>
een?<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to tell you a long saga of how I came by the Dragon Hide; I was<br/>
fully<br/>
prepared to search high and low, to battle Balrogs, and even to send away<br/>
for<br/>
something special, if necessary.  The reality, as reality so often is, was<br/>
more<br/>
mundane: I just happened upon it at Hobby Lobby. 8-&gt;<br/>

&gt; PS:  Speaking of hitchhikers, who should have made an appearance in<br/>
Come<br/>
&gt; Grumpy, Go Happy but Mr. Dragon of Wisconsin!  I missed that one at the<br/>
&gt; Gathering.  Neat design, Team Taco and Acorn!!  Where did you get the<br/>
dragon<br/>
&gt; hide?  (He's still living at my house...I was unable to unleash him on the<br/>
&gt; world...couldn't find a container to fit him.)<br/>
