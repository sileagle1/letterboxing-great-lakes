I've tried Bounce.  It doesn't work.  The only thing I've ever seen work was Artistamp's mosquito netting.  THAT works.  And it's really very fashionable.  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
I discovered that mosquitoes can bite through jeans while at the Gathering.  My husband didn't know this, either, because he gave me some VERY odd looks when I got home and showed him all my bites.  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
And as for learning to spell your trail name...there are some early finds of mine where "Delirium" is spelled with two "e"s.  Very nice, considering I'm an English teacher.  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Just want to say many thanks to Shutterfly for finding our box  and <br/>
commenting on our first attempt.  Now I understand why everyone gets so  crazy after <br/>
they place a box.  When Dumpster Diva and I didn't hear  anything about our <br/>
first placement we felt a little out of the loop.  You  know "LBA" (Letter boxer's <br/>
Anxiety).<br/>
<br/>
Not yet having found a box, we had zero idea of what we were  up against.  <br/>
This did not thwart our attempt at placing our own box...We  decided to go with <br/>
the "Live and learn" attitude.  Plus, sometimes the most  memorable moments <br/>
are also the most embarrassing.  I mean, we had a couple  of weeks of LB faux <br/>
pas, didn't we?  We may be newbies, but we are  fearless!<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that several of you have team names.  Dumpster  Diva and I are best <br/>
friends who live in two different states (MI and IL) I  believe it's high <br/>
time we come up with a team name.  I have a couple ideas,  but of course, I'll <br/>
have to check with my teammate.  I'll be getting back  to you all on this.  We <br/>
have nothing in common, so this ought to be fun to  work on.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about team spirit...Like an idiot, I promised her that I  wouldn't try <br/>
to look for a box that we were unable to find while she was  visiting me here <br/>
in MI, unless she was with me again.  What was I  thinking?  This box is not <br/>
even 5 miles from my home (Who's at Hagar Park)  I drive by it almost every day. <br/>
 A promise is a promise...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah, Lipstick Chick, I understand your anxiety.  Deedle &amp; I have the same promise - no letterbox hunting will occur unless both are present!  Now, granted, it's a little easier for us since we only live a city or two away from each other, not entire states away.  But when you've been bitten by the letterboxing bug and then have two busy schedules to coordinate, the need to get out there &amp; box when you can't becomes overwhelming.  In the meantime I pacify myself by trying to figure out mystery clues, prepare ideas for letterbox plants, etc., so that when I next see Jeff I'm talking non-stop about our next letterboxing exploits for about an hour.<br/>
<br/>
Yet he still loves me :)<br/>

Doodle aka Diane, who, with Deedle, is FINALLY going to get to go letterboxing hunting on Sunday!<br/>
