I know that there are a few people on this list from Indiana and I'm<br>
hoping that they can give me some state-specific advice.  I want to<br>
plant a series at Shades State Park.  I went to the IN DNR's website<br>
and read their policy on geocaching and also reviewed their permit for<br>
geocaching.  I couldn't find anything about letterboxing and those two<br>
documents are much too specific to be applied to letterboxing (for<br>
starters, I have no way of providing the DNR with exact coordinates<br>
and I don't plan to post it on the geocaching site).  So, those of you<br>
with boxes in Indiana State Parks:  did you ask permission, and if so,<br>
of whom?  Have you had any boxes pulled by park managers or other DNR<br>
employees?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Nope and Nope. There has been a letterbox at Potato<br>
Creek State Park for ages and it's still there. I have<br>
several series at Indiana State Parks and try to keep<br>
the boxes placed trailside in order to keep social<br>
trails at a minimum. There's a lot of boxes at Fort<br>
Harrison State Park....so.....as long as you plant<br>
responsibly....and the boxes attract no outside<br>
attention...I say go for it!<br>
<br>
just my .02<br>

Interesting question.  Since I found my first boxes in IN State Parks, I didn't question that it <br>
could be a no-no.  So I placed one.  I saw a specific note on the Clifty Falls SP map that <br>
said leaving things behind was not permitted.  So I didn't pursue that park.  As Armadillo <br>
Jo said, there are boxes in quite a few SP's but it has been my experience that they are not <br>
very far off the trail.  It might still be an under-the-radar activity in this state.  Wonder <br>
how long that will last?<br>

<br>
I'm not from Indiana, but I agree with what Armadillo<br>
Jo & speedsquare already wrote about planting boxes in<br>
general.  A large chunk of letterboxes hidden around<br>
Cleveland are hidden in our area Metroparks, and when<br>
Deedle & I were getting ready to place our first plant<br>
(which was slated for a Metroparks park) I went to<br>
their main website to see if they had a policy.  Same<br>
as you wrote - they had a geocaching policy, and a<br>
form to fill out if you were placing a geocache, but<br>
also too specific to be applied to letterboxing.  And<br>
since there were already so many boxes planted, we<br>
didn't want to jeopardize those boxes by bringing<br>
letterboxing to the attention of the powers that be. <br>
We figured as long as we're not planting them in areas<br>
that will harm the area, it was better to keep it<br>
under the radar as long as possible.  <br>

This is exactly why I figured I would ask here first, rather than email<br>
the DNR and ask them.  I loved the boxes that we found at Fort Harrison<br>
State Park and would hate to think of them being destroyed.  Thanks to<br>
every one who responded!  I guess I'll load up the car sometime in the<br>
next few weeks and head over to Shades State Park.  <br>
