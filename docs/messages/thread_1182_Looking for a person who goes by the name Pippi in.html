Ancient &amp; I have temporarily "adopted" Cindy &amp; Keith's boxes.  They had<br/>
planned a trip to Africa back in February but had cancelled it.  They had a<br/>
chance to go this month and decided to go for the month of April (&amp; probably<br/>
May).  They removed all the clues so that we could decide what we could<br/>
easily maintain.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't done anything with the Blanding's boxes yet.  I think we'll<br/>
probably pull any/all the boxes that are in DuPage forest preserves.<br/>
