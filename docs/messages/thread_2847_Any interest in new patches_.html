<br>
Some of you that have been around a while know that we had patches <br>
made with our original regional logo.  I placed an order for 200 <br>
patches last summer and all 200 were gone by this spring.<br>
<br>
I held off reordering the patches, knowing that SpringChick would be <br>
incorporating Minnesota into a new design.  I'm willingly to order <br>
some new patches, but am wondering how much interest there is. Since <br>
SpringChick has included a title with the logo, we could also <br>
duplicate the same look on the patch. The patch price would probably <br>
be $2 - $2.50 per patch.  Our original patches were a 2.5" round <br>
patch.  With the new design we could go with either a circle or <br>
square/rectangle. It could be approximately the same size, or larger <br>
if we wanted. <br>
<br>
If you'd like to see the original patch, and two possible designs for <br>
a new patch, you can look in the Photos section of this group, in <br>
the "Patches" album.  <br>

I'll wait to see how the discussion goes on this topic, and if there <br>
is enough interest, I'll create a poll to select a final design.<br>
