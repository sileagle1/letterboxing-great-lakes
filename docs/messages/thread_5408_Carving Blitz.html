I have about 10-15 stamps previously carved in my closet. Now that the <br/>

Although we haven't been carving recently, we do have a backlog of 14 boxes to plant.  11 are from the WI 10th Anniversary event, 2 will feature our "winnings" from the Cakewalk at the County Fair event and 1 is a stamp that I carved quite a while ago.  Of these 14, 1 will go to Florida, 1 to IL and the other12 will be scattered across WI, since I plan to plant the "Wisconsin Firsts" boxes in the location most appropriate to each image.  We might get a couple boxes planted in the Milwaukee area this weekend or next, and then hope to get a bunch more planted in the state the weekend after Thanksgiving.<br/>
