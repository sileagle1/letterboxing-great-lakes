                    <div class="plaintext-content">Took the long drive from Lansing to WI today and picked up the<br/>
following boxes:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Fenner's First -- Lansing, MI (Really nice nature preserve; got<br/>
there before the Nature Center opened and had to wander the trails<br/>
mapless guessing which was the biggest rock.  Got it after a couple<br/>
extra loops.)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Brokey Key Letterbox -- Lansing, MI (WI placer, WI finder; nice,<br/>
quick stop)<br/>
<br/>
3.  Giant Caster - Lansing, MI (Last time I was there, there were too<br/>
many people to root around; got there early and found it no problem.)<br/>
<br/>
4-8.  Superhero Series - Holt, MI (Great series, quick, interesting,<br/>
but "Holy mosquitoes, Batman!"; I set world records with stamp-in times.)<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Lansing's starting to get some really nice boxes!  Way to go.<br/>
<br/>
9.  Asylum Birds - Kalamazoo, MI (Couldn't find a few numbers, but<br/>
figured it out anyway.  Great hike!)<br/>
<br/>
10.  Home in the Pines -- Kalamazoo, MI (Was looking for "Al Sabo Land<br/>
Preserve" and found the sign near this box; picked it up, but never<br/>
could find "Al Sabo".)<br/>
<br/>
11. GLK Exchange: Octagon House -- Portage, IN (Wonderful conclusion,<br/>
great stamp, really interesting box; I need to find more from this<br/>
Exchange.)<br/>
<br/>
12. Bonus Box -- ???, ?? (a very welcome surprise)<br/>
<br/>
Wow was that fun, but I'm tired.  This is by far my most "productive"<br/>
day of letterboxing.  Aside from gatherings, what have been some of<br/>
your "productive" days?  I'm sure they dwarf mine.<br/>
<br/>
***I put "productive" in quotes because I've had some days were I've<br/>
only found one box, but have felt pretty dang productive.<br/>
