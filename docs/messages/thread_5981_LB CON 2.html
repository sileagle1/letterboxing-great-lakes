<br>
====================<br>
This is in no way a put down of LBCon or a comparison with L & B but concern with publicity. There have been some discussions lately of the growing concern of National Parks having discussions about the "problems" of geocaching and letterboxing. <br>
<br>
In years past before the previously mentioned article on Family magazine, before other spats of publicity there has been about boxing, before scout trooops giving out patches, before mentions on the Today show, before all the other publicity that has brought so many more people into the hobby, this wasn't a problem, or at least certainly not to the extent it seems to be happening now. Boxing was smaller, much more lowkey, and the people who found out about it usually did so by WOM or by wandering by accident onto a web site, first just lbna and now both lbna and AQ. <br>
<br>
Please remember that with National "Conventions" and clubs bidding on the chance to hold these conventions comes more and more publicity. More publicity means more concerns from Park Officials, both on a national, local and state level. Making letterboxing more mainstream doesn't guarantee an embracing of the hobby by officials concerned with the land they are striving to protect and preserve. <br>
<br>
It has always been traditional to not plant in National Parks anyway but in other woodland areas of different kinds, both local and state. With publicity comes more regulations and even the potential banning of boxing in many of these places where we now plant in peace. <br>
<br>
I would just ask everyone to please give this some thought and remember that sometimes bigger is not always better. I love this hobby and hope to be doing it unfettered by an over abundance of official rules and regulations for many years to come. I know that many of us feel the same way. <br>
<br>
It's a very special and unique hobby that I would like to see treated with the same kind of concern and respect that we give to the places where we plant. I hope it can continue to flourish without becoming a monster that must be stepped on by officials because of their fear of it. <br>
<br>
Once again, this is not a put down of LBCon or the people who worked to make it happen. So please don't put words in my mouth and flame me for loving the hobby enough to speak out and speak my mind. I voice my concerns because I love letterboxing. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Con, like Letterboxing, was what you made it out to be.<br>
 <br>
After my first gathering (SILO 1) when I had been in the hobby for only 3  <br>
months, I wanted to get EVERY stamp (exchanges, PT's, event stamps, cooties, <br>
 etc). I kept looking over at my daughter Skeeter (who was 5 at the time) <br>
sitting  by herself at a table. I ignored her in order to get *every* stamp.<br>
 <br>
After SILO 1, I would flip through my logbook to look at the stamp images I <br>
 had amassed and realized I only really referred back to and "studied" the <br>
images  of the stamps I had collected out in the wild & the exchanges (as <br>
they are  like autographs). I hardly ever look to the pages containing the <br>
BEAUTIFULLY  detailed event stamps!<br>
 <br>
I decided at that point that all future gatherings I would only exchange -- <br>
 no PT's, no Cooties, no Event stamps (other than the 1 main event stamp -- <br>
 saying I had been there).<br>
 <br>
The GLG gathering in Afton S.P. I didn't find 1 event box . . . I was to  <br>
busy exchanging and meeting people. However, after the GLG Gather we did find <br>
a  few boxes that had been in the wild for a few years.<br>
 <br>
So, with that rather lengthy background, you have an idea of where I was  <br>
coming from as I drove to St. Louis. Exchange Exchange Exchange . . . there <br>
were  boxers from coast to coast, many of whom I may never get to meet again. <br>
Of the  near 300 signed up I only met about a dozen previous -- I'd say <br>
about half  the number actually showed up, perhaps a tad closer to 200. Either <br>
way, when it  was all said and done, I had only met about 10 people before <br>
and ended up  exchanging with close to 150 more boxers.<br>
 <br>
Shorty & I found a few boxes on the way to St. Louis and met up with  <br>
Familyof6 in Nauvoo. I planted a box in Alton, IL (still to be listed) so before  <br>
we hit St. Louis my count was P1 F2 X1 (not thrilling #'s I know). We got <br>
to the  campus after 10:00pm and found 4 Little Piggies from Tennessee.<br>
 <br>
They let us into the dorms (we weren't scheduled to check in until the next <br>
 day), before the night was up we met up with Camp Fire Lady, Ryan & <br>
Amanda,  Kreepy Kelli and several other boxers. We exchanged with another 15  <br>
folks.<br>
 <br>
Friday Shorty & I went to Queeny Park . . . where the Queen's ruled and  we <br>
only found 5 boxes(and hiked 5 1/2 miles) :-(<br>
 <br>
Then we went to Fairy Princess Fiona's house (she lived across the street  <br>
and down a block from Queeny Park) for an Open House where we had snacks and <br>
met  more boxers then we went to the Doom & Pain Pajama Party -- this <br>
precursor  to the main Con was instrumental in getting exchanges out of the way. <br>
After  Friday night I had exchanged with over 100 people!!<br>
 <br>
I kindly turned down PT's with only a couple sentimental exceptions. And  <br>
Cooties where flicked off my back as they came (truth be told, I only got 1  <br>
Cootie all weekend and it was one that Wassa left on my bed. Ironically <br>
enough I  was the first person to ever stamp into the cootie that was launched <br>
at SILO 1  by Brat Pack IL!!!)<br>
 <br>
The "Main Event" had vendor tables set up where you could buy any color of  <br>
ink you could imagine from several different companies. There were markers, <br>
PZ  Kut, ink re-fills, carving tools and BEAUTIFUL logbooks created by Camp <br>
Fire  Lady (I highly recommend you all buy one) all for sale!<br>
 <br>
There were several workshops on how to make your own logbooks, how to  <br>
cipher and decipher clues (by KuKu), how to carve detailed stamps (by Raqs), how <br>
 to age paper (by Lnd-Crzr). There was a HH contest and a Logbook swap.<br>
 <br>
As I got nearly every exchange I could by mid-day Saturday I decided to  <br>
find some Event boxes hidden out for the event (it was either that or just sit <br>
 on my duff and do nothing) we found 5 AWESOME Lnd-Crzr boxes. That evening <br>
there  was night boxing planned. 6 boxes hidden on campus and 9 boxes in a  <br>
cemetery.<br>

I've never been night boxing before, and it was different for sure. There  <br>
were clues, however, they placed bicycle reflectors near the boxes location <br>
so  you could see them with your flashlight (don't know if this is normal or <br>
 not).<br>
 <br>
Shorty, Kreepy Kelli & I spent the majority of our evening (3 hours)  <br>
laying in the woods and ambushing people as they walked by. The passerby's were  <br>
spread out enough where the next group to walk by us didn't hear the scream <br>
from  the group in front of them, so we got everyone good. . .  even had two <br>
 people wet themselves (that was reward enough!). <br>
 <br>
That night we staid up until about 3 in the morning just sitting, chatting  <br>
& laughing together. Sharing stories and tales . . . it was so nice to have <br>
 the time to get to know these wonderful people outside the 'sport' of  <br>
letterboxing.<br>
 <br>
The next day was a bit slower pace as event boxes were being pulled and  <br>
people started leaving. A large group of us went out to lunch and really <br>
enjoyed  each others company and the 14 of us carved a single stamp and hid a box <br>
right  there in the restaurant <br>
_http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=121150_ (http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=121150) <br>
 <br>
I hadn't been so sleep deprived in years . . . every night was a 2 - 4 in  <br>
the morning bedtime. So, Sunday, in preparation of the drive home I slept  <br>
from 4 - 9 in the evening. Aside from being woken up an hour into my nap --  <br>
and being ambushed with ink pads!!!! I woke up and packed up (check out time <br>
was  anytime before midnight).<br>
 <br>
Shorty and I had planed on hitting some boxes on the ride home. Our  luck <br>
turned sour on box #1 at 10:30 p.m when a nice officer who hailed  from Scott <br>
County Iowa (right across the boarder from where I live) turned  his lights <br>
on and put a spot light on us. :-( <br>
 <br>
We had to leave with a warning. Shorty fell asleep soon after and so I  <br>
drove him all the way home without stopping for another box.<br>
 <br>
I, personally, really loved the convention. Sure, it wasn't an outdoor  <br>
gathering . . . but neither was SILO 1 or a Letterboxers Wedding. I've heard of <br>
 workshops (how to make logbooks or how to carve a stamp) in other <br>
gatherings  just like the Con. And, as I try to only exchange with everyone (and if  <br>
successful then I hit the trails) I was in 7th Heaven meeting SO many <br>
awesome  boxers from so many different states!!<br>
 <br>
I would do it all over again! In a heart beat.<br>

"conventions" tend to get publicity.  Apparently this was even organized and<br>
planned for by the CONVENTION Committee (unlike a large state event we<br>
attended 5 years ago, where the organizers specifically turned away requests<br>
for publicity).  One post I saw said that "there was supposed to be a media<br>
person covering the Con. Arrangements had been made for them to have a<br>
'press pass'."  For a hobby that has its roots in secrecy and discretion,<br>
this is a different path.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The same thing can be said for many other rubberstamping activities that are<br>
using the word "letterbox".  Many have more in common with scrapbooking or<br>
other artistic activities, rather than clues & hikes.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Here's a list that someone posted about the logistics involved with planning<br>
a national convention.  Sounds like some corporate events I have been<br>
involved with in the past.  <br>

I've been trying, unsuccessfully, to wrap my head around the idea of a<br>
letterboxing convention since it was first mentioned. My convention<br>
experiences and my letterboxing experiences make me think the two concepts<br>
are, well, antithetical. I'm curious as to what went on and how it worked,<br>
but obviously wasn't curious enough to ditch my faithful letterboxing<br>
companions and go. So what did happen at LB Con? How was it different<br>
from a gathering, aside from the obvious of being indoors? Was there<br>
actual letterboxing happening? I don't know anyone, personally, who went,<br>
and as I said, I'm curious. Maybe I missed some one posting a message of<br>
their experience, in which case, I'd be happy to be referred to a post #,<br>
but otherwise, any one care to enlighten me?<br>

I shared my experience. <br>
 <br>
As far as media or publicity was concerned the only camera/interviews/etc  <br>
that I witnessed was that of JackBear's LetterPod comcast. <br>
 <br>
To my knowledge the only non-boxers that heard about it was the girls who  <br>
worked at the dorm checking us in and out of our rooms.<br>
 <br>
I'm sure someone else may have "talked", again, I was just sharing my  <br>
experience as a boxer attending the Con.<br>

Matt, I seem to recall Skeeter being quite busy in distributing Cooties at that gathering!!!!<br>

Thanks, though, for your description of LB CON.  I, too, was wondering how it was different than a gathering and I appreciated all you wrote about your experience.  It sounds like it was a lot of fun.<br>

I thought the con was fabulous!  Hartx6, you did a great job explaining how it all worked.  <br>
<br>
Part of what was so fun for me was staying in the dorm.  Between the pajama party Friday night and running into people every where you turned, I got to talk to a lot more people than I usually do.  I also tend to exchange-and-run - I come away with a lot of exchages that only represent a brief meeting.  And while I still got lots of those, I also got to sit down to meals with new people, and hang out in the dorm late at night chit-chatting.  It was like opening a surprise package to walk down to one of the common rooms - "gee, I wonder who will be here this time?"  <br>
<br>
I also loved the classes, the presentations, and having the vendors there was so handy.  It was definitely different than a regular gathering, but in a great way.  I even found time to hunt some letterboxes!<br>
