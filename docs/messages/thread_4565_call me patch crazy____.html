Something we stole from Wisconsin, eh? LOL<br/>
<br/>
I'm half-Yooper, though. And you can use your left hand for that, <br/>
too, if you're creative.<br/>
<br/>
Hold it out with your palm facing away from you, turn your fingers to <br/>
your right and stick out your pinky and thumb, holding the other <br/>
three fingers together.  My mom grew up at the crook of your <br/>
thumb.  My brother went to school at the 2nd knuckle of your ring finger.  LOL<br/>

If you pull off your sock, you can show where you live in Indiana.  I <br/>
can say that since I spent quite a few years as a Hoosier--smack dab in <br/>
