Wisconsin?  I suppose you could say that looks like a hand.... a hand <br>
that was run over by a steam roller or something.  Heh.<br>

Something we stole from Wisconsin, eh? LOL<br>
<br>
I'm half-Yooper, though. And you can use your left hand for that, <br>
too, if you're creative.<br>
<br>
Hold it out with your palm facing away from you, turn your fingers to <br>
your right and stick out your pinky and thumb, holding the other <br>
three fingers together.  My mom grew up at the crook of your <br>
thumb.  My brother went to school at the 2nd knuckle of your ring finger.  LOL<br>

If you pull off your sock, you can show where you live in Indiana.  I <br>
can say that since I spent quite a few years as a Hoosier--smack dab in <br>
the middle and then up on the cuff.<br>
