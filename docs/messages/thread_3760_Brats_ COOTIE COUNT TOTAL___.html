You're cootie plan worked.  I don't thing anyone felt left out, and if anyone does because they didn't find a cootie in their pocket or personal belongings, keep looking because I'm sure there are more lurking around.  Or, I'll mail you a cootie! Bubba and Peanut had plenty to do and I'm sure they felt they were seriously getting away with a something by sneaking around and infecting everyone.  Congrats to Lil A on his first cootie.  <br>
<br>
However, there is nothing to feel sorry about.  You were not 'bad' and PLEASE don't sit in the corner for a self imposed time out.  While you are sitting there, you'll probably start carving more cooties!  Actually, I think it's hysterical that this group manages to slip each other so many cooties while there are so many people in a close area. We certainly are a sneaky group!  <br>
<br>
Next gathering?  Did I hear another suggestion?  Someone just needs to say when and where and we'll all be there.  After all, wneed a place to gather again so we can pass some of these cooties around.  Tee Hee!  That means there are at least 36 cooties among us, plus a couple from St. Nick's, plus more to come.  <br>
<br>
Oh no!  An idea just popped into my head.  Hmmm.....do I dare say what you have inspired me to do for the next gathering?  Nope.  I'll keep this idea to myself.  But I will say that it is a cooties related idea.  LOL!  <br>
<br>
Thanks for creating such a fun atmosphere with all the cooties.  I'm sure we'll be finding them for days to come as we unpack.  I found one in my coat pocket yesterday. It made me smile.  We are an infectiously friendly bunch!  <br>

  Alright Now I'm inspired to find out the answer to that question. Just how many cooties Does it take to fill a Jeep Wrangler????<br>

  them to use! So if you see a couple with little<br>

<br>
  Oh wait, better reserve a few for our tent, too. And<br>
  better remember not to leave the top down on the Jeep<br>
