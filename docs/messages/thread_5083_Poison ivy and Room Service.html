Sorry about the confusion over Room Service, Hx6...with all your hospitalizations and all, I didn't want to burden you with that as well. When I saw that the Cottontails were going to be attending, I sent it to them instead, and forgot to tell you of the change in plans.<br/>
Those of you who got that one last year, it's the same stamp and log. If all goes according to plan when they hear back from the hotel management...the idea is that the Lb will be at the hotel's front desk. You ask the clerk if they have Room Service to obtain it. But again...the actual plan may change...so wait to hear the word from Cottontails for official directions.<br/>

I am poison ivy free. That doesn't mean anything<br/>
though for 2 reasons. One, I am immune to poison ivy,<br/>
just lucky I guess. Two, I never even bother to look<br/>
for poison ivy when I'm out because of reason number<br/>
one. So I can't answer your question. : )<br/>
