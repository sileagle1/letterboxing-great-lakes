                    <div class="plaintext-content">Had to spend a couple of nights in Freeport, so decided to combine <br>
reunions with hobbies and stayed on to do some boxing on Saturday. I <br>
could tell I wasn't in "Chicagoland" anymore when the billboards <br>
started advertising places in Iowa.  <br>
<br>
I used a 40% deet repellent spray and also sprayed down my jeans, <br>
socks, and boots the night before with a tick killing permethrin <br>
spray.  I picked up no tick or mosquito hitchhikers and I found the <br>
following boxes:<br>
<br>
1. To God be the Glory, placed by Nature Nerd outside Freeport.  <br>
Actually found this box on Friday evening, not Saturday.<br>
<br>
Didn't actually figure on having time to get to this box.  However, <br>
as is usual for me, I got lost.  I took the wrong Rte 20 from <br>
Rockford to Freeport and suddenly, right there, right smack in front <br>
of me, was To God be the Glory.  Wow!  How nice for me! Didn't have a <br>
bumpersticker on my truck saying "I slam on my brakes for <br>
letterboxes!!" so I couldn't justify slamming on my brakes and having <br>
the 6 cars or so behind me get upset.  Not to mention my auto <br>
insurance agent might commit suicide at that one when he found out <br>
the reason for an abnormally large payout.  Went to mile marker 26 <br>
until I could safely turn around, come back and snag the box.  Box <br>
was in good order.<br>
<br>
2.  Krape Park Treasure Hunt, 6 boxes placed in Krape Park, Freeport, <br>
by River Rat.  There's something about River Rat's stamps that I <br>
like.  They're rather crude, rather raw, rather Grandma Moses-ish.  <br>
But that's exactly what I'd expect a "River Rat" to carve.  Very <br>
appropriate.<br>
<br>
Had a fantastic time at this park.  It was amazing how they've <br>
combined the parts for the wildlife with the parts for the humans. <br>
And, having decided to hike it rather than drive it, and having <br>
forgotten my water in the truck, suddenly coming across vending <br>
machines just placed out in the middle of wherever was kind of nice <br>
too.  Probably a good money-maker for the park.  Great disc golf <br>
setup.  Played a bit since I carry my discs in the truck in the <br>
summer.  Lots of things to explore here.  <br>
<br>
Only sad part was that I couldn't find the last box.  Tried and tried <br>
and tried somemore but Box #6 eluded me completely.  The boxes were <br>
fun to find -- some of the clues were nicely just slightly ambiguous <br>
and made me stop & think again in my thinking.  The statue of Whoofle <br>
the Dragon was great, even tho the dragon stamp was the one I didn't <br>
snag.  It was worth the search just to see Whoofie.<br>
<br>
The 5 boxes I did find were in good order.<br>
<br>
3.  Duck's Misery, placed just north of Freeport by River Rat.<br>
Given that it was a nice overcast, cool day, I was surprised at the <br>
lack of traffic on the Jane Addams Trail.  Sure wasn't like the IL <br>
Prairie Path or the Great Western Trail.  But all the better to hide <br>
what I was about.  <br>
<br>
Nice walking trail, and a totally straight trail was kind of nice <br>
after all the twists and curves of going around Krape Park.  The <br>
butterflies were having a convention on the trail on Saturday.  <br>
<br>
The box is doing well.<br>
<br>
4.  Butterflies on the Battlefield, placed outside Lena/Kent by Hiker <br>
Babe.<br>
<br>
The box is doing well.  But the poor American Flag isn't.  That's the <br>
sorriest flag I've seen in a loooong time -- I would think Stephenson <br>
County would be able to dig up at least enough cash to come up with a <br>
new flag for the Blackhawk Monument.   That's the most tattered flag <br>
I think I've ever seen.  It didn't look like even half of it was left <br>
flying.  <br>
<br>
5.  Artesian Well, placed in Winslow by River Rat.<br>
<br>
Had a blast going after this box.  I couldn't follow the clue <br>
directions to drive to the box because the Winslow River Days Parade <br>
was just set to begin as I arrived at Hubbard Street.  Oops.  <br>
<br>
So my backpack, my water bottle and I sat down with a very nice <br>
family on their parkway to watch the parade.  The people of Winslow <br>
seem extremely nice. Saw some nice antique tractors and one huge <br>
honkin' new tractor that looked like it cost more than my house.  <br>
Maybe even more than a couple of houses.  And hoofin' it in the <br>
parade was a 25 year old mare named Misty.  She was doin' pretty darn <br>
good for an old gal.  Band was pretty good too.  <br>
<br>
Then I walked in to snag the box rather than head all the way back to <br>
my car and drive.  A lot of folks sure seem to like the water from <br>
the artesian well -- lot of folks filling containers.  Unlike the <br>
water from DuPage County's only artesian well, the water from the <br>
Winslow well is supposed to be perfectly safe.  Or so the information <br>
at the well says.<br>
<br>
The box was in good order.<br>
<br>
6.  Where the Buffalo Roam, placed on the Jane Addams Trail near <br>
Cedarville, by River Rat.<br>
<br>
Was hoping to get a good view of the bison but unfortunately, they <br>
were dots on the horizon.  They were all the way on the other side of <br>
a huge pasture from me.  But I did get to get upclose and personal <br>
with two eensy teensy 15 week old mini-Dachshund puppies for about a <br>
half hour or so.  Their humans live in a home that borders the <br>
trail.  Cutecutecutecutecuuuuute puppies. This stretch of the Jane <br>
Addams Trail, like the stretch earlier in the day, had almost nobody <br>
on it, when it was such a beautiful Saturday for a walk.  I couldn't <br>
believe my luck.  No secrecy at all needed for that box.<br>
<br>
Had a nice walk to the box -- another butterfly convention -- and the <br>
box was in good shape.<br>

nice to hear of your adventures.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the great report of letterboxing in Stephenson County.  We had a great time last month hunting for and finding most of the boxes there.  We still need to get back to finish the Krape Park series and find "Duck Misery".  <br>
<br>
The buffalo were not real close to the fence but we did get a nice view of them.  But best of all, while we were at "Butterflies on the Battlefield" Hiker Babe herself (the box owner) showed up!  Our first Encounter on the trail with another letterboxer!  A very enjoyable day all in all.<br>
