<br>
I was out at the park today hiding more boxes and it was absolutely<br>
beautiful!  The lilacs and wildflowers are starting to bloom and<br>
everything is finally starting to look green.  If you like<br>
bird-watching, you should definitely bring your gear.  Birds were<br>
constantly flitting across my path and occasionally stopping long<br>
enough for me to get a good look at them.  A pheasant even ran across<br>
the trail!<br>
<br>
Everything should be set up at the Visitors Center by 9:30 and we have<br>
the center until 5:30.  There's a horseshoe pit near the Visitors<br>
Center, so if you have a set of horseshoes, feel free to bring them.  <br>
<br>
Lunch is potluck and burgers, brats and chicken will be provided<br>
grilled. I'm not sure how many of those attending are vegetarian, so<br>
if you would like a non-meat option, please bring it and we'll be<br>
happy to grill it for you.  If there is a side dish or desert that you<br>
would like to bring, please let me know.<br>
<br>
And I hope that you guys bring your adventurous appetites for one of<br>
the stamps at the gathering! Mwhaaaa...<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing everyone in a week!  <br>
