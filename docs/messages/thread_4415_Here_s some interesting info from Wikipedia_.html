person who posts outrageous message to bait people to answer. Forum <br>
Troll delights in sowing discord on the forums.  A troll is someone <br>
who inspires flaming rhetoric, someone who is purposely provoking and <br>
pulling people into flaming discussion. <br>
<br>
Trolls are utterly impervious to criticism (constructive or <br>
otherwise). You cannot negotiate with them; you cannot cause them to <br>
feel shame or compassion; you cannot reason with them. They cannot be <br>
made to feel remorse. For some reason, trolls do not feel they are <br>
bound by the rules of courtesy or social responsibility.<br>
<br>
The only way to deal with trolls is to limit your reaction and not to <br>
respond to trolling messages. <br>
