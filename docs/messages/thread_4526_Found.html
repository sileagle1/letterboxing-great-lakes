   We put over 200 miles on yesterday.... Well, actually I was heading in that general direction anyways, But Found:  "Silver Skull" (hand carved), in Ithaca, MI. (Logbook is falling apart!!), FOUND: "Grandpa's Visit" (store bought), in Alma, MI. Box in very good order, but did require some sleuthing to find as it was not really where clues indicate, but very close by. Both in very nice locations, and a beautiful day for letterboxing.. What Colors!!!<br/>
  Thats all,<br/>
