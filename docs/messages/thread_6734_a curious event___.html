actually only done so twice.  One time it turned out some boxers were close<br/>
behind us, so they tucked them into the next box at the park and when they<br/>
met us on the trail going back to pick them up, they told us where we could<br/>
retrieve them.  The other time was at a pretty remote spot and we didn't<br/>
notice we lost them for quite a while.  All we could hope was that wind &amp;<br/>
rain would carry/wash them away before prying eyes found them.  Oh -  and<br/>
one other time a strong wind WHISKED a whole set of clues from a picnic<br/>
table and we immediately went chasing after them, but they quickly landed in<br/>
a creek and the current swept them away.<br/>

But no, it wasn't us in Michigan this weekend...<br/>

Artistamp and I were walking along the Lake Michigan shoreline, returning to<br/>
the car after an enjoyable late afternoon/evening on the beach At Van Buren<br/>
State Park near South Haven, Michigan. She was picking up trash as she often<br/>
does for disposal away from the beach.<br/>
Imagine my surprise when I saw her pick up an 8  x 11 sheet of paper -- I<br/>
said that it looked like a letterbox clue and sure enough, we saw it had the<br/>
LbNA header.<br/>
To my greater amazement, it was for one of my nearby boxes: "I Spy".<br/>
<br/>
Since the paper had not been on the beach a few hours earlier when we'd<br/>
walked that way, I was left wondering if some searcher had walked past me on<br/>
his/her way to find the box. Since I wasn't ready for a trip up the dune to<br/>
see if there had seen a recent find, it will remain a mystery.<br/>
