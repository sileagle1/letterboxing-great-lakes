My wife and I did some letterboxing today (actually we only found one box<br/>
and the other one I believe to be gone.) I can't believe how much fun we had<br/>
running all over southern Wisconsin!! The box we found was The Great<br/>
American Pin-up Series-Mimi. I can't believe how detailed some of these<br/>
stamps are.... We have found a couple of others in this series and really<br/>
enjoyed them all. I can see why letterboxers get excited about their hobby.<br/>
