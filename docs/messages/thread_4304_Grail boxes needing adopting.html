What's involved in adopting a box.  We are close to both the Holy <br>
Hand Grenade and "Run Away!" and, depending on what's required, would <br>
gladly adopt one or both of those boxes.<br>

Thanks for letting us adopt the Clinton Grail box. My kids are very excited  <br>
that we finally have our "own"!! <br>
I was just wondering what I need to do to take it over as far as posting  <br>
online. I'm assuming my email is the one that should be under "contact the  <br>
placer" for questions/comments. <br>
Thanks for your help.<br>

Thanks for the reply.  We'd love to adopt both the Holy Hand Grenade <br>
of Antioch and "Run Away!" boxes.  Having recently found both, we <br>
know that they were both intact as of about 15 days ago.  We don't <br>
have any boxes out there that we've placed ourselves, so if you could <br>
add a line to the bottom of each page of clues on the MPHG site <br>
indicating that questions and reports can be directed to us at <br>
placedenfert1@yahoo.com, that would be terrific.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
