Check out my photos.  Never too young to start boxing.  The best <br>
place to learn is in the back yard!  My Grand children want to Box <br>
daily!   They love the hunt...they also love the little prizes I put <br>
in the boxes.  They have their own log books and stamps...The best <br>
part for children is learning to follow directions.  Such fun!<br>

I don't have little ones of my own yet, so I've been letting my <br>
elementary students box instead...they really love it! I go to 4 <br>
different schools and I hide my personal traveler each place I go. <br>
They actually come in during recess to find them, even after school!<br>
<br>
This week, I'm placing a real box in their honor called "Keeping Up <br>
The PACE" (PACE is our school district's gifted program). They wanted <br>
to make their own boxing group (even made their own symbol, a racing <br>
letter "p" with a little brain in the middle), so when they find next <br>
week's traveler location, they'll get the clues to this new box.<br>
Inside, I've left a bunch of the stamps I created with their symbol <br>
on them, so they'll finally be official.<br>
<br>
Planning for kids make just about EVERY hobby just that much more <br>
fun! ;-)<br>

Oh man, Melinda ... your message sent one of those rapid-response <br>
things through the creative side of my brain and I almost snorted my <br>
soda through my nose because I was laughing so hard.<br>
<br>
Here's what happened:<br>
<br>
I read 'whoever found them got to have one' and instantly <br>
thought "what a great idea for a box series -- the bad granny!" <br>
<br>
Then in nano-seconds followed a series of box ideas:<br>
granny's misplaced smokes<br>
how did granny's stocking get HERE?! <br>
granny's empty alcohol bottle<br>
granny's rapper-boom box<br>
<br>
(remember this is all happening in nano-seconds and I'm drinking <br>
soda while at the computer)<br>
<br>
when my mind got to granny's 'adult' toy box ... <br>
well, that's when I almost lost my soda. <br>
<br>
I think I've been indoors too long. <br>
<br>
The wind and waves are decreasing on the Lake so Bindle Bum and I <br>
are going to ignore the the small craft advisory and go sailing. <br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

aka Bindle Babe <br>
who just KNOWS she won't be able to stop thinking about this <br>
fictitional bad granny series.<br>

Believe it or not, we did a letterbox very similar to what you just <br>
mentioned, Linda!  The clues were a story about a grandma looking for <br>
a letterbox only to lose her dentures.  We made a stamp of some false <br>
teeth, and put it in a plastic hospital container that <br>
said "Dentures" on it.  (Before anyone gets grossed out, we bought <br>
the container at American Science and Surplus!)<br>
<br>
Here's the kicker: We named the box "Lost and Found".  Weird, huh?<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the box went missing within a month of placing.  I <br>
believe only Dragon and Acorn had the pleasure of finding an old <br>
lady's lost dentures out on the trail.<br>

Thank you for making me laugh, too!  I would go looking for the Bad Granny!  How 'bout <br>
Bad Granny Baker?  Her grandkids ... Hansl and Gretl?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Melinda, This is way too weird!  Don't you just love it?  The replies from the pics of my grandkids really has me thinking of potential granny series.  It sounds like you beat me to it.  But I still have a lot of ideas and since yours went missing maybe it is time for a new granny box.  Who knows?  I think Team Taco is in my area....E me off list if you would like and if we are nearby we might be able to get together for an exchange.  My friend The Mox is boxing as I type....She went to some place in Wayne...(I think)...Keep in touch.  Linda<br>
