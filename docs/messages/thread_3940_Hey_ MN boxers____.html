We'll probably be in MN JUL 7-8, and would love to meet for an exchange if you have time available.  We'll know more about our schedule when it gets closer to July.<br/>

P.S.  I haven't seen any MN map yet, but think it would be a great idea to create one.  The visual encourages many boxers to help "fill in the blanks"!<br/>
