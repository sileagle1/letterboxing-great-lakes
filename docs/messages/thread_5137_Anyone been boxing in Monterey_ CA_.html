Saturday. I am so glad the weather held up for you and it looks like <br>
you all had a wonderful time. I am sorry to have missed this gathering <br>
as I couldn't make it to the Big one in MN and I always enjoy the great <br>
letterboxes, and food and conversations. I took some kids from our <br>
church youth group camping this weekend at Lowden State Park and we had <br>
a great time but I missed all of you.<br>
I have a question for you all...My son is getting married this coming <br>
weekend in Monterey CA.  My husband and I will be staying in the area <br>
to vacation for a week after the wedding and I have been looking at <br>
clues for boxes in the area. I am wondering if anyone knows of some <br>
boxes that I just should not miss while I am there.  I will probably go <br>
to the big board to ask...but you are a much friendlier group!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, yes, there are a couple.  I've been to Monterey several <br>
times for conferences, and it's a gorgeous place to letterbox.  The <br>
biggest problem I had was that I didn't have a car while I was there.<br>
<br>
I'm at work right now, but I'll get back to you (soon) about the <br>
boxes I've been able to find.<br>
