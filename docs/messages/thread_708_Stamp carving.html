                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, summer is definately over now and the chilly breeze blowing down here today says that fall is here and winter is not far away.  I had my first cup of hot coacoa this morning (I start every day with a cup of coacoa but only when it's cold out) and although I may still carve the stamp I wanted to carve today, I doubt I'll do it outside like I had planned.  I know we already have a topic of the week, but my brain just spit this out and won't leave me alone until I post it.<br>
<br>
That got me to wondering, when and where do you like to carve and why?  <br>
<br>
I prefer carving outside on warm days.  Sunny fall or spring days in the upper 70s are actually ideal, but hot summer days work ok too since we have a nice big tree out back to sit under.  I live in a small, carpeted appartment, so carving outside means less mess for me to clean up.  It also means better lighting to carve by.  When I just *need* to carve and it's too dark or cold or wet outside, I cover my couch with a sheet and carve there.  I still get some natural light (unless it's night) and the sheet catches the shavings and makes clean-up easier.  <br>
