While Bindle Bum and I are being land-dwellers this winter, we've <br/>
placed a letterbox that will stay in the same location, but have the <br/>
stamp change on a fairly frequent basis. Once we move back aboard <br/>
our sailboat in the Spring, the box will no longer be available.<br/>
<br/>
The first stamp was placed for the Sweetest Day Mini-Meet and has <br/>
just been changed to the second stamp in this ever-changing rotation.<br/>
<br/>
Clues are WOM only. (Word of Mouth) You can email me for them or ask <br/>
another member who attended the Mini Meet.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very easy find, winter hardy as well as stroller and <br/>
handicap accessible. <br/>
<br/>
Currently (10/28): box image consists of a Halloween theme<br/>
Next: Wedding theme in honor of my daughter (Enders Angel) who is <br/>
getting married in just about 2 weeks!<br/>
Then: Thanksgiving theme<br/>
Then: Hanukah them<br/>
Then: Christmas theme<br/>
Then: New Years theme<br/>
Then: Some kind of a Winter theme<br/>
Then: Valentine's theme<br/>
Then: St. Patrick's Day them<br/>
Then: Some kind of a Spring theme<br/>
Final stamp: so long, thanks for the memories<br/>
<br/>
I hope to place all of these boxes in permanent locations after <br/>
their time in the newspaper tube. (Which might take all summer! LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
