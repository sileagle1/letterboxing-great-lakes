(see msg. #5399 and 5409 for details), please let me know by Wednesday <br>
as we will be trying to narrow down a theme later this week.  We <br>
currently have carvers from MI, IL and WI.  It would really be nice to <br>
have all of the GL region states represented.<br>
<br>
For those who have already agreed to participate, I have posted a list <br>
of possible themes (thanks for suggestions) in the FILES > GROUP <br>
PROJECTS > GL TRAVELING EVENT SHOWCASE folder.  If you have any other <br>
suggestions, please let me know as soon as possible and I will add <br>
them to the list.<br>
<br>
I will be sending out an e-mail to all participants later this week <br>
regarding choosing a theme.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions that the above referenced messages do not <br>
answer, please feel free to e-mail me.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
