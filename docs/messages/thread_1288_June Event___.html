checking my own nose for gray hairs)<br>
<br>
Where do I go for the scoop on this event?<br>
<br>
Has anyone ever considered having a carving party?  Sure we may see the <br>
images ahead of time, but we won't know where we'll find 'em!  It might be good for <br>
those who are still uncomfortable carving to get some tips.  I think we have <br>
beaten the "I don't want to find a sticker or previously stamped image to <br>
death"<br>
<br>
 We would definitely have to make the rule that there would be absolutely no <br>
exchanges with these newly carved gems; just our name stamps.<br>
<br>
If you stamp it, they will come. <br>
 If you leave a sticker, you'll bum out their little ticker!<br>
