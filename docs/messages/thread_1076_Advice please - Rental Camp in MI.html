I don't know if you've found something that meets your needs, but if <br>
coming over to the Lake Michigan shore isn't too far for you, <br>
Muskegon State Park has a couple of mini cabins available for rent <br>
at the campground there beginning April 15.  More info on these and <br>
other MI State Parks with mini cabins here:<br>

p.s. There are LOTS of boxes in this area<br>
