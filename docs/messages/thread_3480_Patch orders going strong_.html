in the mail tomorrow, a total of 107 will have been distributed.  <br/>
That's a bunch for the first 9 days!  I appreciate the little notes <br/>
many of you have included.<br/>
<br/>
I have 67 additional patches reserved based on preliminary responses <br/>
and will hold these until January 15. The original list can be found <br/>
in the Files section of the message board, <br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/files/<br/>
<br/>
in a file called patchorders.pdf <br/>
<br/>
After the holidays I'll post an updated list of pending orders.  Any <br/>
patches not purchased by JAN 15 will be added to the available <br/>
patches to satisfy new requests.<br/>
<br/>
We'll probably be out of town a few days between Christmas and New <br/>
Years, so the turnaround time on getting the patches back out to you <br/>
may be a bit delayed.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all have a safe &amp; happy holiday weekend!<br/>
