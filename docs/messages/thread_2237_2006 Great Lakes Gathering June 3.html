<br>
I thought I'd post an update since I received the first box for the <br>
gathering today (a great stamp from Beetle) AND I received our first <br>
RSVP from a boxer in another region (Sewsowbizzy from Virginia)!<br>
<br>
For those who have graciously offered to carve a stamp for the <br>
gathering:  Any local boxers are encouraged to hide their gathering <br>
boxes themselves and email me clues.  Those who will be sending me <br>
boxes to plant for them can send them anytime (the sooner the better, <br>
but May 10 at the latest).  Just send me an email to get my mailing <br>
address.<br>
<br>
We currently have 64 people planning to come, and at least 35 boxes <br>
planned for the event.  If you don't see your name on the website:<br>
<br>
http://2006greatlakesgathering.homestead.com/attendees.html<br>
<br>
and you are planning to come, also send me an email and I'll add you <br>
to the list.  If you have any kids coming, it would be great if you <br>
could also let me know the age(s) and if they are a boy or girl.<br>
<br>
Happy carving!<br>
<br>
