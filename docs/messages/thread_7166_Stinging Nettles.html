Wild Nettle and Pecorino Pizza From Pizzaiolo: Oakland, California<br/>
Five years ago, Chez Panisse veteran Charlie Hallowell stripped a<br/>
hardware store down to its bare brick walls, installed a wood-fired oven<br/>
and started producing spectacular seasonal pies. For this winner, he<br/>
starts with mozzarella and pecorino and adds shaved red onions and<br/>
fistfuls of stinging nettles, a spiky-leafed herb. Cooking neutralizes<br/>
the nettles' sting and wilts them into a tangle of flavorful greens.<br/>
$17; 5008 Telegraph Ave.;<br/>

I'm not sure I could trust that those nasty things could be<br/>
"neutralized" into something tasty...<br/>
