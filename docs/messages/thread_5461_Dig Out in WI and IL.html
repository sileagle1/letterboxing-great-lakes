We can handle snow, but at this moment in the south suburbs of Chicago we just finished <br/>
watching (and listening) to a thunder and lightening storm that has left a half inch of ice on <br/>
EVERYTHING!  We had to take down the bird feeders as the ice was weighing down the line <br/>
that was holding it and threatening to break.  As a result we have a very confused and upset <br/>
cardinal chirping his curses at us!  Likewise, we are chirping the same profanity because we <br/>
had to cancel our trip to Indianapolis!<br/>
Be safe everyone!<br/>

The icy rain started hitting our windows around midnight last night.  <br/>
Then the snow started.  We got the call at 6am that my son's school was <br/>
cancelled today.  Which means those secret Santa gifts and teacher's <br/>
gift and class and basketball parties will be waiting for a few weeks.  <br/>
This is the one day in his life that my son did NOT want a snow day.  <br/>
Now he gets to enjoy it by shoveling and helping with chores!<br/>
