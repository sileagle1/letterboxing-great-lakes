Campfires and s'mores and letterboxes and now....hiking stick medalliions.  OOOO.....I feel so terrible about not being able to attend the 'Green' Gathering.  I'm working this weekend.  Gotta make some money.  But here's hoping that all my letterboxing friends have a great time.  I'll be thinking about all of you.  <br/>

I feel quite "blue" that we will be missing the "green" gathering--hope you have beautiful weather for the event.  Too many things going on this weekend.  Plus, there is no way my dd would head out into thorny bushes, poison ivy, and esp mosquitoes (for which she is a magnet) a few days before prom.  Have a great gathering!!!<br/>
