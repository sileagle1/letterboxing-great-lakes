                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past week I got over to Grand Haven to check on my boxes in that <br/>
area.  Since I've received various questions, comments and reports, I <br/>
thought I'd give the update all in one shot here:<br/>
<br/>
Words in the Woods -- After 3 1/2 years, this series of boxes has been <br/>
retired.  Three of them were missing and they were not seeing much <br/>
traffic any more.  Even though these clues are fun and some of my <br/>
favorites, the stamps were not hand-carved (very early plants) and <br/>
would have to be repurchased.  So I just decided to retire the entire <br/>
series.<br/>
<br/>
Chinook Pier -- I am sad to report that after nearly 4 years, this box <br/>
was found to be missing.  This was one of my earliest plants and my <br/>
first carved stamp (well actually the second as the first was the <br/>
backward text version).  After a proper mourning period, I recarved a <br/>
new stamp and have replaced the box in a slightly different place.  <br/>
Clue modifications have been made.<br/>
<br/>
Mulligan's Hollow -- All boxes are alive and well although a few clues <br/>
revisions were necessary due to terrain changes, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan Woods -- These 6 boxes bring me more *box is missing* reports <br/>
than all of my other boxes combined.  I walked the clues, carefully <br/>
questioning if things were ambiguous, etc. and with the exception of <br/>
two boxes, I don't know how they can be any clearer short of giving 1-<br/>
2-3 directions.  One box (Tic-Tac-Toe)is just in a tough spot and <br/>
there is not much that can be done about it.  Another box (Somewhere <br/>
in the Middle) has had a key landmark removed so it is understandable <br/>
why this would cause problems.  Frankly I am surprised that anyone has <br/>
found that box since that time, but there were several teams that <br/>
managed to find their way there anyway, although most noted the <br/>
difficulty in the logbook.  Despite all of the *box is missing* <br/>
reports, only one box in the series was actually missing (Mirror, <br/>
Mirror) and has now been replaced.  Clue revisions have also been made <br/>
to account for the missing landmark on Somewhere in the Middle.<br/>
<br/>
Grand Haven Pier Light -- The second plant of this box has been <br/>
missing for quite some time now (seems these MI lighthouse stamps are <br/>
collector's items or something because proportionately these boxes go <br/>
missing more than all my other boxes).  I scouted out a new location <br/>
and should get around to planting yet another replacement within a <br/>
couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
The rain looks like it is clearing up, so I may get over to find a new <br/>
home for the Fish Out of Water 7 box yet this afternoon now that it is <br/>
back from a short visit to FungusWoman.<br/>
<br/>
There is something very cleansing about doing box maintenance ;-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry...  it is a great park, one of my favorites in this area.  I have an idea for a possible series of boxes to place there, but am still in the contemplation stages.  The trouble with this park is that they require one to stay on trail, and it is very difficult to hide a box within reach of the trail that is not going to be found by dogs and passers-by.  But it is such a wonderful park, I will find a way to hide at least a couple there.<br/>
