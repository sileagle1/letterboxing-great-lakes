<br/>
You all seem to be so helpful and friendly to eachother, I decided to <br/>
try to ask for advice for my sons birthday.<br/>
He loves letterboxing, he is 13.  He is only bringing 1 friend, and the <br/>
rest are adults to his party at the West Lake Animal Preserve.  He <br/>
doesn't like rowdy parties and suggested to me that we all go there.  <br/>
None of the famly has been there before, so I would like to make it <br/>
enjoyable not frustrating.<br/>
He wants me to do a letterbox for him.  This will be something that is <br/>
placed only for the day.  There is already a letterbox there that we <br/>
tried and got really close, but couldn't find, so I thought maybe I <br/>
could use some of the directions of that one for his new one. Perhaps <br/>
center the letterbox around his age, birthdate, stuff about him.  I <br/>
find its harder than I thought.<br/>
I'd also like to know what would be a good way to do this?  As one <br/>
group or in pairs?  Do I hide more than one LB close together?  One for <br/>
everyone to find?  Instead of a letterbox, should I make a small <br/>
treasure chest?  I'd like some of it to be a surprise so I don't want <br/>
to ask him what he wants.<br/>
Thanks , Sherry<br/>
Any suggestions would be helpful, thank you.<br/>
