The 2005 Gathering at Hudson Mills Metro Park was a great time. Met lots of<br>
nice people plus reconnected with some familiar faces once again. We also<br>
did some boxing in Michigan and can file the following report.<br>

comments on some of our searches:<br>
<br>
Frog Preserves - great hike and interesting to know we were on part of the<br>
North Country National Scenic Trail.<br>
<br>
Go Blue! - loved the eclectic sculptures on this impressive campus.  My<br>
favorite was the "Wave Field".<br>
<br>
Mystery Cabin - Arboretum very pleasant walk.<br>
<br>
Breakfast Elves - nice hike and great stamps.<br>
<br>
Beach View By The Dunes - a very hot hike!  Even though we didn't find the<br>
box, those dunes are simply amazing!!<br>
<br>
Up, Up & Away! - a bit tricky since paths are VERY overgrown.  We had fun<br>
coloring this stamp and it turned out great.<br>
<br>
Home in the Pines - started off on the wrong footpath immediately.  Wandered<br>
about for a while and then lucked into some signs that got us back on the<br>
right path.  Another hot hike.<br>
<br>
Northeast Ann Arbor - saw a muskrat in the pond!<br>
<br>
Walking Tree - ended up explored more of the trail while searching.  Looks<br>
like a new bridge is being installed.  Logbook contained an entry from some<br>
researchers studying the beech trees.<br>
<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to more Michigan boxing next weekend when we'll be in<br>
the U.P.!<br>
