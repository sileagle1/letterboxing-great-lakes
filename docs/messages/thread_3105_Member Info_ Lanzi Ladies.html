                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
My daughters (Gabriella & Sophie) and I (Michelle) are part of <br>
the "letterbox newbies."  Like several others, I read about <br>
letterboxing in the August edition of Family Fun Magazine and we set <br>
off that evening to find our first letterbox - "Chickadee Heaven" in <br>
Kensington Park.  We had to go back the next day armed with a stamp <br>
pad, stamp and logbook so we could officially log in and then we were <br>
off!  Since that night, we have found about 25 boxes and recently <br>
scoped out our first hiding spot.<br>
<br>
We live in Brighton, MI and have been very fortunate to have quite a <br>
few great planters (PennyPenny & Flotilla the Hun just to name a <br>
couple of our favorites) in the area to keep us busy.  (Thank you to <br>
everyone who has placed a box-- we truly appreciate it!)  My hope is <br>
to get over my fear of carving our own stamps and start placing more <br>
boxes soon.  Once I do get to carving, "Lanzi Ladies" will most <br>
likely morph into "The Drama Queens"-- it just didn't seem like the <br>
bear stamp we have been using fit the new title-- so keep an eye out <br>
for our lovely new stamp (it's bound to appear anytime now...)!  <br>
I work for a theater company by day and anyone who has raised <br>
daughters (mine are almost 11 and 5) knows that "Drama Queens" will <br>
be a perfect name for us-- I just hope we're not breaking any <br>
etiquette by changing our name midway through the game...  <br>
<br>
What I love most about letterboxing is that it is a great excuse to <br>
get my girls up off the couch and outside in the beautiful parks that <br>
are all around us.  They don't even realize that they are exercising <br>
when they are on the hunt-- it's wonderful!  We have introduced my <br>
parents (Crazy Grandma & Grandpa) to letterboxing as well which has <br>
created some wonderful days of hanging together in the woods and then <br>
finding a great restaurant to recount our journey.  My parents just <br>
returned from a week in Cape Cod where they found about 8 boxes-- <br>
most of them just steps from where we have walked in the past!  My <br>
Mom recently went through a bout with lung cancer.  This has been one <br>
of the best things for her in getting her up and out walking-- I <br>
cannot say enough about how thankful I am to have discovered this new <br>
hobby for our family!  My only wish was that my husband was more <br>
interested-- we managed to get him out once.  It was nice to hear <br>
that I am not the only one in this boat.  I think it is good for the <br>
girls to have things that they share with just me, though-- it's like <br>
our little secret world...<br>
<br>
I hope to meet some of you on the trails and at some future <br>
gatherings.  Until then, Happy Letterboxing!<br>
