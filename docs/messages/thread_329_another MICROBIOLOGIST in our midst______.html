Tally two more techies to your list, I (Lucky1) am a microbiologist<br>
and 2Lucky is a Genetic Counsellor. I think that a GC could be<br>
counted as a teacher of sorts. Pretty interesting survey!<br>
As for vacation plans... really wherever we go we bring clues. And<br>
if our destination doesn't have boxes, we bring carving tools. We<br>
have scoped out locations to place boxes in MI, IL, and WI. Clues<br>
are made and stamps are in progress. Keep your eyes peeled...<br>
