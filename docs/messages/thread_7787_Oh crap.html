Just try to write down what you remember about each box placement right now. If you don't find the notes, just post your recollections, explain what happened and then say they are a "challenge" clue and that if someone does find it, you would appreciate any info they could provide to refine the clues.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It must be a South Dakota "curse!"  We did the same thing early last June.  Planted a box in a terrific location.  Scribbled the clues on a green piece of paper.  Got home and had the green piece of paper, but when it came time to post the clue...said green paper is no where to be found.  So, our box has been clueless for over a year now.  Steve (Mr. SZSRocks) may be going out to the Black Hills the weekend of June 21st.  If he does, I will let you know and he can do some reconnaissance for you (and us!)<br>
<br>
Glad to hear you are all home now.  See you this weekend at GLG 2013!<br>

Dragon, if you want to relocate Abe -- and are willing to do so, just let me know. I also told Mr. SZSrocks that he could relocate the box, he may be heading out there the week of the 21st. So, please see who is going there first and willing to move the box.<br>

I did the best I could by memory. I think I did an ok job -- but any finders will be able to provide details I may have forgotten.<br>
