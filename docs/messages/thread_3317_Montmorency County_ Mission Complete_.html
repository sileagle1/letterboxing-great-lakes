<br>
A quick 4 hour trip Up North (lol) to place the first letterbox in Montmorency county is <br>
now complete. <br>
<br>
I found a cozy resting place for "The Owl's Nest" letterbox, and my mom was so excited to <br>
have the chance to see the whole process up close: Painting the letterbox cammo... <br>
transferring the image to the block, carving the stamp, testing and tweaking the stamp <br>
with more carving, putting all the other various parts together for the box, then sealing it <br>
up with it's "First Finder's" certificate snuggly in place and hiding it in the snow! <br>
<br>
 It was a fun opportunity to have a quiet weekend doing this hobby that I love but never <br>
have much time to devote to! (I actually had none of my 3 kids with me.... woo hoo!) <br>
Suffice it to say it was a nice break, and although so cold up there we still had a great <br>
time. Thanks to SpringChick and TrailTroll for keeping this thing rolling to get all our <br>
Michigan counties done! And a special thanks to TrailTroll who offered to take my box way <br>
up there to plant: I almost took you up on it, TT, but got lucky to have my DH off work <br>
long enough to allow me to get away for a day-and-a-half!<br>
<br>
Have a great week everyone,<br>
<br>

Great job, PennyPenny!<br>
