<br>
So, I sat meself down on this wee speckled toadstool smoking my pipe when this friendly sparrow comes by. We exchanged pleasantries, he being a fine old chap, when he proceeds to tell me of this amazing land of bounty, full of good things to eat...acorn caps, berries, ramps, all kinds of wild mushrooms, fiddlehead ferns (Oh, I so do love those tasty delights),wild may apples , minnows too numerous to count, and delectable little froggies! Mmmm....I can just taste them now, fried up in maple butter with a nice cup of hemlock ale! O heavens, this certainly can't be! He, dear friend, assures me that it is! <br>
<br>
So, I asks him of where to find this lovely glen of heaven when all of a sudden this rude little fur fur beast comes pouncing out of the bushes, dead set with a blood lust in his eyes, and snaps poor old sparrow shut in his mouth! Heavens me...I was so scared that I ran into a hole for safety, which is an incredibly foolish thing to do since we all know that snakes live there.  OH, I so hate cats. Evil creatures, they are. What, with their fangs and flesh ripping dagger like claws. Third time this week that this beastly thing has attacked. If only poor Mr. Sparrow had gotten away. <br>
<br>
Sacred...scared, I am! So, you see, I am packing up...calling it quits...moving on. Perhaps I shall find that dear little place that sparrow spoke of, the land of delightful foods and enchanted woods. That is the place for poor old Thibwhistle, it is!<br>
<br>
Poor, poor sparrow. You shall not have died in vain. I shall teach that naughty scoundrel, Mr. Kitty, to mind his manners. For, I have a plan before I depart. I shall keep you informed, for I know not where to go. Watch out Mr. Kitty.....sparrow will be avenged!<br>
