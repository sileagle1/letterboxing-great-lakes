                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've had some reports that our Lumbering Along box in Eau Claire's<br/>
Carson Park is missing or at least unable to find.  So, I asked my<br/>
sister to check on the box for us.  To our delight, this is her<br/>
report......<br/>
<br/>
"I  finally checked on the letterbox in Carson Park, the one in the tree<br/>
trunk in the main part of the park.  It is still there and fully<br/>
intact.  It was jammed up there pretty good, but it looked like maybe<br/>
even more debris had covered it.  There was lots of sawdust like from<br/>
woodpeckers or something."<br/>
<br/>
Sawdust?  Paul Bunyan?  .......I did work to hide it well in that old<br/>
stump, so was surprised it was missing, having never been found.  I was<br/>
concerned about an accidental find, and I guess I worry too much.  I<br/>
will probably add some camouflage tape to it on our next visit to Eau<br/>
Claire so it doesn't take as much effort to rehide it with layers of<br/>
bark. My biggest fear was that the bark would get dislodged in a heavy<br/>
rain.  I did think it looked pretty natural though and I guess maybe it<br/>
was too natural looking.  Anyway, It's a pretty cool stamp, so I'm glad<br/>
it isn't missing.<br/>
<br/>
Other news.......We've been back out there again after Mr.<br/>
Puddlejumper's encounter with Poison Ivy 6 weeks ago now.  It's been a<br/>
long 6 weeks for him and the itch still isn't completely gone, but the<br/>
cooler weather this weekend pulled us back out on the trail again.<br/>
Though I confessed to Jessi, Matt and Nick after finding their Ice Age<br/>
Trail box a few weeks ago that it has been a test of our nerves.  Not<br/>
feeling like we knew how to identify PI and knowing there are lots of 3<br/>
leafed plants out there, it just seemed like it was more frustrating<br/>
then fun.  The kids tend to wonder off the trail here and there or<br/>
carelessly brush against trail overgrowth and then there is the dog!<br/>
<br/>
I told Jessi, Matt and Nick that their "Messy Trails" Hybrid Cache just<br/>
sounded like more than we could handle right now.  They reassured me<br/>
that the trails were not overgrown, but that the trail system was<br/>
"messy" with lots of "Ts" and "crossroads".  So with all the new "quick"<br/>
boxes planted in Madison, we got out Sat. to get the second box of the<br/>
Duck Pond Series, Peas in a Pod, Lions and finally Messy Trails.  I<br/>
forgot about the Sunset on Soul box until we were home and Quest for Big<br/>
Tooth will wait until another evening or afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
With our appetite for letterboxing whetted again on Sat. we joined up<br/>
with KDKadiddlehopper and headed out yesterday to get  Famous Faces From<br/>
Wisconsin Series: Just a Good Ol, Mounds of the Midwest Series: The<br/>
Bend, and I-94 Traffic Crawl: Rocky Arbor.  All I can say is that Mr.<br/>
Puddlejumper is much more trusting of the kids on the high altitudes and<br/>
steep drop-offs than I am!  All I could think of was the thread titled<br/>
"First Letterboxing Death...." on LBNA!  We did survive, but Mr.<br/>
Puddlejumper got an earful from me.  We loved the stamps, loved the<br/>
views and at Rocky Arbor, loved all the Pines. We didn't preread the<br/>
clues for Rocky Arbor before leaving home, so didn't have the benefit of<br/>
looking at the photo link to the rock we were to look for.  There really<br/>
were lots of interesting rocks and log piles, but as always, the clues<br/>
always make sense when you do find the right spot.<br/>
<br/>
We did have a breakthrough though!  Leapin' Lizards reported some poison<br/>
ivy in the area of their Mounds of the Midwest Series, The Bend box, so<br/>
we spent some extra time to locate and identify it.  We are pretty sure<br/>
we found it!  Hopefully we didn't get into it, but we think we can<br/>
identify it better now.  Looking at pictures of it just wasn't helping<br/>
me any.  I needed to see some in real life and now that we have I feel<br/>
better informed.<br/>
<br/>
In all, a great letterboxing weekend!<br/>
