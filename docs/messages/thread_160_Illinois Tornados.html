thought I would give everyone the heads up just in case anyone is <br/>
headed out to look for some Illinois letterboxes. They had a thing on <br/>
the news about Utica, and it looked really bad. So yeah, check out <br/>
the area before setting out this week. Look online for some local <br/>
newspapers or park websites to get the latest updates.<br/>

(Considering how much in the open the St. Louis Canyon box is, it <br/>
