Look at the last sentence in this clue!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
New letterbox: Autsidy<br/>
Glenbulah, Washington, WI<br/>
Placed by: Lover of Autumn<br/>
Clues:<br/>
1st box..... Go to the hippo park. Stand next to it and face the road that<br/>
leads right to it. There should be some porta-potties on the left<br/>
side.Follow that road untill the main park is in sight. You should still be<br/>
on the left of the fence with the old fashion wagon. Follow the road untill<br/>
you are on the left of the mini golf course. Then enter the mini golf course<br/>
and head toward the tree in the back left corner or the tree that is there.<br/>
The box shall be under some leaves or in the tall grass or in the tree it<br/>
may be moved due to other people. <br/>
<br/>
2nd box....So you are in the mini golf course..GET OUT.. and face the main<br/>
office building. Go through the buliding toward the pools but go to the<br/>
right of it were there should be some shuffle boards. Go in the path in<br/>
between them. Then follow the path out toward the porta potty. there is a<br/>
road that will bring you to an outdoor movie theater... dont enter it but<br/>
keep going straight on the right and there is a small petting zoo thing.<br/>
face the front of the fence and walk to the back left corner of it. There in<br/>
the corner behind the petting zoo is a wooden fence. go to the left corner<br/>
of it and there will be the 2nd letter box. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortaunlty there is no stamp, its just for fun! But there is a notebook.<br/>
Have fun and good luck on your journey!!!<br/>
