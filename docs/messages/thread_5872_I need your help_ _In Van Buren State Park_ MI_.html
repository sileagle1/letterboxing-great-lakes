                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Friends!! I was recently out letterboxing at Van Buren State Park,<br/>
along lake Michigan in downstate MI... azobox has got a couple of great,<br/>
really fun stamps out there!<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, i'm back in Milwaukee, WI, and I was getting ready to do more<br/>
letterboxing when i realized- I'M MISSING MY STAMP AND MY OLD FULL LOGBOOK!<br/>
*cries* I've looked everywhere for them and they are nowhere to be found!<br/>
That book means a lot to me... i just got back from travelling cross country<br/>
since January and i have stamps from nearly every state i went through! I<br/>
live more than 4 hours from VanBuren park, and I am literally out of money.<br/>
I have like $10 to my name, which means that driving out there to look for<br/>
it is not really an option for me right now. So I'm wondering if there is<br/>
any POSSIBLE way, out of the kindness of your fellow letter-boxing hearts<br/>
that you could make your way out there to see if i left it by azobox's<br/>
"Whose shoes?" box? I asked azobox directly, but unfortunately (s)he is not<br/>
in Michigan right now and can't help me!<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way you could look for it for me? I know that's asking a lot,<br/>
but it would mean the world to me! :( I'd gladly send you like $20 for the<br/>
effort as soon as i get paid for starting work again... in about 2 weeks. i<br/>
know that's not much... but it's the best i can do<br/>
<br/>
The logbook is purple and rather small, not much bigger than a deck of<br/>
cards, and the stamp is about half the size of those pink rubber make-ur-own<br/>
stamp sheets. I kept them together in a small black polyester bag with two<br/>
drawstrings. If i left it out there by the log under which whose shoes is<br/>
hid, it should be pretty easy to find. my friend and i sat on the log close<br/>
to the maple tree sapling when we stamped up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know ASAP if you might be able to help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>

I'm on the other side of the state, but I'm sure hoping that in the next couple of days I'm reading a post telling all about someone finding your stamp and log books.  YIKES!<br/>

&gt; Hello Friends!! I was recently out letterboxing at Van Buren State Park,<br/>
&gt; along lake Michigan in downstate MI... azobox has got a couple of great,<br/>
&gt; really fun stamps out there!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At any rate, i'm back in Milwaukee, WI, and I was getting ready to do more<br/>
&gt; letterboxing when i realized- I'M MISSING MY STAMP AND MY OLD FULL LOGBOOK!<br/>
&gt; *cries* I've looked everywhere for them and they are nowhere to be found!<br/>
&gt; That book means a lot to me... i just got back from travelling cross country<br/>
&gt; since January and i have stamps from nearly every state i went through! I<br/>
&gt; live more than 4 hours from VanBuren park, and I am literally out of money.<br/>
&gt; I have like $10 to my name, which means that driving out there to look for<br/>
&gt; it is not really an option for me right now. So I'm wondering if there is<br/>
&gt; any POSSIBLE way, out of the kindness of your fellow letter-boxing hearts<br/>
&gt; that you could make your way out there to see if i left it by azobox's<br/>
&gt; "Whose shoes?" box? I asked azobox directly, but unfortunately (s)he is not<br/>
&gt; in Michigan right now and can't help me!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there any way you could look for it for me? I know that's asking a lot,<br/>
&gt; but it would mean the world to me! :( I'd gladly send you like $20 for the<br/>
&gt; effort as soon as i get paid for starting work again... in about 2 weeks. i<br/>
&gt; know that's not much... but it's the best i can do<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The logbook is purple and rather small, not much bigger than a deck of<br/>
&gt; cards, and the stamp is about half the size of those pink rubber make-ur-own<br/>
&gt; stamp sheets. I kept them together in a small black polyester bag with two<br/>
&gt; drawstrings. If i left it out there by the log under which whose shoes is<br/>
&gt; hid, it should be pretty easy to find. my friend and i sat on the log close<br/>
&gt; to the maple tree sapling when we stamped up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please let me know ASAP if you might be able to help?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks so much,<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Have no fear dear Trailtracker...if anyone can turn this most unfortunate loss into a success it will be the the caped crusading duo of Grandvilla and her eagle-eyed sidekick -  the one and only - Mobiusklein!<br/>
