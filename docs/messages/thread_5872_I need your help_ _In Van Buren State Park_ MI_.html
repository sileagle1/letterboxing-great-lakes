along lake Michigan in downstate MI... azobox has got a couple of great,<br>
really fun stamps out there!<br>
<br>
At any rate, i'm back in Milwaukee, WI, and I was getting ready to do more<br>
letterboxing when i realized- I'M MISSING MY STAMP AND MY OLD FULL LOGBOOK!<br>
*cries* I've looked everywhere for them and they are nowhere to be found!<br>
That book means a lot to me... i just got back from travelling cross country<br>
since January and i have stamps from nearly every state i went through! I<br>
live more than 4 hours from VanBuren park, and I am literally out of money.<br>
I have like $10 to my name, which means that driving out there to look for<br>
it is not really an option for me right now. So I'm wondering if there is<br>
any POSSIBLE way, out of the kindness of your fellow letter-boxing hearts<br>
that you could make your way out there to see if i left it by azobox's<br>
"Whose shoes?" box? I asked azobox directly, but unfortunately (s)he is not<br>
in Michigan right now and can't help me!<br>
<br>
Is there any way you could look for it for me? I know that's asking a lot,<br>
but it would mean the world to me! :( I'd gladly send you like $20 for the<br>
effort as soon as i get paid for starting work again... in about 2 weeks. i<br>
know that's not much... but it's the best i can do<br>
<br>
The logbook is purple and rather small, not much bigger than a deck of<br>
cards, and the stamp is about half the size of those pink rubber make-ur-own<br>
stamp sheets. I kept them together in a small black polyester bag with two<br>
drawstrings. If i left it out there by the log under which whose shoes is<br>
hid, it should be pretty easy to find. my friend and i sat on the log close<br>
to the maple tree sapling when we stamped up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Please let me know ASAP if you might be able to help?<br>
<br>
Thanks so much,<br>

I'm on the other side of the state, but I'm sure hoping that in the next couple of days I'm reading a post telling all about someone finding your stamp and log books.  YIKES!<br>

I lost our signature stamps in Wyoming a couple years ago on our cross  <br>
