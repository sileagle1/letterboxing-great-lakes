We had a little bit of everything for weather on Saturday. There was <br/>
fog in the early morning before our meeting but the sun peeked out a <br/>
tiny bit as we were leaving the restaurant ... then we got the rest <br/>
of it. I checked the stats at NOAA and found that the temp during <br/>
our event was in the low 40's with winds blowing from the west at a <br/>
steady 30 and gusting to 39! We had occasional sprinkles mixed with <br/>
tiny hail/sleet balls and ended with NIGHT BOXING!  <br/>
<br/>
After enjoying lunch and "Exchanges" all around, we set out for Lake <br/>
Harbor Park.  We found all of the known boxes in this park, and <br/>
picked up two HH's! <br/>
<br/>
First was the Muskegon Beach box, originally placed by Arbo and <br/>
being maintained by SpringChick. Inside we found a surprise HH "No <br/>
Skin Off My Back" (here's the link to SpringChick's Haunted HH <br/>
series ww.letterbox-mi.com/series/hhh_main.asp )<br/>
<br/>
Next was the newly placed Fish Out of Water #7, which is a joint <br/>
effort between Fungus Woman and Spring Chick.  WOW! Amazing detail <br/>
on this tiny stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Then it was on to conquer the "Sandy Seasons Series"  I say <br/>
conquer, because there is a monstrous 80 foot sand dune to climb <br/>
before you can begin this series.  Oh, but the great carvings of <br/>
these stamps is sooooo worth it!<br/>
<br/>
Before we could find the Winter box, we stumbled upon a Geocache. <br/>
Had a little teaching time as I shared what I knew about Geocaching. <br/>
(here's a couple of links if any of you are interested: their <br/>
equivalent of our `big list' is at www.geocaching.com The Michigan <br/>
site is at http://www.mi-geocaching.org/ )<br/>
<br/>
I had a large, long-life lightstick in my backpack available for <br/>
trade, but the DogLvrs kids passed on taking anything from the <br/>
cache. We all stamped in and signed the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
After finding and stamping into the Winter logbook while the sleet <br/>
was coming down in little pellets, we replaced both and hid them <br/>
well. Jokes all around about the appropriate name of the box (grin) <br/>
given the current weather.<br/>
<br/>
We found the Spring box in good condition and went looking for the <br/>
Summer box.<br/>
<br/>
Wooohie!  As if the wind blowing 30+ across the cold waters of Lake <br/>
Michigan and up the open dune wasn't terrific enough  it started to <br/>
rain then sleet again! Never fear  you can't call us `fair weather <br/>
boxers'  no sir, we are dedicated boxers!<br/>
<br/>
What an amazing location the Summer box lives in! If the quality <br/>
carvings on SpringChicks stamps aren't enough to tempt you, then the <br/>
view just before getting to this box and then the "magical" quality <br/>
of this place is worth doing the series.<br/>
<br/>
We thought the Autumn box would be our final find in this park, but <br/>
we were wrong!  Yippee  "Witch Hazel" another of the Haunted HH's.<br/>
<br/>
We made a quick stop at Burger King for "kid fuel" and took a quick <br/>
detour to the Lumbertown #1 box, which was in good shape.  Then it <br/>
was a nice drive via the scenic route along the Lakeshore to the <br/>
Duck Lake area.<br/>
<br/>
Clues were passed out for the Celestial Celtic series I placed for <br/>
the event.  DogLvrs had brought along the clues for my Life is <br/>
Good/Cooler at the Lake box, which is also nearby.<br/>
<br/>
What fun to watch someone run through your clues!  Everyone did a <br/>
great job with the two boxes at Marcus Park but this is where our <br/>
single injury occurred.  "W" of DogLvrs took a tumble from <br/>
the `bouncing log' However, true to our motto of the day, he <br/>
continued on because he is no fair weather boxer, no sir  he is "a <br/>
dedicated letterboxer"<br/>
<br/>
As we went past the Lake Michigan Beach parking area, I was in awe <br/>
of the waves.  Huge breaking rollers, cresting and tumbling before <br/>
they smashed against the beach with a deafening roar of thunder.<br/>
<br/>
We were racing against dark as we counted the squares on the paved <br/>
path toward the Celtic Sun box.  We were able to find the box <br/>
without breaking out the flashlights, but I think we needed them to <br/>
stamp into the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Geez, oh pizza  it sure can get complicated when you have 2 HH's <br/>
and 3 Teams that all have to get stamped.  Our gang came up with an <br/>
efficient `assembly line' that assured all the stamping that needed <br/>
to be done was done and that everything went back where it belonged.<br/>
<br/>
One box left to go, and this time we really were night boxing!  <br/>
Wow .. a first for me, but be careful not to trip or get a stray <br/>
branch in the face.  Our `Purple Heart boxer' was boosted up and <br/>
given the honors of bringing out the Celtic Star box.<br/>
<br/>
We were lucky and only had brief periods of light showers during the <br/>
day, but the rain did come down pretty steady for part of the trip <br/>
to Team Bindlestiffs winter digs.  <br/>
<br/>
Once we arrived, the kids were thrilled to learn there was a WOM box <br/>
waiting for them in the newspaper tube!  That brought the "F" count <br/>
for the day to and even dozen.<br/>
<br/>
While we warmed up with some hot homemade soup, the Pale Puppy Posse <br/>
told us how they had worked out cipher clues for the Midshipman's <br/>
Hitch Mystery Box in the car on the trip over to the event.  They <br/>
also noted that they observed some of the landmarks for this Mystery <br/>
Box on the way to dinner; so they were planning on getting one more <br/>
box before they headed home. <br/>
<br/>
A good time was had by all  you can check out some of the pictures <br/>
