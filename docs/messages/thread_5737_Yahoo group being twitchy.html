<br/>
I tried to open some of the files and for every one of them I got a yahoo error "The requested document is not accessible".  At first I thought it was because the files were pretty old but then I tried opening the bingo files and they didn't work either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else having this problem or is something going on? Maybe it's just my computer today.<br/>
