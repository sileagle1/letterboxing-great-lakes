                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sam Walton's kids just bought the National Park Service after a very intense<br/>
four-way battle with Bill Gates, Oprah, and The Donald.<br/>
<br/>
It's just as well.  Gates was going to give out free computers to any<br/>
under-privileged bunnies but not the squirrels, which would have ignited a<br/>
war or three, Oprah was going to force all the little creatures to join book<br/>
clubs, and The Donald, well, both the big and little creatures of the forest<br/>
*were* kind of excited at the prospect of becoming the next Apprentice.  But<br/>
imagine the boardroom fights between the bunnies and the bears.  Not a<br/>
pretty picture.  Not to mention that the boardroom might be a little too<br/>
snazzy for the unhousebroken crowd.<br/>
<br/>
Sam's kids hate letterboxing.  They still want to make a buck so they're not<br/>
going to stop selling the camo tape however. Just up the price a bit.<br/>
<br/>
They've also taken a hit because, for the camo tape, they have to buy the<br/>
"Made in America" stuff.  Too much suspicion on camo tape coming in from<br/>
other countries.<br/>
<br/>
On a serious note tho --<br/>
<br/>
I had mentioned to a friend that the local Walmart here was recently out of<br/>
the camo tape.  She brought a couple of rolls with her when she flew in for<br/>
a visit.  She also brought some of those lock 'n' locks.  She won't do that<br/>
again.  She must have looked suspicious because she was one of the ones<br/>
whose bag they chose to inspect pretty carefully.  She said that they were<br/>
asking her a lot of very serious, not-so-nice questions about what the camo<br/>
tape and boxes were for.  She's the smart-aleck type, but didn't get smart<br/>
with them thank heavens.  So her time there explaining letterboxing was a<br/>
lot shorter than it could have been.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be they wouldn't have challenged Ted Turner if he was walking on a<br/>
plane with camo tape and lock 'n' lock boxes.<br/>
