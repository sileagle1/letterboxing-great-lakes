Adopting boxes can be as formal, or informal as you want.  In the case of getting no response from the original placer, adoption most likely takes the form of checking in on the box when you're out doing maintenance, replacing bags, cammo tape, logbooks, etc.  <br>
<br>
In a formal adoption, the original placer asks another boxer to take over the duties.  This includes all of the above, but the adoptive parent might also list the clues on their website, just in case changes need to be made.<br>
<br>
Most of us engage in some form of adoption when we rebag or hide a box better than we found it.  However, in the case of this Independent Grove box, it sounds like the clues will have to stay in the care of the original placer (since there's no response), but a local boxer could take over the upkeep.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
