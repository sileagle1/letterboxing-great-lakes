MasterCarve is thick but a little softer than some other media.  I <br>
think SpringChick just did a double-sided stamp recently on PZcut.  <br>
However unless I REALLY CONCENTRATED, I'd probably cut too deep on one <br>
side and wreck the other image if I used something this thin. PZcut is <br>
my current favorite media, but I think if I was doing something double-<br>
sided I'd use MasterCarve.<br>

P.S.  It's nice to include a piece of felt with double-sided stamps so <br>
the felt can be used to cover the "top" side when pressing down.  This <br>
reduces the amount of ink you get on your hands!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did a couple of double-sided stamps for the Great Lakes Gathering <br>
using MasterCarve.  You can get it in two different thicknesses -- <br>
approx. 1/2" and approx. 3/4".  I used the 1/2" thickness because I had <br>
relatively small containers and the thicker stuff just seemed too bulky.<br>
<br>
One thing I found when doing a double-sided stamp is to do the image <br>
with the least detail first.  The reason is that while you are carving <br>
the second side, the image on the first side gets moved around on your <br>
cutting mat quite a bit and find detail areas can get damaged or work <br>
loose -- this is especially true with the MasterCarve as it is kind of <br>
supple and not real firm.<br>
<br>
Another tip for doing double-sided when they will be stamped over each <br>
other -- like if it is two parts of the same image that should be done <br>
in different colors, or two halves of a large image -- basically <br>
anything that needs to be lined up with each other, is to create a <br>
border around at least one of the images to help when lining up the <br>
second stamp.<br>

 <br>
Unfortunately, Hobbly Lobby is not carrying Mstercarve any more and I bought the last piece.  Michaels does not carry it.  I talked to the people at the Scrapbook/Stamping Store on Neil St and they are ordering it in to stock since no one else carries it, so there will be a local source for Mastercarve soon if you want that.<br>
 <br>
I'm pretty sure I still have a small piece left I am not using for anything if you want a sample to try.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually  the one I think you are referring to (one of those from the gathering) was done on a Staedler Mars Grand size eraser.  This is my all-time favorite carving medium and they were readily available from several online resources when I first began carving.  It lies somewhere between MasterCarve and PZKut as far as firmness goes, but is thick like MasterCarve.  Unfortunately I have been told by countless art suppliers and craft stores, etc. that this size Staedler eraser is no longer being distributed in the U.S.  The smaller size is still available at most art stores and I even see them at Office Max and Staples on a regular basis, but I find them too small for most of my carving.  I've also searched online for a German source (that is where the company is located), but have not had any success in that regard either.  A couple of months ago, my local scrapbooking store cleaned out their basement and there was one lonely eraser sitting on the shelf when I stopped in there one day.  I got all excited and thought perhaps they were on the market again and had the owner of the store check with all her suppliers -- but same deal -- no distribution source in the U.S.   If anyone is successful in finding a U.S. or foreign source that accepts U.S. currency or PayPal, please let me know.  I would buy a case of these thing if I could find them.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For small (1" x 1") two-sided carvings, I've very fond of Paperchase <br>
erasers (I got a bunch at the local Borders) - they are translucent and <br>
in fun colors.  The material is a litter stiffer than mastercarve, but <br>
not as stiff as the "pink stuff" and smoother than erasers.  I really <br>
like colors and began carving using neon "office depot" beveled <br>
erasers - pack of 6 and each a different color.  OD usually only has <br>
them during "school supply" time - so I picked some up this week.  <br>
Since I do a lot of boxing with the younger generation, the different <br>
colors are easier to say "how's the green stamp?".  Oh yea, teams of <br>
youngun's really can't get into a team stamp - they what their own.  <br>
And it is really hard to be stealth with 6 wiggly 10 year olds.<br>
