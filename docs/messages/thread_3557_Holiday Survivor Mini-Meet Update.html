                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, here's an update as to the current plans for our little<br/>
Mini-Meet on the 21st.  <br/>
<br/>
- Unveiling of our exciting event stamp<br/>
<br/>
- Gabe wants to try and put on a small workshop about making logbooks<br/>
(Monkey Journals courtesy GLG 2005)<br/>
<br/>
- Fungus Woman has offered to bring some event stamps from the Pirates<br/>
from Every Port gathering, some Oz stamps, as well as some egyptian<br/>
stamps her father had carved.<br/>
<br/>
- A raffle to benefit the LBNA website with currently the following<br/>
prizes:<br/>
    * Set of LePlume II Brush Markers<br/>
    * 3 Great Lakes Regional patches<br/>
    * Telescopic walking stick (courtesy of MRSHAT)<br/>
    * Centrifuge tubes [great for microboxes] (courtesy of Katy)<br/>
<br/>
- We also hope to have demonstrations of technology/equipment that<br/>
people use while "on the hunt".  In addition to this, we hope to have<br/>
people bring along boxes/stamps in progress to give examples to new<br/>
boxers and maybe share techniques.<br/>
<br/>
We've currently got 19 people signed up over at Atlas Quest, but I've<br/>
heard of at least a few others who still plan on coming, so as of now<br/>
we're expecting around 25-ish (hopefully more).  We are also planning<br/>
on laying out the initial plans for an annual IL gathering and are<br/>
encouraging any IL boxers to show up to help with this.  We hope to<br/>
plan/host this first one, then try to set it up to rotate through the<br/>
state and hit a new location every year.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, I ask anyone planning on coming to head on over to Atlas Quest<br/>
and sign-up for the event, that way we can keep an accurate count.<br/>

more tonight and will post the info in both places.<br/>
