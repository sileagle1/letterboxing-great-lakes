                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, here's an update as to the current plans for our little<br>
Mini-Meet on the 21st.  <br>
<br>
- Unveiling of our exciting event stamp<br>
<br>
- Gabe wants to try and put on a small workshop about making logbooks<br>
(Monkey Journals courtesy GLG 2005)<br>
<br>
- Fungus Woman has offered to bring some event stamps from the Pirates<br>
from Every Port gathering, some Oz stamps, as well as some egyptian<br>
stamps her father had carved.<br>
<br>
- A raffle to benefit the LBNA website with currently the following<br>
prizes:<br>
    * Set of LePlume II Brush Markers<br>
    * 3 Great Lakes Regional patches<br>
    * Telescopic walking stick (courtesy of MRSHAT)<br>
    * Centrifuge tubes [great for microboxes] (courtesy of Katy)<br>
<br>
- We also hope to have demonstrations of technology/equipment that<br>
people use while "on the hunt".  In addition to this, we hope to have<br>
people bring along boxes/stamps in progress to give examples to new<br>
boxers and maybe share techniques.<br>
<br>
We've currently got 19 people signed up over at Atlas Quest, but I've<br>
heard of at least a few others who still plan on coming, so as of now<br>
we're expecting around 25-ish (hopefully more).  We are also planning<br>
on laying out the initial plans for an annual IL gathering and are<br>
encouraging any IL boxers to show up to help with this.  We hope to<br>
plan/host this first one, then try to set it up to rotate through the<br>
state and hit a new location every year.  <br>
<br>
Again, I ask anyone planning on coming to head on over to Atlas Quest<br>
and sign-up for the event, that way we can keep an accurate count.<br>

today, as well as sign their contract.  Supposedly, there's a small<br>
kitchenette in the Auditorium and they have a few restrictions (like<br>
no red or purple drinks since they stain carpeting).   I should know<br>
more tonight and will post the info in both places.<br>
