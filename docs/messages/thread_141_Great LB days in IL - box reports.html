Starved Rock #4 - found, in good shape<br>

Untitled - found, in good shape<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad you finally found the notorious "Butt Box" aka Masquerade #1!  <br>
It took a long time (four months) to write those clues, so it's <br>
gratifying to see them leading 'boxers to victory (finally!).<br>
<br>
What a bummer about Herrick Lake, though.  That was the first Lb <br>
stamp I ever carved.  Oh, well....  Rest assured I will make a note <br>
of its absence on the LbNA site and begin carving a new (and <br>
hopefully improved) stamp in the near future.<br>
<br>
As for the Terrified Tree....  Did you happen to find an extra set <br>
of clues in its box?  If not, we'll have to print up a fresh set of <br>
bonus box clues....<br>
<br>
A placer's work is never done (thank goodness!)<br>
