I poked and prodded and raked the area with a sturdy stick, and even moved the fallen pieces of stump and totally demolished what was left of it (so much for "leave no trace"...but if questioned I figured I could always say "the fungus(woman) did it").And then I went back and poked and prodded and raked some more. And I'm going back next weekend, so I'm going to look again.<br/>

Did you dig around in the rot? We've found two boxes quite "buried" in<br/>
rotted stumps. The "organic material" had deteriorated and covered the box<br/>
quite deeply. Luckily we were persistent enough in our searches that we<br/>
were able to uncover them (one was a box I planted and another was a box<br/>
presumed missing in IL).<br/>

We are so sorry, I was sure we had emailed you about this. It is still there. When we found it in April the stump was no longer a hidding spot, actually it was not really a stump, and we moved it to the nearest good hidding spot.
