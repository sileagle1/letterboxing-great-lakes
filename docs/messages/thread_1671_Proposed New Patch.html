<br>
<br>
It is with great pleasure that I would request one of these lovely <br>
new patches should they come to fruition.<br>
<br>
While our place of residence is far from your district, our heart <br>
still lies with many of our new friends made in the state of <br>
Michigonia while we were temporary ringmasters for Boch's Traveling <br>
Circus several months ago. I have remained subscribed to this list to <br>
keep up on the news from your land in preparation for a return in the <br>
future. This patch will serve as a reminder of friends made and <br>
memories enjoyed in your land.<br>
<br>
Please enter an order for 1 patch so that we, too, can gaze upon this <br>
wonderful piece of new, letterboxing memorabilia.<br>
<br>
Wishing you all the best in this new endeavor,<br>
<br>
<br>
Marco Peperini,<br>
Pinecone Extravaganza Circo<br>
<br>
<br>
PS. One unfortunate event from our trip was that Mrs. Peperini came <br>
down with an awful case of the Cooties. She still visits the spa <br>
daily for a special sea salt rub to rid herself of these pesky little <br>
critters1<br>
