Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man reported to me that they were unable<br>
to find it during their recent swing through Kalamazoo so I went out<br>
to check on it.<br>
I was worried; when experienced boxers like those come up empty,<br>
there's probably good reason.<br>
Now, it *may* still be there, but since the parks people have<br>
dramatically changed the landscape along that trail, *I* can't find it<br>
either.<br>
And when the placer can't find the box, I guess we'll call it "missing".<br>
<br>
This was a significant logbook for some on this list.<br>
