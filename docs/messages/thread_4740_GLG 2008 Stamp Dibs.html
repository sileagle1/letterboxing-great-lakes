did. I would assume other people have used the term before, so I can't stake claim to <br>
coining it although I really don't recall hearing it anywhere else. I think the common <br>
nickname for people from Wisconsin is Cheesehead (I think that's a well embraced <br>
nickname by people from WI. since you can buy a big orange cheese "head" at a Packer <br>
game) If I was from WI. I would be proud to call myself a cheesehead, who doesn't like <br>
cheese? and everyone knows that WI. makes some of the best cheese anywhere. I <br>
remember coming home from the Dells or somewhere and looking forward to stopping to <br>
buy cheese from a little cheese shop(can't remember the name of it). <br>
MMMMmmmmm......Cheese. : )<br>
<br>
As far as the Illinois name, I've never heard it before.<br>
<br>
What do people from WI. call Minnesotans? Complimentary or not, I want to know. As far <br>
as I can remember I've never heard a nickname directed at us from WI. I'm sure it's <br>
hilarious whatever it is.<br>
<br>
GG<br>

P.S. Due to a cruel twist of fate, I've become Lactose intolerant since my 2 month long bout <br>
of Salmonella last year. : ( No more cheese for this Minnesotan.<br>

<br>
> Yeah, I know you were kidding!  I have to admit that I've never heard the term <br>
"Sconnies" before.  Did you make it up or is it a term that is used in Minnesota?  To my <br>
knowledge, we only have a nickname for people from Illinois and it isn't complimentary.  <br>

I've never heard of a nickname for Minnesotans.  That's probably because we live in the SE corner of WI, so MN seems pretty FAR away.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Having been born and raised in Wisconsin, the only two nicknames I<br>
ever heard for Minnesotans was "Looneys" or "Mud ducks." Neither was<br>
very common, mostly b/c people just don't seem to move from MN to WI,<br>
at least much past the first 20 miles of the MN-WI border (and that's<br>
just fine by us 'Sconnies!) ;] <br>
<br>
Sadly, in the last year or so I passed the milestone where I have been<br>
an official resident of MN longer than I was of WI. But if you ask me<br>
where I'm from, I'll still say "I'm from Wisconsin, but I live in<br>
Minnesota." And let's forget about that whole "Duck, Duck, Goose" vs.<br>
"Duck, Duck, Greyduck" controversy. My kids think I'm nuts when I say<br>
"GOOSE!"<br>
<br>
Since I grew up in an area that got lots of tourists and summer<br>
residents from IL, I am also very familiar with the F.I.B. and F.I.S.H<br>
nicknames. I worked at McDonald's during my high school summers. 'Nuff<br>
