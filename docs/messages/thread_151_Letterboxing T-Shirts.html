I am a t-shirt girl, so I am always looking for something new. I went <br/>
to cafepress.com the other day and saw that if you send your graphics <br/>
to them, they will sell and distribute t-shirts to whoever wants to <br/>
buy them. If you want to make a profit from them, you can hike the <br/>
price up to whatever you want. Otherwise the money goes directly to <br/>
cafepress for making the items.<br/>
Has anyone ever thought about using them, or have you used them <br/>
before? I thought it would be neat to have a letterboxing shirt to <br/>
show off the idea and get others interested. I know some people don't <br/>
like to spend the time getting them made and dealing with the money <br/>
and shipping, so I thought the cafepress thing would be a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick idea I thought I'd share. :)<br/>

my gift lists (although I don't want to wait for my B-day in August)!<br/>
<br/>
I just checked the T-shirt poll and noticed that it got reset <br/>
somehow - probably I did it by mistake.  Anyway, if you voted last <br/>
week, please re-vote.  If I remember right, I think if we have over <br/>
a dozen orders, the cost would be reasonable to get them made (and <br/>
the more the cheaper).  I have a source we use for our school T-<br/>
shirts that I'll probably use, but I'll check with cafepress too.<br/>
