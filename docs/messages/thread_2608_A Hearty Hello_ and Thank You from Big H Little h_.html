world of Letterboxing this past weekend.  We were a little <br/>
aprehensive of attending an event so early in our Letterboxing <br/>
career, but I can't tell you how much fun we had.  We learned more <br/>
about this hobby in one day, than we could learn in a year doing it <br/>
on our own relying on internet FAQ's.<br/>
<br/>
We had a great time pairing up with Sophie &amp; Me + Toenail + Singular <br/>
Girl.<br/>
<br/>
We also really enjoyed doing some bartering with Drama Mama in <br/>
regards to some coffee cake and a delicious jar of jam!  Little h is <br/>
tickled that your husband liked the cake, and Big H (me) has already <br/>
enjoyed a breakfast with your jam.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I can't finish without thanking Wisconsin Hiker and Martini <br/>
Man for making this all possible.  Without your efforts and an event <br/>
like this, we might not have been as hooked to Letterboxing as we are <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Big H Little h<br/>
