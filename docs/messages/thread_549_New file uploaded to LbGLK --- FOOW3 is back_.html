virtual/postal box.  Based on the clues I'd previously posted (back in<br/>
the files, as the announcement noted), you should be able to figure<br/>
out where it was hidden without being at the actual location.  Email<br/>
me with the location and your address, and I will mail the box to you<br/>
(the stamp has been modified to reflect its new status as not being<br/>
hidden there any more).  Mail it back to me after stamping in (unless<br/>
I get a rash of correct answers in which case I will set up a mailing<br/>
list...let me know if you don't want your name and address circulated<br/>
in this way and I will arrange for a private mailing from and back to me).<br/>
<br/>
I hope this all makes sense.  See the clues for more details.<br/>
<br/>
I am limiting this box's circulation to the Great Lakes Group, at<br/>
least for now.<br/>
