repost our original intro.  Some things have changed<br>
our F count is no longer 200 and we are married now! <br>
Things are finally starting to slow down again and<br>
we're trying to get all of our letterboxing life back<br>
in order!  Anyway, here's the "throw back"<br>
introduction.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi!  We're John and Sara, otherwise known as Leapin'<br>
Lizards.  <br>
 It was great to meet those who made it to the<br>
Wisconsin gathering and we  hope to meet more fellow<br>
letterboxers at the Great Lakes gathering this summer.<br>
 We thought we would take a minute to introduce<br>
ourselves and share how we got into this crazy thing<br>
called letterboxing. . .<br>
<br>
 Sara:  I have created a monster!  About a year and a<br>
half ago, I came across a blurb about letterboxing in<br>
an outdoor travel magazine.  So I asked John what he<br>
thought and he said...<br>
<br>
John:  Cool! Let's try it!<br>
 <br>
Sara:  We started letterboxing in January 2003 and<br>
since then we've seen lots and lots of great places. <br>
Places which I'd personally love to stay and visit the<br>
non-letterboxing points of interest, as well, to which<br>
John always assures me, "We'll come back."  But as<br>
time goes by, and we have yet to return, I know it's<br>
just a line . . . so typical of a guy.<br>
 <br>
John:  Well, if Sara's legs weren't so short, we'd get<br>
to the boxes faster and have time to visit the other<br>
places.  <br>
<br>
Sara:  Like in Michigan! So many cute towns and shops!<br>
<br>
John:  So many letterboxes!  The makers of Advil<br>
really need to thank Spring Chick for the amount of<br>
Advil we purchased during our trip. <br>
 <br>
 Sara:  But it was worth every sand dune we had to<br>
climb!  We must have walked 70 miles during those five<br>
days.<br>
 <br>
John:  But really, letterboxing has been a great way<br>
for us to spend time together, take walks together....<br>
 <br>
Sara:  I'm still convinced he only holds my hand to<br>
drag me along...<br>
<br>
John: ...and teach us patience....like waiting for<br>
Sara.  <br>
 <br>
Sara: . . . and gain endurance, like when John makes<br>
me walk in sub-zero temperatures into straight-line<br>
winds off of Lake Michigan. <br>
<br>
John:  And criminal law, like when were stopped by<br>
Missouri police for a random drug check of our vehicle<br>
while driving home from a letterboxing trip. "Really,<br>
officer we're just looking for boxes with stamps in<br>
them. "  Thank goodness we had the pictures to prove<br>
it!<br>
 <br>
Sara:  We recently marked our 200th find (and retired<br>
our first signature stamp).  Currently, we've planted<br>
16 letterboxes in 6 states and released  5 <br>
hitchhikers.  <br>
 <br>
John:  We have several series ready to be planted,<br>
too...<br>
 <br>
Sara:  Yes, he has close to 100 boxes ready to be<br>
planted.  He tells me that he has carved all of the<br>
stamps, but I'm convinced he has his art students<br>
carving them...Sometimes when he's sleeping, he yell's<br>
out,  "You call that a stamp!  I've seen better stamps<br>
carved out of potatoes by kindergartners!"   <br>
 <br>
John:  I would never let that happen in my sweatshop,<br>
er, classroom.<br>
<br>
Sara:  Like I said, I've created a monster.   I've now<br>
got him on a 12-step program.<br>
<br>
John:  Yes, I'm on step 10 at 340 degrees.<br>
<br>
<br>
Happy boxing--<br>
 <br>
Leapin' Lizards  :-)<br>
