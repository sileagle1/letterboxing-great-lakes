It always surprises me when I see bonus boxes listed on web sites.  They<br>
were originally intended to be surprises and only for those that were<br>
alert enough to pay attention to the letterbox & logbook where the bonus<br>
box clues might be located.  Here are the definitions posted on<br>

I'm guessing you are referring to the three New Orleans bonus boxes. Perhaps<br>
that isn't the correct terminology in this case. When I heard that Shorty<br>
and Pitties planted their series of stamps and I had three carvings here<br>
doing nothing in particular, I offered them as additional stamps once the<br>
clues were already posted and in place. I obviously can't speak for them,<br>
but my guess is they listed them just so finds can be recorded. I don't mind<br>
one way or the other since I don't keep track of my stats, but yeah, it is<br>
nice to hear when people are out to find them. I suppose in that sense they<br>
could be listed just as mystery boxes without linking them to the series and<br>
without listing where the clues are. So as they stand now, in the truest<br>
