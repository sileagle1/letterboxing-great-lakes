For the first time in the 13 years I've been working at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay the campus was CLOSED (not just classes canceled) - by order of the Gov.  Last I heard green bay was at 14" and it's still comming down.  <br>

We've been shoveling out all morning.  The snowblower didn't start and we only have 1 shovel, so much for preparation :).<br>

Down here in Princeton, IL, we missed the worst of the storm. We have ice with about 3 inches of snow on top and lots of wind. Schools are letting out early due to drifting. We'll have to wait and see what tonight brings!<br>

When I saw this first snow fall, my first thoughts were about all the letterboxes out there.  I pray that the lids are on tightly and that they will survive the winter months.  My second thought was BINGO!  When does the maddness start?  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Down here in Janesville we've had about 16-17 inches of very wet, heavy white stuff! (I've got some photos posted on my Facebook for anyone who is my "friend" on there). We still have some flurries right now, but no more accumulation in the forecast. Shoveling today was not fun, but luckily my neighbor helped me out with the end of the driveway where the plow had filled it in with an extra foot and a half of snow! <br>
I will definitely be ready for Bingo to start soon  =)<br>

Pugnasties...and other first time Letterbox Bingo players,<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
WARNING:  If you think letterboxing is addicting, wait till you start playing the daily game of Letterbox Bingo.  It's the slowest game in the world, and it's maddening.  You wait and wait for the winning words on your card to be called, and it becomes an all consuming activity.  You wait every morning for the new word to be posted.  Spring Chick has us in the palm of her hand all winter till the last game winner is announced.  And - it's such fun! <br>
