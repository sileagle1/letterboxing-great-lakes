Sir Frederick the Frog. However, by my calculations, this is the first ZERO term.

If I don't hear from you by the time I call a word on 4 day (ie Tuesday}, you forfeit your wild card. Once you've used your wild card, there are no take backs. Oh yea, this year you can use the wild card for the intermediate games.</div><div><br/></div><div>WILD CARD -
