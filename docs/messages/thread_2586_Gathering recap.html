                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Thanks to all of you for a fantastic weekend!<br>
<br>
We started out with 22 of us at the Delafield Brewhaus on Friday <br>
night.  Lots of exchanges, some special stamps, and lots of <br>
letterboxing chit-chat.  We were interested to hear about Gooble <br>
Gobble's adventures on his way down from Minnesota, as well as <br>
Speedsquare's travel to WI from Indiana, SpringChick's and Azobox's <br>
ferry journey and the early arrival of several IL attendees.  There <br>
was some discussion of tips & tricks and of course many anecdotes <br>
were exchanged as well as stamps.  Several of us noticed that Dragon <br>
had a lovely pair of coconuts that evening!<br>
<br>
Saturday morning arrived clear & sunny and it turned out to be a <br>
perfect day with temperatures in the low 70s.  Gooble Gobble helped <br>
us rearrange a few picnic tables when we arrived and he & Speedsquare <br>
were the first to officially sign-in.  After that there was a steady <br>
stream of arrivals throughout the day.  Luckily the line never got <br>
too long.  Final attendee count was 116 boxers, the largest event our <br>
region has had so far!  The person who came the furthest to attend <br>
was SewSowBizzy, who came from Virginia.  Fairy Princess Fiona also <br>
came from outside our region, coming north from Missouri.  The <br>
youngest attendee was baby CignaCats, 2+ months old.  The oldest <br>
was "Dollar Bill", Fairy Princess Fiona's dad, who I heard is 90 <br>
years old!<br>
<br>
Many people simply hung out in the lodge/picnic area for quite a <br>
while, content to do some exchanges and chat.  Others hit the trail <br>
for a morning hike and letterbox hunt.  Attendance at the workshops <br>
was light, probably because everyone was focused on boxing and <br>
socializing.  Gooble Gobble did teach several of the kids some basic <br>
juggling techniques and later in the day gave us a demonstration of <br>
his skills.<br>
<br>
We started the charcoal a bit late, but then the coals were so hot <br>
that the hot dogs were quickly cooked (OK, maybe "charred" might be a <br>
better description!).  Many thanks to Tonto & Drama Momma for <br>
pitching in to get the grilling under control.  Since the food was <br>
ready, we decided that it might be better to eat first, then take the <br>
group photo.  We also figured we might get more people in the photo, <br>
since they were slowly straggling back from the trails.  We had a lot <br>
of tasty treats for lunch, with several items related to the Alice in <br>
Wonderland theme (tarts, tea, brown bread w/jam, small cake with <br>
currants, and "Eat Me" cakes.<br>
<br>
It just so happened that two of our friends that have heard us talk <br>
about letterboxing over the past 3 years showed up to see what it was <br>
all about just as we were trying to get the group photo organized.  <br>
They therefore volunteered to act as the group photographers and <br>
later even went out to find a few boxes themselves!<br>
<br>
After the photo we awarded a few raffle prizes, then many people went <br>
out to hit the trails again.  Some stayed nearby for more socializing <br>
and to find the numerous boxes hidden in and around the lodge.  Many <br>
of these were very creative and/or tricky.  We especially enjoyed <br>
Dragon's box based on a funny Budweiser commercial that many compared <br>
to a letterbox search (the stamp & log were inside a beer bottle <br>
which was inside a cooler that had a "Drink Me" sign on it) and <br>
Singular Girl's "Have You Seen Me?" box in a milk carton, featuring a <br>
lost Alice who was "Wandering in Wonderland".  Others included a <br>
Goldfish cracker box, Lemon Poppyseed (Papeseed) box, Girl Scout <br>
cookie box, a Riverside Caf box and more.  It certainly kept Martini <br>
Man & I busy throughout the day, even though we never went out on the <br>
trails!<br>
<br>
Of course everyone also appreciated the artistry of the boxes out on <br>
the trails.  Thanks to all of you who contributed boxes for the event!<br>
<br>
People started saying their good-byes at various times, depending on <br>
other commitments and travel distances.  However many stayed until <br>
the end of the day and we were very impressed by all the help we <br>
received during the clean-up phase!!  We REALLY appreciated it and we <br>
certainly saw that "many hands make light work".  Since the Wisconsin <br>
State Parks now have a policy of taking all garbage out yourself, a <br>
VERY SPECIAL THANKS go to the boxers who offered to take some of the <br>
trash home with them  you guys are great!<br>
<br>
We also want to thank all of you for your generous contributions <br>
toward the gathering expenses.<br>
<br>
Not content to let the fun end, 33 boxers attended the "Post-event" <br>
get-together at Marty's Pizza.  Local boxer Jigsaw created a special <br>
Pizza Man stamp for the occasion AND "make your own pizza" stamps <br>
which allowed each of us to draw a circular pizza in our logbook and <br>
then stamp it with our favorite toppings.  Selections included black <br>
olives, mushrooms, pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, and pineapple.  <br>
We sat across from BindleBabe and were amused with her pizza that <br>
featured some toppings on the pizza and some to the side.  She <br>
labeled it "Double Olives, Hold the Peppers", or something to that <br>
effect.  The stamps made the rounds to the various tables as we <br>
enjoyed more stories of the day and some REAL pizza.  After 2 hours <br>
or so, most of us were ready to head for bed to get ready for another <br>
day of boxing.  However Jigsaw & Gooble Gobble were talking of <br>
heading out at 10:30 pm for some night boxing.  Not sure if they made <br>
it or not, or what adventures or misadventures they may have <br>
encountered.<br>
<br>
This morning Martini Man & I were excited to head back to the park <br>
and look for some boxes ourselves.  Even though we hid 22 boxes for <br>
the event, there were amazingly ANOTHER 22 boxes that other people <br>
had hidden!!  We're happy to report that after a busy 9.5 hours at <br>
the park, that we did in fact find 22 boxes and were even the first <br>
to complete the "Wasp in a Wig" series by Jigsaw.  During the day we <br>
met MANY other boxers out on the trails, doing exchanges, sharing a <br>
few tips or hints and generally enjoying the day.  We were also happy <br>
to see some of the dogs out on the trail today.  By the way, I just <br>
want to note that the boxers really earned their stamps this <br>
weekend.  Since the majority of the boxes will be permanent, we <br>
wanted to spread them throughout the park.  This meant that finding <br>
all the boxes required many miles, many HILLY miles, of hiking.  <br>
Congratulations to all the hardy hikers!<br>
<br>
We'll be updating the website with photos in the near future and <br>
encourage you to send us some that you may have taken during the <br>
festivities.  I'll also be emailing the box creators copies of the <br>
clues that were used at the gathering if they would like to post them <br>
on LBNA and/or other clue sites.<br>
<br>
After leaving the park today, we headed out for a celebration dinner <br>
(including margaritas).  This had been a fantastic weekend for us  <br>
totally letterboxing oriented from Friday evening through Sunday <br>
evening.  Thanks to all of you for your potluck, letterbox and <br>
monetary contributions, but most of all for your friendly company!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!! What a great weekend!  We would also like to throw in our <br>
thanks to WiHi and Martini Man for putting together 3 great events.  <br>
We had a terrific time at the pre-gathering, a simply amazing time <br>
at the gathering, and an exhausted but great time at the post <br>
gathering (5 foot pizza anyone?)<br>
<br>
Mrs. Cottontails and I were able to get all but three of the boxes <br>
listed in the packet, despite hanging out at the lodge until 3:00 on <br>
saturday and not starting until after 10:30 sunday.  We have not <br>
done our final count for exchanges, WOM'S, boxes, PT's, the Tess <br>
boxes... but I know that it is the biggest number that I have ever <br>
seen for 2 days worth of boxing.<br>
<br>
We would also like to thank all of our boxing partners over the two <br>
days, you all made the trip that much better!<br>
<br>
As for the Griffin box, we found it in what we think was the right <br>
spot sometime after 6:30 today.  We are pretty sure that we were the <br>
last boxers in the park, not leaving until around 8:30.  We just got <br>
home about 10:45!  I can't wait to go the the next gathering and see <br>
you all again, and meet even more new faces!<br>

PS: A very big thank you to Cmoon and Friends for lunch today, <br>
without which we never would have been as successful as we were.<br>
