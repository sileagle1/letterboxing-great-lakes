                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've received a few BINGO questions in e-mail and here on the list...<br>
<br>
Q. Is it okay to use a trailname if you got the person's personal <br>
traveler but didn't exchange signature stamps?<br>
A. Yeh, I'll let this go as a personal traveler is sometimes the stamp <br>
that a person chooses to exchange instead of their sig stamp.<br>
<br>
Q. Is there a minimum or maximum $$ amount for the Bingo Booty item? <br>
Can we send more than one thing?<br>
A. There is no min or max and you may send as many items as your heart <br>
desires.<br>
<br>
Q. We don't meet the requirements to use any of the letterboxes, <br>
trailnames or gatherings because we have only been letterboxing a few <br>
months...<br>
<br>
... can we just choose anything we want then?<br>
... can we not play then?<br>
<br>
A. You can only use the letterboxes, trailnames and gatherings if you <br>
meet the criteria.  If not, you will need to choose from the general <br>
letterboxing terms for your list. There are enough general terms that <br>
you can fill your card -- you will even get to make some choices as <br>
there are 7 general words in each column and you only need 5.<br>
<br>
... isn't this unfair to newer people?<br>
... won't we be at an unfair advantage?<br>
<br>
A. Qualifying to use some of the letterboxes, trailnames and <br>
gatherings does not give a person an advantage in winning the game, it <br>
simply gives them a larger subset of words to choose from for their <br>
card (which, depending on your perspective, is not necessarily even a <br>
good thing).  The purpose of this is to reduce the possibility of <br>
duplicate cards, not to give anyone an advantage. The words are drawn <br>
randomly and each word has the same odds of being called as the next, <br>
no matter which category it is from.<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone!<br>
