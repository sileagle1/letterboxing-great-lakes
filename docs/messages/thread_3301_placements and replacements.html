Magic" has been replaced for the 2006 season.  It's the same stamp as <br/>
last year, but in a new location, and there's no fee involved this time.<br/>
<br/>
The first in a series of letterbox tributes to my Dad has been <br/>
placed.  "Remembering Boxer: Wolves" has been hidden in Illinois.  <br/>
While it's listed as a mystery, it really is no big mystery - I'm just <br/>
trying to keep it off the Google radar since the location it is hidden <br/>
at does not know of its placement.  Please be overly discrete if you go <br/>
looking for this one.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, a special thanks to The Two Freetimers for adopting and <br/>
placing the replacement for my long-lost "SPAM!" box in Austin, MN.  <br/>
Its new name is "SPAM Town, USA".  We had a dickens of a time posting <br/>
the clues on LbNA.  Choi was on the case trying to determine why both <br/>
the Freetimers and I were getting error messages denying us access.  He <br/>
couldn't figure it out, but the only thing I can guess is somehow the <br/>
website did not appreciate me attempting to post spam and was trying to <br/>
block me???  I finally tricked it by spelling it "sp*m" and then once <br/>
it was accepted I was able to correct the spelling.  Anyway, thank you <br/>
again to the Two Freetimers, and if you're ever in that region of MN, <br/>
please treat yourself to a sample of SPAM!  (Just watch out for those <br/>
bloody Vikings!)<br/>

the "Remembering Boxer" series.<br/>
