                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, these heavy downpours are having a negative affect on my letterboxes.  First, Sir Paul from The Beatles Letterbox Series is reported missing....most likely washed away down stream.  The crew of the Yellow Submarine hasn't found Paul yet, so I'll have to recarve that stamp and replace that box.  Yes, thanks to all the support emails I received, I WILL recarve that rather detailed stamp and keep the series active.  <br>
<br>
Tonight, I'm told that the log book inside my Long Grove Bridge letterbox is WET!  That means the freezer bag was left open, or it was somehow compromised (tiny holes in the baggie), or maybe the box wasn't sealed tightly.  But this unusual amount of rain and flooding in Lake Co. has been severe, and there are 4 more days of rain expected this week.  YIKES!  <br>
<br>
Once this rain stops, I'll be out on the trails doing some inspection of my boxes.  This might be a good word of advice to other local boxers too.  Sometimes a box is washed out of it's hiding spot, but it can be rescued if found before someone else finds it.  I've saved completed wet logbooks by taking it apart, laying the pages on a plastic table cloth and drying the pages with a hair dryer.  Then, I use a dry iron on a high heat setting to flatten the pages.  It works, sometimes.  <br>

Here's hoping that all of our letterboxes are safe out in nature.  <br>

Yea, CB and I were watching the news last night as they reported that <br>
the Des Plaines River was going to crest near 9ft...while the normal <br>
height is only 2ft!  We quickly counted a few boxes that we fear might <br>
be washed away.  Hopefully it will get warm and sunny so we can go see <br>
if they are all still alive...we hope all the area boxes survived this <br>
past weekend.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Rivers are like that!  Rivers overflow their banks.  Rivers are not letterbox friendly.<br>
When I went to check on The Beatles Series, I looked for Sir Paul's box down stream, along the river banks, and I even considered walking into the river to check the beaver dam...but I didn't.  Common sense finally kicked in.  Those stamps were a big challenge.  Recarving Paul will be difficult for me, but I've received so much encouragement that I'll give it another attempt to replace that box. Maybe my carving technique has improved thanks to all the tips I have received from FW over the years.  As for the location, what they don't know...well, you know what I mean.  Life is about chances and nothing lasts forever.  <br>
<br>
I'm conducting a outdoor education training for the GS this Saturday.  The rain is suppose to stop by Friday, but the mosquito population may be preparing to eat us ALIVE!!!  With all the talk about mites and bites, it may take more than repellent.  How does one teach how to build a campfire with wet wood?  This will certainly be a challenge.  <br>

Use White Birch, it burns easily when wet.  Then use the VERY smokey <br>
fire to dry the rest of your wood.  It is best to use split logs, <br>
because they dry faster.  You may also find yourself needing more <br>
kindling then you would normally use.<br>

Now dear, you KNOW how to do this. It's called 'firestarters.'  Didn't <br>
you learn all about those in GGG? :)<br>
<br>
Just double (or quad) the amount you'd normally toss in and build out <br>
with a box fire. The wood will dry in no time, as long as it isn't <br>
actually storming.<br>
<br>
It's almost time to go LEAPing about!<br>
