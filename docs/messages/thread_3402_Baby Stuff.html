                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL, we hadn't thought about using these names as their trailnames.  <br>
That's a really funny suggestion.  As a precaution to not jinx the <br>
babies, Mr. Cottontails insisted that we use "nicknames" for them <br>
until they are born.  We haven't been referring to them by their <br>
real names yet, instead we just call them Twinkie (our daughter) and <br>
Ding-Dong (our son).  It's a long story about how we arrived at <br>
those nicknames.  They will just be absorbed into our family <br>
trailname of "The Cottontails" until they are old enough to choose <br>
their own trailnames.<br>
