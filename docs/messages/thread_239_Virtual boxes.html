                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for your kind words Matt ;-)  You are correct in your <br>
assumption that the Moo-Mahh stamps are available only for <br>
completing the 4 phases of the virtual hunt.  There was a 5th stamp <br>
image that went only to the person who finished first -- BeMa from <br>
VA.<br>
<br>
I had a lot of fun creating the virtual challenge -- it is a good <br>
winter activity.  I had ideas for a couple of others but I put them <br>
on hold because it is really a lot of work to keep up with it as it <br>
is so dependent on other people's web sites.  I've had to change <br>
clues and reroute visitors several times because the referenced <br>
sites disappeared, moved or changed their site design/options.  If I <br>
do another one, it will be more dependent on information that can be <br>
found in various places on the web, not on specific web sites.<br>
<br>
Glad you had fun with it!<br>
