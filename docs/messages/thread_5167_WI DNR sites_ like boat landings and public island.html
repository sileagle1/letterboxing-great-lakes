and was wondering if any of you have already been down this route. <br/>
There is a public landing by my house which would be GREAT - but it is<br/>
clearly posted that you can't leave "litter".  Same on a very small<br/>
island in Minocqua Lake which I have visited and played on for 50<br/>
years.  Does the WI DNR consider letterboxes "litter"?  (As opposed to<br/>
all the empty vodka bottles that are at every site ...)  I've been<br/>
searching their sites and see that geocaches are not allowed. What<br/>
about the Rail-to-trails land? Just thought I'd ask here before I<br/>
start calling.  Sara<br/>
