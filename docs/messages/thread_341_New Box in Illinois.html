                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have just placed our first letterbox.  It is also my first <br/>
attempt at stamp carving.  I was going to stick with store-bought <br/>
stamps, but thought I would be in the minority.  It also seems that <br/>
we are continuing out trend of letterboxing in the rain.  That just <br/>
makes things more fun.  If you find yourself near Shabbona, IL, stop <br/>
by and take a little stroll.  We'd be interest to hear what you <br/>
think of our first letterbox.<br/>

I know how excited you are!  Good for you for attempting  the carving, it's <br/>
less intimidating once you start to carve, right?  It's  was the thought of it <br/>
that scared me, but once I got started...BOOM!  Addiction City.<br/>

You need to tell us who your partner in crime is.  You  said, "We placed our <br/>
first box."  I live in MI. I hope someone finds your  box soon, so you can get <br/>
some feedback while the excitement is raging in your  veins, and you are <br/>
completely obsessed with if your clues are too abstract or to  obvious.  It's a <br/>
killer, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
I hope to find your box one day!<br/>
