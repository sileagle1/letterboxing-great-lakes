to try Doodle's idea of filters, because then Outlook won't pick them up.<br/>

The wierd thing is some Notify messages come through, and others don't.<br/>
Same with my cousin...some of her messages come through, others go into the<br/>
spam basket.  (Personally, in her case, I wish they all did...she sends me<br/>
junk!)<br/>
<br/>
(It's usually after several days that I check and see 500+ spam<br/>
messages...but better there than in my inbox!)<br/>

<br/>
I have had the same thing happen to me but I have far less Spam<br/>
coming in (yikes! 500 messages!?) so I don't think contact the<br/>
placer messages have slipped past me.<br/>
When I read your note, I thought of a possible solution. This may or<br/>
may not work, but I have just implement it myself.<br/>
Try adding the user: notify at letterboxing dot org<br/>
(notify@letterboxing.org) to your email address book. I think those<br/>
spamguard type programs have a feature that scans the address book<br/>
before sending an incoming message to the bulk/junk mail box.<br/>
If you try it, let me know. Maybe we can test each other's mailbox<br/>
by using the contact placer feature at letterboxing.org (grin)<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
