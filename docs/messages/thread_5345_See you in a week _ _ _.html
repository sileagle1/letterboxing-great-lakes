I am leaving at one in the morning on Friday for a week long <br>
missionary trip to Jamaica. <br>
<br>
I will be back late Saturday (the 18th) and will post more then. <br>
<br>
I am excited that there are 2 boxes where we are going to be, here's <br>
hoping for a couple of finds. I do have 1 box to plant as well.<br>
<br>
Please be praying for myself, as well as the other 10 going on this <br>
trip. Pray, especially for our families back home, for Becki and the <br>
kids.<br>
<br>
Also, my grandfather is expected to pass away by the end of this week <br>
or early next week. So, he will probably die while I'm in Jamaica.<br>
<br>
I spoke with him last night, saying, "We'll see you in Heaven <br>
someday, we love you." <br>
<br>
Most probably the last words I will ever speak to my grandfather in <br>
this life. I was pretty choked up over this last night.<br>
<br>
Please keep him, my grandmother, dad and whole family as we prepare <br>
to lose someone very special to all of us.<br>
