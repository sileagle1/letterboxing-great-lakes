I just returned from Lake shabbona and had the opportunity to check on <br/>
The bridge of Death.  It is not there.  There had been a report of it <br/>
being missing a while back and then someone reported they had found it. <br/>
If you can let the owners know that a new one has to be carved and <br/>
mailed to me, I will go out and replace it.<br/>
