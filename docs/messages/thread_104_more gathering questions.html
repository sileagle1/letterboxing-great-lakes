<br/>
In answer to some of your gathering questions...  Not sure if there <br/>
really is a rule as to how you count the boxes that you create and <br/>
then send to someone else to hide.  I have contributed several boxes <br/>
to events and series around the country in this way, and I have <br/>
never counted them at all.  But it is up to you -- some people count <br/>
them as a plant, some count as a 1/2 -- not a big deal, just however <br/>
you feel comfortable doing it.<br/>
<br/>
It is up the the creator of the box to decide it's fate.  If you <br/>
want the box back after the gathering, just take it home with you or <br/>
let Tim know and perhaps it can be sent to you at a later date, <br/>
etc.  If you decide to leave it, it would be your responsibility to <br/>
maintain though unless you make an arrangements with somebody else <br/>
in the area.<br/>
<br/>
As for personal travellers...  yes -- keep your eyes and ears open.  <br/>
Another good idea is to search through the archives at the big list -<br/>
- you don't have to read them all, just do some searches on the <br/>
words personal traveller (both spellings as some use only one "l") <br/>
and the posting names of people...  Also sometimes people who have <br/>
personal LB'ing web sites will have hints on their web sites, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of a "what to expect at a gathering" file.  I will <br/>
spend some time this weekend pulling info from the various messages <br/>
that have been posted here and at the other groups and add them into <br/>
one place in the files section.<br/>
