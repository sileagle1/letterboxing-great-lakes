So glad everything is well & I wish you all the best with your new  <br>
little guy! Especially these first few months! (I always loved the  <br>
first 6 weeks or so with our babies... a crazy, sleep-deprived  <br>
existence at times for sure; but overwhelmingly a magical and  <br>
wonderous time as well.)<br>
<br>
Take care and hope to see you on the trails some time soon to meet  <br>
the newest TJ_Mich boxer :-)<br>

We were camping in Manistique and filled our water cooler from the <br>
Old Well on July 2.  As we were driving away, saw folks milling <br>
around in the woods and have been kicking ourselves ever since for <br>
not stopping.  Another Exchange opportunity missed!<br>
