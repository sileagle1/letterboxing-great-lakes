Yay! Just in time for LK and I to hunt them down! Opted for a trip to<br>
Milwaukee instead of Duluth for my birthday in August. Wanted to see family<br>
and friends... and wanted to work on our long list of Milwaukee area boxes.<br>
Lot harder to get there these days! We will be in town August 24-26... you<br>

Ooooh!  Count me in too!  I love going to outdoor events in Milwaukee and would love to introduce everyone to Sophie's kid brother, Frank!  I haven't done any letterboxing this summer, (except the two I found on my trip to Seattle), because of the heat and the bugs.  I would love to come out and be social!

Hey, we'll be around then! How about getting together for one of the free<br>
<br>
outdoor concerts in the area if the weather is decent? Some possibilities<br>
<br>
on Wednesday AUG 25 are the Dirty Boogie Band at Pewaukee Lake (6-9 pm, buy<br>
<br>
food & beverages) or Five Card Studs at River Rhythms downtown Milwaukee<br>
<br>
(6:30-9pm buy food & beverage OR you are allowed to bring your own stuff).<br>
<br>
If Wednesday isn't good, we could do something Thursday.<br>
<br>

P.S. We're still planning to do the free outdoor movie nights at the<br>
<br>
lakefront in SEP (Darkside of Oz on SEP 10 and The Rocky Horror Picture Show<br>
<br>
on SEP 24). We'll post more info after Labor Day, but here's a link:<br>

Yay! Just in time for LK and I to hunt them down! Opted for a trip to<br>
<br>
Milwaukee instead of Duluth for my birthday in August. Wanted to see family<br>
<br>
and friends... and wanted to work on our long list of Milwaukee area boxes.<br>
<br>
Lot harder to get there these days! We will be in town August 24-26... you<br>
<br>
know, in case anyone wanted to get together or go find a few boxes with us!<br>

Love to you all!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We'll be there!  Unlike some other downtown concerts, you ARE allowed to<br>
bring your own picnic food & beverages (including alcoholic beverages) to<br>
this concert site.  There are also places to purchase food & beverages at<br>
the concert if you don't bring anything, so it's your choice!  Just bring a<br>
blanket or some lawn chairs along and you'll be ready for the concert.<br>
<br>
There is street parking available near the park and I believe after 6 pm it<br>
is free.  In addition, here's a site that shows some other parking options<br>
near the park:  <br>
http://www.parkmilwaukee.com/destinations/7-pere-marquette-park<br>

<br>
We'll probably be at a concert there next week, so we'll scope out a place<br>
that might be good to designate as a meeting place and post it next<br>
Thursday.  If anyone that will be meeting up with us on AUG 25 wants our<br>
cell phone numbers in case they can't find us, send me a private email.<br>
<br>
Here's some info on the group that is playing:<br>
<br>
August 25 - Five Card Studs  http://www.fivecardstuds.com<br>
<br>
The Five Card Studs returns to River Rhythms for a night of fun to prove<br>
they are "the hardest working lounge band in the Midwest"<br>
