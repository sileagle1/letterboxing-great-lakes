&gt; Is anyone actually venturing out this weekend?!?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wisconsin Hiker<br/>
&gt; <br/>
Tonto teased first thing this morning about being willing to go up to <br/>
Niles to find Atom 118's "Bear Down" letterbox today...He is WAY too <br/>
excited about the big game tomorrow if he is ready to risk freezer <br/>
burn just to get a Bears letterbox! I should've called his bluff!  <br/>
Maybe I will ask tomorrow around...Hmmm, let's see...5 PM!<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I spent the day baking...Chicago Bear cookies for tomorrow's <br/>
hoopla!  This is really silly coming from a gal born and raised in <br/>
Indy!  But let me remind my Hoosier friends that back in the day, <br/>
Indy folks didn't even have a NFL team...and I actually grew up with <br/>
my Dad being a big Bears fan...ala Gale Sayers days...Ohhh...I'm <br/>
showing my age!<br/>
<br/>
And yes...I believe Johnny Unitas was the great quarterback of what <br/>
team????<br/>
Tonto says GO BEARS!...Tiptoe says she will just be glad when all <br/>
this fuss is over....<br/>
Keep warm...and remember the groundhog didn't see his shadow...spring <br/>
is just around the corner!<br/>

earlier, we're unbelievably quiet for a Sun. now (@5:20pm).<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of a bummer to miss the kickoff, but I'll (hopefully) be <br/>
home before the 1st quarter is over.<br/>

GO BEARS!!!!!!!<br/>
