Tonto teased first thing this morning about being willing to go up to <br>
Niles to find Atom 118's "Bear Down" letterbox today...He is WAY too <br>
excited about the big game tomorrow if he is ready to risk freezer <br>
burn just to get a Bears letterbox! I should've called his bluff!  <br>
Maybe I will ask tomorrow around...Hmmm, let's see...5 PM!<br>
<br>
Instead, I spent the day baking...Chicago Bear cookies for tomorrow's <br>
hoopla!  This is really silly coming from a gal born and raised in <br>
Indy!  But let me remind my Hoosier friends that back in the day, <br>
Indy folks didn't even have a NFL team...and I actually grew up with <br>
my Dad being a big Bears fan...ala Gale Sayers days...Ohhh...I'm <br>
showing my age!<br>
<br>
And yes...I believe Johnny Unitas was the great quarterback of what <br>
team????<br>
Tonto says GO BEARS!...Tiptoe says she will just be glad when all <br>
this fuss is over....<br>
Keep warm...and remember the groundhog didn't see his shadow...spring <br>
is just around the corner!<br>
Tiptoe & Tonto<br>

earlier, we're unbelievably quiet for a Sun. now (@5:20pm).<br>

It's kind of a bummer to miss the kickoff, but I'll (hopefully) be <br>
home before the 1st quarter is over.<br>
