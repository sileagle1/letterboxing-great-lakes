I've been holding my breath because, gasp, I've been doing better than I <br/>
expected.  Of course, that might be due to the fact that no one is <br/>
posting stuff like "YEA..JUST NEED ONE MORE"...so yea....it is hard to tell.<br/>
<br/>
Wait, what..10th anniversary?  Yea...perhaps the winter snow is just <br/>
dragging everyone down, dulling the brain,...a bit more than usual.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is just the lack of SIDEWAGERS this year...who knew that was <br/>
the glue that held it all together?!  Perhaps I'll need to pick it back <br/>
up next year....<br/>
