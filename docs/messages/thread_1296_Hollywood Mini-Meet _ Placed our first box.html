Hollywood Mini-Meet.  It was nice to finally meet some other boxers <br>
face to face and talk letterboxing.  Looking forward to the next one :)<br>
<br>
In other news,  we placed our first letterbox today (after a yummy <br>
Mother's Day breakfast of course).  The box is called "A Puppus Among <br>
Us".  The clues are already posted on the LBNA website.  We would love <br>
to hear from whomever looks for our box since this is our first attempt <br>
at writing clues.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Hope <br>
everyone has a great Mother's Day :)<br>
