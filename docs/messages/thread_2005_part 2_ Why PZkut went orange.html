PZkut, her son Justin is running things now.  <br/>
<br/>
After exchanging a couple of emails, I asked Justin the following:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do you mind sharing with me the reason you switched<br/>
&gt; from the original white to the newer orange product?<br/>
&gt; Just wondering if it was a supply or cost issue or if<br/>
&gt; there were some other reason for the switch.<br/>
<br/>
I'd just like to say Justin has always been very prompt to reply and<br/>
quite willing to be of assistance. It's obvious that quality is a<br/>
priority for him. I'm in no way suggesting anything derogatory about him.<br/>
<br/>
Here is his reply to my question:<br/>
<br/>
The quality of the white was degrading slightly for awhile, then<br/>
suddenly it took a big turn for the worse. I was no longer able to get<br/>
any that would qualify as Grade "A". I contacted the factory, and it<br/>
turns out they had switched out some pieces of machinery to reduce<br/>
costs. Unfortunately the new equipment made it impossible to get the<br/>
white material any longer. At that point I was made aware of the<br/>
orange material, and that it was unaffected by the change. As the<br/>
orange still generally maintains a smooth surface, I have had to<br/>
switch to that to be able to continue to provide a Grade "A" quality<br/>
PZ Kut. I know not everyone likes it. If it was up to me we would<br/>
still have the white, but unfortunately it is out of my hands.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
