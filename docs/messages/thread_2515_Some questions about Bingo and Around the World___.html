Yes, reading some old posts would be one idea.  There is also a lot of<br>
good info in the "Files" section of the message board.<br>

<br>
P.S.  The BINGO game started January 1.  Anyone could enter by<br>
contributing a prize and selecting 30 words from a predefined list of <br>
150<br>
words.  The "Around the World in 80 Days" is a series of boxes in MI <br>
that<br>
SpringChick & Azobox created.  You need to contact them to get clues. <br>
More details can be found in Files and older posts.<br>
<br>
P.P.S.   Welcome to the group!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi dsgmi -- welcome to letterboxing and the group!  As WI_Hiker mentioned, reading through old posts would be a good way to "catch up" with some of the things we are talking about and the goings-on around here.  Also a good way to find out about letterboxes and letterboxers in your area.  But if there is anything specific you are wondering about, please feel free to shoot a question to the group, we are a friendly bunch.<br>
<br>
The Bingo game is wrapping up for this year.  The "Around the World in 80 Days Series" is just getting underway for the 2006 season.  You can find more information on that here:<br>

<br>
Where are you from?  (I am venturing a guess that the "mi" at the end of your signature may indicate Michigan?)<br>
