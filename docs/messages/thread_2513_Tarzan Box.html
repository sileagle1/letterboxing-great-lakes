each word in an answer to make it easier to figure out the clues.<br>

Bummer -- we were unable to locate the building that dark rainy night after enjoying dinner and icecream with AtomicBeans. So, Tarzan will never be found by the Harts :-(<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Back in the fall of 2008, I letterboxed for two full days in Chicagoland while "I/m w/Her" was not with me (he was in meetings).  The first day, I started early and took the train out of town.  I went to the zoo, saw some biker chicks and ate some candy.  The next day strolled a couple of cemeteries, ate some ice cream and finally headed toward Tarzan.  The Tarzan clue indicated that the letterbox might be a "tall order" for me (I'm only 5'5") ... so to increase my chances of being able to reach the box, I had lugged around a thick Chicago phone book in my backpack all day.  <br>
<br>
Aha!  I reach the correct building.  But alas, there is a maintenance guy in the hallway ... plastic sheeting on the floor ... he is not just dusting.  I walked around the neighborhood and came back in 30 minutes.  Mr. Clean Team gave me the stink eye and I headed back to the train!  <br>
<br>
So, I had a good workout carrying that phone book.  Found a lot of boxes.  Arrived back at the hotel to meet up with I'm w/Her with enough time to change into my formal wear for the evening ... just couldn't get all of the ink off my fingers :)<br>
<br>
Thanks for the memories!<br>

The Tarzan box will be available Tuesday.  I'm basically waiting until they lock the building up to remove it, and they haven't said what day that will be.  My husband talked to the maintenance man to see why the building was being locked up.  Apparently,someone was coming in on the weekends and vandalizing the bathrooms.  Plus, some of the offices are open in the evenings and they thought it would be safer for those folks if things were locked up.  <br>
