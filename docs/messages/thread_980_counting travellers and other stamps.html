them at all!  On top of the mix, I have to take into consideration the boxes<br/>
we have at camp...they aren't public, so should I count them?  I have placed<br/>
some, have helped some girls place others, and I have found those others<br/>
have placed....  I mean that as a rhetorical question...I have already<br/>
decided I really don't care!  It's the fun of it all that counts.  I only<br/>
count how long I've been boxing, which will be a year in March.<br/>
