<br/>
LibraryGrrl and I have been talking about planning an event for next October, a fantasty follow up for Boxacon.  We have been looking at a number of parks in the Milwaukee area, but many that we have looked already have quite a few boxes in them.  Does anyone have any suggestions of parks that have a number of trails that would lend themselves to a gathering?<br/>
