<br/>
  I have officially discovered that the outdoors doesn't like me.  It started a three weeks ago, when my wife and I were traveling to find some Grail boxes, and successfully found all of the Adult Swim letterboxes (Thanks Worms!!)  Upon such quest, we came upon a ravished hoard of mosquitoes, and a burning tree.  After stamping in, and loosing a pint of blood each, we put out the burning tree (a sign from God?) and went to lick our wounds. (Finding an official count of 142 bites on me alone).<br/>
<br/>
  Fast forward a week and I being the only adventuring one, traverse a nice grove of shiny three leaved plants that seemed to enjoy my company and latched onto my legs.  Yup a quick visit to the dermatologist confirmed that it was infact poison ivy.  One Cortisone shot later and not only did the poison ivy start to go away, but the itching from the bug bites went away too. (let me tell you a bug bite on top of poison ivy does not cancel eachother out.)<br/>
<br/>
  Now today (and I am writing this after being released from the emergency room) I decide to go out without my wife to find a couple of boxes that Atom 118 planted and I end up getting stung twice by a wasp.  Within ten minutes of stamping in, I broke out in hives along my upper body and arms, my face started to get puffier, and sweat began to pour down my face as my arms felt like they were on fire.<br/>
<br/>
  Well 911 put me on hold for ten minutes and everyone along the path seemed to avoid me because I had my dog with me.   As I was sitting there on my gurney, I remembered that I had forgotten to read the waiver of responsibility agreement that comes at the bottom of all of our clues.<br/>
<br/>
  Lesson of the day:  I should have not worried about the twenty minutes to get to Elgin from Des Plaines.  I should have gone with plan A and tried to get to the Cottontail's for thier garage treasure stamp, and forgotten thosr local stamps all together.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for reading guys.  Don't take it out on me if you didn't like this post, just keep it on and relay any funny injury related trail stories, so we can all learn from each other's mistakes.<br/>

vicious deer flies.  Liberal use of bug spray tends to keep the mosquitoes<br/>
at bay (IF we remember to spray!).  Martini Man does a good job of watching<br/>
for the dreaded PI and we haven't had problems in any of our midwest<br/>
excursions (however I did get PI while we were in Maryland and we both got<br/>
poison oak while in California).  Maybe your fate is to be more of a WINTER<br/>
boxer...  That's our favorite time to plant boxes anyway, so there would<br/>
probably be some new ones for you to find at that time of year.<br/>

Other than mosquitos and  things with stinging, itching things that i  could <br/>
not see, we havent come across anything like your story.<br/>
We did freak out a bit yesterday when the four of us went out, and each of  <br/>
us encountered a different snake on the same outing. yikes, they scare the  <br/>
daylights out of me.  The only other thing I can remember is when my hubby  and I <br/>
were caching and bumped our hard heads into eachother, had a headache for  <br/>
two days.  lol<br/>
So, are you ready to get back out there yet?  <br/>
