Start searching for a unique hiding place in a remote, scenic, or historical location.  In two weeks, you can carve the stamp while taking my workshop at HHPC.  I'll bring the tools and rubber.  Just bring an idea.  BYO tent and let's hope it doesn't rain.  <br>

  Recently I placed my first HH and am ready with my second. I posted it on both atlasquest and letterboxing.org. Also, I put my email in the log books with a request for the finders to keep me posted of where it's been. <br>

  Before there were "HH listing places" people just used the e-mail address provided in the HH logbook to contact the placer. Seems simple enough.<br>

  In my expierience it does seem that not many people log hitchhikers, I <br>
  am ashamed to admit, myself included. This may be partly because many <br>
  placers do not list hitchhikers, and some only list in very special <br>
  places like personal sites, wanda and pete's site, etc...<br>
<br>
  I do feel your pain though. Last fall we planted two hitchhikers, one <br>
  we have recieved a handfull of reports about, but the other, "The <br>
  Panda of Doom" has never written home.<br>
