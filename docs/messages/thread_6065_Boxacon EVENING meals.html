                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I set up a database to find out how many people are interested in<br>
getting together for a meal (& exchanges of course) on Friday and/or<br>
Saturday.  Just add a record to provide your trail name, # of people in<br>
group, and a time preference for getting together.  (I used a "+" sign to<br>
indicate "or later").<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Depending on where people will be located Friday night, we wouldn't<br>
necessarily need to be right near the park, so indicate if you have a<br>
preference as to general area to get together.  I'm assuming Saturday we'll<br>
want to be fairly close to the park.  I've also included columns to allow<br>
you to indicate food preferences or other general comments.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Once we see what size group we're looking at, I can make some suggestions<br>
for locations.  I will try to get places that will let us have separate<br>
checks and that could tolerate a crazed group of people stamping logbooks!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
The database is on the message board in the Database section, table name is<br>
Boxacon (Sci-Fi) Evening Meals<br>
