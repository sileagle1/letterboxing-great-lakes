                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ditto to all the earlier messages of praise.  SpringChick and Old Shoe <br/>
have raised the bar!  Kudos to both of them for an outstanding event!  <br/>
It was so well organized in every respect!  The purchase of clues with <br/>
ticktets earned in a variety of ways was an ingenious idea and like <br/>
some of the others, we feared we wouldn't have enough for the day.  But <br/>
no worries, we found more at the event, with coupon stamps hidden in <br/>
and around the building and by being first finders in some boxes.  What <br/>
a great day we had!  We got 17 boxes Saturday and 12 more Sunday.<br/>
SpringChick and Old Shoe ROCK!!!!<br/>
Thanks to everyone we met and to the old friends we got to see again <br/>
for making this weekend wonderful!<br/>
We were, are and always will be...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a nice event!  So MANY great boxes, nice trails, fantastic weather,<br/>
tasty food (who brought that antipasto type salad? Can we  get the recipe?<br/>
... the apple pie and apple crisp were also wonderful!).  We're totally<br/>
impressed that SpringChick can host such a high-caliber event every year. So<br/>
much creativity... it's amazing how she can carry the theme across all<br/>
aspects of the event - the tickets, the clues, the stamps, the group<br/>
activity and even the food.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun to see some letterboxers that we only see occasionally and to<br/>
meet some new ones.  We spent much of the day out on trail with a few people<br/>
and saw others in the morning at the lodge.  As usual, we were torn between<br/>
finding boxes and chit-chatting.  We did manage to get quite a few boxes<br/>
yesterday and managed to find all the rest today.  We even managed to find 7<br/>
of the 8 hitchhikers!  We'll post some photos tomorrow night and hope to<br/>
have our blog updated in the next day or two.<br/>
<br/>
A BIG THANK-YOU to SpringChick and Old Shoe, and to everyone else who<br/>
contributed stamps to make this such a fun event!<br/>

Well, now I'm really confused! LOL  I swear I've never made or <br/>
released a cootie.  I don't even know Soy, never heard of them before <br/>
you mentioned the name.  I just looked though my logbook and I don't <br/>
have a stamp of a cootie by that name.  That's not all that <br/>
surprising, because usually I just pass them along without stamping <br/>
them.  Maybe someone wrote in the log that they got "cootied by me", <br/>
meaning I passed it on to them, not that I created it?<br/>
<br/>
I did get a cootie on Saturday and I passed it off to F06.  I didn't <br/>
open it to see what it was, though.  It was in a film type <br/>
canister.  Was that the LB bug?<br/>

At 09:11 PM 10/20/2008, you wrote:<br/>
&gt;There was a slip of paper inside that said: "LB BUG Cootie" Placed by Soy<br/>
&gt;7/12/08. On the opposite side it had a copy of the stamp image and "by BNL<br/>
&gt;Bali". Sounded suspicious to me..... are you sure you are innocent?!<br/>

<br/>
Well, now I'm really confused! LOL I swear I've never made or<br/>
released a cootie. I don't even know Soy, never heard of them before<br/>
you mentioned the name. I just looked though my logbook and I don't<br/>
have a stamp of a cootie by that name. That's not all that<br/>
surprising, because usually I just pass them along without stamping<br/>
them. Maybe someone wrote in the log that they got "cootied by me",<br/>
meaning I passed it on to them, not that I created it?<br/>
<br/>
I did get a cootie on Saturday and I passed it off to F06. I didn't<br/>
open it to see what it was, though. It was in a film type<br/>
canister. Was that the LB bug?<br/>

Yes Bali, that's the one I passed to you... It didn't have a logbook <br/>
its a stamp in your book and log it online only type. I also tried to <br/>
pass it to Mrs. Doglvrs but she scooted off way to fast. I had heard <br/>
she LOVES those little things. I woudl have hit Fo6 but I was to scared <br/>
to get anywhere near him, who knows what I woudl have ended up with <br/>
then. :)<br/>
