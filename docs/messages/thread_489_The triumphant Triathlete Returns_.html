Well I'm back.  And I didn't drown, crash, or collapse during the triathlon.  I did, however, experience about five minutes of deep, primal panic and terror at the beginning of the "Lake Michigan/Lake Huron, hey let's mix together and form a love child called the Straits of Mackinac" swim.  In fact, the only thing (and I'm serious about this one) that kept me from dog paddling my sorry butt back to shore and calling it quits was the fact that I would have to carry that burden of shame and embarrassment around with me for the rest of my days.  Pride overrode self-preservation, and I suffered my way through 21 minutes of freezing (not really, it was a balmy 67 degrees in the water) "swimming" (read:something close enough to drowning to keep the life guards awfully close to me).<br>
<br>
I knew once I made it back to shore that the rest of the race would be gravy (but a very nice vegetarian gravy, of course), and sure enough,  I managed to suffer my way through and even crossed the finish line with a degree of panache- carrying my 2 year old daughter with me (who had been sent out to meet me by her father, a cruel and heartless man who knew I'd not be able to resist such a Kodak moment).  Even in the face of near exhaustion, I'm still a ham for the camera.<br>
<br>
The point of all this?  Simply put, I was BEAT!  And so, the next day's prospect of boxing on the Island didn't fill me with the glee it should have.  In fact, after tooling around the interior of the island (and not that nice, sensible coastal loop, but those really mean uphills that get you to the top of that island) on an ancient mountain bike with my 30 pound daughter strapped to the back, it was all I could do to not fling myself off of Arch Rock- which turned out to be the only letterbox I even found on that God-forsaken island.  It was, in fact, only the siren call of fudge that brought me away from the edge, and back to the ferry, which my daughter informed us she was never leaving, because she liked the boat and the island a great deal (I would too if I got to be chauffeured around in a bike seat).<br>
<br>
The next day, we attempted the "Fishing Mullet Lake" series.  This seemed fitting, since, according to the clues, one of the stamps was of a sturgeon, which I was convinced was going to eat me during the swim leg of the triathlon (note: I worried about this unlikely scenario BEFORE the race.  Once in the water, I was too busy simply panicking to stop and worry about giant fish lurking below)  Anyone who's ever 'boxed with me would not be surprised to hear that I only found two of the four boxes.  Not because I think they're missing, but simply because I am a wretched letterboxer.  Truth hurts.  And I didn't even get to the sturgeon stamp.  *sigh*<br>
<br>
But if you're ever up Cheboygan way, I would HIGHLY recommend the Mullet Lake boxes- the stamps are GREAT!  I would also recommend that Bar/Grille in Mackinaw City- I don't know the name, but you can't miss it, it's a giant log cabin looking thing.  Ah!  Such beer!  And the cheese sticks come in a little bucket!  Divine!<br>

> Well I'm back.  And I didn't drown, crash, or collapse during the<br>
triathlon.  I did, however, experience about five minutes of deep, primal<br>
panic and terror at the beginning of the "Lake Michigan/Lake Huron, hey<br>
let's mix together and form a love child called the Straits of Mackinac"<br>
swim.  In fact, the only thing (and I'm serious about this one) that kept me<br>
from dog paddling my sorry butt back to shore and calling it quits was the<br>
fact that I would have to carry that burden of shame and embarrassment<br>
around with me for the rest of my days.  Pride overrode self-preservation,<br>
and I suffered my way through 21 minutes of freezing (not really, it was a<br>
balmy 67 degrees in the water) "swimming" (read:something close enough to<br>
drowning to keep the life guards awfully close to me).<br>
><br>
> I knew once I made it back to shore that the rest of the race would be<br>
gravy (but a very nice vegetarian gravy, of course), and sure enough,  I<br>
managed to suffer my way through and even crossed the finish line with a<br>
degree of panache- carrying my 2 year old daughter with me (who had been<br>
sent out to meet me by her father, a cruel and heartless man who knew I'd<br>
not be able to resist such a Kodak moment).  Even in the face of near<br>
exhaustion, I'm still a ham for the camera.<br>
><br>
> The point of all this?  Simply put, I was BEAT!  And so, the next day's<br>
prospect of boxing on the Island didn't fill me with the glee it should<br>
have.  In fact, after tooling around the interior of the island (and not<br>
that nice, sensible coastal loop, but those really mean uphills that get you<br>
to the top of that island) on an ancient mountain bike with my 30 pound<br>
daughter strapped to the back, it was all I could do to not fling myself off<br>
of Arch Rock- which turned out to be the only letterbox I even found on that<br>
God-forsaken island.  It was, in fact, only the siren call of fudge that<br>
brought me away from the edge, and back to the ferry, which my daughter<br>
informed us she was never leaving, because she liked the boat and the island<br>
a great deal (I would too if I got to be chauffeured around in a bike seat).<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
