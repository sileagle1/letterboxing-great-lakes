<br>
I received the patches in the mail today and they did turn out pretty <br>
nice!  I'll hold in reserve until OCT 1 patches for anyone who<br>
already emailed me that they wanted some.  They'll be available for <br>
purchaseat the Haunted Harvest Gathering on OCT 1.  If you won't be <br>
able to attend the gathering, or if you want them sooner, you'll need <br>
to send me a self-addressed stamped envelope and a check for the <br>
appropriate amount.  The patches are $1.50 each.  I don't think <br>
you'll need any extra postage for 6 patches or less.  I also ordered <br>
some extra ones, so you can still email me to let me know if you want <br>
some.  If you want to see what they look like, go to the Photos <br>
section of this group and click on the Patches folder.<br>
<br>
You can send checks and self-addressed, stamped envelopes to:<br>

Labor Day.<br>
