Nope!  I need 1/2 of what you do and I do not feel at all lucky!  I <br/>
was feeling really lucky at the beginning.  I thought I'd win 2 or 3 <br/>
of the small games.  But, then I did win one, bragged about it on the <br/>
board before it was confirmed and then lost it because someone else <br/>
won first.  Ever since then, my luck went in the gutter.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, "when pigs fly" is when I'll win, too!<br/>
<br/>
And a swine day to you all!<br/>
