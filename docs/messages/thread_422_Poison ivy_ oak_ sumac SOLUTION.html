not, but here's a comercial site you may want to check out.<br>

I have been lucky enough to never have (knocking on wood) had a <br>
reaction to any of these pesky plants.  However, Bindle Bum highly <br>
reacts to the slightest exposure to poison ivy.  <br>
<br>
We always keep some of there products aboard the boat and in our <br>
boxing pack because it works.<br>
<br>
LOTS of poison ivy on South Manitou Island (where we planted a new <br>
LB) and he of course was exposed. Used the Tecnu and ... no rash! (Of <br>
course I ended up stomping through it to get some macro pictures of <br>
the endangered Pritchers Thistle, and had to ditch my clothes into a <br>
plastic bag to be washed with the Tecnu so I wouldn't expose him to <br>
the darn oils... there went my hiking shoes for a few days of <br>
isolation! LOL) <br>
<br>
Didn't see any poison ivy on Garden Island, when we hiked into the <br>
woods back to the Nat'l Regsty. site of the Native American Buiral <br>
Grounds. He came down with a rash the next day, anyway. Hmmmm! But <br>
the Tecnu products worked great and it not only didn't spread, but it <br>
cleared the small rash site on his forearm in only about 3 days.<br>
<br>
Juice from the Jewel Weed/Touch-me-not olant has always worked great <br>
for both of my kids, but has never worked for Bindle Bum. Don't ask <br>
me why, I don't understand it myself.<br>
<br>
I pick it anytime between now and autumn, squeeze the juice out of <br>
the plants and freeze it in those mini ice cube trays. This herbal <br>
cure has worked for us. Even in the dead of winter when my son was <br>
exposed to 'dormant' poison ivy during a Scouting event and came down <br>
with a rash in some ... er .... delicate places.<br>
<br>
One thing to note, the juice does give your skin an unusual green <br>
tinge during treatment.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

with it, zero reaction to poison ivy.  Anyone know anything about <br>
this?  Is it possible to react more strongly to one source of <br>
urushiol than others? <br>
