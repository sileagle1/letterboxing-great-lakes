BUT, I have carved a fish fry stamp, for obvious reasons.  I'm thinking <br/>
of placing it in Hartford 'cause I remember going to a fish fry at The <br/>
Mine Shaft with some of Peabody's coworkers - Snarky Tani jokingly <br/>
remarked on how much fish I ate - um, I'm not a little person AND I was <br/>
a nursing mom.  <br/>
