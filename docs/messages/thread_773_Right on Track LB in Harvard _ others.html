Has anyone found the Right on Track letterbox recently? My friend and <br/>
I went out boxing the other day and that was one on our stop. We <br/>
looked all over the place we thought it would be located in with no <br/>
luck. If you have found it, can I e-mail you off the list to pick <br/>
your brain to see if we did it right?<br/>
<br/>
On a more positive note, we did manage to find three boxes that day.<br/>
Red Horse Bend, Belvidere IL<br/>
Humming Letterbox, ??? IL<br/>
All the World's a Stage #1: Kindergarten, Wauconda IL<br/>
<br/>
On another, well, not so negative, but not so positive note...<br/>
We went looking for the Dead River box, a little late in the day, and <br/>
didn't find it. What we did find was Lake Michigan and the wonderful <br/>
beach there. On the way back over the sandy hill from the beach we <br/>
hear this over the loudspeaker: "Would the owner of the [my car] <br/>
please come back to your car? We would like to go home sometime <br/>
tonight." Oops! Well, I guess it was later than we thought. <br/>
So...which way did we come in at? That way took a half hour to get <br/>
here...maybe there is a faster route. Of course there was! We found <br/>
the park ranger shortly after his second comment about how "everyone <br/>
else figured out that it was time to go, so why couldn't you?" and <br/>
told him that we had gotten lost. He was nice after that. We then <br/>
traveled the hour and a half road back home to Rockford, completely <br/>
worn out from our day of letterboxing.<br/>

I checked this morning, and Right on Track in Harvard is indeed missing.<br/>
