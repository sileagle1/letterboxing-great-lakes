<br>
I need to apologize for not posting more information earlier, but here's what I can share at <br>
this time.<br>
<br>
I reserved one of the large (max-150) shelters at Pokagon State Park for Saturday, May 30, <br>
2009.  Pokagon is located in the NE corner of Indiana, just south the Indiana Toll Road (I-<br>
69) exit.  I posted the event at AQ last night - just as a Save-the-Date notice.  I plan to <br>
communicate most plans here, but the routine logistics will be posted there as well.<br>
<br>
If you are not familiar with Pokagon, you will be pleased with the amenities.  There are 9 <br>
trails, camping, swimming, boating, biking horse trails, camp store, etc.  There is also an <br>
Inn on site (for those of us that don't do tents).  There is a restaurant inside the park as <br>
well.<br>
<br>
There is a caching/letterbox permitting policy for all Indiana State Parks.  Due to the <br>
sensitive areas (several endangered species) within the park, the maximum number of <br>
permits is limited to six (6) and they are all currently taken.  The park interpreter has given <br>
me the okay to have event-day letterboxes that would not require the regular permit.<br>
<br>
I will be at Clear Lake the weekend before the event.  I am hoping to have the event boxes <br>
planted several days in advance of the event.  I have some ideas for box themes, and I will <br>
create a poll for the Event, and database for letterbox submissions later tonight.<br>
<br>
If you think you'd like to be involved in the planning, let me know.  I have many ideas <br>
already, but I'd love to delegate some things.<br>

Hello, Folks!<br>
<br>
I need to apologize for not posting more information earlier, but here's<br>
what I can share at<br>
this time.<br>
<br>
I reserved one of the large (max-150) shelters at Pokagon State Park for<br>
Saturday, May 30,<br>
2009. Pokagon is located in the NE corner of Indiana, just south the Indiana<br>

<br>
I posted the event at AQ, and some of you have started signing up.  Thanks.<br>
<br>
I tried to create a couple of databases here, but I think we've maxed out.  Here are some <br>
ideas to toss around until Spring Chick can free up some space.  I am struggling with an <br>
OFFICIAL event theme, so I am hoping you can inspire me and others with 3 or 4 ideas.  We <br>
can vote as soon as we get some workable ideas.  My thoughts for event boxes center <br>
around some of my favorite themes.  I want to incorporate each of the Great Lakes states, <br>
so with that in mind, I thought these could be used:<br>
<br>
Our favorite Great Lakes state parks -- The Conservation Movement -- Flora and Fauna of <br>
the Great Lakes -- American life in the 1920's and 1930's (Between the Wars) - I'm <br>
especially fond of the work done by WPA artists and artisans --Others? - please add your <br>
suggestions.<br>
<br>
The only idea that comes to my mind at the moment is "Save Our Parks" - not very <br>
glamorous, but in light of tightening budgets everywhere, it doesn't seem as weird as I <br>
once thought.<br>
<br>
I'd like a separate database for box submissions as soon as space permits.  The shelter <br>
house will accomodate 150 people, but I'd like to keep the boxes to 15-20 out in the wild.    <br>
Depending on your response to boxes, we may have just a couple of boxes in the shelter <br>
that will require some sort of mental challenge.  More on that later.<br>
<br>
At this time, I am going to ask that additional boxes not be brought to the event/shelter.  <br>
There will only be one shelter and space will be at a premium.  Personal travellers and <br>
LTC's  that you carry on your person are fine.  If you need further clarification, email me <br>
off-list.<br>
<br>
I am planning a bit cautiously at this point.  I will unveil some other activities for the day <br>
after I see the numbers.  The park is about 3 hours from my home, and I will be making a <br>
trip up there shortly to take pictures and get a better feel for the actual space.  I've been by <br>
it, but I want to count tables, check the grill size, the walking distance from the camp <br>
store and campgrounds, walk a few more trails, etc.  I'm not sure the cost of travel will be <br>
an issue and affect attendance this year.  My preference would be to not have a mob event.<br>
<br>
After we vote on the event theme, I will be asking someone to carve the event stamp.  I'm <br>
also interested in having an event shirt made.  More on that later too.  If you'd like to be <br>
considered for the event stamp, let me know.  I just know I must delegate that artistic <br>
endeavor.<br>
<br>
I hope to have an answer back shortly about extending the boxes' availability through <br>
Sunday.  <br>
<br>
It's getting late.  I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.<br>

here's what I can share at this time.  I reserved one of the large (max-<br>
150) shelters at Pokagon State Park for Saturday, May 30,  2009.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Pokagon is a GREAT state park--I can't decide if I like it the best or <br>
Starved Rock (in IL).  The inn has a lot of common space--there is a <br>
big room with lots of tables that people generally use for puzzles or <br>
games, but I'm sure we could convert that to stamping!  <br>
<br>
And the best part--for me at least--is birdwalks every Sunday <br>
morning  :~)<br>

anyone want to be the committee person in charge of potluck?  I am also not ashamed to <br>
say I'd be just as happy with a sack lunch and dinner at the restaurant in the Potawatomi <br>

<br>
Here is the date and location for the event - SATURDAY, MAY 30, 2009: Pokagon State <br>
Park!  I created a database for folks to sign up here, but if you want to sign up at Atlas <br>
Quest, that would be great too.  The maximum number allowed in the shelter is 150, and <br>
we have about 30 already signed up.  I put a couple of links in the notes at Atlas Quest.  <br>
As soon as I get an answer about allowing event boxes to remain for the weekend, I will <br>
post the answer here and at Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
Please look over my last posts and if you have a catchy, good idea for the Overall Event <br>
Theme, please submit your ideas.  I'd like to create a voting poll between Thanksgiving <br>
and mid-December.  I'm interested in making T-shirts with the event logo available as <br>
well.<br>

Speedsquare, we could help out on a somewhat limited level prior to the event, but could <br>

I believe there was mention in an earlier post about a theme tied to<br>
saving our parks.  I love that idea!  How about expanding that to be<br>
an overall "green" theme.  Saving our open spaces and parks are a<br>
major component of a healthy, sustainable environment so the earlier<br>
parks idea would fall nicely within that and it would open the theme<br>
up a bit so there would be plenty of room for some great box ideas. <br>
I'm not thinking of a catchy one-liner, theme name at the moment<br>
though...  <br>
