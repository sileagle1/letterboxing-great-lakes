<br/>
The new patches have arrived!  I had already received money and self-<br/>
addressed envelopes from several people, so the first 50 patches will <br/>
be in the mail tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
If you entered your name in the database on this message board with a <br/>
patch request, I will hold the patches for you until mid-January. <br/>
[Note: I deleted the database after I exported it to a spreadsheet to <br/>
track the requests.]  If I don't receive your money and envelope by <br/>
January 15th, I'll assume you changed your mind and will then make <br/>
the patches available to someone else.  If you didn't have your name <br/>
in the database, please contact me before sending any money, to be <br/>
sure I have enough patches to satisfy your request.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a link to see the final patch and get ordering info:<br/>

P.S.  Please include your trailname when you send your $ and envelope <br/>
so I know who you are.  Can the following people that already sent <br/>
money also send me a note with your trailname so I can cross you off <br/>
the list?  (Your patches will be mailed tomorrow, but since I didn't <br/>
recognize your "real name", I couldn't associate it with your trail <br/>
name).<br/>

I know, I know!  People trying to confuse me with aliases like <br/>
Kristin &amp; Charlotte!<br/>
<br/>
However you guys are also embedding in my mind the names of Twinkie &amp; <br/>

of yours...  Good luck tomorrow on the big day!!!<br/>

Christmas Concert, and thinking, "Why do I do this to myself?"  The <br/>
Preschoolers and Kindergarten sing louder than the 8th graders (and <br/>
they can read and have the song book in their hands).  My head is <br/>
throbbing, and my phone rings.  It's the husband.  Can't be good if <br/>
he's calling in the middle of the day.<br/>

"What?"  I snap!<br/>
"I picked up the mail"<br/>
"So?" <br/>
"Our patches are here"  <br/>
<br/>
Patches?  OOOOOhhh, PATCHES!  I smile.  The children keep singing, <br/>
and all I am thinking is where I am placing the patches and will I <br/>
get in trouble if I end practice a little early.  Nope.  We have <br/>
practice again Monday!  I sent them back to class, took an Excedrin <br/>
with Pepsi - it was that bad, and went home and looked at my <br/>
beautiful patches.  Headache gone!<br/>

&gt; I am sitting at my daughter's school today, having rehearsals for the<br/>
&gt; Christmas Concert, and thinking, "Why do I do this to myself?" The<br/>
&gt; Preschoolers and Kindergarten sing louder than the 8th graders (and<br/>
&gt; they can read and have the song book in their hands). My head is<br/>
&gt; throbbing, and my phone rings. It's the husband. Can't be good if<br/>
&gt; he's calling in the middle of the day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "What?" I snap!<br/>
&gt; "I picked up the mail"<br/>
&gt; "So?"<br/>
&gt; "Our patches are here"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Patches? OOOOOhhh, PATCHES! I smile. The children keep singing,<br/>
&gt; and all I am thinking is where I am placing the patches and will I<br/>
&gt; get in trouble if I end practice a little early. Nope. We have<br/>
&gt; practice again Monday! I sent them back to class, took an Excedrin<br/>
&gt; with Pepsi - it was that bad, and went home and looked at my<br/>
&gt; beautiful patches. Headache gone!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The new patches have arrived! I had already received money and<br/>
&gt; self-<br/>
&gt; &gt; addressed envelopes from several people, so the first 50 patches<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; be in the mail tomorrow.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you entered your name in the database on this message board with<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; patch request, I will hold the patches for you until mid-January.<br/>
&gt; &gt; [Note: I deleted the database after I exported it to a spreadsheet<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; track the requests.] If I don't receive your money and envelope by<br/>
&gt; &gt; January 15th, I'll assume you changed your mind and will then make<br/>
&gt; &gt; the patches available to someone else. If you didn't have your<br/>
&gt; name<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the database, please contact me before sending any money, to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure I have enough patches to satisfy your request.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Here's a link to see the final patch and get ordering info:<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (Please don't forget the self-addressed envelope)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wisconsin Hiker<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S. Please include your trailname when you send your $ and<br/>
&gt; envelope<br/>
&gt; &gt; so I know who you are. Can the following people that already sent<br/>
&gt; &gt; money also send me a note with your trailname so I can cross you<br/>
&gt; off<br/>
&gt; &gt; the list? (Your patches will be mailed tomorrow, but since I<br/>
&gt; didn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; recognize your "real name", I couldn't associate it with your trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; name).<br/>
