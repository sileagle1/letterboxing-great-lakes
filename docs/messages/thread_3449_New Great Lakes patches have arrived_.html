                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br>
<br>
The new patches have arrived!  I had already received money and self-<br>
addressed envelopes from several people, so the first 50 patches will <br>
be in the mail tomorrow.<br>
<br>
If you entered your name in the database on this message board with a <br>
patch request, I will hold the patches for you until mid-January. <br>
[Note: I deleted the database after I exported it to a spreadsheet to <br>
track the requests.]  If I don't receive your money and envelope by <br>
January 15th, I'll assume you changed your mind and will then make <br>
the patches available to someone else.  If you didn't have your name <br>
in the database, please contact me before sending any money, to be <br>
sure I have enough patches to satisfy your request.<br>
<br>
Here's a link to see the final patch and get ordering info:<br>
http://letterboxing.homestead.com/greatlakespatch.html<br>
<br>
(Please don't forget the self-addressed envelope)<br>
<br>
<br>
Wisconsin Hiker<br>
<br>
P.S.  Please include your trailname when you send your $ and envelope <br>
so I know who you are.  Can the following people that already sent <br>
money also send me a note with your trailname so I can cross you off <br>
the list?  (Your patches will be mailed tomorrow, but since I didn't <br>
recognize your "real name", I couldn't associate it with your trail <br>
name).<br>

I know, I know!  People trying to confuse me with aliases like <br>
Kristin & Charlotte!<br>
<br>
However you guys are also embedding in my mind the names of Twinkie & <br>
DingDong.  I might never remember any other name for those new babies <br>
of yours...  Good luck tomorrow on the big day!!!<br>
