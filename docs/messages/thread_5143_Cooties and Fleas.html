check this out!  I read about 'Fleas' on AQ.  <br>
<br>
"A flea is a non-restricted form of a cootie. You can plant it in <br>
letterboxes as if it was a hitchhiker, or on a person like a <br>
traditional cootie. You can log in with a thumbprint signature or use <br>
your signature stamps."  <br>
<br>
So now, there's the possibility of a non-restrictive flea epidemic too.<br>
 <br>
I'm not 100% sure but if you find a flea in a letterbox, do you have to <br>
take it and move it like a HH? Or, I guess you could leave it there for <br>
future unsuspecting victims. LOL!  As always it would depend on the <br>
labeling instructions.  <br>
