until a few years ago (and no, I didn't participate!).  A ski club<br/>

You know where I'm going with this....<br/>

Why not letterboxes!?  <br/>
<br/>
I started out with Sit...Sip...Stay...Box located at the Hollywood<br/>
stop on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe line.  I added Come Grumpy,<br/>
Go Happy  near the Riverside stop.  I've spoken with a few local<br/>
boxers already about placing some, and now I'm posting the idea for<br/>
all to play along.  Lord knows there are enough railroad tracks in the<br/>
Chicago area...heck, you can even take a commuter up to Kenosha!  Just<br/>
think...all the boxing you could do on a $5 unlimited weekend pass!<br/>
<br/>
I created a folder in the files section that contains a document with<br/>
introductory guidelines.  I also posted pics of the contents of the<br/>
two boxes I mentioned above to help give you an idea if you want to<br/>
look at them. Since these boxes will all be placed with the blessing<br/>
of the propietor of an eating establishment, the pics can also help<br/>
you explain to them what you want to do.<br/>
<br/>
I mention in the document a database to record all these boxes in one<br/>
place, but I see the database section is restricted.  SpringChick or<br/>
Dragon, can one of you start a database to the specs listed, or open<br/>
up the database so I can set it up?  It would help us to see what<br/>
stations are taken in a table format.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, take a look and come join the game!  With all the stops<br/>
available, we may end up placing enough boxes to make Connecticut<br/>
stand up and take notice!!<br/>

Here in Ohio there's a city called Lakewood.  It's one of those older cities where there's literally almost a bar on every corner, esp. on Madison Avenue, since the city came to be around the time when everyone still walked everywhere and families maybe had one car.  I've never done the Madison Crawl, although when planning my friend's bachelorette party last year I wanted us to do that, since she lives in Lakewood and had talked about wanting to be able to say she's done the Crawl.  She wanted to see strippers instead, though, so we went to the Flats.  <br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ooooh, what a fun idea for winter boxing!  We often take the train to <br/>
Chicago for a day of shopping and sightseeing around the Christmas <br/>
holidays.  While looking out the window at the passing towns I always <br/>
wonder what's out there that we're whizzing by...<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to tackle the Kenosha stop and I work in Antioch so I'll <br/>
check that out, too.  Seems like there doesn't need to be any limit <br/>
on how many boxes are located at each stop, does there?  I mean, <br/>
other than being limited by the number of good restaurants, shoppes, <br/>
etc. within walking distance.<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like lots of fun!  Count me in!  I'll keep you all <br/>
updated on my progress as I search for the best ice cream shoppes, <br/>
sub shops, coffee shops... mmmmm!<br/>

years experience of one hour and forty-five minute rides), so I hope there'll be <br/>
some intermediary boxes too.  Harvard does have the advantage of having <br/>
one other box in easy walking distance and another box about one mile from <br/>
the station (a great way to see some victorian houses).  Of course, you can <br/>
always drive, too!<br/>
