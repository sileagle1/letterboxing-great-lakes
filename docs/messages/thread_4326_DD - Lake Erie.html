been unable to find and learned that 4 of them have been <br/>
repaired/replaced or clues revised since I was there and the 5th the <br/>
owner said right here that it was in need of repaired.. Woohoo that <br/>
means I'm really not just missing them they might have been missing! <br/>
bad for the owner but makes me feel better about my ability to <br/>
letterbox as a newby... Anyway it looks like the Lake Erie box was <br/>
replaced on Saturday. I'll be going out there on Sunday to look for it <br/>
if it's a nice day for swimming.<br/>
