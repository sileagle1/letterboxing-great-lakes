                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been sitting here for the past 4 or 5 days, wondering why there <br>
were hardly any messages being posted to the group.  My goodness, there <br>
was the gathering last week and only one or two posts about it--what's <br>
going on?  Then SpringChick started the TOTW about Christmas carols--<br>
which I thought would be popular and there weren't any posts popping up <br>
on my screen.  Hey, and I know I posted a reply and I don't see it <br>
anywhere.  What is going on??<br>
<br>
Then I looked at my screen some more and saw that I had somehow <br>
switched my messages from "list as individual messages" (where I can <br>
see all the new replies to posts) to "group by topic" (where you have <br>
to explore to find the new replies).  So I've spent the last half hour <br>
or so getting caught up on everyone's posts.<br>

Did you also change your preferences back to "individual messages"?  <br>
Just curious...<br>

Yes, I switched back to individual messages and can see all those new <br>
posts waiting to be read.  At least I'll know what to do the next <br>
time I hit the "group by topic" button by mistake.<br>

I noticed something today that I just started using.  Maybe it was <br>
there before, but I don't think so....<br>
<br>
I usually just click on "reply" in my email application to reply to a <br>
message group posting.  But for the last several weeks I've noticed <br>
(and so have others) that it may take HOURS for the message to <br>
appear.  I therefore started going to the message group, getting to <br>
the post I wanted to reply to, and then replying from there, rather <br>
than my email program.  <br>
<br>
Today I noticed that at the bottom of each message that not only are <br>
there links to go to various areas of the LbGLK group, but also a <br>
link entitled "Reply (via web post)".  This gets me directly to the <br>
right spot to do a reply that will probably show up in minutes rather <br>
than hours.<br>
