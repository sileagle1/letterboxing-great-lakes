                    <div class="plaintext-content">The fabric camo tape is used on archery bows and gun stocks.  It's available where these might be sold (gun stores, sporting goods stores, etc.)  It's MUCH more realistic than any plastic type tape (even the duct tape) and because it's a cloth, it picks up a bit of dirt in the weave making it even more invisible.<br>

I put this on all my boxes and I think it helped to greatly reduce the number of missing boxes due to careless re-hiding.  I actually found one right out in the open, not covered at all, but didn't realize that it was my box till I was right on top of it!  It comes in different patterns and styles too, to match the local flora.  It's stretchy, easy to cut and sticks really well!  I'm sure you could order it on-line at a place like Bass Pro Shops if you didn't have a store near you.Chris Puls "Scoutdogs"Troop Leader for Dog Scout Troop 107 (OH-KY-IN tri-state) www.DogScoutTroop107.comCaptain of the Dearborn County Animal Response Teamwww.TriStateCART.com My boys: www.Dog-GoneHappy.itgo.comMy book: www.SafeHomeVisits.comMy art: www.PictureTrail.com/scoutdogs <br>
