just wanted to draw your attention to a bunch of stuff I uploaded to <br/>
the FILES section of this group yesterday -- the 'About <br/>
Letterboxing' info sheet, sample FF Certificate (feel free to add <br/>
additional formats), labels of various sizes for the outside of <br/>
boxes and inside of log books, etc.  All of these are in MS-Word <br/>
format so that you can edit them.  The Infosheet is also in .PDF <br/>
format as that does not require editing.  If you need a different <br/>
format, e-mail me off list and I can probably convert it for you.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to use and customize these as you wish!<br/>
