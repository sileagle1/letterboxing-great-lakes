  Ahhh, so it is magnet - "backed"?  I was having visions of baking some kind<br>
  of dough imprinted by a rubber stamp, and not quite sure how that then<br>
  became the stamp.  Technically it would not be a find per LbNA guidelines as<br>
  there is no logbook (just like finding a box with a missing stamp is<br>
  technically not a find).  From the LbNA FAQ:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  "a letterbox can only count as Found when the letterboxer obtains a stamp<br>
  image from any stamp associated with that box, and their personal stamp<br>
  image has been imprinted (or attempted) in the logbook or other part of the<br>
  box."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  I guess if you stamped your personal stamp image onto the back of the rubber<br>
  stamp itself you could count it, but that would get kind of messy after a<br>
  while if everyone did that ;-)  But, a lot of people don't keep track, and<br>
  even those who do, it comes down to whatever each person calls a find.<br>
