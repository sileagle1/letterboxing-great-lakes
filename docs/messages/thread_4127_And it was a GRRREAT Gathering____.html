                    <div class="plaintext-content">I will second Horse Trader and Safari Man's motion in recognizing the <br/>
incredible effort our hosts put forth to insure a fantastic event!  Many <br/>
thanks to you both and to your two children, who no doubt, helped in <br/>
many ways as well! <br/>
<br/>
I also want to tack on a thank you to Rosmarinus for putting together <br/>
the Friday night Sock Hop and reserving the church for the several <br/>
pre-event-event.  Your organizational efforts were very noticed there as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I very much enjoyed the camping part and having a chance to <br/>
chat in a very relaxed fashion.  I had the best camping neighbors (both <br/>
previously known and new) anyone could ask for. <br/>
<br/>
I think the Great Lakes group has some stunningly talented and creative <br/>
carvers too!  What a wonderful bunch of stamps we all got to add to our <br/>
collections!<br/>
<br/>
Last, some of us commented later in the day on Saturday how wonderful it <br/>
was to take note that all these kids had a fantastic time playing, <br/>
finding all the many wonderful boxes Hales Angels made for them, <br/>
noticing them getting along so very well together having just met and <br/>
for being so polite around adults.  All of us adults had such a great <br/>
time meeting each other or reuniting and even all the dogs had a great <br/>
time together as well!  It just seemed like life got suspended for one <br/>
wonderful day!<br/>
<br/>
My thanks to all who contributed in so many ways to the Columbus <br/>
Cluez-In Event!<br/>

Hi everyone!  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Safari Man (whom I was very glad to meet, by the way) that the gathering was a<br/>
blast!  We had never been to one before, having just started boxing in November, and frankly, we were a bit nervous...not knowing exactly what we had gotten ourselves into!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you, I have been bragging about you folks to anyone who'll listen for the past two days!  I've never met a nicer group of people...or seen a BIGGER potluck!  (and I come from a BIG potluck family!)  :)  The kids had a great time as well, especially my friend's youngest, who kept proclaiming the Disney Series as "so easy"!  She's 8 and feeling pretty proud of herself!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of potluck, does anyone know who made the awesome salsa with all of the corn and tomatoes in it?  I'd love to have the recipe!  <br/>
We are excited to start placing some boxes of our own soon, so be on the lookout for Huntin' Dogs and Busy Bees!  See you on the trail...and hopefully at another gathering!<br/>
<br/>

  We left early and had to miss the Bag Piping!!  Good thing we didn't know this would happen or may have been a family feud to get to stay!!<br/>
