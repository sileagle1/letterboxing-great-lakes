I'm finding that i'm enjoying planting more and more.<br/>
My stamp carving ability is improving with each and<br/>
every stamp. I find myself keeping an eye out for box<br/>
materials every time I go shopping. I've been debating<br/>
on which is the better carving medium: the pink stuff<br/>
or the Staedlater carving block. I've used both, and<br/>
both have their merits. <br/>
Last weekend I bought the wrong size containers for<br/>
the Kokiwanee series...so in my head i'm thinking,<br/>
"These boxes MUST be used!" I'm planning on planting a<br/>
few boxes during my Ohio trip next week...one in<br/>
Lorain County (box finished, just need to find a good<br/>
spot where finders and myself won't get shot) and<br/>
probably one in Ashtabula County near the Pymatuning<br/>
Reservoir. <br/>
<br/>
I finally got a chance to read the Time article. My<br/>
co-worker brought in a pile of magazines for the lobby<br/>
and the issue with the article was in it. I thought it<br/>
was a little cheesy. In my opinion, it did not capture<br/>
the spirit of this activity AT ALL. It made it seem<br/>
so...surburban...which it is NOT. The article really<br/>
didn't capture the artistic angle as well as it could<br/>
have. No WONDER everyone was concerned. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I deleted a letter from my trail name...so now<br/>
i'm just Armadillo Jo, cause it just goes with the<br/>
flow....! When I was planting boxes at my old Girl<br/>
Scout camp this weekend, I remembered my trail name<br/>
for camp...Scooby. Scooby. The most un-original trail<br/>
name ever! Only given because I happened to have a<br/>
Scooby-doo hat on during orientation. My best friend<br/>
was Pebbles because she had red hair. I guess there<br/>
were some cartoon junkies at our camp that year!<br/>
Armadillo Jo is just more ME! What are some of your<br/>
previous trail names?<br/>
