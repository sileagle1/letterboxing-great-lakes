                    <div class="plaintext-content">According to last count, MI needed boxes in 12 counties and WI stood <br/>
at 11 to go.  But, hold on!  A technicality has been brought to my <br/>
attention, which puts Michigan neck and neck with Wisconsin (thanks <br/>
Moonduck).<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the Pink Cadillac box (yes, belonging to yours truly), <br/>
which was listed on LbNA as being in Wexford County, is actually <br/>
located in Missaukee County.  I knew this when I originally listed <br/>
it and chose to list it otherwise to help in identifying the city <br/>
(it is a mystery box that gives county but not city), but had <br/>
forgotten about this discrepancy when compiling the list of first in <br/>
the county boxes.<br/>
<br/>
So for purposes of accuracy in identifying the first box in each <br/>
county, and of course to inch MI one box closer to the finish line, <br/>
I have corrected the LbNA listing for Pink Cadillac to be Missaukee <br/>
County, which as luck would have it, was one of the Michigan boxless <br/>
counties! So this brings the Michigan count down to 11.<br/>

WooHoo!!  Let's go Michigan! (Wow, that's hard for a MSU girl to say!)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, has anyone asked the owner of the CCC Bridge box to correct the <br/>
county listing on LBNA?<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiosity, how long does it typically take for the maps <br/>
at LBNA to be updated with covered counties?<br/>

  I don't know how long the LbNA site takes to update, but I've taken a<br/>
  page from WI Hiker and copied what she has been doing for some time;<br/>
  which is to keep her own map and do her own updates. <br/>
