A remainder that today is the firearm deer opener in Michigan and much of the public land visited by letterboxers will be open to hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Wearing orange vest/hat is recommended as well as avoiding white over black or white over brown clothes. Before heading out (pre) dawn and dusk are the hours when deer and hunters are most active.<br/>
<br/>
In some places (State parks) there are safety areas (where hunting is not allowed), please remember to take caution even in those places.<br/>
<br/>
Also, consider that the risk of deer-related car accidents is higher this time of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is still a lot of boxing to do this time of the year, right?<br/>
<br/>
so let's do it safe!<br/>
good boxing to you all!<br/>
JP<br/>
