                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I felt funny for a while continuing to require people to email me to obtain the rest of the clues to find my boxes, but I guess it's paid off.  Knock on that-tree-with-a-nice-little-hidey-hole-in-it, but my losses have been down since I've been doing that for the last couple years.  And when it is obvious from a request that the person is a newbie, I make sure I give them a few extra pointers.  It's also a great way to get to know people better and make new letterboxing friends (just to name one example - I learned Nitrocat lives near the hiding place of Duane's Motel, and I was able to recruit her for a rescue and replant mission - something I wouldn't have necessarily been able to do if we hadn't learned about each other via our off-list chats!)  But I'm digressing (as usual!).<br>
 <br>
Contacting Family Fun might not be a bad idea.  Remember this isn't the first time they published a letter on the topic, and won't be the last.  Doesn't it seem to be every two years they print one?  Another point to remember (in their defense) is that they did interview a seasoned letterboxer, Oldpatterns, who from my dealings with her on postals and through the LetterboxingGS list, seems to be a conscientious boxer.  Space considerations in such publications always play a key role.  Raise your hands out there if you were interviewed by a certain Time Magazine reporter in 2004.  Okay, yes I see them all.  Now raise them if your sage words were quoted.  Right.  Mine weren't either (and I wasn't nearly as sage then as I am now!).<br>
 <br>
I don't know what point I'm really trying to make here.  PGranola, thank you for your initial post.  Very eloquently put, as were the many responses that followed.  Obviously a topic that needed to be brought to light.<br>
 <br>
That being said, I placed another little box today.  You know where my friends can find the clues - without asking me!<br>
