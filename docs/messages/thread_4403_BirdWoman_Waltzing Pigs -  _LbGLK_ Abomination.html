Well, I'm not a geocacher. I'm truly a letterboxers and I'm still in love <br/>
with finding hand carved stamps and creative clues. But if this book was <br/>
about letterboxing instead, and the clue leads you to the body, my only <br/>
concern would be that the stamp was still at the scene. LOL! It's all about <br/>
finding the stamps! Tip: Wear rubber gloves and don't leave your signature <br/>
stamp behind, or the police will want to question you. Try to explain this <br/>
hobby to the police and they'll lock you up.<br/>
<br/>
I like mysteries and thrillers. I might check out this book. Thanks for the <br/>
information.<br/>

  I was reading "Book Page"--a book review magazine given away at our <br/>
  library. The tagline for a book called "Abomination" read: Somewhere <br/>
  in a secret geocache lies the unspeakable clue. Apparently, the book <br/>
  is about a serial killer who posts clues about his next victim on a <br/>
  geocaching website. From reading a review, it also seems that the <br/>
  killer uploads the GPS coordinates of the dead body on the geocaching <br/>
  website as well. Certainly wouldn't want to be looking for that <br/>

It is also by choice, not by accident, that you seldom, if ever, hear a report or read a newspaper account about the 'crazed fan' who murdered John Lennon and hear his actual name reported.   It's was out of respect for John Lennon that his many, many, fans (some in the news reporting industry) have personally elected not to mention that person's name in order to deny him the attention/fame he sought.  Sad night, sick person, and John is gone.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of other famous people buried in cemeteries worth mentioning.  However, cemeteries are tricky places to plant a letterbox because they are private property, sort of, and letterboxing is somewhat restricted in burial areas, etc.  I'm working on a box now, but it won't be exactly 'in' the cemetery, but very close.  <br/>

  Personally, I am over cemetery letterboxes.  We have an abuse problem in my area<br/>
with a significant number of boxes being planted in cemeteries (planters, learn how to spell the word! If you can't spell cemetery, you shouldn't be planting boxes there).  Often in my area, the stamp does not correspond to anyone or anything in the cemetery, what was the point of the exercise then?  Hunting in the cemetery also has a sense of morbidness and infringment of personal space running all over a place of peace.  I have encountered grieving visitors at graves close to the letterbox locations, how nice of me to be rummaging in the bushes as you're wailing away over there!  There are plenty of places to plant boxes, planters just need to get creative.  To this on going store bought or hand carved debate- There really is no excuse to ever use a store bought stamp.  To carve a stamp is neither difficult nor expensive to produce and like anything, requires some practice to master-it is not rocket science people!  It requires patience but minimal artistic ability, if<br/>
 you can trace a line, you can carve a stamp.  Print an image, transfer it to the carving medium, then trace the lines and remove the unwanted parts-come on, get with it, make the effort and quit whinning!  Like anything, you can do anything you put your mind to so use it and excercise it!  You might surprise yourself at your attempts.  TRY!!!<br/>
