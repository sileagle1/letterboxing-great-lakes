                    <div class="plaintext-content">  The clues for the Gryphon Letter Box that we had placed for the Great Lakes Gathering asked those seeking the Gryphon to guess which way to go at the last trail intersection.  Anyone who went to the right found the Gryphon.  Anyone who went to the left found the Winged Panther Letterbox.<br>
   <br>
  There were no clues for the Winged Panther so I wasnt expecting it to see much activity.  But over the past few weeks one party invitation and three separate hitch hikers have cycled through the box and the log book is two thirds full.  I guess not much gets past you guys!<br>
   <br>
  As of this afternoon the Winged Panther has been removed from its hiding place and the clues for the Gryphon have been added to LBNA without the need to guess at the last intersection.  If anyone intends to look for the Gryphon please use the updated clues and not the clues from the gathering.  And if there is anyone who is interested in the Winged Panther, it will be making other appearances, but it may not have any clues. : )<br>

trying to find the stinking Gryhon box. (without success ... bummer!)<br>
<br>
However, we were succesful with the un-clued Panther (way cool stamp<br>
BTW!!) box; for which we are MOST grateful. (Can you imagine the angst<br>
of working the clues WITHOUT getting SOME kind of reward!?!?!?  - Oh<br>
yeah, you're all letterboxers, so of course you can! lol)<br>
<br>
It is still beyond ~ME~ where that darn Gryohon was at.<br>
