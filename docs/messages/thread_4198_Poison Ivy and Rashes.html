Thanks for reminding me about all the poison ivy that I may encounter.  I seem to forget that itchy stuff is out there just waiting for us.  <br>
<br>
Over the weekend, an opportunity presented itself and I was off in search of some new places to hide letterboxes.  I didn't have my hiking shoes or socks, but that didn't stop me.  I was wearing CROCS flip flops; comfortable but certainly no protection from poison ivy.  If I didn't have a trail name already, I'm sure people would call me FLIP FLOP.   I try to be careful and look where I'm stepping.  So far, I'm not itching so I guess I've been able to identify what I'm hiking through or I'm just very lucky.  <br>
<br>
Hope Martini Man's itching subsides soon.  OUCH OUCH OUCH!  <br>

  Oh, I forgot to ask - is there still SO MUCH poison ivy in those parks?? We never had rashes from poison ivy or poison oak until we started letterboxing. Of course Martini Man is itching again after our trip to VA this weekend....<br>
