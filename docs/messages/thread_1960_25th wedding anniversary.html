this past week to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary, Tonto and <br/>
I ended up in Brown County Indiana!...A far cry from our other <br/>
choices of Maine, Asheville, Tuscon or Banff....that is another <br/>
story... suffice to say, time became an issue...But, we gratefully <br/>
report that all turned out to be a perfect time!  The other <br/>
destinations are still on the list - Afterall, we can celebrate all <br/>
year!  Right?<br/>
<br/>
The weather was superb! Lots of great hiking, memorable meals, <br/>
quaint accomodations and yes, even a few letterboxes!  <br/>
We thought we had officially found our 200th letterbox on CMoon's <br/>
Haunted Trail earlier in October, but upon further inspection we <br/>
were on 199!  So, on our anniversary trip passing through <br/>
McCormick's Creek State Park (BTW another awesome Indiana SP!) we <br/>
found our official 200th, "Changing Foliage," by the BrownKnight - a <br/>
fitting image of a tree with a lovers heart &amp; arrow carved into the <br/>
trunk...AHHHHH! For those of you that do the happy-dance at these <br/>
milestones - we felt it fitting to happy-smooch!<br/>
<br/>
One of the most exciting finds was the "Connecticut State Seal" in <br/>
Bloomington, IN planted by the Dawnlanders of CT.  They had given <br/>
the box to Mark &amp; Sue Pepe to take with them on their trip to <br/>
Dartmoor and somehow it is now permanently planted in Bloomington! <br/>
(Armadillo Jo, what were they thinking?) As we read the logbook, it <br/>
once again dawned on us how we get such a happy feeling when we come <br/>
across a letterboxer's signature stamp that you have met and spent <br/>
time with. It is amazing how a little inked image on a page can <br/>
conjure up such pleasant memories....(Maybe 2Bentrider should delve <br/>
into that psychological phenomenon in her disertation!)   <br/>
<br/>
At the same park in Bloomington we found "The Wise Old."  How ironic <br/>
that as we were leaving the box and heading back to the parking lot, <br/>
a Great Horned owl flew barely over our heads!  We screeched in <br/>
delight over that great anniversary gift!  <br/>
<br/>
It all was a little earth shattering for Tiptoe (a Boilermaker <br/>
through and through) to be spending her 25th in IU country <br/>
thoroughly enjoying herself and finding such great boxes! <br/>
<br/>
And to top off the LBing highlights, we commemorated our 25th <br/>
wedding anniversary by planting a new letterbox with the added bonus <br/>
of marriage advice! - "A Froggie Went A-Courtin'," at Brown County <br/>
State Park on Nov. 1st.  I just listed the clues on LBNA tonight. <br/>
So, all you Hoosiers get ye down there!<br/>

CONGRATS on the Silver Anniversary, it's an inspiration these days to<br/>

Loved the Owl story because Bindle Bum and I share a special (private)<br/>
thing that involves different birds.<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>
