  Fungus Woman's poor little pickle is hanging on her Christmas tree and no one has found it yet. What is sadder is that maybe no one is looking for it...yet. But with all this Polish food chat, you think someone may have eaten the pickle? Well, here's another sad story, someone may have decided to eat some goose too. My small cement goose is missing from my front porch! At first, I thought that it was shoved up with the snow and tossed onto the front lawn. But the snow is thawing and no goose. BOO HOO!!! <br/>

<br/>
The temps on Sunday were in the 40s, so the larger piles of shoveled snow melted down.  <br/>
Then, I saw him....my goose!  He was laying on his side with his little head poking out of the snow.  <br/>
Now, my little goose is recovering nicely from the trauma, no broken parts, just a little cold<br/>
from being shoveled up and buried in snow for several days.  <br/>
It's sort of funny how attached you get to something on your porch that is always there to greet<br/>
you when you come home, and then suddenly one day, it's gone.  <br/>
<br/>
Beetle's goose has been found, but the other question remains...has anyone found Fungus Woman's<br/>
pickle?  I bet she hid it very well.  <br/>
