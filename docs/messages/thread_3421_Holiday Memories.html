                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have a traditional Polish Vigil dinner (see below) every year, but I haven't heard of a Winkie.  And I LOVE Halupki (as long as I don't have to make them or eat the cabbage :-)  We don't think of that as a holiday food though, those can be eaten anytime someone has the energy to make them :-)  Speaking of which, it's been WAY too long since I had some!  Oh mother..... I know what I want for dinner when I come visit :-) <why "sure!="" answer="" be="" do="" have="" her="" i="" if="" make="" suspicion="" the="" them!"="" will="" you=""><br/>
<br/>
Speaking of vigil dinner, here's what I sent to another list when asked "What are your fondest holiday memories?"<br/>
<br/>
My Christmas Memories are from my childhood and some still happen to this day.  I recall getting together with my whole family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.) at my grandmothers house on Christmas Eve. She would bake and cook all day and the house always smelled so good!  The adults would talk while the kids ran around the house and played.  We would all help set out the food including a piece of Oplatek on each plate.  This is like the Catholic host, very thin and crisp, with images of the Nativity, the Christ Child with His mother, and Bethlehem on it.  It is shared with the family pets too, who were the first to see the Christ child. There is always an extra place setting at the table so that any last minute visitors would feel welcome. We would gather around the huge handmade table, with handmade chairs (my grandfather was an artist with wood!)  with the white tablecloth decorated with hand embroidered, traditional polish designs. My grandfather would propose a toast and we would all clink glasses.  Then we would each take our oplatek, turn to the person next to us and wish them a Merry Christmas.  Each person would break off a piece of the other person's oplatek, eat it and then give the person a hug and a kiss on the cheek (or lips for couples.)  Each person worked their way around the table until each person had shared their oplatk. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then the feast began.  It was a traditional Polish Christmas dinner (we call it a vigil diner) and my mom still cooks this every Christmas!  It always includes these 12 items and only these items:  Fish, noodles, pierogi, bread, butter (usually in the shape of a lamb), mashed potatoes, cooked wheat, boiled prunes, a vegetable, wine (water and soft drinks too), salt and pepper.  The 12 items symbolize the twelve apostles and 12 months of the year.  It is served on the best plates with the best silverware, but depending on the number of people, that didn't always mean everyone had china and real silver J<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After we all stuff ourselves and have warm conversation (I am so thankful for how close my family is and how well everyone gets along) we then have dessert (if we have room!)  My grandmother and now my mother always makes SO MANY desserts!  In our house to this day, our meals are not done till the dessert is eaten. J Once everyone was fully stuffed, all the kids had to help with clean up before the presents could come out.  Not sure if this is part of the Polish tradition, but it's been our family's tradition ever since I can recall J  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once everything is cleaned up, the family gathers around the Christmas tree to exchange gifts.  Usually, one person is designated to hand out the gifts one at a time.  After the person with the gift has opened their present, showed it around and thanked the giver, the next person gets their gift until all the presents are given out.  The young kids got sent to bed early so Santa could come during the night, but now there are very few young kids so mostly we all stay up late and talk.  Eventually everyone heads home (or to the hotel now, since the family is spread out across the U.S.)  For the young kids, they always find a special present from Santa under the tree when they wake up on Christmas morning (or when they get back to my parent's house) and their stockings are filled too.  Christmas day is spent in satisfied relaxation, with everyone enjoying what they got the night before (or that morning.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a very special holiday for me and is often the only time I get to see some of the family.  Over the years, fewer and fewer of the family have been getting together because of age and the difficulty with travel.  My grandmother is no longer with us and my grandfather is in a nursing home in FL where my Aunt and Uncle spend Christmas with him (&amp; visit him almost every day.)  My cousins are all very busy with their jobs, families and lives so they are rarely able to get together.  But I am always thankful for any time I get to spend with my family, regardless of the day.  This year, I will likely pack up the dogs and hubby and stay at my parents house from the 21st till after the 1st.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all the most peaceful of holidays this season.<br/>

was that you were supposed to break wafers oldest to<br/>
youngest, with the oldest &amp; second oldest members of<br/>
the family starting, but there were always so many of<br/>
us that by the end it was just a lot of "Merry<br/>

you yet??"<br/>
