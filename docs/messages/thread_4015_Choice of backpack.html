<br/>
I found an Eastport messenger bag at Walmart for about $12.  It has <br/>
one section with all sorts of pouches that I can put our markers and <br/>
personal stamps in (the flap of the bag folds over this).  Plus it <br/>
has a pouch for a water bottle and 5-6 different zippered pockets to <br/>
stash various things--I just have to remember which pocket to look <br/>
in!  It's quite a bit bigger(wider) than my old backpack--but now I <br/>
have plenty of room for a jacket, snacks for everyone, camera, <br/>
binoculars and bird books. Not exactly traveling light :~)  Now I <br/>
just have to get used to the solo strap of the messenger bag.<br/>
<br/>
Just a note on boxing with kids.  A year or so ago, I got smaller <br/>
backpacks for each of the kids--enough room for their logbook, <br/>
snacks, jacket, etc.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there...<br/>
<br/>
How old are your kids? I would suggest that you get each of them a  <br/>
backpack of their own!<br/>
<br/>
Many 2-year-olds, even, are eager to act like "a big kid" and carry  <br/>
their own pack. There are many kids packs out there: My son had a  <br/>
"Thomas The Tank Engine" pack that was small enough to fit him at age  <br/>
2.5 and he carried his bottle of water and some Kleenex packs in it  <br/>
when we went on hikes! Now he's 5, and he still uses the same pack  <br/>
but likes to use his older brother's backpack too (it looks like a  <br/>
"big kid's" backback, he says!) and carries any number of things -- I  <br/>
do however keep it limited to the light stuff. My older boys can  <br/>
carry much more, of course. Spread out among all of us, no one ever  <br/>
has too heavy a load and it is lots of fun to all help out, too!<br/>
<br/>
I myself use a backpack that has lots of outside pockets and two big  <br/>
interior pockets. I find I use ALL the outside pockets, since they  <br/>
are so easy to access while on the trail: Keys, cell phone, mini- <br/>
binoculars, bird seed, and two bottles of water make my list of  <br/>
"Outside Pocket Stuff." Also I'll roll up any current clues I'm using  <br/>
and stick them in an outside pocket.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of my stuff goes inside my pack: Letterboxing journal, log- <br/>
book, and stamps and ink. I also have a big wet-bag in my backpack  <br/>
(it came with the pack, but a 2.5 gallon zip lock would serve the  <br/>
same purpose) that we use mostly for we garbage of all sorts; wipes,  <br/>
juice boxes, wet sox, etc. until we can properly dispose of the stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of this helps when you're making your pack selection!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for your suggestions PennyPenny. I have 2 10 year olds and a 4 <br/>
year old. When we first started letterboxing I had the older two <br/>
carry their own bags, but then it turned into "Mom, will you carry <br/>
it? I'm tired!!" So eventually I ended up with all their junk too. <br/>
I'm just tired of having to dig to the bottom of the bag everytime I <br/>
need something. <br/>
I will definitely look for something with more pockets. I was just <br/>
wondering if there was a specific hiking pack or something that had <br/>
LOTS of pockets; like a photography bag or something, but smaller. <br/>
Hmmm...maybe I'll just MAKE THEM carry their own : )<br/>
Thank you everyone for your suggestions.<br/>

Thanks so much for the link to the hiking pack. I am really <br/>
interested in this one, especially because of the stool. And you're <br/>
right, that is a decent price. Thanks again. <br/>
