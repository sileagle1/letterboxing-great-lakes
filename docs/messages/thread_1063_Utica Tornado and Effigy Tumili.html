Sorry this late, but for those of you interested, The Weather Channel <br/>
will be airing the story of the Utica tornado and then a special <br/>
about Utica rebuilt.   I figured I would post this as many of us <br/>
regulary check the boxes at Starved Rock, Matheissen and Buffalo Rock.<br/>
<br/>
Second,  is Effigy Tumili and Buffalo Rock still there?  We spent <br/>
Saturday morning searching for it for about 2 hours before giving <br/>
up.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Hey Sil,<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that the Effigy Tumuli Letterbox is <br/>
there!  I went looking for it yesterday after work, and probably more <br/>
to dumb luck than exceptional navigational skills, I found it in the <br/>
first place I looked!  The box itself looked as though some raccoons <br/>
have been chewing on it.  Let me know if you want some additional <br/>
directions.  I didn't have time to look for the Buffalo Rock LB.  If <br/>
I go looking, I'll let you know the results.  I'm still looking for <br/>
your Streator Letterbox #1 in the park - no luck finding that one, it <br/>
must be really well hidden.<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>
Mike<br/>

&gt; cool, if you could provide some it would be<br/>
&gt; helpful...<br/>
&gt; I did find the buffalo rock lb and it is pretty easy<br/>
&gt; to get to.  I am going to the park tomorrow to check<br/>
&gt; on Streator box 1 - haven't been there in a<br/>
&gt; while.....have you read my post about being at the<br/>
&gt; Streator Hobby Show.  I am going to try to find out<br/>
&gt; this week if anyone is interested.<br/>
