Sorry this late, but for those of you interested, The Weather Channel <br>
will be airing the story of the Utica tornado and then a special <br>
about Utica rebuilt.   I figured I would post this as many of us <br>
regulary check the boxes at Starved Rock, Matheissen and Buffalo Rock.<br>
<br>
Second,  is Effigy Tumili and Buffalo Rock still there?  We spent <br>
Saturday morning searching for it for about 2 hours before giving <br>
up.   <br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

Hey Sil,<br>
<br>
Just wanted to let you know that the Effigy Tumuli Letterbox is <br>
there!  I went looking for it yesterday after work, and probably more <br>
to dumb luck than exceptional navigational skills, I found it in the <br>
first place I looked!  The box itself looked as though some raccoons <br>
have been chewing on it.  Let me know if you want some additional <br>
directions.  I didn't have time to look for the Buffalo Rock LB.  If <br>
I go looking, I'll let you know the results.  I'm still looking for <br>
your Streator Letterbox #1 in the park - no luck finding that one, it <br>
must be really well hidden.<br>
Best Regards,<br>
Mike<br>
