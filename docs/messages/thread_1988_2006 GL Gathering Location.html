<br>
Date - Saturday, June 3, 2006<br>
<br>
Location - There have been some suggestions and bids tossed around,<br>
but nobody currently has claim to the 2006 gathering. This is open<br>
for volunteers and is open to anyone - even states that have<br>
previously hosted.<br>
<br>
I will give 1 week for interested volunteers to respond.  Even if you <br>
have expressed interest before, please e-mail me again as I am <br>
starting fresh now that there is a specific date.  A poll will go up <br>
on Friday, Nov. 18, consisting of interested states that have not <br>
previously hosted the Great Lakes Gathering. In the event there is <br>
only a single volunteer from these states, that location will be <br>
chosen and there will not be need for a poll. In the event that there <br>
are no volunteers from these states, those that have previously <br>
hosted will then be put into the poll. The poll will remain open <br>
until the end of November, with each person being allowed one vote. <br>
The location with the majority vote will be chosen as the site of the <br>
2006 gathering.<br>
<br>
Once the 2006 location has been established, I will put together a<br>
state rotation for subsequent years, alternating east-west within the<br>
Great Lakes region.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in hosting the 2006 GL Gathering, and are able<br>
to do so on Saturday, June 3, please contact me via private e-mail --<br>
please do not post to the list as I do not want this to erupt into a<br>
struggle or for anyone who may be interested to feel intimidated.<br>
When e-mailing me, let me know how many people would be working with<br>
you, where you are from and the general vicinity where you would plan<br>
to hold the gathering (i.e. NE Indiana, Milwaukee area, SW Ohio,<br>
etc.).<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

that date (perhaps not ON that date as my children are in a wedding that <br>
day in RI, LOL - but you never know - I have to check to see if there is <br>
one in the park....).  We are driving there, so will be getting some here <br>
and there along the way from WI to RI.  We will be enviously thinking of <br>
the fun that will be going on back home as well!<br>

P.S.  Sounds like we'll probably have some other gatherings "fairly <br>
near" us next year - Minnesota in May and Illinois in October???<br>
