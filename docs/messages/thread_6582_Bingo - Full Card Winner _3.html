Yeah, I was hoping North Starr or Boxacon would be called!  I had my state wildcard, so either would have done the trick for me.  However I think there would have been a LOT of winners if it was either of those two words.<br>

I, too, send congrats to all the winners this year! I can't believe there weren't more on the last day, with it being a general word. I still had the names of 2 Illinois/Iowa boxers on my card!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks, SC and Bali, for giving us another fun winter event, since there wasn't a lot of letterboxing going on in northern Illinois!<br>

<br>
With yesterday's word we have our full card 3rd place winner -- actually<br>
winners! Tat2bob and Kimberly (separate cards) will share the 3rd place<br>
winnings. While Cootie tipped the scale for them, they each needed one word<br>
(different words) but were able to use their wildcard in place of the<br>
missing word (different wildcards).<br>
<br>
Congratulations Tat2bob and Kimberly!<br>
<br>
With that, the another season of Bingo has concluded. Great game all -- see<br>
you again in December and as always, if you have any suggestions for ways to<br>
change up the game a little, I would love to hear from you. I will separate<br>
out the booty and be shipping prizes soon.<br>
<br>
Thanks for playing!<br>

Tat2Bob filled out my card and I filled out his but only by mistake.  I had set everything up on the papers and handed Tat2Bob one to fill out.  And it wasn't until about an hour after we emailed SpringChick our sheets that I realized what we had done.  Thanks to everyone for all the fun and congrats to all the winners.
