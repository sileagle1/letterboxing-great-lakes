25 days without a BINGO term can make one..maniacal!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Police Log:<br>
<br>
911 received several calls at 0649 regarding a woman in a state of <br>
dishabille, jumping up and down with a rubber chicken and screaming <br>
at the top of her lungs.  This officer was dispatched and arrived at <br>
the scene at 0654.  Paramedics were called as the woman appeared to <br>
have a serious head wound; however, upon closer examination I <br>
discovered that the substance was not blood but large amounts of red <br>
ink.  The woman would not calm down and, fearing for my safety, I <br>
attempted to take my bullet from my pocket.  Before I could do so, <br>
the woman attempted to stab me with several long hat pins.  <br>
Fortunately, a passerby leaped the fence and pushed the woman away <br>
from meall the time yelling "Citizen's Arrest!  Citizen's Arrest!"  <br>
<br>
I was able to wrestle the woman into the back of my police cruiser.  <br>
She remained distraught and I heard her rambling on about odd things <br>
like tiptoeing in old shoes? and something about her rubber chicken<br>
or was it a spring chicken??  She appeared to calm down at the police <br>
station when I inked her fingers to take her fingerprints.  Then she <br>
started looking furtively about the room and muttering about <br>
cooties.  I assured her that the cells were thoroughly sanitized <br>
between "guests".  <br>
<br>
After processing, I gave her the phone to make her one call-- to her <br>
husband.  Even from across the room, I could hear his voice shouting <br>
about "this blasted BINGO game".  Based upon his other comments, I <br>
don't believe that he will be posting bail anytime soon.  <br>

WOW!  I saw a report on CNN about this last night!  It was a sight to <br>
see!  I think this report left out the part about the hitchhiker that <br>
Fife picked up on the way to the station.  He was arrested, as well, <br>
since he attempted a driveby from the cop car!  The poor cop filled <br>
up two logbooks writing it up and has them both in Lock(n Lock) up!<br>
<br>
Weird story!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mysteryas and TrailMark have been busy ensuring that Mysteryas' book <br>
report about Thomas Edison is completed on time (due tomorrow morning).  <br>
Sadly he hasn't had too much time to celebrate yet.  Perhaps MobiusKlein <br>
will send the confetti this direction; we'll be ready to celebrate soon.<br>
<br>
Mysterina created a very colorful Bingo board with pictures for each <br>
Bingo term.  I've been planning to post it online but I haven't taken <br>
time yet.  She and I are doing very well (we got a 6-pack yesterday).  <br>
However, neither Bingo board is close to the "4 corners" nor the "X".<br>
<br>
All of us have been enjoying the tales of BirdWoman, Tiptoe and others.  <br>
The creativity here is awesome!  Thank you to everyone for sharing <br>
during this bitter cold season.<br>
