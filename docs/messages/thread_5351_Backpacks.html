If anyone is interested in the backpack w/stool that Gruntmur and I had for<br/>
the event, these are from Boy Scouts and can be picked up at your local<br/>
scout office or we would be happy to obtain one for you and ship it.  We<br/>

Perhaps with my birthday money next August I'll get one :-)<br/>
