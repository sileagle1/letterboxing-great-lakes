                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone!<br>
<br>
I just wanted to post a little adventure we had out letterboxing <br>
today.  We got out real early this morning because we wanted to hit <br>
a few boxes in the Western Springs (IL) area - the biggest draw <br>
being the Haunted Trail Series that was just put out by CMoon. Well <br>
we found a couple other boxes and then headed to Bemis Woods to <br>
search for the Haunted Series.  When we pulled into Bemis Woods, we <br>
stopped at the trail map right next to the entrance to the Salt <br>
Creek Bike Trail to check out where we were headed.  We are standing <br>
at the map minding our own business when out of nowhere a ton of <br>
bees started attacking us.  They weren't there one minute and the <br>
next minute there were about 40 freakin bees surrounding us.  And <br>
these guys were agressive too.  They chased us halfway down the <br>
parking lot before we could get back into the car and drive away.  <br>
(Two of them even followed us back into the car) I was only stung <br>
once on the back of my leg, but Jason got hit about 3-4 times.  <br>
Being the troopers that we are, we decided to go ahead and get the <br>
series.  But we called it a day after that.  I wanted to go look for <br>
Biker Chicks:Tandumb but there was NO WAY we were going to go back <br>
by that trail map. <br>
<br>
So just a warning to anyone headed out to Bemis Woods . . . be <br>
careful of the bees.  I don't know if we were near a hive or what <br>
(we really didn't investigate) but maybe at least avoid that trail <br>
map if you can.  <br>
<br>
Happy Boxing Everyone!!<br>

reporterd bee area. <br>
<br>
Bees are freaky this time of year and will swarm so bee careful out there!<br>
