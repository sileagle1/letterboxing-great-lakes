Hmmm, I didn't know there was a link at Pete and Wanda's site -- I <br>
will have to check that out.<br>
<br>
The clues are not a secret, but I have always intentionally kept it <br>
rather low profile since by nature the box contains HH, and the last <br>
thing I want is for it to be vandalized and other people's stamps to <br>
disappear -- now if I could just control the critter curiosity ;-)  <br>
Probably because of this it has seen low volume turnover -- I think <br>
there were 4 HH to come and go between last spring and September when <br>
I again pulled it for a new log book.  Although considering the other <br>
boxes in that park didn't see many more than that, maybe that isn't <br>
so bad.<br>
<br>
The actual clues, like my other boxes, are on my web site and have <br>
been on the letterboxing.org site off and on as the box has flip-<br>
flopped between active and inactive.<br>
<br>
I have the new log book done, but haven't had a chance to put it back <br>
out yet.  I was hoping to get over to that park this weekend to do <br>
box maintenance and bring it with me then -- although that won't help <br>
you for Spring Break ideas.<br>
<br>
One thing I have concluded about my letterboxing during the past <br>
year -- I spent way too much time doing box maintenance.  My time is <br>
so much more limited now than when I first began boxing (and wasn't <br>
working full-time and had no grandkids and pending weddings).  During <br>
the past year I have spent most available letterboxing time tending <br>
to boxes and most carving time replacing box stamps and log books.  <br>
It was more fun when I was spending all my time planting new boxes <br>
and hunting other people's boxes.  I've considered retiring a bunch <br>
of boxes, but have a hard time choosing because I look at the list <br>
and think, "yes, but people really liked that box..."  I'm not sure <br>
what the solution is, but something has to give...<br>

<br>
I've found this happen to me as well.  The bonus I have is that I <br>
have a week of spring break to take care of most of my boxes, then I <br>
can spend the rest of the time hidding and finding.  I think the <br>
solution is to rely on other letterboxers to:<br>
1) inform you that a box was found or possibly missing<br>
2) perform any maintenance that may be needed and to let you know.<br>
<br>
If we all helped each other out with this (and the new tools on the <br>
LbNA site will help) all of our maintenance work would be <br>
efficiently handled. Kudos to WI Hiker and Martini Man (and others) <br>
who do this regularly and have helped me out a lot! Thanks!<br>
