                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gladly. Mine was The Roadside Table and we knew exactly where it was and like you we also read the compass wrong. So, we kept going back. I remember going there in the snow and the entire steps up were ice. I had a bad knee at the time and fell down the edge of the hill and almost landed in the creek below. After pulling myself up, we found the box. NOPE! it was a geocache within 10 ft, so we had to go back. I asked Springchick for a clue and in typical fashion she did not respond. I came to learn that she took this madness seriously and am grateful she didn't give me a hint as it was so fun finding it. (Thanks Deb...I cursed you for months. Just kidding...don't come after me a scary monster cake, OK?) However, that was not actually the first box we actually found. We found Thumper days before getting the Roadeside Table. Funny story...we were standing right on top of Sprinchick's box the entire time. testament to a good hide! BTW...the geocache nearby was a good one (you didn't hear me say that). Both boxes are now missing. :( <br/>
<br/>
Oh...and by the way, Mrs. Familyof6 is playing the 50 BOS game and had a great day with Interlochen today. Anyone else have luck?<br/>

<br/>
So glad to hear that Deedle &amp; I weren't the only ones who thought that when we set out on our first letterbox hunt!  Unfortunately for us, we never did find the box we were looking for that day, but we felt a little better learning that a few weeks later, the box was marked as missing, and it most likely was already missing the day we tried to find it<br/>
<br/>
And, obviously, we didn't let that failed first mission deter us, either.  <br/>
