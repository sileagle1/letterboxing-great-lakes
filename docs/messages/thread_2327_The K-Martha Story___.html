Hitchhiker/Event stamp that many folks on this list have stamped <br>
into their log books.<br>
<br>
K-Martha began as a joke by the infamous Legerdemaine from Maine.  <br>
Immediately it caused a stir in the letterboxing world both because <br>
of the novelty of the stamp and also because it had been done by <br>
Legerdemaine.  One NE letterboxer in particular, who shall remain <br>
unnamed, although I will say she is well-known for the great number <br>
of LB finds she has acquired, was intent on getting her hands on <br>
this stamp.  It has been rumored that she frequently set out on wild <br>
goose chases to boxes hundreds of miles from her home if it was <br>
thought the K-Martha resided in one of them.<br>
<br>
As an practical joke to confuse this insanely zealous boxer, a <br>
second K-Martha stamp was carved, purportedly by Legerdemaine.  <br>
These two stamps were close to identical and to the average <br>
letterboxer, it would be nearly impossible to distinguish between <br>
the two.  About this time, the K-Martha stamps began making the <br>
rounds as event stamps rather than being placed in LB as HH's.  Soon <br>
afterward one of the stamps disappeared from circulation (it is <br>
believed that was the original stamp).  Rumor has it that the over-<br>
zealous LB finally got her hands on it and it now resides in her <br>
underwear drawer.<br>
<br>
About 2 years ago, once it was realized that there was only 1 stamp <br>
in circulation, a 3rd stamp was carved, again with the intent to <br>
cause confusion and bewilder finders.  This stamp was carved by an <br>
individual who shall remain unnamed, although Legerdemaine certainly <br>
had a hand in the mischief.<br>
<br>
At the Morraine Hills Great Lakes Gathering, two of the K-Martha <br>
stamps were present, supposedly #2 and #3.  Since that time these <br>
two have been making the rounds to gatherings although there is not <br>
so much the hype and intrigue as they once generated.<br>
<br>
It appears that the stamp for sale on E-Bay is one of these.  <br>
<br>
Disclaimer...  This is related to the best of my knowledge.  As <br>
there are so many stories circulating about K-Martha, the facts have <br>
gotten twisted and even this account, although not entirely hearsay, <br>
may not be 100% accurate.<br>
