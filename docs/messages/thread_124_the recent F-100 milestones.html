Couldn't let the recent F100 milestones pass by with adding a great <br/>
big CONGRATS from me, to those who've made it though! <br/>

I also note that you guys have pretty high "P" numbers too. Thanks <br/>
for all of the effort you have put into letterboxing.  I'm sure I <br/>
speak for more than myself when I say, that those of us who came to <br/>
boxing after you, truly appreciate the fruits of your labor.<br/>

to <br/>

distance <br/>
&gt; myself, the deal was sealed. So off I headed to the Grand Rapids <br/>
(MI) <br/>
&gt; area to join with Grandvilla and Mobiusklein. First on the agenda <br/>
&gt; were Bindle Babe's Fate of Easter Series and then the Bonus Easter <br/>
&gt; Eggs.<br/>
&gt; An exchange on the trail was another bonus during that hunt. <br/>
&gt; SpringChick's letterbox partner for the day, Taylor, shared her <br/>
stamp <br/>
&gt; with us.<br/>
&gt; Then we moved on to two very cool hunts at Grand River County <br/>
Park. <br/>
&gt; Great clues and stamps were the way to close in the 100 mark. <br/>
While I <br/>
&gt; didn't need a slide rule, trig tables or algebraic formulae, a <br/>
&gt; calculator would have come in handy. Wow, I did more math than <br/>
I've <br/>
&gt; done for years! "Sphinx" and "Serpentine" were challenging hikes <br/>
&gt; through a wonderful park -- with good clues to boot.<br/>
&gt; They finished me with an easier one at Hager Park for F-100!<br/>
&gt; If you go to Grand River, study the clues in advance.<br/>
&gt; Oh yeah, I ended the day with an even F-100.<br/>
&gt; Now, for tomorrow.<br/>
