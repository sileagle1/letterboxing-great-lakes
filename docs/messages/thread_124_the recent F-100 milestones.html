this is my first time back online in a few days.<br>

Couldn't let the recent F100 milestones pass by with adding a great <br>
big CONGRATS from me, to those who've made it though! <br>
<br>
I also note that you guys have pretty high "P" numbers too. Thanks <br>
for all of the effort you have put into letterboxing.  I'm sure I <br>
speak for more than myself when I say, that those of us who came to <br>
boxing after you, truly appreciate the fruits of your labor.<br>

Enjoy!<br>
