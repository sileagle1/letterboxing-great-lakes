                    <div class="plaintext-content">Back when we planted The Haunted Asylum, we totally intended the location to be temporary since we posted the clues at sunset on Halloween and wanted it to be a safe trek in the dark.  The plan was to relocate it after that night.  So now several holidays have come and gone, and it is in its new location just in time for the 4th. <br>
<br>
And a side note, I was checking in on Hammerin Hank while I was down in the area and the last entry in the logbook is for 7/23/13.  So sometime a couple of weeks from now that person will be visiting the box :)  Perhaps I should be there so we could do an exchange!  <br>
