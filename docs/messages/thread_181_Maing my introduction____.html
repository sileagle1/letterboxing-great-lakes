                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings!  I had recently joined "the big list" and<br>
had gotten a few "welcome to the club" messages,<br>
including one from Dragon suggesting that I might want<br>
to join this list, too.  So here I am!  For those who<br>
didn't "meet" me on the big list yet, I'm Diane, aka<br>
Doodle Bug.  My boyfriend, Jeff (aka Deedle Bug) and I<br>
learned about letterboxing last fall while trying to<br>
find information on Squire's Castle here in Ohio.  We<br>
found our first box a few weeks ago, if the rain holds<br>
off this weekend we're going to try to find box #2,<br>
and I'm already working on plans to place our first<br>
box.  We're from Cleveland (Parma for me, Brooklyn for<br>
him) and the more I read about this hobby the more I<br>
love it.<br>
<br>
I'm glad to be part of such a welcoming group!  Oh,<br>
and since I missed the original "trail name" thread, I<br>
wanted to throw in the story behind our names.  Jeff<br>
started calling me his "Doodle Bug" because I<br>
unconsiously sing "do do-do do do do-do" when I'm<br>
doing things like the dishes or laundry or what-not. <br>
And then he became Deedle in turn.  But our stamp was<br>
carved before we decided to use our "pet" names as our<br>
letterboxing names, so it's more to do with how lucky<br>
we feel we are to have found each other<br>
*awwwwwwwwwwwweee*<br>
<br>
Happy boxing, all!<br>
