                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Labor Day boxing experience consisted of checking on my boxes on <br/>
Friday late afternoon.  My sister, who is quite new to letterboxing, <br/>
went with and I had her work out the clues.  It was fun doing this <br/>
with her because we never did a whole lot together (she's 9 years <br/>
older than me with four brothers in between us) and she's not a big <br/>
fan of the outdoors.  By the time we got to the last box it was dark <br/>
and I had her searching around this tree while I held the <br/>
flashlight.  She says to me "Well, I've really got something to write <br/>
about in my journal tonight - I never expected to be doing this!"  We <br/>
had a nice time chatting on the way back and listening to night <br/>
sounds.  One of my stamps had broken in half so I took it along with, <br/>
repaired it that night (including mounting it on wood - that rubber <br/>
cement does work well when you let it dry first!) and replaced it <br/>
early the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
Didn't get out the rest of the weekend, but now that the kids are <br/>
back in school I have two days off work during the week that I can <br/>
box on my own (or clean house, run errands, do laundry, etc. if I <br/>
HAVE too!).  There are lots of Milwaukee-area boxes that I haven't <br/>
done yet that will make good day trips.  It's a good time of year, <br/>
too, since there aren't many bugs or people out (at least on the <br/>
weekdays).  <br/>
<br/>
Do many of you letterbox in the winter months?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree -- letterboxing on a sunny winter day can be serene.  Two <br/>
years ago I wasn't working during the winter months and was fortunate <br/>
enough to be able to get out often.  One of my very favorite <br/>
recollections is a sunny winter afternoon at Saugatuck Dunes State <br/>
Park.  Back in the protection of the trees, behind the dunes, the <br/>
wind was minimal and the sunshine felt so good as the snow crunched <br/>
underfoot.<br/>
<br/>
Different story once I broke out of the trees and over the sand <br/>
dunes -- the full wrath of old man winter blowing in off the lake.  <br/>
My fingers nearly froze trying to stamp into the Birthday Box, but it <br/>
is still a great memory.<br/>

Yes, we certainly do. As Acorn mentioned, the obvious side-trails in <br/>
the snow can be a problem, but I recall a suggestion by DogScout (?) <br/>
wherein she carries a bottle of yellow food coloring and disguises <br/>
her off-trail detours as though they perhaps had another purpose. Of <br/>
course she has her dogs along for the search.<br/>
(Hey, I'm trying to be discreet!)<br/>
And appropos SpringChick's comments about the quiet and solitude of <br/>
the winter trails, I couldn't agree more. Besides, you'll have the <br/>
trails to yourself.<br/>
On the downside, landmarks take on another dimension when snow <br/>
covered. We searched at length, unsuccessfully, for a box because we <br/>
never found a certain colored boulder along the trail -- we couldn't <br/>
see the trail! But generally, I'm a big fan of winter letterboxing.<br/>
