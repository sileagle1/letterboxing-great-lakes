We had to go to Dekalb for something else, so we decided to find a few boxes-some indoor-some outdoor. By the time we got to I-88, I knew we should have stayed home. It was slow going on the roads, but we got around pretty good. Our event in Dekalb was cancelled due to weather, so instead of going home, we headed to Geneva, IL. Had a good meal at Mel's Diner...spent at least an hour at the Geneva History Center decoding a clue...wandered about a cemetery in vain....finished up at the top of the Peck Farm silo! Whew! We found 4 out of 6 attempted and didn't go into the ditch!! A successful day in the crazy obsessed life of a letterboxer! I uploaded a couple snowy pictures to the great lakes yahoo group album entitled "snowboxing". Feel free to add your own snowy photos.<br>

Our Lab (as old as she is) trudges through the snow making paths around the backyard... and the other 2 (1 XL and 1 Med Beagle mix) follow the paths around.  It's pretty funny to watch them actually... I'll have to get a video once.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't mind the 'white stuff' usually.  However, the 'white stuff' <br>
makes parking in the city very challenging.  The Atomic Beans when out <br>
for breakfast and upon our return we found our neighbor stuck trying to <br>
get out of the spot in front of where we had been parked earlier.  When <br>
I asked, "do you have a shovel?" he seemed to think I was crazy. He <br>
thought he'd be able to power his little car out of the spot and over <br>
the snow-plow ridge without problem.  WRONG!  So, after I helped him <br>
push his car out of the spot, we managed to settle back into the spot I <br>
had shoveled clean earlier in the day.  If everyone would suck it up and <br>
shovel their own spots, the street would be clean after a day, and then <br>
we could all get back to our normal parking scheme.  Instead, I'm sure <br>
that all my hard work will be taken by one of my lazy neighbors upon our <br>
return home this evening.  So, it seems that I'm off to go do some more <br>
shoveling.  We are very tempted to stick out our own folding chairs to <br>
reserve our own spots....however, we doubt that will help....stupid <br>
neighbors.<br>
<br>
And when not at home, that first "SPLAT" into the 4 inches of muddy <br>
water when you get out of the car while out shopping isn't much of a joy <br>
either.<br>

Sorry for the rant.  Back to you.<br>

Sledding, skiing, snowshoeing, letterboxing..........white is nice.<br>

I don't like yellow snow.  I don't like brown snow.  And living out in<br>
DeKalb County now with horses, dogs, alpacas, and sheep, I see plenty of<br>
both.<br>
<br>
I don't like black snow.  Driving around in the suburbs while working I see<br>
plenty of that too.<br>

But snowshoeing thru Matthiessen State Park these days is plenty pretty.<br>
And the turkeys are such turkeys.  They think they're safe now that<br>

Here in Cleveland, the official count was 10 inches.  I didn't bring the yard stick outside to measure our yard, so I'll take the weather people's word for it.  Luckily, Deedle & I had nowhere to go (my cousin had called around 10 am to cancel her son's birthday party, originally scheduled for 6 that night).  Of course, having my Jeep Wrangler, we could have made it around town if we had to ;)  We did go outside during the afternoon to help our elderly neighbor shovel his drive (not that he needed our help, he seems to enjoy doing these kinds of things) and then after watching the third little car attempting to make it down our street and getting stuck I brushed off the Jeep to drive up & down our street a few times, figuring if nothing else maybe I could flatten the snow so the little cars wouldn't have such a tough time.  <br>

I like the snow but no more than 2 inches per day.<br>
