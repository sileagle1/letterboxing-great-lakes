trail but these boxers I ran into at McDonalds! Now I casually <br>
mention what a great day it would be to be out boxing... they smile <br>
politely. Now that makes me wonder if I have mistaken them for <br>
someone else. I have been wrong before ( once or twice ), so I ask <br>
again if the three children with them, whom I am assuming are <br>
grandchildren, have trail names. Trail names, what's that Grandma?? <br>
She smiles politely again and informs me that "they" (the children) <br>
don't know what that is!! What a private past time that is not share <br>
with our younger generation!!! How could that be? <br>
<br>
As Groovy Girl is off playing on playland and their three no named <br>
kids are as well, CCB slides over the to the booth seat closest to <br>
mine and say's "now who are you?" Well I can't blame him for not <br>
recognizing me from the gathering we just attended together as my <br>
hair is about a foot shorter than it was in the fall. :-)<br>
<br>
It was certainly nice to see them both and we chatted a while before <br>
Groovy Girl and I were off to plant "Rabbit Pie". We had the Nature <br>
Area all picked out as rabbits like grassy areas and forests too. We <br>
get there and the park is closed.. for all things, gun deer hunting <br>
season. Seems the area around the preserve has hunters on it! Dang <br>
it! and now we have snow! Dang it again!! So the pie will have to <br>
stay in the oven a few days longer until I get another chance to <br>
plant it.<br>
