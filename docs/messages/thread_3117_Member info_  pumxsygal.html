letterboxers.  Aimlesst suggested we go out and try the Miller Park <br/>
box at a bookcrossing meeting.  So on August 6, 2005, Aimlesst, <br/>
freshwater and myself set out to find our first box.  I thought I was <br/>
just going along to see what it was about--I didn't even take any <br/>
equipment with me.  We were so excited to find our first box!  Not <br/>
having a stamp I signed in drawing my favorite doodle. Afterwards I <br/>
drove over to Target and got a stamp pad and journal and drove back to <br/>
the box to get the stamp in my journal.  And I've carved that doodle <br/>
into my signature stamp.  Now, about 150 boxes later in five states <br/>
and 1 plant I'm having a great time.  Even went boxing in the snow for <br/>
The Cigna Cats' Twelve Days of Christmas series.  Also during the <br/>
winter I worked out some of the "virtual boxes" that people have <br/>
done.  Currently I'm mulling over a couple of ideas for some plants.  <br/>
I have found letterboxers to be quite a varied group of people--with <br/>
many diverse interests which seem to add to fun.<br/>
