email addy.  Not that you have to use the email address (I do not) - you <br>
can add in your new ISP provider email.  But you will loose access to do <br>
any changes to your yahoo groups when you lose your SBC email, so I <br>
would do it sooner rather than later.  Then, after you get that new ID, <br>
rejoin your groups under the new ID and then after you are all set, you <br>
can then login under your SBC/Yahoo id and leave the groups under the <br>
old ID(does that make any sense at all?).  If that is not any clearer <br>
than mud, let me know!<br>
