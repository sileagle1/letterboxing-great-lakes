the gathering organized and it ran very smoothly. We had a fairly large <br>
turnout and found some special boxes that were planted just for the mini <br>
meet. Doglvr's will be posting those clues to the website soon for those of <br>
you who could not make it. We had several young boxers along who were a joy <br>
to have on the outing.<br>
Several times it ended up being a battle of the sexes with the woman <br>
proving to be victorious! I think the men outwitted themselves! I know it <br>
was very hard for "R" of Doglvr's to keep from wagging his tongue but with <br>
the threat of being skinned alive he managed to keep quiet. That and having <br>
to help carry the stroller with Rainy Day Rabbit in it helped keep his mind <br>
off helping with the clues.<br>
I am so glad that we got to meet so many of you boxers and hope to see you <br>
again at the Gathering.<br>
Thanks to all who came:<br>
Team Rabbit<br>
Lipstick Chick and Lighthouse Guy<br>
Snorlax and Brazilian Baby<br>
Scherezade and Puss in Boots<br>
the entire Doglvr's team<br>

and anyone else I might have forgotten<br>

I keep double clicking and sending emails. (Can you tell I'm a huge Instant <br>
Message user)<br>
<br>
Anyway...I just wanted to mention that I thought it was really interesting <br>
how everyone at the meet has their favorite part of LB-ing.  The Lighthouse Guy <br>
could work clues all day long, and I like to hear how and why people have <br>
chosen their team and trail names while I color in their stamps.<br>
<br>
The Brazilian Baby wants to thank everyone for being so friendly.  I told her <br>
that Letterboxers were just a friendly group.  I hope this is something she <br>
will pass on to the people of her country.  Wouldn't it be awesome if we all <br>
were the reason letterboxing started up Brazil?<br>
<br>
Man, do I need a compass!<br>
