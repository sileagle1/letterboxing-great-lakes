The theme could be stamps depicting what would happen to indicate Hell is freezing over (like pigs flying) and they could have it in Feb. when Hell, MI should be frozen over.  So, MI letterboxers, any takers?<br>

We love the theme, but why make it an indoor event - isn't that what BINGO is for?  hehehehe  The outdoor Iditarod Event (a Michigan offering - thanks to "Family of Many" aka "Famof6"....) was one of the BEST events we've ever participated in!  In that case, the weather thawed long enough to allow the snow and ice to melt just enough for us to enjoy a break from the long bleak winter known as.... hell!<br>
