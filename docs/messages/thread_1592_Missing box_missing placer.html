First off I would like to say hi, I'm new and be gentle with me....<br/>
In my search for information about a box I'm looking for, I came to <br/>
this group and so I'm enjoying my first day of surfing around.  I do <br/>
have a question that I hope you could answer for me:<br/>
The box is called Campton Preserve placed by suezq.  It is listed on <br/>
the Letterboxing.org as being placed Dec 31, 1969.  I have tried <br/>
contacting the owner with no luck.  The date looks fishy to me. Does <br/>
this box actually exist, have any of you found it?  My daughter and I <br/>
spent 2.5 hours walking around a relatively small preserve on a very <br/>
hot day with an idea of where it should be if it does indeed exist.  <br/>
We are, like I said, new to this and this is the first one we haven't <br/>

strike against us.  Any help would be appreciated.<br/>

I am not familiar with the planter name.  I did want to clarify the date though.  About 2 years ago, the letterboxing.org site (where the clues are located) underwent a major overhaul.  All of the box clues from the old web site needed to be entered into the new website.  Each planter was responsbile for moving over their own boxes.  Boxes that were left, if it was known they were active at the time, were moved over by the webmasters and no date was assigned.  These are the boxes that show up with a date of Dec 31, 1969.  So don't be fooled by the stale date.<br/>

Dec 31, 1969 will show up when the placer does not indicate the actual<br/>
date of placement.  Some of the older boxes might show this date when a<br/>
conversion occured some time before I got involved.  You may or may not<br/>
ever get a response from the placer.  I have not looked for this box, so I<br/>
cannot confirm anything.  I would try again, especially if others have<br/>
reported it alive and well.  Good luck.<br/>

they're just not posting the clues on LbNA.  I doubt the Kane County Forest<br/>

supposedly extremely friendly towards letterboxing and geocaching.  And none<br/>
