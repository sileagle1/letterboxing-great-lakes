Lake Elmo and Woodbury are about 20/30 minutes away from <br/>
Minneapolis/St. Paul.  If you get the time, I highly recommend <br/>
the "Minnesota History series" by ToT and HK Wolf.  It's a beautiful <br/>
walk and the stamps are great.  Another one is "A Grand Excursion" by <br/>
Deb Rocks.  It was my first one and is still one of my favorites.  <br/>
There is another series by ToT in Afton (south of Lake <br/>
Elmo/Woodbury).  As much as I complain about the roads in Minnesota, <br/>
all of the suburbs are connected and you can (usually) get to them <br/>
quickly.  <br/>
<br/>
I would definitely be up for a meet/exchange if our schedules work <br/>
out. My schedule is pretty flexible except for the fact that I have to <br/>
work during the day. Too bad you aren't coming up next weekend when <br/>
I'm hosting a mini-meet.  Let me know if you would like to meet up! <br/>
