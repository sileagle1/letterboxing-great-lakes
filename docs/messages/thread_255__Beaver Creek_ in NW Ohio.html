box in Williams County, Ohio, near Bryan?  We found the remains of <br>
this box and put it back together, sans stamp, but I expect its <br>
location has been compromised.  I tried "contact the placer" on the <br>
LBNA web site, but have received no response.<br>
<br>
In our limited letterboxing activity, we traded stamps with azobox on <br>
one occasion.  He's fairly easy to spot with his big compass around <br>
his neck and his hands full of paperwork.  We also ran across a Grand <br>
Rapids family over by Lake MIchigan.  They were looking for the same <br>
Spring Chick box we were looking for, but they forgot their compass.  <br>
We helped them out and traded stamps.  This same family stamped in a <br>
box in Northen California that we found last year.  We recognized <br>
their stamp.  We've also seen Spring Chick's stamp in a letterbox <br>
over by Cleveland.  We believe trading stamps when meeting in the <br>
field is a great way to tie the sport together.  Letterboxers are a <br>
small family, and collecting stamps is what it's all about.<br>
