On a side note-<br/>
<br/>
It would seem that I'm not the only one placing very colorful stamps <br/>
in the midwest these days.  I would suggest, if you haven't done so <br/>
already, that people purchase a package of multiable colored inking <br/>
pens to bring to the gathering. Michael's usually has a coupon in <br/>
the Sunday paper.  I'd suggest using that.  If you are going to <br/>
stick with a single ink pad, please be sure to bring "wipees", of <br/>
some sort, to clean off the stamps (as usual)when you are done.  <br/>
That way those of use that use inking pens won't have them ruined.  <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
