looking for S'mores!  (My bag-o-markers was the tip off.)<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Although my original FOOW1 went AWOL, my second box placed, Hurray for<br>
Hollywood just had its sixth logsheet replaced (#7 is larger).  And FOOW3,<br>
the one that was pulled and went postal, had its first anniversary last<br>
month.  After it arrives home from its last few stops, it will be retired<br>
(too valuable to entrust all those stamped images accumulated over a year to<br>
the USPS).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Speaking of anniversaries, tomorrow is my 29th anniversary working for the<br>
Department of Veterans Affairs.  <br>
