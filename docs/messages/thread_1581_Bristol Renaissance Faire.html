                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned from an eventful day of letterboxing at the Bristol <br/>
Rennaisance Faire.  It was a great day to be out there, even though it <br/>
was pretty hot.  We successfully found the 10 letterboxes (the 9 Sir <br/>
Timothy's Journey boxes &amp; the Bristol Ren Faire box), but we weren't so <br/>
lucky with the letterpeople.  We found 3 or 4 of the letterpeople, but <br/>
only one of them had their stamp on them (Laughing Coyote).  The others <br/>
explained that they did not have their stamp yet or something to that <br/>
effect.  But its only opening weekend so we kind of expected that. We <br/>
will definitely return later in the season to pick up those <br/>
letterpeople boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
We want to let everyone know that the stamps we did find were <br/>
beautifully carved and definitely worth the trip (and the cost to enter <br/>
the faire). It was a lot of fun reading through Sir Timothy's Journey <br/>
and following it around the Faire. We also really enjoyed the joust and <br/>
the whole audience participation factor.  The staff there is very <br/>
friendly and they really make an effort to get everyone involved in the <br/>
atmosphere.  <br/>
<br/>
So all in all, we had a great experience and look forward to making <br/>
another trip up there soon :)<br/>
