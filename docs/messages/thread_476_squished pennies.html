Subject: RE: Re: TOTW -- Childhood Treasures<br/>
Actually, I took my first Metra ride this weekend....and found HFH...I<br/>
actually squished a penny for myself since I collect the ones you can get at<br/>
the machines.....HOW FUNNY AND APPROPRIATE!<br/>
Although this penny doesn't have the HFH stamp on it, I'll have to put the<br/>
penny in my logbook!<br/>

Poor Bindle Bum .. I had accused him of leaving them down there. <br/>
