                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's the schedule:<br>
<br>
Before 10am -<br>
Some will be arriving early and may set-up the shelter without me<br>
there.  We are only known as a WI Hiking group to the park people, but<br>
I think they suspect we are letterboxers.<br>
<br>
WiH and MM will be there with their special boxes to stamp into and<br>
the gathering stamp and log, so you can take care of that early on. <br>
You can also hide boxes and write up clues before we officially begin.<br>
 I hope to be there about 9:30 to place last minute boxes.  If you<br>
want me to hide your box on a trail with printed clues, give it to me<br>
at that time.  Otherwise you are on your own.<br>
<br>
10am - Official start<br>
<br>
Noon - Group picture <br>
12:15 - Potluck lunch (I plan to bring charcoal, etc. if anyone has need.)<br>
<br>
7 pm - Gathering over (after gathering get-together?)<br>
<br>
Hope I didn't miss anything.  I wasn't expecting this week to be so<br>
busy at school...<br>
