<br/>
In our eagerness to find a specific box on the north side of Lake<br/>
Mendota in Madison, WI last night we  encountered a bit of "magic".  We<br/>
had been struggling with the clues and finally had an "ah-ha!" moment<br/>
yesterday afternoon.  We promised to take the kids swimming, so<br/>
afterwards we realized it was still dusk and being the first day of<br/>
summer and the longest day of the year, we buzzed over to hunt the box<br/>
as the sun was setting.  Unfortunately, I made some erroneous<br/>
assumptions about the box, so we didn't get it this visit.  However, as<br/>
we headed back to the car it was dark except for the moonlight and<br/>
fireflies!  All the while the kids were imaging monsters and bears<br/>
lurking in the woods, but as we exited the woods, we were met with a<br/>
gorgeous view of the moonlit lake.<br/>
<br/>
It looked just like a wall of water in the tree line with a shelf on top<br/>
with the city lights balancing on top of that.  Because it was dark, we<br/>
were seeing two dimensional and our eyes were playing tricks on us.  The<br/>
kids just gazed and asked "wow, what's that?!"  They couldn't<br/>
immediately recognize that it was actually the lake.  It literally<br/>
looked like a very shimmery wall with lights dancing around it.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Puddlejumper suggested we walk down by the lake and there we found<br/>
the lake breeze sweeping across our faces as we gazed at the moon and<br/>
the city lights across the lake and listened to the water rolling<br/>
against the lake shore.  It was mesmerizing and nearly magic.  We spent<br/>
some time searching the skyline for the Capitol, the UW Hospital<br/>
buildings, the airport etc.  There was a small sailboat anchored to a<br/>
buoy just about 50 yards offshore that sat in the tail of the moonlight<br/>
and a few other boats quietly moving about the lake.<br/>
<br/>
It was about that point we wished we didn't have the kids and the dog<br/>
along, but it was definitely a very magical memory for the first day of<br/>
summer!  It was something we would have never experienced if we weren't<br/>
out looking for a letterbox!<br/>
