interpreter for Pokagon SP less than a week ago.  Seems *someone* placed a<br/>
mystery box there.  There is a new Geocaching policy for Indiana, and<br/>
letterboxing is covered under the same Bulletin #46.<br/>
<br/>
We've exchanged several informative and friendly emails.  There is a limit<br/>
to the number allowed in the park and they must be permitted.  I told him<br/>
I would go and check on the mystery box and decide whether or not to keep<br/>
it there.  He said he enjoys geocaching and that letterboxing was<br/>
something he would be interested in, when he found some time.  Wouldn't<br/>
you know, he went to look for mystery box!  He didn't find it, but the<br/>
terrain evidently is not as it was when it was placed.  He told me where<br/>
he looked, but he was not in the right spot, so there is hope that it may<br/>
still be there.  I will be in the area sometime in September or early<br/>
October and I will be picking it up and deciding whether to apply for a<br/>
permit.  Seems silly to do so, now that the mystery is solved.<br/>
<br/>
But on the positive side ... I asked about how receptive Pokagon SP would<br/>
be for an event/gathering in 2-3 years.  Knowing there was a geocaching<br/>
event there, I asked about a possible letterboxing event.  I suggested<br/>
asking for permit for a number of Temporary boxes (3-7 days).  It sounds<br/>
like we might be able to get approval for this.  I plan to continue<br/>
talking with him and the other park personnel about this.  I hope we can<br/>
show them how environmentally conscious we are as a group, and how it<br/>
would promote the great park Pokagon is.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep you updated as I learn more.<br/>
