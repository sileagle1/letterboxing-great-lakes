it or move it, something eats it, someone steals it, or aliens abduct <br/>
it? I just got an email from some LB greenhorns that said my Red <br/>
Dragon's Lair box was all over the trail. They DIDN'T say if every <br/>
thing was there or if the log book was ok, I guess I will just have to <br/>
go out there (grrrrrrrr...) AGAIN. I guess they did say they found the <br/>
last box, and you can't find the last box without the first box's <br/>
stamped clues, so the stamp must still be there. I just had to recarve <br/>
the stamp earlier in the summer. It is always something with this box!<br/>

email about a box I just planted 3 weeks ago. I finally get some <br/>
action at my boxes and half have some malfuntion. I have had only one <br/>
visitor at all my boxes all summer! It was one that I placed at a camp <br/>
site called A Weekend Away. It has gone MIA but some one left the bag <br/>
that was around the box in the same spot under the rock. Why would you <br/>
take a box and leave the bag there. It isn't like kids go camping by <br/>
themselves either! I think that is so rude, what don't you understand <br/>
about "DO NOT REMOVE". Why would someone want a rubber stamp anyway?? <br/>
What is this world coming to??? I probably wont get up there until <br/>
next year, unless someone else wants to go camping there for the <br/>
Fantasy gathering Sept. 9th weekend. Well if anyone goes to Holly Rec. <br/>
area let me know I will mail you a stamp. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I have two cursed boxes, FOOW1 and FOOW2.  #1 keeps disappearing, and each time I recarve I make it smaller and smaller, hopefully to make it less obvious and safer.  I use the same graphic as the basis of the stamp.  It's kind of interesting, because as I stamp each version (I think it's on it's 4th incarnation, maybe the 5th?), I see the changes in my carving style and skill.  Same thing with #2, although with that one, I've even given up on including a logbook in order to make it as tiny as possible.  Fingers crossed it's been hanging in there (literally - oops!  Just gave a clue!) for a while now.<br/>
