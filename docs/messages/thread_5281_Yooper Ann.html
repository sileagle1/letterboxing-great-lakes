                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there!  I've actually been here all along, but obviously mostly<br>
lurking ;-).  I seem to be letterboxing mostly in the U.P. and mostly<br>
when I have nieces and nephews to entertain.  (Which raises the<br>
question of how many "mostly's" can this woman fit into two<br>
sentences?).   I confess that there are boxes within two miles of me<br>
in Illinois (Forest Park) that I've never gotten, including, alas, the<br>
now departed box by the circus graves.  Last summer I carved a stamp,<br>
intending to place it near my apartment, but there's construction<br>
starting and I don't know how accessible the area will be so it's just<br>
been sitting in my bag waiting for the stars to be in alignment, or<br>
something.  <br>
      I did up my involvement in AtlasQuest after they threatened to<br>
orphan my boxes since I hadn't signed in in a year.  I'd also had<br>
requests to put my Wyoming boxes there so it gave me a good excuse to<br>
get that done.  It's very gratifying that people are still finding<br>
those boxes I placed four years ago.  <br>
   So carry on.  I'm still here.  <br>
