I hope that I'm not being being too out of line with this, forgive me<br>
if you feel I am, but I felt I needed to make contact today with the<br>
WI geocacher group on our behalf for a couple of reasons.<br>
<br>
The primary reason was that after a long walk in the cold rain to get<br>
to the Aslan box in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe series, I<br>
found that a geocacher failed to notice the large print on the box<br>
saying that it is a letterbox and promply exchanged a travel bug for<br>
the Aslan stamp!  (Sorry Sophie & Me!)  I'm hoping that the president<br>
of the WI Geocachers can hunt down the geocacher involved, so we can<br>
get the stamp back before it bounces around too many geocaches!  (I<br>
should also note that another geocacher had also came by and put a<br>
plastic orc fighter in the letterbox and "took nothing").  As<br>
mentioned below, I know of the geocache in the area, and it is yards<br>
away from the Aslan box.  (It is actually only a few yards away from<br>
another letterbox in the area.)<br>
<br>
Secondly, as is indicated on their group's website, and as I noted in<br>
an earlier post to this group, the WI geocachers are trying to set<br>
policy for geocaches in WI with the state DNR and parks.  As we know,<br>
these policies often get converted to include letterboxes without our<br>
knowledge until it is too late.  I firmly believe that the current<br>
problems that the IL letterboxers are having with various preserves<br>
are a result of policies that were inacted for geocachers, in which<br>
the geocachers were aware of what was going on but the letterboxers<br>
were not.<br>
<br>
As such, I sent the following email to the president of the WI Geocachers:<br>
<br>

<br>
"Greetings!<br>
<br>
I'm representing a number of letterboxers in WI who<br>
feel there is a need for our two groups to at least<br>
have some contact with each other since our two<br>
activities share similiar concerns.  Athough we do not<br>
have a state organization (yet), there are over 100<br>
letterboxers in WI, most of whom are part of the Great<br>
Lakes Letterboxing group.<br>
<br>
One area we are particularly concerned about is your<br>
group's discussion with the WI DNR and state parks. <br>
As many states adopt policies restricting Geocaching,<br>
too many of them automatically assume that<br>
letterboxing is the same and force the geocaching<br>
rules on us.  Often these infringe on the very areas<br>
where letterboxing and geocaching are different or<br>
have differing philosophies and tend to ruin our<br>
hobby.  Before the WI geocachers "strike a deal" with<br>
the state, we would like to have a say in the deal, as<br>
we may not be in complete agreement with you on some<br>
issues.  By contacting you, I'm hoping that we can<br>
work together for the good of both hobbies in WI (not<br>
to mention all the other fringe hobbies related to our<br>
hobbies).<br>
<br>
I also have another concern I'm hoping you can help me<br>
with.  On my letterboxing walk today at Lake Park in<br>
Milwaukee, I found the box I was searching for, but it<br>
had been found by two different geocachers (at the end<br>
of Oct.) who failed to notice that it was a letterbox<br>
and not the nearby geocache (although the box is<br>
CLEARLY marked as a letterbox).  As such, one of them<br>
who goes by the name Great Teton 2020 took the hand<br>
carved stamp that needs to remain in the letterbox. <br>
They left travel bug #477229.  The other geocacher<br>
left a plastic figure.  The stamp that they took means<br>
a lot to many letterboxers and we'd like your help in<br>
tracking down this geocacher and hopefully getting the<br>
stamp back to where it belongs.  I also have in my<br>
possesion the items the geocachers left behind, since<br>
although I know there is a geocache near the<br>
letterbox, I'm not sure exactly where it is, so I<br>
couldn't put them in the geocache.  (I know about the<br>
geocache because I happened upon a geocaching family<br>
(who are actually friends of mine) as I was searching<br>
for a different letterbox nearby over a year ago). If<br>
you find out who this Great Teton geocacher is, please<br>
have them contact me by email so we can work things<br>
out.<br>
<br>
This actually brings up another concern for both of<br>
our groups.  Although most letterboxers know about<br>
geocaching and know what to do with a geocache, I've<br>
found that geocachers tend to not know about<br>
letterboxes.  Anything that your group can do to alert<br>
WI geocachers about letterboxes so that situations<br>
like this don't happen would be greatly appreciated. <br>
This is the first time I am aware of that a geocacher<br>
has taken the stamp of a letterbox in WI.  I have,<br>
however, personally experienced this in many of the<br>
surrounding states on my letterboxing trips.  (In one<br>
extreme case, a geocacher actually removed a letterbox<br>
so they could take over the great hiding location.)<br>
<br>
Thanks for your efforts, and here's to our two groups<br>
working together in WI!<br>
<br>
Sincerely, <br>
Tim Kuehl<br>

>>>snip<br>
<br>
I will keep you all informed of anything that transpires from this<br>
contact through posts like this to the GL group.<br>
<br>
It would also seem prudent at this time for us to officially form a<br>
group.  I in NO WAY wish to become a "splinter" group of the GL group,<br>
NOR do I wish us to create a separate Yahoo Talk Group.  We should<br>
stay a complete part of the GL group.  All I am suggesting is that we<br>
form a "recognizable group" that the DNR, etc. can recognize and<br>
contact.  I think it would be nice to have our own webpage, with<br>
information that is particularly for WI letterboxers - particularly WI<br>
newbies.  So we all have a voice in whatever policies affect us, we<br>
should join together by creating a membership list of letterboxers in<br>
WI, with contact people, who can turn around and inform the other<br>
members either through the GL group or by email.  (I also think it<br>
might be cool if we created a "Letterboxing WI" logo.  Maybe it could<br>
even be carved for the traveling event stamps SpringChick is looking<br>
for and/or for our own patches, but I digress.)  I don't think we need<br>
to go the route of the geocachers and have a "president", membership<br>
dues, etc. for our group either.  Just a couple of contacts on the<br>
website in case someone from the outside need to contact us as a group.<br>
<br>
If you don't like any part of this, let me know, but please be kind :-)<br>
<br>
If you agree with me that this is a good idea and would like to help<br>
in any area I mentioned in the formation of the group, please let me<br>
know the specific area in which you'd like to help.  I definately feel<br>
there is much to be gained by having newer WI letterboxers as well as<br>
established letterboxers joining together to put this group together,<br>
so don't be shy to volunteer!<br>
<br>
BTW, if you are interested in visiting the WI Geocachers website, go<br>

their dealings with the state allbeit minimal info.<br>

Suck!  That's the second time that stamp went missing!  Dang it!  Thanks for letting me know.  Do you think I should re-vamp the Aslan box to hide it in a completely differnt place to prevent this from happening again?  (I really liked the area because it had the stone lions near it, but I don't want this kind of thing to keep happening, so maybe a move would be the best thing).<br>
 <br>
Thanks for the update on the boxes and for sharing your letter with us.  I thought it was very professional and to the point.  I wouldn't change anything about it.<br>
 <br>
Keep me posted as to whether or not you hear back from the organization.<br>

Thanks for taking the initiative to start dialogue with the geocaching<br>
group.  It needed to be done.<br>
<br>
I think it is a great idea for form a recognizable group and would be<br>
willing to volunteer in some way.  I'm in the southwest Chicago suburbs.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

But seriously, the IL letterboxers might want to consider doing the <br>
same - organizing that is.<br>
<br>
To keep the TOTW going, how about...<br>
<br>
ILL - Illinois Letterboxing League<br>
(and NILL and SILL for northern and southern)<br>
L4 or 4L - Land of Lincoln Letterboxer League<br>
<br>
Come on everyone!  Get your brains and funny bones going!<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

You asked for opinions and feedback, so here is our input:<br>
<br>
We personally don't have an interest in becoming "organized" or <br>
having a quasi-official group  to represent us as letterboxers. I'd <br>
really prefer that the DNR didn't even know about letterboxing.  We'd <br>
rather take it as it comes, adapt to conditions and keep it fairly <br>
low-key and secretive.  Maybe this is wishful thinking, but it seems <br>
that as soon as things get organized it's not long before more rules <br>
and regulations start appearing...<br>
<br>
This list, the national list, and contact the placer features seem to <br>
work quite well in communicating items of general interest.  If state <br>
or local issues arise they could be posted and rather than having <br>
a "single voice" representing an organized group, it might be more <br>
effective to have lots of grass-roots voices contacting the officials <br>
in question if it is necessary.<br>
<br>
There are lots of sites that provide good info for new people <br>
(AtlasQuest, letterboxing.info, LBNA and the new boxers list).  I'm <br>
not sure we need another one for WI.  Those that are more "serious" <br>
about letterboxing will find the existing material.  Not sure what <br>
other content might be included on a WI website, but I still prefer <br>
to avoid a lot of fragmentation or duplication with other sites.<br>
<br>
If a WI patch was created, we'd probably want one.  However we're <br>
satisfied with the identification we have with the regional group.  <br>
The only state that I know of that has their own patch is Texas (due <br>
to its size, I think it's comparable to a region!), all the rest are <br>
regional patches.  However maybe a trend is starting toward having <br>
separate patches.<br>
<br>
Re: Geocachers.  We've been lucky not to have had any problems.  A <br>
few have logged into our boxes, but not taken anything.  One cacher <br>
found my Possum box in IL and contacted me to let me know it wasn't <br>
hidden very well anymore and offered to go back to the park to cover <br>
it better if I wanted him to. I think some cachers have switched over <br>
to letterboxing based on having found some LBs and then learning more <br>
about it.   I do think it is a good idea to put a "This is NOT a <br>
Geocache" label on your box as an extra precaution.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am not from WI so I have just been watching from the sidelines (unless Milwaukee wants to claim MI also).  But I would have to say that I agree with the things WI Hiker has stated regarding "less contact with the DNR is better" and also in regards to WI (and the other states in the Great Lakes region) remaining a part of a regional group.  I think taking a more organized approach to letterboxing would be contrary to the nature of the game and would significantly impact the way we play and the freedoms we currently enjoy.  If anything I think the answer is for more clandestine modes of play as it is my feeling that a majority of the issues that letterboxing faces today are due to over-exposure and easy accessibility to clues and letterboxes.<br>
<br>
Down the road, depending on DNR and other land usage policies and increases in the number of letterboxers, I may feel differently.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I had a nice long reply to WI Hiker's post, but Yahoo deleted <br>
it in the editing stage before I got to send it.  Guess it wasn't <br>
meant to be.<br>
<br>
Since I don't have time to re-type it now (let alone write it in the <br>
first place), I'll just point out that I agree to most of what WI <br>
Hiker, Martini Man, and SpringChick posted.  Those were the same <br>
sentiments that I was initially trying to send in my contact to the <br>
geocachers.  I took it out because it didn't sound pleasant and was <br>
more information than a first contact needed to have.  Besides, I'll <br>
take a "very professional sounding" critique anyday!<br>
<br>
It seems the geocachers should be made aware that we would prefer to <br>
stay under the radar and not to have their policy be applied to us.  <br>
(I'm not trying to speak for the group, I'm just stating what I've <br>
gleaned from what people on this site have said.)  My concern is <br>
that in every situation I've seen, geocaching policy has become <br>
letterboxing policy, whether the letterboxers agree or not, and <br>
whether the policy says letterboxing or not.  The geocachers are <br>
looking to limit the number of boxes, put a time limit on boxes, and <br>
assess a fee to plant a box (sound familiar?).  Do we want these <br>
policies to be forced on us without a say when we have the chance?  <br>
Can we make sure that these are only applied to geocaching and not <br>
to letterboxing?  Can we get the WI sate parks to be more like the <br>
CT state parks (oh, if only we could!)? I don't know!  What are we <br>
going to do?  At least let's come to a concensus on direction.  We <br>
can also keep tabs on what policy they are working on, even if just <br>
observing under the radar.<br>
<br>
I still can see the need for a WI letterboxing webpage.  I envision <br>
lots of helpful information not only for outsiders looking for info, <br>
but also for WI newbies and for letterboxers traveling to WI.  We <br>
don't need to re-invent the other established pages that are out <br>
there, but there are some unique aspects to letterboxing in WI that <br>
are helpful to know, just like there are for MI, IL, OH, etc.  BTW, <br>
if you google "wisconsin letterboxers", you don't find anything <br>
useful.  If the DNR did that to contact us, they'd give up.  <br>
Outsiders wouldn't know there is a "contact the placer" on LBNA.  (I <br>
should also mention that the "contact the cacher" on the geocaching <br>
site is difficult to find, which is why I couldn't find a way to <br>
contact the stamp "thief" directly until SpringChick gave me the <br>
direct link.)  Shouldn't we at least be googleable? (New word?):-)<br>
<br>
Actually, the preceding paragraph might be best solved in this <br>
group!  Maybe each state could note some letterboxing quirks that <br>
are unique to the state, and we could collectively do it for the <br>
region, so letterboxers from outside the region and newbies can know <br>
of the quirks right away.  I'm thinking of things like 1 pace = 1 <br>
step in the GL region (mostly), bring inking pens - we have colorful <br>
stamps!, bring rags to clean off our colorful stamps!, etc.  If we <br>
then put it in the files section with a proper heading, it should be <br>
able to show up on a google search as desired.  Just a thought.<br>
<br>
Anyway, time to go pack to go to Boston!<br>

<br>
I just wanted to remind eveyone of my experience with a similar, yet <br>
smaller, organization in Illinois, the DuPage Forest Preserve. They <br>
have recently adopted written policies regulating geocaching <br>
and "related activities" (including letterboxing).<br>
<br>
Believe me, the regulations developed for geocaching are compatable <br>
with letterboxing. The two activities are so closly related as to be <br>
virtually identical to those on the outside. It doesn't matter to the <br>
DNR if you stamp in the box or if you trade trinkets. They are <br>
worried about trampling on the way to find the box/cache.<br>
I wouldn't worry too much about being represented by a group.<br>
<br>
For the most part the permit systems are written to protect certain <br>
types of areas that are fragile or otherwise need protection. <br>
<br>
I have had the experience of finding a geocache accidently (Hey H.C., <br>
you too huh?), and having a geocacher find one of my boxes ----<br>
 "Waiting in the Shadows" (how that happened is still a mystery). <br>
Both were pleasant experiences. We just need to educate the <br>
geocachers in general that letterboxes exist and to not-take-the-<br>
stamp. <br>
<br>
Perhaps a few letterboxers that also geocache can help spread the <br>
word about letterboxes. <br>
