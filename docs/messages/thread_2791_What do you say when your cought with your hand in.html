I enjoy birdwatching (guess that explains my trail name) so I often <br>
have my binoculars when we are out boxing.  If someone seems to be <br>
looking at us as we are searching, I conspicuosly pull out my <br>
binoculars to provide a distraction while the others are searching <br>
for the box.  <br>
<br>
When people come upon us as we are stamping in, the kids often <br>
pretend that they are using their journals to "take notes" about <br>
or "draw pictures" of whatever scenic site we are near.<br>

Oh yes, the Letterboxing Murphy's Law.  As Deedle<br>
says, you can be letterboxing on Mount Everest and as<br>
soon as you find the box and spread all your supplies<br>
out, along will come someone walking their dog. <br>
Luckily we've never actually had anyone ask us what we<br>
were doing.  Usually, if we're hunting for a box where<br>
we know there are other people lurking around, we'll<br>
prepare a cover story in advance that's apropos to the<br>
situation.  IE, pull the camera out, if someone gets<br>
too close start taking lots of photos.  I forget how<br>
many photos we have of me posing in front of the tree<br>
or sitting on the ledge where the box is hidden as<br>
people walked by us.  <br>
<br>
If we're in a state where there was no one, no one, no<br>
one around and they suddenly materialized from thin<br>
air and we've got all our stuff spread around us, we<br>
gather it up into our bag as quickly as we can and<br>
either pass around the water bottle, act winded like<br>
we need to rest from the hiking, pretend we're<br>
searching for something in our pack, stoop to tie our<br>
shoes, pretend I'm searching for my contact, pretend<br>
we've stopped for a snack (how do they know there<br>
isn't really food in that tupperware container, right?<br>
:).  So far no one's questioned us...<br>

We have become great Thespians in the woods:<br>
<br>
We've used the camera decoy because we really do take photos of <br>
fungi!<br>
<br>
We've used the birdwatching decoy...with our secret call-out to <br>
alert the other of an "intruder".."I think I hear a <br>
Woodpecker!"..Although, this usually doesn't work well at a beach <br>
where woodpeckers are scarce!<br>
<br>
And like Doodle & Deedle, I've actually acted like I was chewing a <br>
stamp as if it was a cookie just pulled from a ziplock baggie as <br>
someone passed by!  I think that if that occasion had been captured <br>
on film an Oscar would have been mine for the over-the-top <br>
performance!<br>
<br>
But, the best, was recently when there was an elderly woman acually <br>
sitting on the tree where the box was located.  We simply told her <br>
that we were letterboxing (like a scavenger hunt) and if she didn't <br>
mind moving we'd fetch the box and be on our way.  We explained all <br>
about letterboxing to her as we went through the process.  She was <br>
keenly interested and then asked if she could continue the hike out <br>
with us and hitch a ride into town!  Our first human hitchiker!  It <br>
ended up her sister met up with her and we didn't actually have to <br>
take her to the next box!  Sometimes with a little discernment you <br>
can win new letterboxers right out on the trail!<br>

That's part of the risk of hiding a box, isn't it ? It<br>

  I always have my camera with me -- both for use as an alibi and just because <br>
  well, I always have my camera with me... If I feel that I am being watched, <br>
  I begin taking photos, usually focusing very intently on something specific <br>
  so it appears I am studying something and it is less likely that anyone will <br>
  disturb me. Only once has anyone asked me exactly *what* I was taking <br>
  pictures of and I made up something about the fungus that was on the tree <br>
  nearby. Works every time...<br>
