myself ... more than once, even! <br/>
<br/>
After the first time and doing the actual re-carving, I decided I<br/>
would try to fix it before doing all that again.<br/>
<br/>
You know that acrylic gel medium I use for mounting my stamps?  Well,<br/>
I love that stuff because it's strong and I use it for a million<br/>
things.  I used it to repair two of those "fatal" carving errors.<br/>
<br/>
The first one was large enough that I could glue the little piece of<br/>
carving material back in place with the gel medium. And after it<br/>
dried, it stamped up just fine.<br/>
<br/>
There was one "fatal" error that was such a tiny bit of fine detail<br/>
that putting carving material back in place was going to work.  I just<br/>
used my magnification light, a tiny straight pin and some gel medium<br/>
to "build" the missing area.  After I built it up, I stuck my finger<br/>
in some soapy water and smoothed out the top of the gel medium, wet<br/>
the straight pin in soapy water and scraped off the excess gel medium.<br/>
 Once this dried it also stamped up pretty darn good. And I saved<br/>
myself a ton of re-carving time. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought from the field (so to speak) You might want to give it,<br/>
or something like it a try.<br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>

&gt; As a side note, I think I made my first "fatal" carving mistake <br/>
&gt; today :-(.  After spending umpteen hours on one carving, I <br/>
&gt; mistakenly ripped off a couple of fine parts on it while cleaning it <br/>
&gt; up.  Unfortunately, it looks like I get to spend another umteen <br/>
&gt; hours recarving it as I don't think it can be saved.  As those who <br/>
&gt; recently traveled to the Buffy box said - "Grrrr Arrrrgh!"<br/>
