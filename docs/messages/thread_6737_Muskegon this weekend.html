I'd love to squeeze in some letterboxes - but time will be limited.  We are renting a small cottage on Beach street in Muskegon - believing that we'd be close to the state park.  BUT!

Is tree some local trick to this?  Does anyone know?  We can almost touch the state park from the cottage, BUT WE CAN'T GET THERE?  Is there any other way?  No foot bridge?  Or local ferry?  <br/>
