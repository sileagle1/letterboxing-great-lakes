                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone who has been out at the Faire and looking for <br/>
me!  I'm sorry I haven't run into to anyone yet this year, as I've <br/>
been so busy with other activities!  I'll be there for the next (and <br/>
last) three weekends of the Faire, so keep an eye out for me!<br/>
<br/>
This year I'm involved in the charity for Renaissance Faire workers <br/>
and have been selected as one of the champions for my group (the <br/>
Wenches Guild and other affiliated guilds).  <br/>
<br/>
The charity is R.E.S.C.U. and they are a 501(c)3 organization. Their <br/>
website is http://www.rescufoundation.com/ and they provide funds to <br/>
help cover medical and other costs incurred by people who work at <br/>
Renaissance Faires when they are ill or injured. Unlike working for <br/>
businesses or corporations, many Faire workers are one-man <br/>
operations and generally are able to make ends meet, so when illness <br/>
or injury strike, there's usually no insurance or rainy-day funds to <br/>
pay for clinic and hospital costs.<br/>
<br/>
Please help me raise money for R.E.S.C.U. over the next two weeks <br/>
and to crown me and my fellow champions as Bristol Best In Show!  <br/>
I am accepting funds through my PayPal account (kburrall [at] <br/>
trcsolutions [dot] com, and will be making a stamp image to send to <br/>
everyone who makes a donation.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again and I hope to see a few more 'boxers at Faire this <br/>
season!<br/>
