be potluck and my parents (they only letterbox with me, but they have<br/>
their own sig stamps, so feel free to ask for an exchange) have<br/>
volunteered to bring meat (probably brats and hamburgers) and do the<br/>
grilling.  If you have a dish you'd like to share, let me know and<br/>
I'll add it to the list.  <br/>
<br/>
Beverages will be "bring your own". I know this probably isn't an<br/>
issue at gatherings with this group, but alcoholic beverages are not<br/>
permitted in Minnesota state parks.  <br/>
<br/>
In an effort to make this gathering a little greener, I'm going to ask<br/>
that attendees bring their own reusable plates, utensils, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
And just a reminder on boxes, if you're mailing them to be planted,<br/>
they are due to me by May 1st.  <br/>
<br/>
Several boxes have already arrived and they are fantastic!<br/>
