While I haven't done this, I have remotely participated in a find.  A <br/>
letterboxing friend called me from over 900 miles away (I was at <br/>
work) and said "Hey - remember that mystery box we were looking at?  <br/>
I think I just stumbled on the starting point!  Look it up and read <br/>
me the clues."  So I did, and she found the box!  I really thought I <br/>
should count it as a find, but I waited until my next visit to the <br/>
area and made her take me to the spot.  It was a good one, and a fun <br/>
find for both of us!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Any suggestions for us to be able to share this hobby together, <br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; be greatly appreciated..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm sure the "old school" letterboxers would probably frown on <br/>
this, <br/>
&gt; but...oh well.<br/>
&gt; Our family went on vacation recently and wanted to do some <br/>
&gt; letterboxing along the way. <br/>
&gt; One particular one that we wanted to get was down a very hilly <br/>
trail. <br/>
&gt; It was hot and muggy, and mosquito infested. The kids were cranky <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; wanted to stay in the car to watch DVDs. So my husband grabbed one <br/>
&gt; walkie-talkie and the back pack and hit the trail. I stayed in the <br/>
&gt; car with the clues, the kids and the other walkie-talkie. I read <br/>
him <br/>
&gt; the clues while he looked for the box. I didn't get the full effect <br/>
&gt; of the journey, but I still felt like I was contributing to the <br/>
hunt. <br/>
&gt; When he found the box he stamped in for the both of us. <br/>
&gt; We continued doing this for many of the letterboxes on our trip, <br/>
&gt; alternating who had to stay in the car. <br/>
&gt; You might want to try doing that for the boxes that are too much <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; your wife. (It also is nice for those really long hikes from one <br/>
end <br/>
&gt; of a park to the other. You don't have to walk back to the car. <br/>
Just <br/>
&gt; have the other person drive around to pick you up!)<br/>

<br/>
  Funny you should say that. I did the same thing but in reverse.<br/>
  I warned the folks on the trail about my strange husband. If I saw someone enter the trail, I would mention it to my husband. Then when he said he could see them I would start saying things over the walkie-talkie like "Pay no attention to the guy in the white shirt and orange shorts. There is absolutely nothing to see here. Move along..." <br/>
  (Yes, we have a odd relationship...but it's fun)<br/>
