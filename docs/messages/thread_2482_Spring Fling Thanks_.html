Fling yesterday for contributing to a spectacular day of <br/>
letterboxing.  Thank you TJ_Mich for sparing what limited and <br/>
valuable time you have to host this event, and JB Books for lending <br/>
them a hand.  Thank you to everyone who attended: those we met for <br/>
the first time, and those whom we've previously had the honor to <br/>
know, those who live a scant 10 minutes away, and those who came from <br/>
across (or outside of) the state, those who just began letterboxing a <br/>
month ago, and those who have been at it for years.  It was most <br/>
excellent to run into so many of you on the trails time and time (and <br/>
time) again, and to trade tales and stories from our collective <br/>
myriad of experiences...  It's days like this that make for a feeling <br/>
of family and belonging in the letterboxing world...<br/>
<br/>
A special thank you to Trail Troll for hangin' with us for most of <br/>
the day.  We found as many boxes as we could, Raine permitting.  We <br/>
hope you had luck with the Lovebirds!  <br/>
<br/>
We'll be back for the other seven boxes soon!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

gathering, in large part because of the hard work they put into the <br/>
day. Thanks so much. We had a blast (and got all of the May Days <br/>
series, hurray!).<br/>
<br/>
Also, I uploaded a few photos of the day into the Photos section. The <br/>
folder is called Spring Fling.<br/>
