<br/>
Now that we've almost fully recovered from all the hiking LAST <br/>
weekend, we've been getting ourselves organized for the Garage Sale <br/>
that we're having THIS weekend.<br/>
<br/>
We have carved a new stamp in honor of this event.  Yes, we know of <br/>
the Rummage Sale Box, but forgot to request it in time to have it at <br/>
our sale, so we've made a new one.<br/>
<br/>
We've posted the clues to the box on AQ and LbNA.  We're also <br/>
including them in this post.  Hope to see a couple of you this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
This letterbox will only be available on Friday, June 9 and Saturday, <br/>
June 10 during the hours of 7am and 4pm.<br/>
<br/>
Start from the park where The Cottontails had their Easter Egg Hunt.  <br/>
Look for a street near the park that an Old Mother would call home.  <br/>
Between a street that can fly and a more formal Larry, you'll need to <br/>
head south to find us.  Look for the East-facing house that has only <br/>
half of a tree near the driveway.<br/>
<br/>
When you find us, ask us if we have any shopping carts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GOOD LUCK!!<br/>

<br/>
We're up getting all set up for our garage sale today.  Just wanted to <br/>
remind everyone that you have the opportunity to get our Garage Sale <br/>
Treasure box today from 7-4 and again tomorrow during the same time <br/>
frame.  We will also have the final boxes for Vive Montmartre and <br/>
Strenennacht available for anyone who has missed them while they were <br/>
AWOL.  <br/>
<br/>
We did not have the opportunity to get out to place our new boxes, so <br/>
those will be out soon.  (Don't you hate it when life gets in the way <br/>
of letterboxing?)<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see some of you out in our neck of the woods this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>

We had Dragon's garage sale box here last year so this year we thought we'd do something different.  In honor of my son's, first day off of school mishap, you will need to find him at the sale and ask if he has a Sharpie to sign his cast.  You will not only have that honor but also receive his 'cast' stamp.<br/>
<br/>
As an added bonus, I am currently hosting Doyle the Boxing Buddy.  He is really looking forward to the sale (although he will be staying far away from the pile of stuffed animals for sale) and would love an exchange if you visit.  If you think you might be in the area, send me a note off list and I'll get you the address.  Thanks everyone!<br/>
