long, winter hikes?<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree with Acorn - we wear Cool-Max liner socks and SmartWool socks <br>
when hiking in both summer and winter.<br>
<br>
I am usually colder than most people, so I will wear multiple layers <br>
with the top layer being a down coat from Lands' End. I also have some <br>
winter "climbing" pants (shaped for mountain climbers) that are really <br>
warm.  Bottom layers are lightweight or midweight hightech long <br>
underwear that wicks moisture. I also really appreciate the down <br>
mittens I have!<br>
