                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone! My name is Angi and I just started letterboxing this <br>
week after hearing about it for the first time...last week. I found a <br>
link to the letterboxing.org site while surfing around on the <br>
internet and became very interested in it. When I got the chance I <br>
went out and bought a stamp kit and made my first stamp. It ended up <br>
being pretty big. It just barely fits on the tiny logbook page as it <br>
is about 2.5 x 4 inches. Oops. I am probably going to be working on a <br>
smaller one sometime soon.<br>
<br>
When I found out that there was a box not very far from my house, I <br>
decided to start this weekend. I was originally going to start once <br>
school got out because all the other boxes would be like a day trip <br>
for me. Anywho...my first box was found today (or yesterday as it is <br>
2:00 in the AM now) and was the Red Rover box (Midway Village) in <br>
Rockford, IL. I didn't really pay much attention to the stamps in the <br>
logbook, but am I right in thinking there was one from Leapin <br>
Lizards? It was fun looking through the stamps.<br>
<br>
So I have all this fun looking for my first box...and now I have to <br>
wait a month to go again. ::cries:: I can't wait for this semester to <br>
be over with.<br>
<br>
I hope I am making sense...it is way past my bedtime...lol.<br>

I thought I would poke my head up long enough to let y'all know I couldn't<br>
stand it anymore - I had to see what this group is all about.  Several folks<br>
I know are already on this list, and since I like them so well, I figure it<br>
has to be a good place to hang out.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm from Texas and have been boxing down here for almost four<br>
years.  I also co-moderate the Texas list with Silver Eagle.  I normally box<br>
with my 11 year old son, the very cool Lightning, and sometimes we take my<br>
husband/his dad, Fearless Fox, along if he's very good.  I have a 19 year<br>
old daughter who is a waylaid boxer and a carver extraordinaire.  She's busy<br>
at the moment being 19 years old and on her own, so she doesn't find her way<br>
out to box very much unless she's hanging out with her old mom and her<br>
little bro.<br>
<br>
Aside from letterboxing, my other passion is scouting.  I'm the Cubmaster<br>
for one of the local packs and love it - and it flows very well with my<br>
letterboxing activity as I usually manage to slip out on campouts and hikes<br>
for a little boxing wherever we go!  Lightning, unfortunately, is growing<br>
older and he just crossed into Boy Scouts and he and Fearless Fox left me<br>
alone to play with the little guys.<br>
<br>
I was actually born in Wisconsin to temporarily displaced Texans and I spent<br>
my first three years there until they moved us back to Texas.  I did another<br>
brief stint in Indiana when I was about five, so your neck of the woods<br>
isn't entirely foreign to me!<br>
<br>
I've been jealously reading about your gathering this weekend and it sounds<br>
like a good time was had by all.  I might eventually actually make my way<br>
north to a gathering, but in the meantime, here I sit.  Thanks for letting<br>
me eavesdrop!<br>

Welcome!<br>
<br>
I enjoy reading your posts on the Texas board.  I joined that group <br>
about 1.5 years ago before we took a vacation in Texas.  We didn't <br>
get a chance to meet any of you Texan boxers, but got some excellent <br>
recommendations from Silver Eagle about where to go during our week <br>
in the central part of the state.<br>
<br>
Your post here was in excellent taste and just another example of <br>
your good manners, no matter what Investigator Bacon has said on <br>
the "big board"!<br>

Ahh, but now I wonder, Wisconsin Hiker.<br>
Was the eloquent and defending post by the Silver Eagle just a ruse to<br>
deflect attention from BL? To have her show up *here* of all places,<br>
just when her reputation might need a bit of polish?<br>
Shucks, everyone knows that we in the upper midwest don't even know<br>
enough to misbehave.<br>
<br>
I am not a suspicious person, but the Investigator was rather direct<br>
in his accusations.<br>
(Although he has apparently moved on to others with his accusing<br>
finger-pointing.)<br>
And, do a bit of anagramming with his initials!<br>
Yipes!<br>

Subject: [LbGLK] Introduction<br>
<br>
Hey Y'all!<br>
<br>
I thought I would poke my head up long enough to let y'all know I couldn't<br>
stand it anymore - I had to see what this group is all about. Several folks<br>
I know are already on this list, and since I like them so well, I figure it<br>
has to be a good place to hang out.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm from Texas and have been boxing down here for almost four<br>
years. I also co-moderate the Texas list with Silver Eagle. I normally box<br>
with my 11 year old son, the very cool Lightning, and sometimes we take my<br>
husband/his dad, Fearless Fox, along if he's very good. I have a 19 year<br>
old daughter who is a waylaid boxer and a carver extraordinaire. She's busy<br>
at the moment being 19 years old and on her own, so she doesn't find her way<br>
out to box very much unless she's hanging out with her old mom and her<br>
little bro.<br>
<br>
Aside from letterboxing, my other passion is scouting. I'm the Cubmaster<br>
for one of the local packs and love it - and it flows very well with my<br>
letterboxing activity as I usually manage to slip out on campouts and hikes<br>
for a little boxing wherever we go! Lightning, unfortunately, is growing<br>
older and he just crossed into Boy Scouts and he and Fearless Fox left me<br>
alone to play with the little guys.<br>
<br>
I was actually born in Wisconsin to temporarily displaced Texans and I spent<br>
my first three years there until they moved us back to Texas. I did another<br>
brief stint in Indiana when I was about five, so your neck of the woods<br>
isn't entirely foreign to me!<br>
<br>
I've been jealously reading about your gathering this weekend and it sounds<br>
like a good time was had by all. I might eventually actually make my way<br>
north to a gathering, but in the meantime, here I sit. Thanks for letting<br>
me eavesdrop!<br>

At first, I was inclined to give Inspector Bacon the benefit of the <br>
doubt (after all, we pig-types should stick together).  But then he <br>
had the temerity to accuse our own WI Hiker!  I'm beginning to think <br>
he is living up to his name.  After all, bacon comes from the <br>
underbelly of a pigand I fear he is trying to create a corrupt and <br>
sordid underbelly of letterboxing.  <br>
<br>
Thank goodness we're not truly related to this Bacon fellowwe are <br>
actually Waltzing GUINEA Pigs.<br>

I think Frankie should be watching his own hoofsteps - does he forget <br>
that the Waltzing Pigs are ready to come to our defense?  Besides, they <br>
don't want anyone besmirching the PIG name...<br>

<br>
I am new to letterboxing as of April of this year and together with my children, have fallen in love with the hobby. We've been out letterboxing at nearly every opportunity and have found many of the hidden gems within our community.  We also plan to do some trips with the kids this summer to find the gems of other areas as well. My children like going on the "treasure" hunt and have told and invited many friends to join us. We've even set up a series and taken my daughter's fourth grade class on a letterboxing quest their last day of school (unfortunately it rained and we had to move it indoors). <br>
<br>
I have been a stay at home dad for 6 years with my children age 6, 10, 16 and 27. My two oldest children are do not join us on our quests, but the two younger love to figure out the clues and find the boxes. My 10 year old daughter has also become a fan of the wonderful carvings out there. She has also tried to carve her own signature stamp.<br>
<br>
In addition to the Stay at Home Dad career, I am a part time paramedic (working nights only) and teach a number of parenting programs for hospitals around the area. I have been a girls scout leader for 7 years, and do at risk mentoring and literacy counseling at school. My wife and I have also done Foster care for pre-adoptive newborns for the last 4 years, but have recently retired to focus more on our children's adventurous needs. <br>
<br>
I have become quite fascinated with carving my own stamps and placing letterboxes. I have been working hard to make the plants enjoyable for everyone. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd really like to learn. Most of my plants at this time are pretty short trips, because I need to plant them without too much complaining from the kids that "I'm tired." While they are short, they are great for boxers with kids. <br>
<br>
You will find that I'm a bit of a history buff and have done extensive genealogy research. Many of the boxes that I hope to create have some sort of a history lesson to help the children put history into understandable terms. <br>
<br>
I look forward to meeting many of you on the trails and am hoping to attend some of the gatherings with my children. If you are coming to the Green Bay area, please contact me. Time allowing, I'd love to go letterboxing with others and have my children learn from their adventures.<br>
<br>
Thank you to all of you for providing the opportunities to explore with my children.<br>

We also plan to do some trips with the kids this summer to find the gems of other areas as well. My children like going on the "treasure" hunt and have told and invited many friends to join us. We've even set up a series and taken my daughter's fourth grade class on a letterboxing quest their last day of school (unfortunately it rained and we had to move it indoors). <br>
<br>
I have been a stay at home dad for 6 years with my children age 6, 10, 16 and 27. My two oldest children are do not join us on our quests, but the two younger love to figure out the clues and find the boxes. My 10 year old daughter has also become a fan of the wonderful carvings out there. She has also tried to carve her own signature stamp.<br>
<br>
In addition to the Stay at Home Dad career, I am a part time paramedic (working nights only) and teach a number of parenting programs for hospitals around the area. I have been a girls scout leader for 7 years, and do at risk mentoring and literacy counseling at school. My wife and I have also done Foster care for pre-adoptive newborns for the last 4 years, but have recently retired to focus more on our children's adventurous needs. <br>
<br>
I have become quite fascinated with carving my own stamps and placing letterboxes. I have been working hard to make the plants enjoyable for everyone. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd really like to learn. Most of my plants at this time are pretty short trips, because I need to plant them without too much complaining from the kids that "I'm tired." While they are short, they are great for boxers with kids. <br>
<br>
You will find that I'm a bit of a history buff and have done extensive genealogy research. Many of the boxes that I hope to create have some sort of a history lesson to help the children put history into understandable terms. <br>
<br>
I look forward to meeting many of you on the trails and am hoping to attend some of the gatherings with my children. If you are coming to the Green Bay area, please contact me. Time allowing, I'd love to go letterboxing with others and have my children learn from their adventures.<br>
<br>
Thank you to all of you for providing the opportunities to explore with my children.<br>

Last night I went right from work and found the biggest outdoor letterbox<br>
I've ever met.  It was a sweet box.  I would say obviously planted by<br>
children, but not in the safest of places in Lombard (as far as muggle<br>
traffic goes), so if anyone in the DuPage County area is thinking of going<br>
and looking for it..............I wouldn't wait too too long.<br>
