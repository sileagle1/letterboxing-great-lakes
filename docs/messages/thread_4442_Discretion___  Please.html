                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know there are a couple of different schools of thoughts about<br/>
asking permission when it comes to letterboxing.  Some people feel<br/>
"better safe than sorry" and ask before they place a box on park land,<br/>
etc.  Others feel that when it comes to non-private land, if<br/>
letterboxing is not specifically prohibited, then it is better to go<br/>
with the "don't ask, don't tell" philosophy.  The feeling on this is<br/>
that when put in a position to *have* to say yes or no, many places<br/>
that do not have an official policy would opt on the side of caution<br/>
and say no.  On the other hand, if they are not put in a position to<br/>
*have* to commit one way or the other, many just look the other way. <br/>
<br/>
Which way of thinking you subscribe to when placing your letterboxes<br/>
is your business.  However, when seeking boxes you must respect the<br/>
fact that the placer may be playing under the radar and that by<br/>
mentioning letterboxing to park rangers, etc. you very well may be<br/>
putting their letterbox in jeopardy.<br/>
<br/>
I received an e-mail today with a much appreciated condition report on<br/>
the of one of my letterboxes that has been peacefully existing in an<br/>
area park for over 5 years.  In the e-mail there was an additional<br/>
comment about being careful for the park rangers because they said if<br/>
they found any letterboxes they would confiscate them.  I guess I'm<br/>
not sure why anyone would be having a conversion with a ranger<br/>
regarding letterboxing when they are looking for one of my boxes in<br/>
the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Please, please, respect those who have placed boxes by being discreet<br/>
while letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
This has been an unpaid public service announcement.  I will now step<br/>
down off my soapbox and cross my fingers that this will eventually<br/>
sink in... and hope that my box is still in place when I get over<br/>
there in a couple of weeks.<br/>
