She keeps mentioning the names SpringChick and Azobox, and keeps asking <br>
where TrailTroll is. (I think that she's still upset that you didn't <br>
come home with us that day. All the way home she kept <br>
saying "TrailTroll ride with us!" ;-) She also tells us how much she <br>
enjoyed playing with the sticks with Nickerboxer. (AKA-"Nicky" as she <br>
calls him). I guess that you all made quite an impression on her. :-) <br>
So, truly, a good time was had by EVERYONE.....even down to the <br>
littlest boxers-in-training!! Thanks again for a great day TJ Mich!<br>
