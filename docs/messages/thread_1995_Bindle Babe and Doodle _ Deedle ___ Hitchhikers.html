                    <div class="plaintext-content">Why do you prefer not registering some of your Hitchhikers and LBoxes with Atlas Quest or Letterboxing.org ???<br/>
<br/>
I notice that you both are listed as members with Atlas Quest, but until recently neither "The Wandering Rocker" or the "Christmas Swish Tree" was registered at either website. I want to thank D &amp; D for registering The Wandering Rocker today so I could add him to my list of finds?<br/>
<br/>
Suppose one of your Hitchhikers ends up in California or Hawaii or Florida or Arizona for the winter. Wouldn't it be nice if the new finder could list them among their finds at Atlas Quest. If you took the time to register as a member of Atlas Quest why not take the time to register your LBoxes with AQ??? In general are LbGLK members boycotting AQ, and if so WHY?<br/>

NO, no no.  I don't think is is so, at least not in Indiana.  I am member<br/>
and I support the great Green Tortuga in his efforts with AQ.  I keep in<br/>
contact with a number of local boxers through this site.<br/>
