Hello Acorn!<br>
 <br>
Dumpster Diva and I are so jazzed that you came to check out  our box!  Did <br>
you know you were less than a mile away from her stamp store,  The Goose Barn, <br>
where you could have met her?  She was dying to meet  you.  We probably should <br>
put a note in there, so finders can meet  her.  It would be fun.  I have <br>
never been to a gathering, so I have  never met another LBXR.. <br>
 <br>
We made a promise that we wouldn't check our box until I came  back to IL to <br>
visit.  I live in MI now.  We never imagined we  would have so many people <br>
hunt it down so soon.  We know of 4 people; Were there more stamps in it when you <br>
were there?   Thanks for responding about its condition.  When you hide <br>
something in a  cemetery, there's always the chance that the maintenance man will <br>
bury it a  little deeper than you intended <br>
 <br>
Please let me know about how many visitors 4 ft Under has  had.  Thank you SO <br>
much!<br>
