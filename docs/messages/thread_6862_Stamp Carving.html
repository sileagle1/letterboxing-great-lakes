I'm not a good carver and I don't enjoy carving. So I usually procrastinate <br>
for awhile, then force myself to get started, then either get bored or <br>
frustrated and stop after about 45 minutes, put things away, and go do <br>
something that's more fun. And then carve a little more the next day.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I rarely spend more than about an hour carving any of my stamps. Longer (ie more detailed) than that and I get bored and I'm afraid I might not get back to it if I put it down. I'm horrible about forgetting things if I'm distracted in the middle of it. Now designing the stamp image can easily take several days and I may set it down and come back to it. But once I start carving I really get excited to see the finished product and I usually do it all in one sitting.<br>

I'm holding on to my last piece of PZ, but did order some Mystery Makeover to <br>
try in the meantime.  Big mistake...the stuff is AWFUL to work with!  My biggest <br>
complaint is that after I complete a cut, I can't get a clean end on the strip <br>
of material I remove (for lack of a better term, the "rubber chad"??).  Maybe <br>
it's just my technique, but I end up ripping it out and leaving a nubby stump <br>
that looks terrible when stamped, especially tight corners where two cuts come <br>
together.  I thought it was my tip, but I'm using a brand-new #1 pinched down to <br>
a "0".  On the positive side, I pre-sanded the surface with ultra fine sandpaper <br>
prior to carving, so at least it takes ink better now.<br>

I made the mistake of carving a stamp outside once, back in May of 2006.  Deedle & I were having a garage sale on a sunny spring day, and we weren't getting much traffic, so I thought it would be a good way to spend the day between customer.  Unfortunately, I was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and didn't think to put sunscreen on, and after a few hours of sitting hunched over a table, got a lovely red burn on just my left arm.  The burn did turn into a nice, dark tan.  However, I never bothered to even out the tan.  So when we got married later that year in June, if you look closely at some of our wedding photos, it looks like I'm wearing a lovely tan arm-length glove on just my left arm, when compared to the rest of my exposed skin in my strapless gown.<br>
