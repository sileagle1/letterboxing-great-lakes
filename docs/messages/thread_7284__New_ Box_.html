<br/>
Illinois' Laila is back!<br/>
<br/>
She went missing from her stump, the cause=critters. What I found when checking on the box, was the box and moldy log, scattered around. But no stamp :( I went back another time in hopes, but still nothing. One more time, wait, what's this? STAMP! After 3 attempts, 4 months, I finally found the stamp, and in contact!!!<br/>
<br/>
So she is back out, in her new spot, and with even better 'clues'!<br/>
<br/>
If you are in the Peoria, IL area, this is a must! It's different from the norm, so it wont disappoint!<br/>

Also, while in the area, I check on my Night Box, and it still awaits some more finders! :o)<br/>
