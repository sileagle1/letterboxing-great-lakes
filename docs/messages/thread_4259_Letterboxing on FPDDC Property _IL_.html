The FPDDC is beginning a letterbox program and I have placed two boxes<br/>
to get things started. I recently placed the clues on the<br/>
letterboxing.org website, but would appreciate some assistance. We are<br/>
trying to catalog all of the current letterboxes on our property and<br/>
have their owners apply for approval. We are doing this to help ensure<br/>
they are following all of our rules and regulations, while not<br/>
disturbing any sensitive natural areas. Towards that I was hoping to<br/>
get our official Letterboxing Rules and Regulations information posted<br/>
on letterboxing.org and contact all owners who have placed boxes in<br/>
DuPage County, IL to ensure compliance. Please let me know if you can<br/>
help me with either of these matters. I hope that we can continue to<br/>
help letterboxing grow in DuPage County and give people another way to<br/>
enjoy visiting our beautiful forest preserves. Thanks for your time and<br/>
consideration, it is appreciated.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Possibly because of the heavyness of some of the rules, they haven't gotten<br/>
anywhere near the permit applications that they thought they'd be getting,<br/>
so they decided to do something on their own to stir up both interest and<br/>
adherence to the rules?  I can certainly understand where they're coming<br/>
from with the rules as far as wanting to know where the letterbox is going<br/>
to be placed so that no fragile environments are harmed, like they sometimes<br/>
are out in Kane County, but some of the other rules are a bit much.<br/>
Especially all the wording that has to be on or in the letterbox besides<br/>
just putting the permit on the box.  It just kinda takes the "art" out of<br/>
boxing, to me.  And there are too many other places available to put boxes<br/>
other than DuPage County Forest Preserves.  There's nothing "special" really<br/>
about DuPage forest preserves that the same stuff can't be found anyplace<br/>
else around.  I think the rules came about mainly as a geocaching problem.<br/>
There were probably 100 caches in each preserve vs 1 letterbox, and a lot<br/>
more "tearing up" of the environment is risked with geocaching because they<br/>
don't have the clues like letterboxing does.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found that box yesterday morning.  Yes, I made my way thru to it.  It was<br/>
quite badly hidden and no camouflage on the box whatsoever.  Hobby Lobby<br/>
stamp -- the exact same stamp the placer of the Behrens Park one in Elmhurst<br/>
used, so if you have that one, then you have the York Woods one. :-)  I also<br/>
went looking for the other box yesterday morning -- the one at Oldfield<br/>
Oaks -- and all I found was an empty container -- no stamp or logbook.<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of a shame because they had the box labelled as an "Official<br/>
educational letterbox."  Well, if educational means a store bought stamp<br/>
with no effort put into hiding or camouflage and making a "social trail"<br/>
thru poison ivy...........then I guess the box is "educational."  I hope new<br/>
boxers don't come away thinking this is all there can be to letterboxing<br/>
because it CAN be so much more creative and imaginative.<br/>
<br/>
I found Nature Nerd's box to be a much better idea as far as "educating" new<br/>
boxers about letterboxing.<br/>
