You have to weigh the implications regarding the box being accidentally found if it's not re-hidden properly.  It may be better to risk someone seeing it as trash and just tossing it as opposed to someone seeing it, thinking it's a "suspicious package", evacuating the area, calling the bomb squad, etc.<br>

Camo blends in better in the woods and that's what it's designed for, not the urban jungle (unless maybe it's planted in urban vegetation, but that is at risk from landscapers.)  I think in an urban situation, better "camo" is actually an untaped box.  Because plastic doesn't look as out of place in urban settings as it does "in the wild."<br>

  There's been a LOT of discussion about camo tape since the nonsense in<br>
  Boston. The concern is that average Joe Blow stumbling across a<br>
  'mysterious' package that has clearly been wrapped for disguise will<br>
  over react and yell for the bomb squad. Some locations that allow<br>
  boxes have already stated they must be clear, so that contents may be<br>
  identified without opening the box.<br>
<br>
  I personally have switched to doing partial camo. I'm wrapping camo<br>
  around the sides in a compromise, leaving the top and bottom of the<br>
  container clear. Being an urban boxer, I'd really rather avoid public<br>
  panics :)<br>

I was looking for a box in an city park last year, and there was a ton of<br>
litter in that area of the park.  I almost didn't find the tupperware box<br>
because it was right under my nose and I was mistaking it for just another<br>
piece of litter.  It wasn't in the right place.  Someone or something had<br>
either kicked it or tossed it out nearer the path than it was supposed to be<br>
and out in the open.  But it blended in just perfectly with all the other<br>
litter.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have thought about this issue (bomb scare, etc.) every time I make a box and think about <br>
how best to hide it. Some hiding places don't need camo on the box, but some do. So...<br>
<br>
What has worked well for me with a few of my most "stealth" boxes is to do the camo job <br>
as I like it -- while also keeping some small part of the box clear for seeing through it. <br>
<br>
For instance, one of my boxes is held in place with velcro on the bottom, and the rest of <br>
the box is painted black to blend in with it's urban location. I did not paint the bottom... <br>
so just around all the edges of the velcro, when the box is removed from it's hiding spot, <br>
you can peek in and see that there are no wires, switches, or the like(!)  <br>
<br>
Another I have is painted in outdoor/woods camo paint... and again, I simply left part of <br>
the bottom clear... and hid it with that side to the ground. I keep my fingers crossed that <br>
it's placed again in that same position after finders stamp in and return the box.<br>
<br>
So far (knock on wood) I've had good luck with these camo boxes, and hopefully it's <br>
enough to keep me from getting in trouble with any of the authorities ;-)<br>
