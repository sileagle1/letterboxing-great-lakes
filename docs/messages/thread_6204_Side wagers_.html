I've received the entries from everyone who is listed in the players database, except one -- Beetle I emailed you, please contact me so we can figure out what happened with your entry. Thanks everyone for the great stuff sent for the booty (and the Holiday wishes for SpringChick and OldShoe were also appreciated ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I will be verifying all of the entries today just to make sure nobody has duplicate words or words in the wrong columns -- will email anyone if there is problem.<br/>
<br/>
If you've been crazy busy with holiday happenings and just didn't get a chance to mail your Bingo stuff but want to play, there is still time! Mail has been arriving in 1-3 days so anything going out tomorrow should still make it in time. If you are going to mail tomorrow yet, it might be a good idea to email me a copy of your entry form first, just to make sure that arrives in time -- I am okay with the booty package arriving a day or so behind, but must have your card in time in order to participate in the game.<br/>

It adds an extra element of fun and it's probably good to rotate it around to get some new twists.  The basic rules are in a file called sidewagers 2009.pdf  in the Files section of the message board.  Last year I simply copied what azobox had used before, and just changed it to include my contact info and the current year's date.<br/>
