Each year it will be hosted by a different host at a different <br/>

be "Saturday Morrning Cartoons", "Mythology", or "Where No Man Has <br/>

&gt; &gt; I am willing to volunteer for MI State Annual Gathering mid <br/>

&gt; &gt; Each year it will be hosted by a different host at a different <br/>

&gt; &gt; be "Saturday Morrning Cartoons", "Mythology", or "Where No Man <br/>

fall.  I really like September, warm enough to be fun during the day <br/>

&gt;  But I think we should get some people together from different <br/>

always <br/>

is) <br/>
&gt;  at different times troughout the summer, that way if you really <br/>
&gt;  wanted to go to, lets say MI, but its not being held at the right <br/>
&gt;  time for you, than you can go to another state's gathering close <br/>
by. <br/>
&gt;  I am willing to volunteer for MI State Annual Gathering mid <br/>
summer. <br/>
&gt;  Each year it will be hosted by a different host at a different <br/>
&gt;  location, so as not to be partial to on side of the state or the <br/>
&gt;  other. It will be at Maybury Park (hopefully). The theme will <br/>
&gt;  be "Saturday Morrning Cartoons", "Mythology", or "Where No Man <br/>
Has <br/>
&gt;  Gone Before" (if I can get permission from a co-conspirator). <br/>
There <br/>
&gt;  will be a vote on the date, theme, and if I can think of an <br/>
&gt;  alternate park. Anyone else want to step up to the plate?<br/>

&gt;  &gt; I do like the idea of annual state gatherings.  This was <br/>
actually <br/>
&gt;  sort of what I had in mind when/after I hosted the Mining for <br/>
Boxes <br/>
&gt;  gathering and it was sort of brought up at the Holiday <br/>

fall, <br/>

I <br/>

&gt;  &gt;  &gt; I think that we should host annual state gatherings. <br/>
Initially <br/>
&gt;  the <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; early GL Gathering were small enough and the interest in the <br/>
&gt;  sport <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; itself was small enough that it could accommodate everyone. <br/>
&gt;  There <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  are <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; new members every day and more and more articles every year <br/>
&gt;  that <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  bring <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; in new members. It would be nice that each year it could be <br/>
&gt;  held in <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; different areas of the state. I think it would be helpful <br/>
for <br/>
&gt;  not <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  just <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; teachers but everyone who can't spend the extra money on gas <br/>
to <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  have <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; it locally. It isn't like people from out of state wouldn't <br/>
be <br/>
&gt;  able <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  to <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; come to the other state's events.<br/>

&gt;Ok, ever since we got into letterboxing (6 months ago this friday) I have<br/>
&gt;wanted to have an annual gathering here in the Quad-Cities. Don't know if <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;year will work or not and I will let the group know if there will be one <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;year or not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We don't expect many from this group to be able to attend (as we are so far<br/>
&gt;west), however, many of us Quad-City folk have been planting away to make <br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;a  more enticing area for you all -- a letterboxing haven if you will :-)<br/>
