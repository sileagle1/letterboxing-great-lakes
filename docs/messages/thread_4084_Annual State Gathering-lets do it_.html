                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, who's up for hosting one? We don't have to make it this year. <br>
But I think we should get some people together from different states <br>
and start talking about it! If each state would host one, (I always <br>
feel sorry for MN, it's really far where ever the GL gathering is) <br>
at different times troughout the summer, that way if you really <br>
wanted to go to, lets say MI, but its not being held at the right <br>
time for you, than you can go to another state's gathering close by. <br>
I am willing to volunteer for MI State Annual Gathering mid summer. <br>
Each year it will be hosted by a different host at a different <br>
location, so as not to be partial to on side of the state or the <br>
other. It will be at Maybury Park (hopefully). The theme will <br>
be "Saturday Morrning Cartoons", "Mythology", or "Where No Man Has <br>
Gone Before" (if I can get permission from a co-conspirator). There <br>
will be a vote on the date, theme, and if I can think of an <br>
alternate park. Anyone else want to step up to the plate?<br>
