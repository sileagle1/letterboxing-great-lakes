                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another successful event behind us, it is time to begin looking forward to our next annual Great Lakes event, at least to get the basics nailed down so a venue can be reserved and people can plan ahead.<br>
<br>
First I would like to take the opportunity to thank Speedsquare and her helpers, as well as everyone who has hosted the GLG Gathering over the past 6 years.  Hosting a gathering is a lot of planning and hard work and each one of you has done an awesome job!  Each year the GLG has been thoughtfully planned and has provided an exciting opportunity for Great Lakes letterboxers to come together for a day/weekend in celebration of this hobby we enjoy.  The event has come a long way since our first little get-together in Michigan 7 years ago!<br>
<br>
Having come full circle, with all of the states in the region hosting the event, we are at a crossroads and before moving ahead, I would like some feedback and discussion with the intent of making the annual event for our region continue to be one of the premier letterbox gatherings in the country.  I'm hoping to see some good discussion over the course of the next week or so and then if there is anything requiring a decision, I will put up a poll for voting.<br>
<br>
A few things I'd like to throw out and see ideas on...<br>
<br>
- As letterboxing grows in popularity within the region, we've seen the annual GLG gathering become larger and larger, to the point where it is becoming more difficult to acquire a venue large enough to accommodate the group.  Most states already have their somewhat annual state get-together, as well as many smaller events throughout the year.  Is the continuation of the annual regional event desirable and realistic or have we gotten to the point where we have outgrown it?<br>
<br>
- I realize the timing of the event makes it difficult for some people to attend.  With a group this size, there is never going to be a time of year that is good for everyone, and I do think it is important to establish a date and stick with it so people can plan ahead.  That being said, as we move into a new cycle, I am interested in what the group thinks about the possibility of moving the gathering to another time of year to hopefully make it accessible for some of the folks who have not been able to participate in previous years.  The caveat would be that if the event is moved, the new date would remain consistent throughout the next 6-year rotation.<br>
<br>
- A plan for choosing location moving forward...  two options are 1) open it back up for bids from any state or 2) use the rotation that has been established and start again at the beginning (i.e. Illinois would host in 2010, then Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, Indiana...)<br>
<br>
- Any general feedback about what works really well and what could be improved to make the event even better!<br>

I think the established rotation order works well. (Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, Indiana)It's anice alternation between east and west, roughly speaking, and keeps the Gathering moving regularly across the region. It should be reasonably close to anyone's home base at least every other year, even if certain states are far away for a particular person.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ditto to TJ_Mich’s response. The rotation seems to be working well and we’d like to see it continued.<br>
<br>
To add to TJ_Mich’s response, while the gathering has grown (which is very exciting and cool) we personally didn’t feel it had reached its capacity at this last gathering. (Speedsquare may have another opinion after planning the event. :) Kudos to her and her helpers for taking on the challenge!) Without a doubt, this year’s gathering did seem unusually large. However, in the end several parties did have a change of plans for one reason or another and were unable to attend, which brought the group to a large, but in our mind, workable size. We’ll probably always have a little of that going on. That said, Leapin’ Lizards’ opinion is that we can probably get by for a few more years as is (besides, we’d miss seeing all of our non-cheesehead letterboxing pals each year). :( Perhaps we take another look at adopting state gatherings after this next cycle?<br>
<br>
Settling on a new date for the next cycle might be something to consider. As Spring Chick pointed out, there will never be a perfect date, but it might be nice to switch it up this next cycle so that those who struggled to make or could not make the date in the past have the opportunity to attend. (Ok, ok...so this is my personal shout out to all the teachers and students who are up to their eyeballs with grades, finals and end of the year obligations during the last part of May. Although, I suppose I could always leave John behind and attend the gathering myself...nah!) :)<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts from the Lizards.<br>
<br>
Sara (of Leapin’ Lizards)<br>
<br>
P.S. (Is it wrong to be so excited for next year’s gathering already no matter where or when it may be? ) :)<br>

Events that happen in each individual state are wonderful, but there's something that feels more all-inclusive knowing that this particular event is for the entire region, no matter which state in the region is hosting it. I'm much more likely to make the time and arrangements to drive out to another state for the GLG being held there rather than an individual state gathering, because I know I'll be meeting and reconnecting with 'boxers from all over the region, not just be the token Ohioan at an out-of-state gathering. I see the GLG as our region's culmitive event, and I'd hate to see it go away just yet. <br>
<br>
As for the state rotation and time of year, I'm fine with whatever the majority chooses. <br>

Maybe you could do something like every year move the date ahead by two weeks until the rotation has completed, and then set it back for the next rotation?  You could even have each rotation start two weeks later than it did last time, so each state would end up with a gathering at each of the two week starting points.  Maybe this is way complicated, but it is just a thought for moving the date around and evening out the dates over time between states.  With six states, you could set up permanent weekends, one in May, two in June, two in July, and one in August (or something similar), and play round robin with the rotation.

This was the first Great Lakes Gathering we were able to make because all the rest, I believe, were on Indy 500 weekend, which I always go to. That conflict will always remain for us unless the date is changed. Maybe you could do something like every year move the date ahead by two weeks until the rotation has completed, and then set it back for the next rotation? You could even have each rotation start two weeks later than it did last time, so each state would end up with a gathering at each of the two week starting points. Maybe this is way complicated, but it is just a thought for moving the date around and evening out the dates over time between states. With six states, you could set up permanent weekends, one in May, two in June, two in July, and one in August (or something similar), and play round robin with the rotation. Or something to that effect.<br>

<br>
Personally the begining of June works better, but that's just me.  I say schedule it and I'm sure enough people will come even if it does conflict for others.  There is never a way to make everyone happy.<br>
<br>
I also think setting the limit to whatever the park can hold is reasonable.  Find a good park and then decide how many people can come don't try to find a park that will fit the number of people.  I'd rather not be able to go (because it's full) and others have a great experience than be able to go and have a bad experience.<br>
<br>
Also I'd like to volunteer my skills to gathering coordinators if they want them.  I have wicked computer skills, can create a decent website and am an organizational freak.  I'm limited with travel though, but can do stuff at a distance.  One day I'd love to host the "big one" (i.e. a GLG) but for now I need more experience.  I've only been to 2 events.  I need to start slow.<br>

  Subject: [LbGLK] Great Lakes Gathering... Going Forward<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  Another successful event behind us, it is time to begin looking forward to our next annual Great Lakes event, at least to get the basics nailed down so a venue can be reserved and people can plan ahead.<br>
<br>
  First I would like to take the opportunity to thank Speedsquare and her helpers, as well as everyone who has hosted the GLG Gathering over the past 6 years. Hosting a gathering is a lot of planning and hard work and each one of you has done an awesome job! Each year the GLG has been thoughtfully planned and has provided an exciting opportunity for Great Lakes letterboxers to come together for a day/weekend in celebration of this hobby we enjoy. The event has come a long way since our first little get-together in Michigan 7 years ago!<br>
<br>
  Having come full circle, with all of the states in the region hosting the event, we are at a crossroads and before moving ahead, I would like some feedback and discussion with the intent of making the annual event for our region continue to be one of the premier letterbox gatherings in the country. I'm hoping to see some good discussion over the course of the next week or so and then if there is anything requiring a decision, I will put up a poll for voting.<br>
<br>
  A few things I'd like to throw out and see ideas on...<br>
<br>
  - As letterboxing grows in popularity within the region, we've seen the annual GLG gathering become larger and larger, to the point where it is becoming more difficult to acquire a venue large enough to accommodate the group. Most states already have their somewhat annual state get-together, as well as many smaller events throughout the year. Is the continuation of the annual regional event desirable and realistic or have we gotten to the point where we have outgrown it?<br>
<br>
  - I realize the timing of the event makes it difficult for some people to attend. With a group this size, there is never going to be a time of year that is good for everyone, and I do think it is important to establish a date and stick with it so people can plan ahead. That being said, as we move into a new cycle, I am interested in what the group thinks about the possibility of moving the gathering to another time of year to hopefully make it accessible for some of the folks who have not been able to participate in previous years. The caveat would be that if the event is moved, the new date would remain consistent throughout the next 6-year rotation.<br>
<br>
  - A plan for choosing location moving forward... two options are 1) open it back up for bids from any state or 2) use the rotation that has been established and start again at the beginning (i.e. Illinois would host in 2010, then Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, Indiana...)<br>
<br>
  - Any general feedback about what works really well and what could be improved to make the event even better!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Before much more is proposed and discussed about the next and future Great Lakes gatherings I have been composing something in my head this past week.  I'm not sure I will cover everything in this post, but I need to get my thoughts down on paper before time passes.<br>
<br>
First of all, thank you all for your kind sentiments about the event at Pokagon.  As some of you know I had the notion of hosting this group event for a few years.  It wasn't feasible when we had two mortgages in cities 60 miles apart, and to find a venue that would accommodate an ever-increasing number of attendees wasn't easy.  Indiana State Parks have online reservations and reservations can be made only 1 year in advance.  I missed the opportunity in 2008, so on May 30, 2008 I reserved the Apple Orchard shelter only after the CCC shelter (#1 choice) had been reserved by 7:30AM!  I didn't know on that date if any letterboxers were working on hosting, but I took the risk.<br>
<br>
Pokagon was the obvious choice for location, trails and amenities.  I also enjoy Turkey Run, Brown County and McCormick's Creek for the scenery.  They would have been more difficult for travel.  They are also "southern" if you consider temperatures at this time of year.  I find Central Indiana is on average 7-10 degrees warmer than Chicago and Wisconsin.  As it happened the temperatures were very comfortable at the shelter and on the trails.  A blessing.<br>
<br>
The size of this gathering definitely was manageable.  In the beginning I was very concerned about overflow and party crashers. Sometime in December the sign-ups had met the shelter capacity of 150.  It would be my opinion that some did not attend for economic reasons.   The day before I left (Thursday) there were about 128 sign-ups at Atlas Quest.  When I returned home Sunday night, the sign-ups fell to a number around 110.  We had a few "new folks" that were not signed up anywhere, and a few no-shows.  If this number remains constant, we will find it easier to procure venues.  I do like having this gathering as opposed to splitting up and having individual states hosting 6 annual events.  Some states (at least, my neighbor) already have events on a more frequent basis.<br>
<br>
I had hoped to get more help from Indiana letterboxers I know.  Some have moved out-of-state, some are no longer active, and are leading busier lives.  I worked on details and did my best to keep costs low and affordable for all.  I do not know what the previous events' budgets were, but my target was not to exceed $300 or $2 per attendee (150 max).  I have to mail off the event history book after I add pictures and event information (still undone), but to-date I expended about $250, and free will donations were just shy of $216.   These numbers are rough  I do have an itemized listing should anyone want to know more detail.  I am not complaining about my out-of-pocket expense because I should have been more aware what to expect.  I've been very generous when donating to past events.  So from a group perspective I think a little discussion about costs and expectations should be addressed.  Asking for money is not comfortable for me, but future organizers may benefit from a frank discussion.<br>
<br>
<br>
I truly appreciate Pale Puppy Posse and her organizational skills in taking care of the food.  I do not enjoy that aspect of large parties.  Had it been up to me, I would have headed to the Inn or brown-bagged it.  I enjoyed Doglvrs' roll ups, Tiptoe's tortellini salad, FungusWoman's Nuts4U, and 3 Oreo cookies  which took about 3 hours to finish.<br>
<br>
I hoped I had planned the kind of event you wanted to attend.  After attending 2 previous Great Lakes events, I experienced first hand the fun and chaos.  Too many boxes, too little time?  Or  too few boxes, bored letterboxers?  How much do I need to find for the attendees to do before and after the event?  Too much scheduled, no time for socializing?  All of these things were considered and once I realized I wanted to have the least complicated event, everything else seem to fall into place  from picking a theme to allowing folks to come and go without any time demands.  My goal was to minimize the stress  for you, as well as me.  A nice escape from reality.<br>
<br>
As to the set date for the annual Great Lakes event  I like this weekend and can make it work.  Right now, May is a super busy month for my household.  Mother's Day weekend or Memorial weekend is when our family opens up the lake house  dock, boats, clean the gutters, grounds, etc.  Graduation always seems to fall the night before the letterboxing event.  If the group consensus is "change"  I definitely support the caveat.  SpringChick's comment that this event becomes one of the premier events for the larger LbNA community would suggest we are to encourage and invite boxers outside our region, and changing the date may not be as attractive.  Perhaps we have already set a tradition  one that others have come to plan years in advance?  Who knows?<br>

I believe the GL gathering should continue on the same rotation of states.<br>
<br>
Since there have been times where it has been difficult to get someone to volunteer to host, and the current set date routinely hinders one particular group of individuals (students and teachers) from coming, I believe the date of the event should be up to the person willing to host it (gives them flexibility and more flexibility in who can host).  Just stipulate that it must be some Saturday from the weekend after Mem. Day to the last Sat. of June, and that the date must be set by the host by September the year before so there is plenty of time to plan.  Of course they can set the date earlier.<br>

As others have noted, it is one event that people from many different states will make an effort to attend.  We've really enjoyed attending them for the last 6 years (only missed the first).<br>
<br>
2.  We don't care what weekend or month it is, and also don't care if it is held on a consistent date.  We'd personally advocate one of the 3-day holiday weekends (Memorial Day, 4th of July, or Labor Day) since that allows more time for travel.  However we realize that some people may have extended family commitments on these holiday weekends.<br>
<br>
3.  We'd like to see the event kept in the same state rotation as originally established (ignoring the "extra" year that MI hosted).<br>
<br>
4.  As Speedsquare noted, there are costs involved with hosting the event.  We've hosted 2 larger events in the past and were very pleased that each time the attendee contributions to the DONATIONS box were more than adequate to cover the outright expenses for the event.  I shy away from setting a "per person" suggestion, since it may penalize families and I also realize that people have varying abilities to contribute.  Perhaps suggesting a range for a group or family to cover costs and/or identifying the major costs that need to be covered would reduce the likelihood of falling short.  One way to save costs is to keep the boxes in an area as permanent plants, rather than sending them back in the mail. For the events we hosted, we luckily had very few boxes to return.  Another suggestion for keeping host costs down is to ask attendees to bring other things instead of a food item (such as nametags, etc.)<br>

We're looking forward to attending more events later this year!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">-We definitely would like to see the tradition of the Great Lakes Gathering continue as well! It has become kind of like a "family" reunion of sorts for us, and we look forward to it (and try very hard to make it) each year!<br>
<br>
-We think that the rotation of the states should continue as it has been established (with IL hosting in 2010 and skipping Michigan's extra year) We enjoy looking ahead to where we will be able to go each particular year.....and as someone has already said (TJ MIch?), it seems to work how it is already set up....a nice switching back and forth between east and west each year.<br>
<br>
-As for the date...although having a set date is convenient....we like Dragon's idea for it being up to whoever is hosting the event that year to decide on the exact date (within set parameters). We know that the year we hosted it was definitely much easier for us to have it later in June, and we agree that by being a bit flexible with the date you would have more people who would be able to host and/or help with the gatherings. If we are going to have a set date, however, we would suggest moving it to later in June...when the rush of the school season dies down. (Also, we would prefer it not to be a holiday weekend)<br>
<br>
Well, those are Team Rabbit's thoughts on the matter......<br>

<br>
So, excluding the very first year in Michigan, we will just carry on from the point that the rotation officially got underway -- which means IL will host in 2010, followed by MI, WI, OH, MN, IN.  Tonto should be able to rest easier now knowing that the 2048 will be in WI.<br>
<br>
The feedback about the date was also good and I am in the process of trying to come up with a poll that reflects some of the suggestions that had the most consensus.  Will post this weekend.<br>
