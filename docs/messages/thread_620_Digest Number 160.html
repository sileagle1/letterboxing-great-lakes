Keith,<br>
you are in my neck of the woods!  I am pretty new to this whole  boxing thing <br>
too, but we LOVE it!  We are going to starved rock  tonight!  Yipee!<br>

You will see us (family of 4) dad carrying the youngest 'cuz he got  tied of <br>
walking after 5 minutes...my backpack is a bluejean/denim  pack...but ours <br>

Being relativaly new to letterboxing, I don't  really<br>
have "set" outfit.  But usually, you will see me  alone<br>
wandering aimlessly lost through the woods wearing my<br>
work  shirt (usually hit Starved Rock, Buffalo Rock, or<br>
Mathessien since  they are about 10min from work) and<br>
studying the clues in my  hands.  I will be the one<br>
that people will be staring at and  wondering what I am<br>
up to, sometimes I even get asked if I am having  a<br>
mental lapse....oh wait, maybe I am...who on earth in<br>
their  right mind would spend hours and hours looking<br>
for a little plastic  box to stamp...we do of course,<br>
us of a different breed.   <br>

Hmmmm, let's see first there's the 2 of us wandering around in circles <br>
and up and down the same hill 15 times... The backpacks probably <br>
wouldn't be a give away they're fairly standard.  There's always the <br>
clothes - I'm the one bundled up in jeans and  "sunscreen tops" and hats <br>
so nothing shows when everyone else is in shorts and t-shirts. (skin <br>
cancer 20 years ago so I need to be careful).<br>
<br>
Probably the biggest clue would be me taking photos of moss on tress <br>
from 1 inch away every time someone walks by. (I have more pictures of <br>
moss now, but I LOVE the macro mode on the camera). We've gotten asked a <br>
number of times if we're scientists.  I guess macro photography makes a <br>
good cover....<br>
