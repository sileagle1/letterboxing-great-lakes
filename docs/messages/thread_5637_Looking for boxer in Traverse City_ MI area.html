                    <div class="plaintext-content">I live in Florida, but I've taken an interest in Matt the Rat's 45th<br/>
Parallel series.  I found two in the Traverse City vicinity back in<br/>
2005.  One was in terrible shape, and I'd like to see if I could help<br/>
it a bit.  I'm willing to hand-carve a replacement stamp (the<br/>
originals were custom-made), but before I go to that effort I'd like<br/>
to know if there's anyone in the vicinity that would then perform the<br/>
actual service.<br/>
<br/>
No, not now -- I understand this is a poor time of year for boxing in<br/>
that area.  I'm talking about spring or summer.<br/>
<br/>
I have already carved three similar stamps and sent them to someone in<br/>
Maine for planting along the 45th Parallel in that area.<br/>
