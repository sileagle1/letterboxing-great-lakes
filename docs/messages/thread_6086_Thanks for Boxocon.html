Also, our personal Thanks to Aimlesst for helping us when we arrived, not knowing what to expect and we were a bit nervous, she gave such a great welcome and showed us what to do to get started. It was very nice allowing us to attend even though we weren't signed up. We were sorry to miss meeting most of you, but there's always next time. <br>
<br>
The location is beautiful, we are looking forward to getting back up there to finish up what we missed, hopfully while the trees are in full color.<br>
<br>
Thanks again to Aimlesst for everything and Happy Hunting to all!<br>
