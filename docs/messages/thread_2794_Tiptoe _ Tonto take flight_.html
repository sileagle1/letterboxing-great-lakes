Windy City Trib Travel section received by the Travel Team shows<br>
Tiptoe and Tonto celebrating their "Around the World in 80 Days"<br>
success aboard a hot air balloon!<br>
<br>
Sure enough, the exited couple is pictured reveling in their<br>
achievement of completing the 80 Days adventure within the requisite<br>
time to gain the bonus stamp in addition to the "World Traveler" box.<br>
<br>
Insider reports to the Travel Team also reveal that the Illinois<br>
letterboxers logged more than 800 miles of mostly Michigan driving<br>
over the last couple of months. As with many letterboxing couples, one<br>
of the two exhibited tremendous patience through this adventure.<br>
<br>
Congratulations to Tiptoe and Tonto!<br>
