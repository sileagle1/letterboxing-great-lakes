I'm looking for information for the Great Lakes gather 2009 Info. Where are<br>
people staying? I know some are camping, Are spots still available? If some<br>
are lodging, which hotels are close by?<br>
<br>
I was going to come just for the day But now I'm thinking I might want to<br>
make a weekend of it. It sounds like such a fun time.<br>
