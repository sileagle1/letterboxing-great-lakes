                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today we decided to check on the boxes we've placed to see how they <br/>
were doing and take care of any necessary maintenance.  Since we've <br/>
only placed 5 so far, and they're fairly near each other, it wasn't a <br/>
huge undertaking.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately we discovered that one is GONE!  Of course this was a <br/>
disappointment, but it is one of the risks of the "game".  When we <br/>
initially placed "Brookfield Junction" we were worried that it might <br/>
not survive spring flooding.  However the water levels are fairly low <br/>
this year so we weren't concerned about it as we traipsed out to <br/>
check it.  But when we got to the trestle all that we found was the <br/>
outer ziploc bag (secured in place).  We searched around the area, <br/>
but saw no sign of box or contents.  We'll check again in a few weeks <br/>
to see if by some REMOTE chance someone returns it.  I've added a <br/>
note to the clues in the database accordingly.  We'll delete the box <br/>
if it doesn't reappear.  (There's no other viable spot to hide a box <br/>
out there, and since the first was taken we don't want to risk <br/>
another.)  FOr those of you who did find it, you're now in possession <br/>
of a "limited edition" stamp!<br/>
<br/>
The other four boxes were just fine:<br/>
- Wirth Park<br/>
- Foxbrook Park<br/>
- Lucky Leprechaun<br/>
- Capone's Cargo<br/>
<br/>
We both agreed it was a shame we couldn't check on our adopted box <br/>
today - we're sure it was MUCH nicer on the beach in Hawaii than <br/>
braving the nippy winds here in Wisconsin!<br/>
