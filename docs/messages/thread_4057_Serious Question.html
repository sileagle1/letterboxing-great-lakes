                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree with Mosey.  I certainly understand your effort and think your heart was in the right place.  It really isn't one of those things you think about, rather just do because it seemed right at the time and possibly almost a tribute to this person.  I myself have recarved a missing stamp from another person's box that I had adopted (dropped out of letterboxing, not deceased) in an effort to keep the box alive.<br>
<br>
But in retrospect, I think that taking care of boxes planted by another person should be limited to general maintenance and once a critical piece of the box is unavailable, the box and clues should be retired since at that point, the box would no longer be the creation of the original planter.  With the abundance of letterboxes available in most areas of the country, there really is no need to perpetuate a box unto oblivion, rather they are planted, they exist for a finite length of time and then they are gone, often to be replaced by a new box with a fresh theme and clues.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Hart!<br>
There has been quite a bit of discussion on the "big board" recently on a similar topic.  Here are excerpts from some emails I sent to someone earlier this week regarding this subject:<br>
I personally believe that if a box is gone, it's gone.  No reason to have it continue indefinitely.  In some sense it is a "limited edition".  I'd rather see people placing new boxes of their own than "recreating" someone else's.<br>
I view letterboxing as a dynamic, not static, environment with some boxes disappearing and new ones appearing.  I don't have any desire to see every box maintained into perpetuity.<br>
I'll do maintenance on a box (baggies, logbook, container, etc) but I would never recarve a stamp to a box that wasn't mine.  If the stamp is gone, the box is done unless the owner decides to replace it.  I have adopted one box that exists and the owners were unreachable by LBNA.  I simply adopted it so the clues were still accessible to people, since the box was still in place.  If the box disappears, I'll delete the clues.  I wouldn't recarve someone else's stamp.  I don't plan to replace all of my own boxes if they disappear and would have no desire for anyone else to replace them for me. <br>

I thing what you did and are doing is beautiful and seems <br>

to reflect that this it is a re-creation of the original by xyz, but <br>
the legacy left was a meaningful one so you choose to continue it, <br>
