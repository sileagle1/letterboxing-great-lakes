I didn't consider you snapping at me.  This is the first time I <br/>
chimmed in actually.  I just saw the potential for our group to be <br/>
divided with this argument.  I was just offering a solution.  I still <br/>
do plan to go ahead with another gathering later in the summer for <br/>
whomever wants to come.  That way we get a double letterboxing fix.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do like the idea of annual state gatherings.  This was actually sort of what I had in mind when/after I hosted the Mining for Boxes gathering and it was sort of brought up at the Holiday Survivor "mini-meet."  We probably would have planned one last fall, but I had heard a rumor that some of the N. Illinois people had something in the works and then the year sort of ran out of time.<br/>
