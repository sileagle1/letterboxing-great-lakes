We came down to Illinois a day early and had a great day of boxing.  We <br>
did 2 series on longer hikes and also did a few "drive-by" boxes.  We <br>
located 19 boxes and were able to log into 17 of them (yep, 2 more <br>
FROZEN IN PLACE boxes that we'll have to return to sometime after <br>
things thaw out!)<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to seeing everyone (or at least a LOT of you - I <br>
see the expected attendance is now 64 people!) tomorrow at the SILO <br>
Mardi Gras event.  <br>

LOL at myself - if you are trying to make sure there's a box planted in <br>

I went searching in Koshkonong Mounds Park today for a place to hide a <br>
box, when I accidentally found the existing box.  I guess great minds <br>
DO think alike when looking for a good hiding place in a park with <br>
limited options.  And yes, once again, Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man <br>
had been there before me... :)<br>

We can't wait to see all the floats!  We've both come up with a guess as to how many floats will actually be in the parade.  I'll try to photograph all of them for those that can't make it tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Also happy to see that the Christmas Elves will be attending w/the new little elf!<br>
