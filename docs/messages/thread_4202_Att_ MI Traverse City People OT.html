know of a good cottage to rent up there that has room for 4 couples <br/>
and 3 kids? And has stuff for the kids to do and on a lake? I really <br/>
would like to go durring the cherry festival but I think that it is an <br/>
impossible dream. I heard that these LBs up there are some of the <br/>
best, but I chose not to tell my family that (smirk).<br/>
