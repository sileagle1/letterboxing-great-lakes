Well than try to solve this one.<br>
<br>
If you want to find a stamp,<br>
Than you will have to find our camp.<br>
<br>
Make sure you look up the map on our scheduled weekend date,<br>
So as not to confuse the campgrounds booked state.<br>
<br>
The chinese zodiac was fun last year<br>
But our site will have none of those hear.<br>
<br>
Santa's helpers are very near,<br>
But not the same lettered section I do fear.<br>
<br>
When we have to answer natures call <br>
We wont be but 3 site over from the stall.<br>
<br>
In our lettered section there is only one to be seen<br>
And in the morning you will see us going there to get quite clean.<br>
