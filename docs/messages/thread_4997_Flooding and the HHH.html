                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hope everyone is enjoying the weekend!  We took the opportunity to <br>
double check our HHH boxes.  We are happy to report that we were able to <br>
find two of the boxes that had been underwater just a few weeks ago.  <br>
Unfortunately, we decided to remove 'Defender of the HHH' since it had <br>
floated ~40ft from its hiding place.  Since we now have a better feel <br>
for how often the area floods, we decided not to press our luck any <br>
further (nor force finders to squish through the mud or potentially <br>
knee-high water), and  we retired the box.  The image of the backside of <br>
the stamp is posted with the clue if you desire to search for the HHH <br>
(which we were happy to find safe in its hiding spot). <br>
<br>
The remaining HHH boxes will be available through the summer after which <br>
we will likely retire the series.  For those of you who won't have a <br>
chance to find them (or those of you that have), we will likely be <br>
hiding a second HHH series sometime later in the summer or fall.  These <br>
will be an entirely new set of stamps, but they will be grouped like the <br>
current HHH series with the bonus box to find after finding the other <br>
clues.  This time we will be sure to plant them somewhere that will stay <br>
drier throughout the year!<br>
