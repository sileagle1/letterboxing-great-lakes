                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, the clue is very vague for this letterbox. It<br>
makes it seem that the box is just a hop, skip, and a<br>
jump when in reality it's about 2 1/2 miles away over<br>
a sand dune. The mileage on the clue is incorrect<br>
according to the trail map. AND if you want to go back<br>
to your car you either have to A: go back the way you<br>
came (back over the dune)or B: go the alternate route<br>
which will involve begging a park ranger to take you<br>
back to the car if you parked at the nature trailhead<br>
in the first place. But you're correct, I probably<br>
shouldn't have publicly suggested to give an alternate<br>
route. I think I will probably e-mail the placers and<br>
see if they might want to post the alternative<br>
themselves or at least amend their clue to place a<br>
degree of difficulty on it. 'Cause it ain't easy<br>
folks!!! I really had no idea how difficult this one<br>
was, and I'm one to do a lot of research before<br>
heading out. <br>

However, it was a beautiful spot with beautiful scenes<br>
of Lake Michigan!<br>

about its current status and got back a warning that I should be prepared <br>
for a long hike.  I was grateful for the warning and decided not to try to <br>
fit it into an already busy day.  After hearing these details I'm very glad <br>
I took a pass.  On the other hand, there are times when knowing that a box <br>
is a challenging hike would make it all the more attractive, so I think it <br>
would be great if the clues were amended to provide that information.  I <br>
also think that in these post-Time magazine days, a box that's a good <br>
challenging hike has much more chance of being there when we go look for <br>
it.  (Though, of course, we'd be all the more disappointed if it were not).<br>

what you are getting into (either time or distance or even a <br>
difficulty rating), if for no other reason than to have water along.<br>
<br>
After finding the box, we took the suggested way back, hoping it <br>
would be shorter than the route we took in.  Nope.  We had thought <br>
about taking what is the alternate route you referred to, but were <br>
afraid we wouldn't be able to find a way back to the vehicle as it <br>
was off-season.<br>
