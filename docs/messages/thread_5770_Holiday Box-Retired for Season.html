Odd, only three sets of people found it this year.  I don't know if that <br/>
is because: (A) many folks in the area already have this stamp (B) it <br/>
was a cold/snowy winter with less boxing opportunities or (C) we coded <br/>
it this year.  If it is 'A', please let us know and we'll carve a new <br/>
stamp for this next year.<br/>

I was at the gathering when this stamp was first revealed, but for some reason I never saw it.  I planned to find it this winter, but the reason is "B" - too much snow and ice this winter.  Those conditions also contributed to a severe epidemic of letterboxer's cabin fever for some of us. In the future, I'll look for this box to be posted again.  But I had a great time finding Joined and Monk last weekend!  <br/>
