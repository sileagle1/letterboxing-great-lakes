They are small round tokens that you create your own design for. I see them kind of like the new patch (ok, all you patch people out there, don't get to offended by that). You can hook them onto your jacket, key chain, backpack or hiking stick.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a web site with some examples http://www.pathtags.com/<br/>
<br/>
You can see there is a pretty hefty start up cost that includes the design &amp; colors, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We, the planning crew of the GLG, would like your input by placing a vote in the poll I just put up.<br/>
<br/>
1) No, don't invest in the pathtags.<br/>
2) Yes, offer them at cost (not sure how much that would be yet)<br/>
3) Yes, offer them if someone pays X amount of $ for the raffle.<br/>
<br/>
Option three would be if someone buys $10, $15 or $20 worth of tickets for the raffle to be held, they would get a pathtag. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure how a pathtag for hiking X number of miles would tie into a gathering.  Are we to expect some REALLY long hikes between boxes at the gathering? Or would you have to prove you hiked that number of miles before attending it to receive your patch?  If just getting one by donating $X to a raffle...that negates the value of the pathtag concept.  Wouldn't that just make it an event patch???  I'm missing something.<br/>
<br/>
That being said...sure...I have room on my hiking stick for more doodads!<br/>

<br/>
These will have nothing to do with how far you hike -- I just used that as  <br/>
an example. Nitrocat is in charge of Pathtags for hiking distances for the <br/>
state  of Illinois (FYI).<br/>
<br/>
These pathtags will have the image of the Event Stamp for the GLG and will  <br/>
be a little "token" more or less "proove" you were there -- much like a  <br/>
patch.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can add one more layer of information about the Pathtags v. Treasure <br/>
Hike pathtags.<br/>
<br/>
Pathtags don't have any official connection to hiking distances---but <br/>
what several of us across the country did was USE pathtags as a reward <br/>
for hiking x number of miles while letterboxing and have called them <br/>
various things including Treasure Hike (pathtags).  It is my <br/>
understanding that pathtags were originally used (and still are) as a <br/>
signature "stamp" or tag and folks can just trade them.  I saw quite a <br/>
few down at the event in Gatlinburg this past year and they are gorgeous!<br/>
<br/>
You can have them made for anything including the event!  But the <br/>
Treasure Hike pathtags are earned and are not connected to raffles etc.  <br/>
Most states that have started their Treasure Hike program and who used a <br/>
pathtag as the award, ended up with a cost of around $3-$4 and it varies <br/>
with the number of colors you use on the tag.  **Give yourself PLENTY of <br/>
time to order these if you decide to have them made.**<br/>
<br/>
I was/am on the original group who helped start the Treasure Hike <br/>
Program, but here in Ohio we opted to do the patches instead of the <br/>
pathtags and so I can't help you directly with more of the actual <br/>
mechanics.  If you ask your questions on the public AQ Treasure Hike <br/>
Program board, I'm positive you will get the web sites and other <br/>
information you need to order tags. <br/>
