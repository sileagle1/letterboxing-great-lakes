The little "bunnies" are working on their cards, as we speak, so they can play along at home. Last year Rainy-Day Rabbit would have won 1st place in the full card if she had been playing for real.....she covered her card a couple of days before the real winner had a Bingo on here ...and she used almost ALL general terms (so that should give some hope to those of us who aren't able to use many/any events, boxes or exchanges on their cards :-) <br/>
<br/>
Good luck to everyone!! Let the fun begin!! <br/>
<br/>
And Happy New Year!!<br/>
