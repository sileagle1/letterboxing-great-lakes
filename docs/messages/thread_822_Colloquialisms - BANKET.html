good old Dutch recipes put out by the Holland Junior League.  I'm sure I can<br/>
find you a Banket recipe in there.  Now, I just need to find where I put<br/>
that cookbook (I got it for a wedding present over 20 years ago).<br/>
<br/>
BTW -- if you don't speak Dutch and are wondering what Eet Smakelijk means,<br/>
it translates to "eat well and with taste."<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bonket? Silly me! I thought it was pronounced: bl - long A - ket!!<br/>
&gt; ROFL ... no wonder the guy at the Dutch bakery looked at me so funny<br/>
&gt; when I asked for some for the office Christmas party last year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I bought four of those fantastic almond pastry treats for our party<br/>
&gt; and they were gone almost instantly.  Later that night, one of the<br/>
&gt; locum tenens Doc's was "caught" in the kitchen wolfing down a whole<br/>
&gt; one of the 'logs' and drinking milk straight out of the carton.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His confession, "I haven't had this since I left home for Med<br/>
&gt; School." (We forgave him, and he personally made Olie Bollen for<br/>
&gt; those of us working the Urgent Care Center on New Years Eve.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Enjoy!<br/>
&gt; ---PJ<br/>
&gt; who would LOVE to know how to make this too-tasty-for-words-treat!!<br/>
