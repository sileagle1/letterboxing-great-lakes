a brief report I posted on the PacificNorthwest board:<br>
<br>
Hi!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We thought we'd post a brief report on our great trip to the Portland area.<br>
We began by spending 5 days in the Columbia River gorge. There were an<br>
amazing variety of waterfalls and it was fun to walk behind some of them!<br>
We especially enjoyed the free fall drop of Latourell Falls and Tunnel<br>
Falls.  Up on the high points we usually had very good views of the river<br>
gorge (except on our way up Dog Mountain, when we were hiking in a cloud).<br>
Another highlight on some of our hikes were the blackberries - fat, sweet<br>
and juicy and more plentiful than we could believe!  We ended up having<br>
stained hands not from our inkpads, but from gobbling up so many berries. It<br>
was also interesting to see those fat slugs in a variety of colors (however<br>
THEY certainly didn't look very appetizing!)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Since we enjoy hiking in the mountains, we chose to do some of the more<br>
challenging hikes.  These included Angel's Rest, Nesmith Point, Dog<br>
Mountain, Hamilton Mountain, Triple Falls and Tunnel Falls. We found lots of<br>
boxes along the way and especially appreciate the people that place boxes on<br>
longer hikes (Green Tortuga of course, Funhog, Der Mad Stamper and Double<br>
Tree).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We enjoyed doing the Tunnel Falls hike with Funhog and Pungent Bob and<br>
appreciated Funhog organizing a dinner at a brewpub that evening.  It was<br>
great to meet some of the local boxers, including Der (famous) Mad Stamper!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We spent the next 2 days at State Parks.  We had a very busy and long day at<br>
Silver Falls.  Once again we enjoyed a variety of waterfalls and took a VERY<br>
BUMPY road way back in to find a box series in a remote area.  Unfortunately<br>
we couldn't get to the best access point for one of the Green Tortuga's<br>
boxes - the road to the trailhead was gated and we were told we would<br>
probably be ticketed if we parked there.  Since we didn't have enough time<br>
left in the day to take the longer route, we had to pass it by.  The next<br>
day was a little more low-key at Milo McIver Park where we did some shorter<br>
walks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We spent the last 2 days in the Mount Hood area.  We hiked around Trillium<br>
Lake, up to Twin Lakes and Mirror Lake the first day.  That night we headed<br>
into Gresham where Maiden had organized another group dinner.  We<br>
appreciated her efforts to help us meet more local boxers and it was another<br>
fun night of exchanging stories and signature stamps.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our last day in the area we hiked to the pretty Ramona Falls and then hiked<br>
up to McNeil Point.  This was our absolute favorite hike of the whole trip!!<br>
Fantastic views of Mount Hood and the surrounding mountain ranges in the<br>
distance.  Even heard the glacier crack/rumble!  And as the icing on the<br>
cake, we were successful in finding the box on the trail - but it certainly<br>
wasn't a quick find...  A definite sense of accomplishment since we're not<br>
really too good at picture clues.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We placed 2 boxes during our trip and will post clues soon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for all your hospitality and the great boxes!<br>

P.S.  We've sent individual messages to all the placers to give a status<br>
update on the boxes we looked for.  If anyone is curious to see the list of<br>
those we attempted, you can see it at:<br>
