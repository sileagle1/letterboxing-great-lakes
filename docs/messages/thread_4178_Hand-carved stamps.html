                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to let everyone know that yesterday I braved 90-degree weather <br>
and screeching, buzzing cicadas and rode Ginger in to update my <br>
"Kinnickinnick" letterbox.  I removed the original (commercial) rubber stamp <br>
and replaced it with a hand-carved stamp.  ALL of my planted boxes now have <br>
hand-carved stamps (with the exception of "Sgt. Snuffy" which has a stamp <br>
custom-made for that box).<br>
<br>
My friend Fred (who goes by the nickname "krait") has been carving these <br>
stamps for me.  He is VERY talented at this!  Unfortunately he has physical <br>
problems that keep him from being able to hike very far, and so hasn't been <br>
able to get out and do any letterboxing himself.  But he likes the fact that <br>
"his" stamps are out there for others to find and enjoy.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any recommendations for easy "drive-by" stamps in the north <br>
central area of Illinois I'd be glad to pass them on to Fred.<br>
