                    <div class="plaintext-content">We planted a new series today... Hollywood Hike in Kenosha WI.<br>
<br>
Clues posted on Atlasquest, but we DID start it with a higher F <br>
count because I wanted to be sure those who did this one were <br>
familiar with the idea of being VERY discreet, and being very <br>
conscious of the environment where you tread. <br>
<br>
The series is in an AMAZING place, but of course, the caretakers do <br>
not know the boxes are there. While I think they would respect the <br>
way most Letterboxers feel about nature, I think they would also <br>
imagine a whole buttload of people heading out to trample their <br>
woods. LOL<br>
<br>
So... incognito is the word folks... and if you DO head out, and are <br>
concerned about a box's location, I have NO problems with you moving <br>
it, or removing it for us to replace somewhere else. I don't want to <br>
see these found by the wrong people! We took alot of time and <br>
planning to get this series out there, and we certainly think we <br>
found a VERY special place to send you to find them... not to <br>
mention the lovely stamps you will find.<br>

the online sites - In which case, I will post the clues here for all <br>
to see! <br>
<br>
We certainly did not mean to NOT include long time Lb'rs, but moreso <br>
out of concern - my concern is that if ONE box is found locally there, <br>
the others may be looked up by the wrong people - so.... hence my <br>
hiding it.<br>
<br>
When you visit the location, you will understand!<br>
 <br>
And... the clues will soon be in the Files section! <br>
