<br/>
Congratulations on your find.  I found a LS&amp;B box this week and now I only need to find one more in the series.  LS&amp;B told me that they will be placing some new series letterboxes in WI.  Looks like you found one of their new boxes.  Triple Wohoo!!!  <br/>
<br/>
I was asked to come in and work at 3:45 am.  ROFLOL!  No way!!! It was agreed that I could come in and work Fri, Sat, Sun till closing instead.  I'd much rather work the afternoon/night shift till 11:00 pm or 12 midnight.  I don't do mornings very well.  I feel your pain.  Drink coffee!  <br/>

adults.  However tomorrow morning we'll be off on the hunt (and the plant)<br/>
for the rest of the weekend.  Hope to meet up with a Connecticut boxer in<br/>
Madison tomorrow and perhaps Optic in Chippewa Falls on Saturday.  We've<br/>
planted 3 of the "WI Firsts" boxes over the last 2 weekends (still need to<br/>
post the clues) and hope to plant several more this weekend.  We also hope<br/>
to plant our winnings from the "County Fair Cake Walk" and a few more in my<br/>
WI State Symbols series during the course of the weekend.  We'll see how far<br/>
we get with this limited daylight!  Less than a month to go until the days<br/>
start getting longer again....<br/>
<br/>
We hope everyone had a nice Thanksgiving!<br/>

As of last week it had been reported that all 11 of the state parks slated to be closed would remain open as our "wonderful" governor restored part of the budget cuts that were made. I know for sure that Kickapoo is staying open and I'd bet that Castle Rock is also staying open.<br/>
