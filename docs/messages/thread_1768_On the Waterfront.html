As my trail name might imply, horses are a very important part of my life, always have been, and (so far) they DO rank above my letterboxing hobby :)<br>
<br>
As for local boxes - there are some hidden in Rockford and many hidden AROUND Rockford.  I believe RagsEnigma is actually going to plant a box in downtown Rockford just for the OTW festival.  <br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

  Hey, all you Rockfordians!  I'll be attending On the Waterfront Sunday with<br>
  some friends and family (all Noxers, alas!).  I won't be able to drive<br>
  around looking for anything, but are there any boxes to be had in the area<br>
  of the festival?  Anyone going to be around for exchanges??<br>

We also met up with old HS friends and saw Better Than Ezra and Lifehouse in<br>
