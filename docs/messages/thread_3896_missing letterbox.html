Our almost 2 year old begged to go out letterboxing today!!  We told <br>
him we would go yesterday and didn't and he never forgot.  We got out <br>
to Maybury State Park and found Laika and Lovebirds, which leaves only <br>
one box left at Maybury for us to find.<br>
It was a beautiful day.  Our son will get the box out of its hiding <br>
spot if we point him in the right direction.  Although we still need <br>
to work with him on the ink pads.;)<br>
We must have just missed other boxers as there was a stamp before us <br>
from today.  From then on we were eyeing everyone suspiciously.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the info on Hiro and Joy.  I'm not surprised it went <br>
missing.  I emailed the placers after finding it, telling them (gently, <br>
I hope) that it really needed to be moved.  It's in a very well-tended <br>
garden, and required moving delicate plants to reach it.  It was buried <br>
in the ground when I found it, and I don't approve of making <br>
letterboxers dig up a private garden.  However, I think the placers <br>
weren't regular letterboxers, even at the time - they just planted that <br>
one box and disappeared.  Thanks for sharing with the list that it's <br>
gone now.  Hope you had fun in Maybury!<br>
