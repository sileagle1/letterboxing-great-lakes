 <br>
I was in Freeport, IL this weekend hunting for River Rat and Nature <br>
Nerd's Krape Park Treasure Hunt Series (what a beautiful park!) and<br>
as I'm walking down some stone steps I ran into another letterboxer <br>
that already had the Waterfall box out!  I never thought I'd get to do <br>
an exchange that didn't happen at a gathering.  He introduced himself <br>
as Wwwaverider and we went off to find the next box, Merry-Go-Round, <br>
together.  Sadly, we ran out of luck on that one.  It was still a <br>
beautiful day for boxing, though.  I did all of those boxes completely <br>
out of order because I got turned around when coming into the park, so <br>
I followed Wwaverider to the final two boxes in the series and <br>
entertained myself watching him work his way through the clues as I<br>
had done earlier in the day.  Since we found the boxes in different<br>
order, we got to share First Finder honors as well :).  <br>
<br>
So how often has this happened to others?<br>

It happens (or rather *almost* happens) to me and Flying Dragon more often that I would have thought considering the lack of local boxers.  The first time, we were up in the Chicago area and passed two ladies that had to have been letterboxers on the muddy, muddy way to "Oh Deer, I can't Sleep" but I was too shy to actually approach them.  Then, we went after Katy's biology series here in Allerton Park and were right behind Team Armadillo for the first two but beat them to the third and met them on our way out.  And Flying Dragon was looking for my Camp Camfield boxes down by lake Shelbyville (this was the one that REALLY surprised me since no one ever goes down there!) and was right behind another pair of boxers for the first three, then got ahead of them, but never actually met them.  <br>

I've only met other letterboxers on the trail once, and it was actually<br>
in the parking lot.  We were looking for the correct trail head (we only<br>
saw one sign and it was the wrong trail) and they pointed us in the right <br>
direction.  A weird silence ensued and then they asked if we were<br>
letterboxers.  When we exchanged stamps, we realised we had been right<br>
behind them all afternoon!  We commiserated about the more impossible<br>
clues for the park and passed along clues for boxes in a nearby park that <br>
they hadn't known about and then went upon our merry way.  <br>
<br>
Ever since that, though, when we've been unable to find a box and certain <br>
that we are in the right place, I wonder if we aren't just two steps<br>
behind some one and they have the box in their hot little hands at that<br>
moment...  <br>

Actually, that's how Deedle & I encountered our first<br>
(and so far only) exchange on the trail.  We'd gone to<br>
find the Lake Medina box here in Ohio one Saturday<br>
morning, and as we were sitting around the lake<br>
stamping in and making sure that none of the dog<br>
walkers were watching us, a woman with a small bag<br>
walked into view.  She also had a sheet of paper in<br>
her hand, and Deedle started whispering, "She's a<br>
letterboxer!"  Well, sure enough, after a few minutes<br>
of watching her, she was walking and pausing at all<br>
the spots the clues told you to, so just before she<br>
was ready to go into the woods to find the box that<br>
was still in my lap, we walked over and said, "Excuse<br>
us, are you looking for this?" and held out the box.  <br>
<br>
If you ever spot Deedle & me on the trail, there<br>
should be no mistaking that we're letterboxers...I've<br>
got an LbNA patch on our bagpack, and Deedle has an<br>
LbNA logo medallion on his walking stick.<br>
