<br/>
In spite of the bad weather, we had quite a few people from out of town.  It was quite a nice turn out, actually.  I never actually managed to count heads, but I believe we had more than twenty people.  The logbook workshop was more popular than I thought it would be and was saved by Ish, who just happened to have thread and needles handy as part of her pack (I totally forgot about needles and managed to blank on the thread just before leaving the house).  Everyone who participated was very patient and gracious about sharing the somewhat limited supplies.  <br/>
<br/>
We had a few special events at this meeting.  Today was Flying Dragon's birthday...so we of course had to eat cake and sing him Happy Birthday.  This also meant that attendees had the oportunity to stamp into the Happy Birthday Bonfire letterbox.  This was a first-time event for many of the attendees.  Most notably, little Emily of the Cottontails made her debute.  And finally, the raffle raised over $100 to go towards the maintenance of the LbNA website.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to send out a huge thanks to everyone who came today.  Without wonderful attendees like you, this event could never have been a success!  Flying Dragon, Katy and I all had a great time and are looking forward to the next event, when we will get to meet some of you again and maybe even more new friends.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sure I'm speaking for all who attended by saying "Thank You" for <br/>
the effort that Flying Dragon, Katy &amp; yourself put into the <br/>
gathering.  As a newbie, I had a great time &amp; learned a lot.  I <br/>
can't even imagine what it will be like at the GLK2007 gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I got to meet several new people, put faces to trail names and even <br/>
discovered a recent acquaintance also "boxes."<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry that some people were unable to attend due to the weather, <br/>
yet I'm also happy others made the trip - by looking at my log, I <br/>
think at least 1/2 the attendees were driving at least 2 hrs.<br/>
<br/>
I had a great time &amp; can't wait for Forest Glen.  I've already got <br/>
it on the calendar - tentatively.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for making my first "gathering" a success!!<br/>
