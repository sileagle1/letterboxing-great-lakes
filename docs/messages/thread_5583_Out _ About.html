                    <div class="plaintext-content">With a clue that reads "Homemade blueberry pancakes" (and maybe add some hot coffee too) ....sounds like a good reason to go in search of a letterbox in the winter.  Enjoy the pancakes.  If they're truly exceptional, you'll have to share the clue with us so we can go searching for those homemade pancakes too.  <br/>

Now, I've got a taste for pancakes!<br/>
