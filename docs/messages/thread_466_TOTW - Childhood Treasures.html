                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is scary...did we ALL have cigar boxes of stuff??  And yes, I <br/>
still have mine...it too was (correction...IS) a sturdy wooden one.  <br/>
The goofiest stuff inside.  Everything from the multicolored counting <br/>
sticks I received in first grade (remember those?  Colored balsa wood <br/>
sticks...) to pen-and-ink drawing nibs from high school, name tag <br/>
from my job at college (dishroom in the dorm), ex-boyfriend's college <br/>
football schedule, a little toy from the dentist's prize box (okay, <br/>
these are NOT listed in chronological order!  The dentist visit came <br/>
WAY before college!).  I wonder if this is an indication of some <br/>
genetic predisposition towards letterboxing.  Although I did not hide <br/>
and seek the stuff...just packratted it away.<br/>
<br/>
The only treasure hunting I can recall at the moment was when my dad <br/>
would collect a red tin can full of pennies.  He would then dump and <br/>
scatter them and my brother and I would hunt for them.  Hey, at least <br/>
that activity MADE me some money instead of costing it!<br/>
