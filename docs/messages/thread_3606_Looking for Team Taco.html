<br/>
However, I do have some of their mystery clues (Horus, Osiris and Isis, <br/>
Thoth, and Terrified Tree) saved on my computer from when I emailed them <br/>
probably 6 months or so ago.  If you want those and send me the answers <br/>
to their trivia, hopefully they wouldn't mind if I passed them on to <br/>
you.  Quick poll though: do people think this is kosher if/since TT <br/>
isn't responding to emails?  I wouldn't want to distribute clues without <br/>
permission, but I would think they would provide them for anyone who <br/>
answers the trivia questions correctly.<br/>

If someone has a different email address for them, perhaps they can try to contact them to confirm that it is OK to release their clues to other letterboxers.  If they still don't answer within a week or two, or if no one has any other contact info, I think it would be OK to share the clues with other boxers.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Regarding passing of the clues.  If they have been pulled cuz the "Team" has changed their minds about boxing, you may be sending them on a wild goose chase.  I too got the mystery clues and figured out the locations, but no box to be found.  Maybe the chatter on this board will get a response from Team Taco.<br/>
