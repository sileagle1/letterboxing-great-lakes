Hey, I just discovered another yahoo group!  Lots of old letterboxes with clues that are not <br>
listed on the LBNA main site.  I guess some are abandoned and need adoption.  I printed <br>
the clues for the ONE Indiana box, and hope to find it next spring.  I might consider <br>
adopting it, just to get the clues back on the active site.  Anyone else closer want to adopt <br>
it?<br>
<br>
There seem to be a number of OHIO and WISCONSIN boxes too.<br>

You can read about the origins of the letterbox-basement on the main <br>
list, in messages 35994, 36026, and 36045. <br>
<br>
If I remember correctly, it houses all of the clues to letterboxes <br>
that were on the "old" letterboxing.org, that as of ~October 2003, <br>
hadn't yet made it onto the "new" letterboxing.org.  A bit of recent <br>
history...<br>
<br>
Prior to ~spring/summer 2003, only the webmasters could post clues <br>
on letterboxing.org.  Whenever someone planted a new box, they'd <br>
post the clues as a message on the main list, and the webmasters <br>
would add it to the site.  As the popularity of letterboxing <br>
increased, this became too burdensome for a handful of webmasters, <br>
and the site was upgraded to what we have today:  boxers create an <br>
account with a username and password, and enter their own boxes on <br>
the site.  During that transition, most people who were still <br>
actively letterboxing entered their own clues onto the new site.  <br>
However, some of the older boxes, or boxes from non-active folks, <br>
were left "unclaimed" and never made it over.  Some of those boxes <br>
might still be in place; some are probably missing.  By all means, <br>
if you find one of them and want to enter the clues on the new site, <br>
that's a great way to let other boxers know it's still active.  (If <br>
you decide to adopt a box in this manner, you might want to try <br>
contacting the original placer one last time, if you have an e-mail <br>
address for them.)<br>
<br>
Another good reason for the new format is that it clearly indicates <br>
who planted each box.  The webmasters (understandably) have no <br>
desire to take on the legal responsibility for boxes that don't <br>
belong to them -- for example, when a state/national park official e-<br>
mails to say "get this box out of here."<br>
<br>
Hope that helps explains what you're seeing.<br>
