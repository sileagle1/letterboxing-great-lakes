<br>
It's me....Beetle!  How could I not respond on this subject.  <br>
I have the Yellow Sub ornament and the lunchbox and thermos set too.  There are lovely additions to my Xmas tree.   Actually, I set up many theme trees.  My largest tree in the living room is loaded with my favorite ornaments.   Yes, The Beatles Hallmark ornaments are proudly displayed front and center.  Also, I tuck color post cards of the Fab Four in between the branches.  This year, I can add Starbucks Gift Cards with Macca to the branches of my Christmas tree.  Now some people might look at my tree and wonder---why are there a dozen photo post cards of The Beatles on that Christmas tree?  Those who know me don't ask; they know the answer.  Christmas celebrates the birth or Jesus and a time to remember those we love.  And after all, that's the message of The Beatles.....LOVE LOVE LOVE.  But when asked, I usually just reply....Doesn't everyone have a Christmas tree with photos of the 'four wise men?'  <br>
<br>
I don't have the ornament with the figures. I must have missed that one.  Wanna sell?  <br>
<br>
Hmmmm......no need to explain my trail name.  <br>
<br>
With LOVE from me to you.<br>
<br>
Beetle<br>
