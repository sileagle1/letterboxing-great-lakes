                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a very successful day of letterboxing on Saturday and just had to <br/>
post a big "WOW" for the people whose boxes we found.  We were up along <br/>
the Des Plaines River Trail in northern IL to find boxes by <br/>
CinemaBoxers, Cherokee Rose2 &amp; Hawkeye, and Beetle.  We thoroughly <br/>
enjoyed the "Trip Across America" boxes 1-10 by CR&amp;H -- very fun to see <br/>
what images were chosen to signify each state.  We look forward to the <br/>
remaining states and are betting amongst each other as to which ones <br/>
will be next. ;)  And for being new to letterboxing, CB have carved some <br/>
amazing Hollywood-themed stamps.  We enjoyed the new "Hollywood <br/>
Blockbusters" series (which we happily report being FF on) and are great <br/>
fans of Harry Potter too.  I personally think Johnny Depp is a bit <br/>
scary, but apparently CB are big fans and did a fine job with those <br/>
stamps as well. :)  We ended the day with a couple of boxes by Beetle, <br/>
thankfully surviving a visit to the three-eyed ax murderer and avoiding <br/>
the cops at the site of the Rondout train robbery.  Unfortunately it <br/>
grew dark by this time, and we weren't able to visit the Fatman without <br/>
causing all his friends to wonder what was going on with the flashlight <br/>
party around back, so we will have to visit him another time.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, after about 8hrs of boxing and 10-11 miles of hiking, we <br/>
managed 21 boxes for the day. :)  Thanks for the fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW and we thought we were having a great day on Saturday. We found 7 boxes on Saturday and 1 on Sunday for the 80 days series which means we are down to 3 !!!<br/>
<br/>
  Probably would have been even better had we brought our researched information with us and not just the passport and overall map of the state of Michigan. :)<br/>
<br/>
  Certainly has gotten the bug of boxing back under our skin.<br/>
