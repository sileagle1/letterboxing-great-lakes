No doubt about it - there are some exceptionally creative and inspiring letterboxers in the Midwest!  SILO (Special Indoor Letterboxing Outing) is an annual theme held in the loft of the Silo Restaurant, but it's the folks who come that truly create the magic moments!  As a co-host, I say thanks to everyone who came and made this event the success it always is.  I know the lighting is a bit dim but the room was glowing during the carving presentation - I think many of us were having a light bulb moment!  Great job Scott and Jim!  <br>
 <br>
Two gatherings in a week - FW must be exhausted!  <br>
It was Lock's idea to challenge us to create uniquely decorated letterboxes to look like Mardi Gras floats.  I love the way creative minds think!  The floats were AMAZING!  Did anyone see Shorty's Mushroom Mystery container?  One thing we learned at this event was that letterboxes can come in all shapes and sizes.  OH!  that gives me an idea for next year.  I'll have to hold that thought.  <br>
 <br>
Atom and Prairie Dog and Beetle (that's me) brought their LTC binders for show and tell.  It was an opportunity for others to see what LTCs are all about.  There are so many creative sides to this hobby!<br>
 <br>
No better compliment than people asking if there will be a SILO #4.  How could we say no.  As for themes: it was Fungus Woman who came up with the festive Mardi Gras/Letterboxing theme.  It worked!  Who would have thought that you could put those two activities together and still have a family friendly event.  LOL!<br>
 <br>
Hmmm...Potato Lovers Month?  Well, no one makes better baked potatoes with topping than Silo.  One way to celebrate potato lovers month is to stop being a couch potato and hit the trails and go letterboxing.  We're always open to theme ideas.  When I shared a possible itheme idea for next year, Martini Man gave me a contact for someone who planned a similar themed event in the Mid-Atlantic region.  <br>
 <br>
Feb. 7 marks the anniversary of The Beatles first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.<br>
 <br>
Feb. 24 is George Harrison's birthday.  <br>

Great job, LS&Bx2 (that's Lock Shock & Barrel and Beetle)!  I'm glad I was able to get back in time to attend SILO3.  Two letterbox gathering attended in less that a week's time...is life good or what?  While the "Fungal Infestation of San Jose" was much smaller than the SILO (hey, 21 people, some coming from over an hour away on a week night just to meet up is pretty cool...and I got to meet Wassa and other great boxers from the Silicon Valley area in person...including Sharuna, a transplant from Lombard, IL...small world!), SILO appears to be gaining a reputation for showcasing some of the area's outstanding carvers...and float creators (have to ask Ryan to create a new category on AQ??).So what's next year's theme going to be?  February 4th is National Stuffed Mushroom Day (ouch!)...the 21st is National Sticky Bun Day (as if inky fingers isn't bad enough...).  February is National Condom Month...nope, not touching that one with a ten-foot carving tool.  It's also Potato Lovers Month...hey, we could carve potatoes instead of rubber!  Feb 12 (1959) - first Barbies sold in stores...Lock could have a field day with that one.  The 18th is Pluto Day (too controversial - planet or not?).  National Inventors' Day (as proclaimed by Ronald Reagan in 1983, in honor of Edison's Feb 11th b-day)...now THAT could be fun..........--klk/fw[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]<br>

Oh you don't live in a cave.  You just go hiking in caves because there's probably a letterbox in the cave.  LOL!<br>
 <br>
Many many years ago.....some of us gathered at a micro-gathering at The Hollywood, a nice sandwich shop in Brookfield, and Fungus Woman hosted the event.  When The Hollywood closed, we looked for another restaurant that could seat us and not charge us a room rate or require a huge deposit since we wouldn't know how many people would show up and neither FW or Beetle (me) are wealthy women.  So I found that the owners of the Silo Restaurant were totally agreeable to letting us gather there in their upstairs party room. Because the room is so large and private, the number of people who come continues to increase.  It's really a cozy spot although I wish the lighting was brighter but we can't always be picky.  <br>
 <br>
The Silo Restaurant is located on Rt. 176 Rockland Road in unincorporated Lake Bluff, Illinois.  They are located between the I94 Tollway and Hwy 41 so it's easy to get there even if there was a huge snow fall.  These are main roads and they are always plowed.  Check out their website.  Best pizza in the Chicagoland area!  And...there is a permanent letterbox hidden at The <br>
 <br>
This year, FW was out of town on business, so Lock (of Lock Shock and Barrel) helped to plan SILO #3, and Lock and Barrel brought new ideas to the gathering....including Lock and Lock boxes decorated to look like Mardi Gras floats and the idea of a workshop.  WOW!  What a great time it was!<br>
 <br>
We post the event each year.  It's always in February, usually the second week.  The theme changes.  But it's really just a chance to meet and greet other creative letterboxers, learn more about the hobby, and jump start ourselves for planning new boxes in Spring.  Will this snow ever melt?  <br>
 <br>
So watch the AQ event calendar.  We usually post the event details in early January...the same time that the BINGO Game starts.  Oh, the things we need to get us through those snowy cold months when we can't hike the snow covered trails.  <br>
 <br>
See you next year.<br>
 <br>
Beetle<br>
