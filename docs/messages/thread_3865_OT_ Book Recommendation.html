                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thought I would put in a plug for a book I am just finishing. "Last <br>
Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature Deficit <br>
Disorder," by Richard Louv explores the increasing disconnectivity <br>
between today's children and the natural world.<br>
<br>
I remember as a kid hours spent playing at a nearby park, exploring <br>
in the woods, building forts, fishing in the pond, wading in the <br>
creek, playing outdoor games, camping & campfires, summer camp, <br>
horsebackriding, etc.  These are some of the most vivid and memorable <br>
experiences of my youth. Now a 20-minute school recess is the most <br>
some children see of the outdoors for days on end.  Too often free <br>
time is now spent watching television & movies, playing video games, <br>
chatting and surfing the internet.  While it is true that our world <br>
has changed since I was a child 30 years ago, it simply requires that <br>
we employ different strategies, not change our priorities.<br>
<br>
This book first came to my attention through a website associated <br>
with the ACA (American Camp Association) while I was compiling <br>
information for a project at work (I work for a summer camp <br>
organization), but I see it was also recently referred to in an <br>
article on letterboxing in Metro Parent Magazine (Detroit area <br>
publication).<br>
<br>
This is something near to my heart and I am sure as parents, <br>
grandparents, educators and concerned adults, there are many here who <br>
share my feelings and would truly applaud this book.<br>
