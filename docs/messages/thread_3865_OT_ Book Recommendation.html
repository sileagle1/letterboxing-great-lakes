Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature Deficit <br/>
Disorder," by Richard Louv explores the increasing disconnectivity <br/>
between today's children and the natural world.<br/>
<br/>
I remember as a kid hours spent playing at a nearby park, exploring <br/>
in the woods, building forts, fishing in the pond, wading in the <br/>
creek, playing outdoor games, camping &amp; campfires, summer camp, <br/>
horsebackriding, etc.  These are some of the most vivid and memorable <br/>
experiences of my youth. Now a 20-minute school recess is the most <br/>
some children see of the outdoors for days on end.  Too often free <br/>
time is now spent watching television &amp; movies, playing video games, <br/>
chatting and surfing the internet.  While it is true that our world <br/>
has changed since I was a child 30 years ago, it simply requires that <br/>
we employ different strategies, not change our priorities.<br/>
<br/>
This book first came to my attention through a website associated <br/>
with the ACA (American Camp Association) while I was compiling <br/>
information for a project at work (I work for a summer camp <br/>
organization), but I see it was also recently referred to in an <br/>
article on letterboxing in Metro Parent Magazine (Detroit area <br/>
publication).<br/>
<br/>
This is something near to my heart and I am sure as parents, <br/>
grandparents, educators and concerned adults, there are many here who <br/>
share my feelings and would truly applaud this book.<br/>
