<br>
Fishing: Bring your fishing pole for an ideal family-oriented fishing<br>
opportunity. We encourage and support the catch and release of fish, so that<br>
many people can enjoy the excitement and thrill of catching fish from the<br>
lake. From the accessible fishing pier you can catch Trout, Bluegill, Perch,<br>
or Crappies.<br>

P.S.  I looked at your photos from your mini-meet today, it looks like you<br>
had a nice turnout.<br>
