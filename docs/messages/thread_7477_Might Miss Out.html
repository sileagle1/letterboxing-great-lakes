I was so thrilled to be attending our first gathering this weekend! We<br>
booked a hotel a couple weeks ago through Priceline and paid for it, and<br>
planned to make a weekend of it! Unfortunately, my father has fallen ill and<br>
has been hospitalized since the 1st of June. It's unclear whether we'll get<br>
to come after all (it's about a 6-hour drive for us!). If we have to miss<br>
out, we will have to live vicariously through all the post-gathering talk &<br>
pictures! Hopefully he will be on the mend though and we'll get to<br>
experience our first gathering! Fingers crossed!<br>
