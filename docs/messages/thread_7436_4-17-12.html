Now what will occupy my time until Baby Bug's arrival?  Anyone want to start a pool about what day they'll arrive?  Our due date is June 3rd, but the doctors informed us that they're not letting me go to term, which means, depending on their monitoring, Baby Bug will be here anytime between the 37th week (about May 14th) and the 39th week (end of May).  <br>
