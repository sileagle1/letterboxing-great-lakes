Believe it or not fellow WI letterboxers, I got an email from Capt. <br/>
Jim!  Since I knew he had picked up Robot 1 at its last known <br/>
whereabouts, I asked him where he planted it.  He told me where, and <br/>
I'll go check to see if it is still there unless I hear from someone <br/>
on this list that they have it - one of you "newbies" might've <br/>
picked it up already.  If you have this HH, please contact me!  <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I told Jim about the gathering and this group.  Hopefully <br/>
he's out there lurking around! :-)<br/>
