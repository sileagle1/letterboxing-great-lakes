As usual, no BINGO word for me. That's not so bad; I've gotten used to <br/>
that.<br/>
But even worse no SILO II either..... I've got to take care of some <br/>
things with my daughter, and it has to be tomorrow... DRAT!  I had an <br/>
outfit n everything.  (see my lip sticking out even farther now.) and i <br/>
was going to listen to books on cd on the long drive,  and stop for a <br/>
box or two, and go to a scrapbook store.... and of course worst of all <br/>
is not getting to see some of you again and to meet some of you for the <br/>
first time SIGH.... ( and it will probably be another bingo word i wont <br/>
have next year to boot)<br/>
<br/>
So i'm trying to console myself.  Since the sun came out this <br/>
afternoon, I skipped out on work and planted my first LB.  Also did a <br/>
plant for a friend (sorry that has taken so long, you know who you <br/>
are)  I must still work on those clues a bit, as i want them to be <br/>
appropriate for the box (but they are drafted, just need some fine <br/>
tuning).  <br/>
<br/>
To further console myself, i think i will go out and hunt after we get <br/>
our business done.<br/>
<br/>
PPE  who will miss the fun. <br/>
