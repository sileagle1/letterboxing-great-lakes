                    <div class="plaintext-content">I pulled the Oktoberfest Marathon box from a Spring Lake park a few weeks ago after it had been found by a non-boxer who kindly emailed me. When I went to the park to pick it up, it was nowhere near the hiding spot (thankfully, she had given me a description to where she found it). This wasn't the first time the box had been found away from it's hiding place. The stamp was missing. The park seems to have lost a lot of it's folliage so I decided to re-carve and re-plant in a much more suitable park. The box is now in Ferrysburg's Coast Guard Park. Clues have been updated. Hope you go out and find it. This park has lots of potential for more boxes!<br/>
