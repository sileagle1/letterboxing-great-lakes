You and Armadillo Jo are the only addresses on the list, but if you know of others you can get in touch with, that's great.  And if it isn't home exactly by Christmas, that's fine too.  I just wanted to take a look at it before I send it out further.<br/>

I gotcha. I am going out to check the mail shortly. Are there many in Indy on the list? I <br/>
will contact everyone on my local list that have not already stamped in. I have some free <br/>
time to meet up with anyone who wants to participate. You are saying you what this PLB <br/>
delivered back to you on or before Christmas? PRIORITY MAIL, right? I can send it UPS <br/>
from work if that is preferred.<br/>

If the mailing address is a residential home, I would be surprised if a signature is required.  <br/>
UPS leaves things at my doorstep all the time that aren't signed.  I would have a tracking <br/>
number to monitor online.<br/>

I think you have to specify either signature required or not on the <br/>
UPS paperwork.  I've also gotten things delivered by UPS left on my <br/>
porch, but occasionally I get one of those post-it stickers stuck to <br/>
my door saying they have a package that requires a signature and I <br/>
have to either go get it, have a neighbor sign, or be home to <br/>
receive it on a certain day.<br/>
