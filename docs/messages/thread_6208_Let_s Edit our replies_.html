But since this has been mentioned on the Newboxers list recently, I am going to bring it up here as well.  <br>
If we could EDIT our posts, reading this list on PDA's and in digest form would be SO much easier.  <br>
It's easy to do, too!  (Assuming you are using a PC, because I don't know mac rules.)  When you hit reply, just use CTRL-a to select all the text of the original message, and then use CTRL-x to delete it all.  Then type your reply.  We'll know what you are replying about by the subject line.  <br>
This is just a small bit of email etiquette that can really make life easier for all of us!  Thank you in advance!  <br>
