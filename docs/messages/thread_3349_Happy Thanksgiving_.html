Funny, SpringChick and Thanksgiving instantly brings to my mind her<br>
T-day stamp series, particularly the Turkey, and gee, look at the GL<br>
logo today...<br>
<br>
Question for the day though -<br>
Is Gooble Gobble in hiding? :-)<br>
<br>
Have a blessed day everyone whether you're a turkey (like me) or not!<br>
