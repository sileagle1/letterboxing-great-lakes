The problem with finding books is that they are meant to be picked <br>
up, so unless you get out to find one right away, it may get picked <br>
up before you get to it.  One of the taglines talks about making the <br>
whole world a library!  <br>
The website is at bookcrossing.com - membership is free and they are <br>
good about privacy issues.  Any messages are totally blind, so your <br>
email is never exposed to anyone.  If you join you get sign up to get <br>
email alerts for any books that are released into the wild for the <br>
towns that you chose from your local area.  Or there is a Go Hunting <br>
link on the sidebar that lets you see where books have been <br>
released.  There is also something called an OBCZ - Official Book <br>
Crossing Zone.  These are usually places like coffee shops that have <br>
a bookcrossing shelf set up, those are usually kept stocked with a <br>
variety of books.  <br>
http://homepage.mac.com/pachydomo/OBCZWorldMap.htm<br>
This is the link to the world maps of OBCZs, you can click into to <br>
your area to see if there are any locally.  Other than that, just <br>
keep an eye out for books roaming free in the wild.  Usually they'll <br>
have a post-it or some note on them saying that they are a <br>
bookcrossing book.  I've had books from Milwaukee go to Iraq, New <br>
Zealand, Sweden, England amongst other places.  It's my other big <br>
obsession besides letterboxing!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Having a book "stolen" is always a risk.  I put everything in/with the book<br>
for the bookcrossing site, and I have maybe a 25% sucess rate.  I've<br>
released 40 books "into the wild" so far. 10 of them were later logged in at<br>
the site and 30 have never been heard from again.  So I don't do it all that<br>
often anymore.<br>
<br>
It would be nice if people who didn't want to play the game would just leave<br>
the books for someone who does want to, but lots of folks just see the<br>
availability of a "free" book.<br>
<br>
And I suppose folks also mean to get around to reading<br>
them...............someday..........and until they do, the book just sits on<br>
a shelf.........someplace....and sits....and sits.<br>
<br>
Personally, I prefer it if folks who went around actively seeking the books<br>
just did one at a time and didn't pick up another one until they read and<br>
released the previous one into the wild again, but I know some folks who<br>
actively go looking for them who have found 4 or 5 in one week and then the<br>
books just sit until they get around to them.<br>
<br>
For places like Starbucks or other shops, if you look towards the bottom of<br>
the listing, it'll often tell ya where in the store you can find the book.<br>
I like to leave them at interstate waysides to see how far away they might<br>
end up.<br>

and toss it in the lost and found, so it never hurts to ask.  If you <br>
have a relationship with them since you already have a box there, I <br>
would probably just ask them to leave it out where it is visible.  <br>
My catch rate - rate of books released that ever get logged in on the <br>

behind my newspaper to see what happens to my book whenever I can.  I <br>
know that most of my books get picked up.  I've even had books that I <br>

to be willing to let the book go once you release it. <br>
