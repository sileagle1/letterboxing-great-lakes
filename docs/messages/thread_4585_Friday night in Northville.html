Did we decide on a time to meet?  Turns out I'm not working afterall, <br>
so I'm available whenever.  Dinner still sounds like a good option, I <br>
just wondered what time you wanted me to meet you at the Painters Place.<br>

Not sure if I'm doing this right, but I'm giving it a whirl...hehehe!<br>
<br>
Is there a time that has been set to meet yet?  I'd like to join the<br>
croud I'm just not sure were I'll be and when on Friday, but if I had a<br>
time I could plan my day around this for sure.<br>
<br>
Let me know....hope I did this right, I guess I;ll find out sooner or<br>
later.<br>

I'd be interested in joining up with the crowd.  Has there been a time <br>
set for the actual meeting time?  I'd like to plan the day around this <br>
or at least allow time to get there so I can get the Painter's place <br>
stamp as well, I've missed out on this one too due the open hours.<br>
<br>
Hope this works this time.<br>

Thanks, Mully :)<br>

I have settled with my MIL, and we could meet at Painter's Place at 6:30,<br>
log into the letterbox, then head across the street and have a beer or<br>
something at the Starting gate. I am bringing a full load of HH and<br>
cooties, from a recent gathering, and I also have my traveling table top<br>
boxes, and personal travellers. We can exchange and all that over there?<br>
Does that sound okay?<br>

PS I can be reached by email before then.<br>
