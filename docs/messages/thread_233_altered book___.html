                    <div class="plaintext-content">In regards to the question as to whether this has been done <br>
before...  There are "letterbooks" that have been placed in <br>
libraries which utilize hollowed out real books for the container, <br>
as Richard had mentioned.  I have not seen any of these so I'm not <br>
sure if they just remove the entire inner hunk of pages or cut <br>
individual niches for the stamp and logbook, or if part of the <br>
original book is utilized for the journal, etc.  I also don't know <br>
in what way they are painted, decorated, etc.  By precise definition <br>
of "altered book" adornment is not mandatory, rather simply cutting <br>
a niche technically qualifies as "altering."  My guess is that your <br>
book is more artistic than most of these, more closely fitting the <br>
idea we hold as altered book artists.<br>
<br>
Either way, it is a very cool concept for an indoor letterbox and I <br>
would like to see more of these types of boxes as they really allow <br>
for some creativity.<br>
<br>
If anyone is interested, I believe the very first "letterbook" was <br>
the Kimball Library box placed by Tom Cooch, a great "old-time" <br>
letterboxer.  The box is in Vermont, but there is an on-line version <br>
(in this respect it probably qualifies also for the first virtual <br>
letterbox).  Even though Tom is not so actively involved in the <br>
letterboxing community as he previously was, it does appear that he <br>
still keeps up with this box.<br>
