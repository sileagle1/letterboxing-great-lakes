                    <div class="plaintext-content">In regards to the question as to whether this has been done <br/>
before...  There are "letterbooks" that have been placed in <br/>
libraries which utilize hollowed out real books for the container, <br/>
as Richard had mentioned.  I have not seen any of these so I'm not <br/>
sure if they just remove the entire inner hunk of pages or cut <br/>
individual niches for the stamp and logbook, or if part of the <br/>
original book is utilized for the journal, etc.  I also don't know <br/>
in what way they are painted, decorated, etc.  By precise definition <br/>
of "altered book" adornment is not mandatory, rather simply cutting <br/>
a niche technically qualifies as "altering."  My guess is that your <br/>
book is more artistic than most of these, more closely fitting the <br/>
idea we hold as altered book artists.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, it is a very cool concept for an indoor letterbox and I <br/>
would like to see more of these types of boxes as they really allow <br/>
for some creativity.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested, I believe the very first "letterbook" was <br/>
the Kimball Library box placed by Tom Cooch, a great "old-time" <br/>
letterboxer.  The box is in Vermont, but there is an on-line version <br/>
(in this respect it probably qualifies also for the first virtual <br/>
letterbox).  Even though Tom is not so actively involved in the <br/>
letterboxing community as he previously was, it does appear that he <br/>
still keeps up with this box.<br/>

&gt; Hey, everyone.  I've been working all day (okay, not ALL day!) on <br/>
a new Lb<br/>
&gt; for camp.  I think I mentioned my idea a while back...an altered <br/>
book that<br/>
&gt; would actually be the journal for the box as well as the hiding <br/>
place of the<br/>
&gt; stamp.  (There's a niche in the back of the book to hold the <br/>
stamp.)  Has<br/>
&gt; anyone ever done anything like that before?  The book I'm using is <br/>
an old<br/>
&gt; (1953) pronounciation dictionary, and my altering is pretty<br/>
&gt; rudimentary...basically just playing with some of my stamps to <br/>
illustrate<br/>
&gt; words on some of the pages.  On the page that has "BLIND", I <br/>
stamped the<br/>
&gt; three blind mice.  For "ALIEN" I stamped Worf from ST:TNG.  A few <br/>
pages are<br/>
&gt; a bit more elaborate:  "ANTS": I multiply stamped an image of <br/>
three ants,<br/>
&gt; and stamped out the words "the ants go marching 3 by 3".  I just <br/>
wanted to<br/>
&gt; do enough to give the girls some idea that writing in the book was <br/>
okay, and<br/>
&gt; spark a little creativity without stiffling their own ideas by <br/>
being too<br/>
&gt; overwhelming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I'd like to bring this along to the Gathering so that all <br/>
of your<br/>
&gt; can stamp into it, if you don't mind.  I'd like them also to see <br/>
what some<br/>
&gt; "real" letterboxers' stamps look like (not the pathetic stuff I've <br/>
produced<br/>
&gt; so far!!...I *really* need a workshop!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The name of the box...er, book?...is "May I have a word with <br/>
you?"  The<br/>
&gt; clues imply the lodge it will be hidden in...oh, heck...here they <br/>
are:<br/>
&gt; "May I have a word with you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ah, camp! The perfect place to relax and forget about your <br/>
problems, at<br/>
&gt; least for a few days.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You say the Pioneer lifestyle is not for you? Well, perhaps you'd <br/>
prefer<br/>
&gt; some of our other accommodations. Perhaps some flush toilets? <br/>
Indoor<br/>
&gt; fireplace and kitchen? Nearby swimming pool? A separate room for <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; leaders to escape the noise of your troop? Sounds rather idyllic, <br/>
don't you<br/>
&gt; think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What? What's that you say? You're trying to read these clues to <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; troopmates but don't know how to pronounce that "I" word in the <br/>
last<br/>
&gt; paragraph? Well, you know what they always say, "Look it up in the<br/>
&gt; dictionary!" As a matter of fact, one of the amenities (okay, look <br/>
that one<br/>
&gt; up too) at camp is a collection of books for your reading <br/>
enjoyment. Find<br/>
&gt; the dictionary and you'll find a most unusual letterbox!!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ["Pioneer" is the name of the first box I placed there...and <br/>
refers to the<br/>
&gt; fact that it is hidden at a platform tent site called <br/>
Trailblazer.  The name<br/>
&gt; of the lodge is "Idle-A-While", hence the reference to "idyllic".  <br/>
The book<br/>
&gt; itself will be on a bookshelf by a set of old encyclopedias that <br/>
never get<br/>
&gt; used, so no one will pay any attention to it unless they are <br/>
looking for<br/>
&gt; it.]<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hey, this is kind of nice that you guys can't go looking for this <br/>
box!  This<br/>
&gt; way I can share this info with you instead!<br/>
