                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for passing this along -- very interesting!  I've always been doubtful about some of the security questions for password resets -- way too obvious, especially to people who know you -- mother's maiden name, father's middle name, pet's name, city where you were born...  Some of these things are actually a matter of public record and a lot of people know these things about me just because they know me, not even because of what I might have put online in a blog or social profile.<br/>
<br/>
The author of the article suggested using the more obscure security questions.  Another thing -- what I tend to do -- is make something up...  there is nothing that requires your security question answers to be truthful.  So even though I was really born in Grand Rapids -- which all of my family and many acquaintances would know, not to mention this is public record -- the answer to my security question would be some other city in a completely different place that I have no logical ties to; and my father's middle name...  well he didn't have one (which is also public record), so that left the door wide open for me to give him one of my own choosing.  Just be sure you have a way to remember what you used as your fictitious answers or you may not be able to get your password reset when you actually need to.<br/>
<br/>
Same goes for passwords...  never use your child's name, pet's name, your birthdate, address or phone number for your password or PIN because people know these things about you or could very easily find out in public records.  Ideally what you choose should not even be a proper noun or a word found in the dictionary, because there are hack programs out there that can run through the dictionary in a matter of minutes.  Choose a favorite word and mix up the letters and then change the "O" to a zero or the "E" to a 3, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just as an FYI as it pertains to Yahoo groups...  some Yahoo groups are public and some are private.  Groups that are set to public (i.e. LbNA -- the "big list") turn up search results on Google so anything you post there becomes searchable public information.  Groups that are private do not pass results to Google, rather are only searchable at the group by members, although most allow pretty much anyone to join.<br/>
