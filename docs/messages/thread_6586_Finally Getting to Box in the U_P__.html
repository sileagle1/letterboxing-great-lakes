and the next year in the eastern UP, including Mackinaw Island.  Both were<br/>
fun trips!<br/>

They've put them in places they want visitors to go to get the best views.  A different scenario from a lot of parks, that's for sure!  We found them in the fall of 2008.  I don't think they're on AQ, but are on LbNA.<br/>
