 <br>
We had a great time with many of the New England letterboxers attending the Bed & Boxing III - A Green Mountain Journey Event in Killington, VT this weekend.  We experienced the reenactment of the first Letterboxing Event in 1999 at the Long Trail Inn - even down to following the same clues!  To keep it all authentic, Mark & Sue ordered up a dusting of white stuff Saturday morning before many of us headed up to find old boxes on the AT by the inn.<br>
<br>
It was really a dilemma for us having two events on the same day...as we haven't missed a fall Michigan event in awhile - we did think of you on Saturday and hoped that you all had a wonderful time together - sounds like that was the end result...accept for Mr. Family of Many!  Do you think Spring Chick has that voodoo doll up and running already?<br>
And then we took a look at the pictures from Horsin' Around of poor FungusWoman!  This is turning out to be a dangerous hobby!<br>
But, the best news was the arrival of Baby Bean!  Congratulations to Atomic Beans!  We can't wait to meet her!<br>
All we know is that our BINGO card will be pretty lame with all of the missed events!<br>
