Unfortunately, it rained much of the weekend where we were and <br>
although I had clues to a few letterboxes within a reasonable drive, <br>
we didn't have a chance to get out.  I had a few boxes with me to <br>
plant and did manage to take advantage of a few hours of sunshine <br>
yesterday to get one planted, and we attempted to plant a second, <br>
but were not able to find a suitable spot...  well, actually we <br>
found a spot, but were not able to get to it.  Will have to go back <br>
there on our next stay at the cottage.  Clues will be posted for the <br>
new box within the next few days.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that was the extent of our boxing for the weekend, and I've <br>
enjoyed reading a few other posts and e-mails of weekend <br>
letterboxing adventures.<br>
<br>
So for this week's TOTW: Were you able to do any boxing over the <br>
holiday weekend, if so -- where and what were the highlights?<br>

while I was out of town...  will a try it anyway though!)<br>

We also scouted one new potential box location, and checked in on 3 of<br>
our existing boxes... Sad to say that the Menominee North Pier Light<br>
letterbox has disappeared, confirming recent reports we'd received.<br>
We'll remove that one from the website.  Eventually we'll carve a new<br>
Menominee lighthouse to take its place.<br>

We didn't go anywhere special for the holidy, so I dragged my family on what has become something of a dreadful tradition- an hour drive (if we're lucky) to find boxes.  <br>
<br>
We went to Sterling Heights to find Team Rabbit's boxes.  We got there a little late (6ish), and found the "Cygnus" boxes.  I have to say, those were some of the most creative clues I've ever seen.  Even after pointing out the solutions to the riddles to my husband, he STILL didn't get them, and accused me of "making stuff up".  <br>
<br>
Our next stop was Dodge Park for the "Joey's Uncle" boxes.  Both husband and child's eyes nearly popped out of their heads when they saw this park.  It was like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting, except a Norman Rockwell painting where diversity actually existed.  There were families everywhere, children running around, an ice cream truck happily sitting in the parking lot, and, most importantly to my 2 year old, A GIANT PLAY STRUCTURE!<br>
<br>
I ended up looking for the boxes on my own, while the other two played.  My well-oiled team broken apart by the seductive lure of swings and slides, I didn't find the first box.  And I looked!  I figured I'd cut my losses on that one and go on to the next one.  Well, dark was falling by this point, and I quickly realized that I wasn't going to have enough time to find any other boxes today.  I SO stink letterboxing on my own.<br>
<br>
However, if the Joey boxes are as clever as the Cygnus boxes, I can't wait to go back and find them!  Heck, it took me two attempts AND a tour guide to find the "Woods in City" box.  Of course, now that I think about it, I'm hard pressed to name ANY Azobox that didn't give me some sort of trouble.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

We're going to remedy that this weekend, however, with a trip to find those boxes and another bike ride along the Towpath here in Ohio.  Biking, hiking, if you're in the area visit the Cuyahoga Valley Towpath!  It's gorgeous, and so amazing to realize that that canal you're riding/walking alongside used to be a major transportational feat.  <br>
