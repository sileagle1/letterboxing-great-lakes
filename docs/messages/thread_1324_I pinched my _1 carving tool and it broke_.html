answer some of my carving questions on.  I got some good answers. Now<br/>
hopefully my new shipment of "pink stuff" comes soon so I can carve<br/>
some masterpieces, or at least something worth putting in a box.<br/>
<br/>
I had great luck carving "Blue Beard" tonight, that was totally cool,<br/>
he is such a nasty guy!<br/>
Thank you everyone for all of your advice, it went along way!<br/>
