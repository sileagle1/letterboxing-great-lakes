<br/>
I was hoping I'd have time to do a temporary box for Milwaukee's Irish Fest (8/19 - 8/22), but<br/>
summers have a way of getting away from me and I had neither the time to do up a box nor the time<br/>
to clear it with the festival directors. So, it'll have to wait for next year. Next year's better<br/>
anyhow, as it's the Fest's 25th anniversary and my carving skills will hopefully have improved.<br/>
<br/>
However, as I'll still be there all 4 days, I will be bringing my personal stamp AND a<br/>
brand-spankin' new little personal traveller with me.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is planning on visiting the Fest (http://www.irishfest.com/), I'm pretty easy to find,<br/>
as I work at the Leinie rock stage  Fri-Sun. Here's what you need to know if you want to get my<br/>
stamps:<br/>
<br/>
I'll be working the following hours in the booth on the west side of the stage: Fri - 8 to<br/>
midnight; Sat - 4 to 8pm; Sun - 6 to 10pm. If I'm not actually in the booth during those times,<br/>
I'm probably backstage, gathering beer. :-) If you don't see me -- or don't know what I look like<br/>
-- feel free to ask anyone else in the booth if I'm around. You'll want to ask for Anne, though,<br/>
not Czeltic Girl.<br/>
<br/>
If you think you'll be attending the Fest but don't think you'll be there when I'm working, feel<br/>
free to shoot me an e-mail and we can arrange to meet up. I'm on the grounds most of Thursday<br/>
night and a sizeable chunk of the rest of the weekend other than my work hours.<br/>
<br/>
There's no special question or anything for the traveller at this time. Just getting yourself to<br/>
the Fest and finding me will be challenge enough. :-) But if you want to make me extra happy, you<br/>
can tell me who the Irish Pirate Queen was (in English or Irish).<br/>
<br/>
Czeltic Girl<br/>
