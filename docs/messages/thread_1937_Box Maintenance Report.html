<br>
Just wanted to let people know that I finally found a new home for my <br>
Lucky Leprechaun box.  Jigsaw had found the box vandalized in July but <br>
luckily found all the pieces and mailed the stamp and water-damaged <br>
logbook to me. (THANK YOU AGAIN!) The stamp is now back in a box with a <br>
new logbook and a slightly new location.  The clues have been updated, <br>
but if you have already found this box, there is no reason for you to <br>
return - it is the same stamp (my very first hand-carved stamp).<br>
<br>
This weekend we also put a new logbook in Wirth Park, but left the <br>
original which is almost full.  Also checked on Diamond in the Rough <br>
and Capone's Cargo which were both OK.<br>
<br>
Also planted a new box - clues will be posted soon...<br>
