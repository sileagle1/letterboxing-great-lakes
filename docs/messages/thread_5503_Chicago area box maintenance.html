yesterday checking on a few of our boxes along the Des Plaines River.  <br>
First, we went to Catherine Chevalier Woods to check on 3 boxes we had <br>
planted there.  We really like this preserve and some of our first boxes <br>
were planted here.  We had gotten an attempt report on "Squash" and <br>
although we found the box in its proper place, the box was cracked and <br>
the insides partially frozen/wet so it was removed and we'll see how it <br>
thaws/dries and decide later about replanting.  Next, we found the last <br>
of our HHH boxes still out there, and this box was found open and <br>
contents scattered across the ground.  It was also removed and will not <br>
be replanted.  Finally, we found my "Beautiful Flower" box safely tucked <br>
into the log where it belonged -- a good sign until opening, when the <br>
insides were found to be one frozen brick of logbook/stamp/ice -- the <br>
contents for this one are unsalvagable I think, so it will likely not be <br>
replaced.  So a pretty sad day for our almost-3 year old boxes in <br>
Catherine Chevalier Woods. :(  I can understand the first two getting <br>
wet since the boxes were damaged/open, but I'm pretty baffled by the <br>
last one, since the box was sealed up and tucked away in the log -- the <br>
only thing "wrong" with it was that the last finder had put the baggie <br>
on the outside of the box and the contents directly inside the <br>
lock-n-lock with no other protection.  But oh well, c'est la vie...<br>
<br>
We also checked on a few of our Broadway series starting from Beck Lake <br>
-- this trail was hard to navigate because it had a lot of ice still on <br>
it.  But we found "The Lion King" (box is fine -- there's a new picnic <br>
table right near it though that may make it harder to retrieve if people <br>
are there but it does provide a good place to log in now), "Aida" (saw <br>
and touched box but it was frozen to the ground under bark so we <br>
couldn't move/open it), and "Spamalot" (also fine, but we did move the <br>
final placement of the box and updated the clues on AQ).  We also went <br>
and decided to remove the "Bear Down" box since we didn't really like <br>
the final placement of the box (busy spot constantly populated with <br>
people and dogs) and we think the last part of the clue was throwing <br>
people off since this box only had 1 finder in 2 years.  We might <br>
replant it, might not -- otherwise, congrats to Cherokee Rose and <br>
Hawkeye for being the only finders!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the little park we were going to find boxes in yesterday <br>
was all gated up, so we were unable to get our first finds of 2009... <br>
but maybe we'll get one tonight! ;)<br>

With all the rain and thawing snow and ice, I have been concerned about all the letterboxes out there.  I received a report that one of my boxes was frozen; a block of ice!   But the finders did some first aid and the box is still alive and well.  I'll check it soon.  This has been a difficult winter and it's just beginning.  Unfortunately, I don't think these will be the last reports of frozen, damaged boxes.  If the stamp survived, I encourage you to replace the box.  <br>

Its funny you mention a block of ice.  We were going to test the quality <br>
of a few of the boxes we rescued yesterday.  We are thinking about <br>
dunking them in a bucket of water, leaving them outside to freeze to a <br>
block of ice, melt them, and then see which of our boxes stay dry.  When <br>
we get around to our experiments, we'll likely post some pictures to <br>
share with the group.  (we thought it would be fun/interesting) <br>
<br>
However, I wouldn't be overly worried...as long as finders don't force <br>
boxes out of their spots when frozen...I think many boxes are more <br>
sturdy than you think.  While out yesterday, we noticed an area that <br>
once held a box (A Future Noble) was covered with a few feet of water.  <br>
We commented that out box had likely been under a similar amount of <br>
water during the winter it was still in place.  When we did end up <br>
retiring it (after we realized that it spent many weeks under feet of <br>
water), it was still very dry inside!<br>
