                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alas, another sucessful season of the Bristol Ren Faire came to a<br>
close today.  Thanks to all of you that came to find the letterboxes<br>
and letterpeople.  A preliminary count shows me that over 40<br>
letterboxers found some or all of the boxes! We had local people as<br>
well as letterboxers from the east coast!  It would seem I'll need to<br>
put THREE sheets of paper in the boxes for next season, as the two<br>
sheets were barely enough! It was also great to see that my friends<br>
the >>-CC-> Family have finally started letterboxing too!  Another<br>
great thing is that, although some boxes were not quite in their<br>
original hiding spots (although close), none of the boxes went missing<br>
all season!  Sorry that today was the only day I could get to the<br>
faire to meet anyone, and only one family found me today.  Hopefully<br>
my car won't break down next year!<br>

Unfortunately, a number of the "letterpeople" will not be available <br>
this year for various reasons.  But, as Kate pointed out earlier, <br>
there are a number of letterboxers that work at the faire that are <br>
willing to do an exchange, if not be letterpeople in the future!<br>
<br>
As for when I'll be available, I don't know.  We'll be leaving this <br>
weekend for the east coast, so maybe sometime in August.<br>

Have a great time at Bristol and enjoy the story!<br>

Several of the letter boxes were very frustrating.  Not because they were difficult to find, but because there were often people sitting right on top of them.  I could even see the corner of one of the boxes sticking out from behind its hiding place, but there were too many people in the area to be able to get it.<br>

went with Dumpster Diva in 2004 and she walked up to the stones the box <br>
was hidden under and fished it out without being noticed at all...and <br>
there was a line of like 30 people waiting for food! She became my hero <br>
at that moment. Now I can't say much about the other boxes that <br>
year...we needed SO much help with them. Poor Dragon must have thought <br>
we were such a group of blondes...wait...we were. ;)<br>
<br>
I am planning on being at the faire this Saturday with the former <br>
candle-maker Laughing Coyote. If anyone else is going, let me know so <br>
we can possibly meet up. :)<br>

there were often people sitting right on top of them.  I could even see <br>
the corner of one of the boxes sticking out from behind its hiding <br>

them, they must've either lost them and didn't tell me, or they forgot<br>
them.  Sorry, but both happens.  Not much I can do about it.<br>
<br>
The only letterperson on the current list that I haven't confirmed for<br>
this year is Granger.  All others have been confirmed.  Do note that a<br>
number of letterpeople from the past are not able to do it this year.<br>
 They are listed in the end under "not available".<br>
<br>
As to the toughness of retrieving the boxes...well, that's part of<br>
what make the Bristol boxes fun!  Here's your chance to work in<br>
stealth mode - or as shutterfly found out, to heck with stealth, just<br>
go grab the box - most people won't pay attention to someone doing<br>
something nutty.  Everyone acts nutty at the place! :-)<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

Sylvie-Rose has provided me with some garb to wear to the faire. Tonight, I tried on the garments and....they feel magical...as if simple clothes could transport you back in time.  I am planning to arrive at 11:00 am.  Looking forward to seeing everyone on Saturday.  <br>

  Beetle, the clues can be found via Dragon's website. All are in <br>
  place and easily findable IF you read the clues carefully. I was at <br>
  the faire last weekend and I was able to nab them all. Jane the <br>
  Phoole and the Knight of Swords are participating, but didn't have <br>
  thier stamps on them. They said they would have them this weekend. <br>
  (I did ask, but alas). The stamp images are amazing and the faire in <br>
  and of itself was absolutely fun. I too was a Faire Virgin until <br>
  then. It took me a bit to get the guts to go to these areas and get <br>
  the boxes as people were always "looking". Shutterfly's advice is <br>
  correct. NO ONE CARES nor really is watching. Use caution but not <br>
  so much that you are a wreck about it. Happy Boxing!!! Jigsaw<br>

<br>
Anyone ever think about planning a gathering for the faire? I remember how <br>
funny it was to see Howling Coyote at the GL gathering this summer without her <br>
faire garb on. She looked so different! It would be an interesting way to <br>
meet everyone in this way. Or instead of calling it a gathering, we could just <br>
say it is a letterboxing day at the faire. We could have clues that tell how <br>
to figure out who each person is. I remember going up to a random person <br>
asking them if they were HC. That poor girl looked at me like I was crazy! Maybe <br>
we can think of something for next year...any takers?<br>
<br>
Or maybe this year...<br>
