That's what you get for choosing all those "unique" items off the <br>
list that you figured you would have and not many other people.<br>
<br>
That being said, I 'fess up...  although I am not *officially* <br>
playing the game, I did choose items and make up a list, "just to see <br>
how I would have done."  If it makes you feel any better, I would be <br>
only 1 for 9 at this point (yeh, Upper Peninsula!).<br>

more in B-F chosen.  Gives us newer, less travelled-out-of-state boxers a<br>
chance.  The boxes I've found in Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin are not on<br>

Slowpokes? <br>
We are "stop-pokes".<br>
I will most assuredly shout from the rooftops if/when our luck<br>
changes.(Well, maybe whisper quietly if I'm batting 1:10)<br>
It sounds as though you quite strategically chose your items.<br>
*I* just went through and grabbed some that seem to ring a bell with<br>
me.Duhh!<br>
<br>
anxiously awaiting tomorrow's pick,<br>

Purple Skull Guy, that was the only one I didn't waffle about.  If you<br>

be looking at the list, if it weren't for the December 31st submission<br>
deadline.  It's all in good fun, but I would be surprised to win.  I never<br>
win.  Oh, I stand corrected.  I won the NCAA March Madness office pool<br>
last year.  I beat out 4 guys!  All that background noise when I am<br>
carving, searching for clues, reading this list, must have seeped into my<br>
subconscience.<br>
