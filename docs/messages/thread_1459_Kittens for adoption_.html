Last week we were on vacation and went camping at High Cliff State Park<br>
in WI.  We made it a letterboxing trip as well. Some of the boxes we<br>
found were:<br>
EAA in Oshkosh<br>
Badger Park in Peshtigo (also visited the Peshtigo Fire Museum)<br>
Red Arrow Park in Marinette<br>
Henes Park Series in Menominee<br>
Mountain Bay Trail in Howard<br>
Three Little Pigs in Green Bay<br>
High Cliff Letterbox Series<br>
Home is Where the Heart is WI in Greenleaf<br>
UWGB Series<br>
Kewaunee Harbor Lighthouse Letterbox<br>
Algoma Pierhead Lighthouse Letterbox<br>
LaSalle Letterbox<br>
Sherwood Point Lighthouse Letterbox #2<br>
Door County Tradition<br>
Sherwood Point Lighthouse-Cabot Point<br>
Sturgeon Bay Shipping Canal Series<br>
<br>
We had a great week and lots of fun on these hunts.  The kittens are<br>
"guarding" the Kewaunee Harbor Lighthouse Letterbox.  At first sighting,<br>
we thought it was one little gray kitten with white paws, but while<br>
replacing the box after stamping in, there were at least 6 kittens who<br>
all scampered back into the rocks.  Very cute and not very old!<br>
<br>
Thanks to all who have planted, replaced and maintained all these great<br>
boxes.  Our favorite by far was the Red Arrow Park boxes.  We kicked off<br>
the shoes and letterboxed barefoot!  As a family with "young'ns", we've<br>
decided the best way to get some of these boxes further from home is to<br>
plan a camping trip.  We had a great week, though the temps were a bit<br>
warm and the mosquitos were out in full force.  We didn't even see one<br>
raccoon in the campground!  Deer were plentiful and so were other flying<br>
buggy things.  The tornado sighted over Lake Winnebago heading straight<br>
for High Cliff never phased us because we were up in Sturgeon Bay<br>
completing the hunt for the Sturgeon Bay Shipping Canal Series when we<br>
heard the weather warning.  We drove back to camp in the rain, but<br>
thankfully the tent doesn't leak and we had a good night sleep.  The<br>
most unusual thing we saw while boxing was the live bear trap in Henes<br>
Park!  This is not a rural park, so we were a bit surprised by that!  At<br>
least the kids can now say they have been to Michigan!  And better yet,<br>
letterboxed in Michigan!<br>

The Puddlejumpers (who realize they planned their vacation for the wrong<br>
week and couldn't go to the gathering in Michigan this week)<br>
Hyacinth (9)<br>
Blue Thunder (7)<br>
Little Green Monkey (4)<br>
Scout - our new puppy whose first letterboxing adventure was the EAA box<br>
planted by Puppybreath! (We know dogs aren't allowed on this hunt, but<br>
we carried all 5 pounds of him through the park anyway.)<br>
