WARNING!  Wisconsin Hiker...DON'T WATCH THIS VIDEO!<br/>
Oh my gosh...I will have nightmares for months after this video...I may never hike again!  My <br/>
blood pressure medicine is NOT working!   Where in the world is this trail?  FW, what is wrong <br/>
with you????  First, you are going to an M.R.S.A. conference and now this video -  all in the <br/>
same day!  The snow and cold have made you a very sick girl!<br/>
But, I did have to laugh at your comment regarding the geocacher taking the box at the end <br/>
of the trail!  It at least gave me something else to think about other than the trauma inflicted <br/>
on my psyche!<br/>
Tiptoe...I can't wait to show Tonto!<br/>

Until they got to the part where the trail had crumbled to nothingness! At that point, I'm pretty sure I would have turned around and gone home (if I hadn't, the dogs certainly would have!). I couldn't help but notice that most of the other hikers were wearing repelling gear. According to some of the comments that trail is in Spain.<br/>

 On further search, the 1901 trail is El Caminito del Rey near Malaga, Spain.  Leave it to those <br/>
crazy Spanish hikers....at least they don't seem to have a lot of snow to contend with.<br/>
