                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ohhhh...This may be helpful in finding the missing box...sometimes <br/>
at gatherings (like this one) when several traveling parties come <br/>
upon others stamping into a box, the first group hands off the box <br/>
to the next giving only a "it goes back in between those two logs" <br/>
type of instruction. (In hindsight, probably not a good idea...)  As <br/>
I recall, help me here Howling Coyote, but we came up to a large <br/>
group with CMoon finishing up stamping in the "Through the Looking <br/>
Glass" box.  CMoon gave us the verbal instructions which we nodded <br/>
that we understood the location, and we proceeded to stamp in. Mind <br/>
you we were all exhausted at this point of the evening! As we were <br/>
finishing up, FungusWoman and troop came by to stamp...We again gave <br/>
her the verbal instructions.  My guess is that the box is hidden <br/>
around the log, but quite possibly not in the exact spot it was <br/>
supposed to be.  Anyone going out that way please look all around <br/>
that big log!  FungusWoman... maybe you can give more exact <br/>
instructions..or did you also give verbal instructions to yet <br/>
another group?<br/>
This is the letterboxing equivalent to "playing telephone"!<br/>
Hope this clears up the missing fabulous box!  My guess it is still <br/>
there just in another off location.  <br/>
