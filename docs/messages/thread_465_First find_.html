this weekend. As I have been interested in LB for some time I have <br>
just finally completed our stamp and was headed up north for the <br>
weekend. We found the Shrine of the Pines and SpringChicks mystery <br>
box but was not prepared for that one.. but will be when we go back. <br>
It was so exciting and I got to do the "dance" as we were completely <br>
alone when it was found! Husband was tolerant of my new hobby but now <br>
has the bug too.<br>
It was great!!!<br>
Just had to share<br>

Pines box is still there.  I had it on my list to hunt for the last time I<br>
was in the area, but weather kept us away.  I did wonder though if it was<br>
still in place and am glad to hear it is.<br>
<br>
Sorry the mystery box was out of reach this time, but trust you will get it<br>
next time.<br>
