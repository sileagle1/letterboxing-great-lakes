You can edit your recorded workouts online through their website as well, so if something recorded wrong and you know it did, then you can go in and change it. Or if you wanted to go back and rename the workout something specific after it's been recorded & uploaded you can do that too.<br>

We have used MyTracks (free ap) easy to use with the Verizon gmail account,<br>
can upload your route right into your Google Maps. It must work off satelite<br>
because the ap will work in locations without phone or 3G service. Only<br>
