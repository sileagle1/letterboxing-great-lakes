Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
I will be coming to Northville, MI starting tomorrow (we're driving from <br>
Boston) and having Thanksgiving with my in-laws. I was wondering if <br>
anyone might like to get together Friday night after thanksgiving?<br>
I know that many of you can't get the stamp I left at Painter's Place in <br>
Northville, because of the limited hours, but since it is my MIL's shop, <br>
I could open it up so you could get the stamp, and then perhaps we could <br>
go across the street and get a beer or something!<br>
<br>
I would bring my travelers, and my traveling tabletop stamps, and would <br>
love to meet anyone local<br>
Please let me know :)<br>
<br>
dale end farm<br>
aka Diana<br>
I can give anyone who writes me personally my cell phone.<br>

Sounds good, Dale End Farm!  I posted a reply to your original post a <br>
while ago, but I think you must have missed it.  Do you know what <br>
time is good for you? Do you know the name of the "place across the <br>
street" from the Painter's Place?  I could list something on AQ real quick.<br>
<br>
I'm not entirely sure at this point if I'm working on Friday or <br>
not,  but since you say "at night", I'm assuming I can do that.  Does <br>
"the place across the street" have food, should we make it around dinner time?<br>
<br>
I tried to get the Painter's Place box, but there's no way I can ever <br>
be there when she has it opened!  It'd be cool to have "VIP access" Haha.<br>
