I began letterboxing on 8/6/2002 with Birkie Bob's "Mt. Bieterman" <br/>
LB which is near my home in SE WI.  I chose that box as my first <br/>
since it is dedicated to his cross country coach at Nicolet HS and I <br/>
am a cross country coach and actually ran against Nicolet on the CC <br/>
course the box is on when I was in HS.  For all you new letterboxers <br/>
out there, this box took me two tries because I was soooo smart to <br/>
read into the clues that he actually meant a "Y" in the trail rather <br/>
than a "V" and spent all my time at trail splits to no avail.  Of <br/>
course, when I returned to find it with my wife to help me (the ONLY <br/>
time she's gone letterboxing unfortunately), as I was complaining <br/>
about the clues not being accurate I looked up and nearly walked <br/>
smack into the "V" in the trail!  The box was soon found afterwards. <br/>
Morale - just read the clues and follow them, don't try to second <br/>
guess them.  (Which I still tend to do!) And keep your mind and eyes <br/>
open!<br/>
<br/>
Since I am not an artist (as some think for some reason), I took my <br/>
stamp image from some of the only artwork I've ever been able to <br/>
look nice - my Escher-like tessellations.  You can see my "Dragon" <br/>
tessellation as the background of my homepage.  You can see my other <br/>
tessellation art (and some of my student's art) at <br/>
<br/>
http://www.kmlhs.org/faculty/TKUEHL/Precalculus/MESA/Tessellations/TK<br/>
%20Tessellation%20Home.htm<br/>
<br/>
My first planted box is "Environmental Classroom" which is at the <br/>
school I teach at.  It is also dedicated to cross country, as it is <br/>
on our cross country course.<br/>
<br/>
I am currently F279.5 P63.5 X20 HH17 E1 and V0 (because SpringChick <br/>
never sent me my virtual stamp last spring ;-) )<br/>
Why do I have .5's?  Because on my last trip down the Mississippi <br/>
from Sparta, WI I went to the "Mines of Spain" box and there was no <br/>
stamp!  (Note to Geocachers - if you're going to do a <br/>
letterbox/cache hybrid, don't forget letterboxers exchange stamps!  <br/>
Please include them in your hybrid box, and don't take them when <br/>
you "leave someting/take something!)  I quickly made a (poor) stamp <br/>
for the box and count it as half a find and plant for now.<br/>
<br/>
Much to the frustration of local WI letterboxers, I am a math <br/>
teacher, and I force lots of letterboxers to use math they haven't <br/>
used for years to find some of my boxes.  But not to worry, I have <br/>
plenty of non-math boxes to find around WI and MI.  Rumor had it at <br/>
our WI gathering that I'm about to get my "just desserts" in <br/>
retalliation for my math boxes from letterboxing teachers of other <br/>
disciplines!<br/>
<br/>
Last summer, I took a 3 week letterboxing trip through MI.  I found <br/>
most of the MI letterboxes planted at that time, and even planted <br/>
three of my own (I STILL can't believe no one beat me to planting <br/>
one in HELL!)  I'm sorry I have not posted which boxes I found and <br/>
which I didn't and their conditions and the hitchhikers I moved <br/>
around.  I did mean to do that.  If you're interested in knowing <br/>
whether I've been to a box of yours (or found your HH), just ask and <br/>
I'll let you know.<br/>
<br/>
My current goals are to:<br/>
1) Return to SW MI during Easter break to letterbox<br/>
2) Fix the "Wisconsin Letterboxes of Antiquity"<br/>
3) Hold the Midwest Gathering<br/>
4) Do an "Ohio" letterboxing trip during summer<br/>
5) Get to P100 and F500 by my 2-year aniversary on 8/6/2004<br/>
6) Encourage WI to get to 500 boxes by the end of the year!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the trail!<br/>
