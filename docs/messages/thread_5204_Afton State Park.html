                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just received word from the Ranger's office at Afton State Park that <br/>
our applications were approved, and our three boxes from GLG2008 have <br/>
been replaced.  The application is very straightforward, and the office <br/>
was terrific about providing the coordinates (which are required for <br/>
the app).  If you have any concerns about one of your boxes from the <br/>
event and have questions, I would recommend sending an email to <br/>
Gene.Groebner@dnr.state.mn.us.  He was very helpful, and asked that we <br/>
mention the application process, so that the boxes can get back out <br/>
into their spots in the park.<br/>

p.s. my email (and these posts) go directly to my phone, so feel free to respond any time! Due to a lack of ink in our printer, we will be relying on my phone for clues anyway. ;) thanks again<br/>

several are still there as of last fall.  We had no problems finding<br/>
many, but a couple are really gone (we think).  Not sure at all if they<br/>
were "approved" or what have you, but some are still there and it makes<br/>
for a fun day of boxing!<br/>
