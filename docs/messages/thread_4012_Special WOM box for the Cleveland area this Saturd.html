<br>
What a great way to celebrate having a garage sale!  I do recall reading <br>
about The Dragon's (traveling, wasn't it?) box for those who have a sale <br>
and therefore cannot go out hunting boxes!  I only know the answer to <br>
your first clue off the top of my head but all your clues are very <br>
cute!  Good luck with your sale and let us know how many make it to the <br>
correct garage sale to stamp in!<br>
