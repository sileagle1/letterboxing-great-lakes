<br/>
What a great way to celebrate having a garage sale!  I do recall reading <br/>
about The Dragon's (traveling, wasn't it?) box for those who have a sale <br/>
and therefore cannot go out hunting boxes!  I only know the answer to <br/>
your first clue off the top of my head but all your clues are very <br/>
cute!  Good luck with your sale and let us know how many make it to the <br/>
correct garage sale to stamp in!<br/>

&gt; After almost a year of marriage and home remodeling<br/>
&gt; and sorting through stuff going, "We really don't need<br/>
&gt; two of these," and "Do you REALLY want to keep THAT?"<br/>
&gt; we have enough stuff to stock our own discount super<br/>
&gt; store. So it's garage sale time this Saturday! Since<br/>
&gt; this will keep us from letterboxing, borrowing from<br/>
&gt; The Dragon's original idea a few years ago, we're<br/>
&gt; going to have a letterbox at our garage sale instead.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We created the Marriage is a Wonderland box for the<br/>
&gt; 2006 Great Lakes Gathering, but haven't had a chance<br/>
&gt; to plant it locally yet (and don't know when we<br/>
&gt; will....). So, if you can figure out where we live,<br/>
&gt; stop by on Saturday for a chance to get this box (no<br/>
&gt; purchase necessary ;). And bring your markers for the<br/>
&gt; stamp. Sale hours will be from 9 am to 3 pm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The clues to find our house are:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Drew Carey hailed from this state, and hey, so do we!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As the Beastie Boys sang, there's "No Sleep Till" this<br/>
&gt; city.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In 1692, a massacre happened here. Not _here_, but I<br/>
&gt; sure hope our street wasn't named after it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stay on the east side of the "Ridge" and you're sure<br/>
&gt; to see the signs. Look for the "doodle" and "deedle"<br/>
&gt; bug to know you're at the right site.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To get the box, say something to one of the<br/>
&gt; proprietors about their first year anniversary being<br/>
&gt; June 10th. Remember that we also have a personal<br/>
&gt; traveler you can get if you tell us how we originally<br/>
&gt; met.<br/>
