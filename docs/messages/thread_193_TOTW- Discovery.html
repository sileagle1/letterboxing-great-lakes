Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I think you guys have already heard enough babble about me.  Professional<br/>
FungusWoman by day, book alterer and rubberstamper by night...with Girl<br/>
Scouts actually taking a back seat in my life these days to allow time these<br/>
personal endeavors.  Well, not really.  Pippin and I are the ones working on<br/>
setting up the Lb "course" at camp (I've got someone to try looking for our<br/>
first box this coming weekend).  And by the way, she is a GREAT cook...be<br/>
sure to look for her contribution at the Gathering (which I'm dragging her<br/>
to after her night of Relay for Life and no sleep!).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Out of curiosity, has anyone in the group happened to go looking for "Fish<br/>
out of water 2"?  I haven't heard any email responses, and was wondering if<br/>
the clues were adequate or what.<br/>
