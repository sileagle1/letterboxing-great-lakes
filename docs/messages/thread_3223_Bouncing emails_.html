thought all the groups had suddenly gone unusually quiet until I <br/>
checked here when I got home and realized that there were a bunch of <br/>
messages I never got.  So I checked my preferences and it said that my <br/>
email address was bouncing.  WHAT??  How did that happen?  I was <br/>
getting messages from my Yahoo groups this morning.  Why did it <br/>
suddenly stop working?  And the weirdest part is that I use a YAHOO <br/>
address.  <br/>
<br/>
Ok...I feel better now.  Going to go check the other groups to see what <br/>
I missed.<br/>
