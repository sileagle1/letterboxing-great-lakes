                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I've been in contact with Blaze frequently the past few days, after I contacted them about their missing series at Riveredge Nature Center.  I was contacted by Riveredge b/c they want a letterbox at the center.  Depending on what Riveredge is looking for, there will either be a new box/series their, a replacement of Moofie and Blaze's series "of Antiquity", or both.  I suggested that Moofie recarve and they replace the series, but Moofie is busy working on her Masters so they left it to me.  Stay tuned.<br>
