So, with only eight days left here in my native soil...ON my native soil, I guess it should be...I have pulled my final boxes.  "Freebird" and "Gotcha!" are now on their way to warmer, more southern climes.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, the highly anticipated "So Long Michigan, '75-'05" box is up and running.  And, for the much beloved online community that is the LbGLK group, I will give an advanced screening of the clues.  They'll be posted on the main site on Friday.<br>

So long, and thanks for all the fish,<br>
