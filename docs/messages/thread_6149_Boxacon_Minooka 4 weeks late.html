I must've beenat Minookaaround the same time as you today. I was stamping into another box just down the trail from Clifford. I took it out into an open field so that I wouldn't be right at the hiding spot... anda few minutes afterI had everything spread out, a group of 30 hikers emerged from the same path! A couple of them asked if the Tupperware contained any lunch for them... sorry, folks...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah, it sounds like the Vagabond club was out again!  We know some people in<br>
that club.  When we were at Minooka a few weeks ago we had to wait for a<br>
bunch of them to go by.  We watched the group to see if anyone we knew was<br>
out & about and sure enough, 2 people that are also in our hiking club came<br>
along the trail.  They immediately asked if we were letterboxing, since they<br>
know our obsession.<br>

<br>
Martini Man was able to come home from his business trip last night rather<br>
than tonight, so we actually were able to get out for 2 boxes ourselves<br>
today.  We also checked on my Year of the Ox box and it was in perfect<br>
shape, waiting for a few more visitors.<br>
