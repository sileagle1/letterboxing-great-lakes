Good luck on your first stamp!  And if you are a bit dissapointed with your skills the first few times around...just remember that it takes practice to work up to some of the intricate masterpieces you have seen.<br/>

&gt;Thanks for that info speedsquare!  I didn't get as far as the sporting goods store tonight, so I will look for that when I do get there.  I did get to Michaels and bought carving material and blades and am going to attempt my first stamp and box once we are done with school this week.  <br/>
&gt;  So a secondary equipment question.  I'm hearing that there are 2 types of carving material and that the harder material is better.  All that the Michaels here had was Speedy-Cut.  I'll work with this, but is there something preferable, or is this what I want?  And if there is something else, any ideas on outlets for it?<br/>
&gt;  And just for the record, I came home from the gather with visions of all these great stamps in my head.  I have since then given myself a few good slaps and have been repeating to myself, "It's your first stamp.  Keep it simple!!!"<br/>

<br/>
My first carving experience was the expensive Master Carve when I made my<br/>
first sig stamp.  Very crude, straight lines and so simple.  I posted an<br/>
image at Atlas Quest if you want to see my first "masterpiece."<br/>
<br/>
I realized carving stamps could get expensive and then I found the pink<br/>
stuff.  Like that and made a few small stamps.  Then I found the gray<br/>
material at a specialty art supplies store.  It took me nearly a year to<br/>
use it all up, but it was highly affordable.  Easy to cut and the material<br/>
is still going strong (see my favorite PT).  Also made the mistake of<br/>
buying that crumbly white stuff, but I have a gorgeous celtic knot image I<br/>
will redo on PZKut soon.<br/>
<br/>
I found all of them easy to work with once I figured out how much pressure<br/>
to use.  <br/>
<br/>
I do love PZKut, and I will probably use this exclusively now.  I<br/>
purchased 1 sheet of white and 2 orange several months ago, and I have<br/>
made one stamp so far.  Yes, that's correct, just one ... The Rose<br/>
Gardeners.  It does make fine detail work easier.  I also used a<br/>
magnifying lamp for that stamp.  I think I spend about 8 hours making that<br/>
stamp (most stamps were a breezy 30 minutes or less).  I also felt much<br/>
more comfortable with the exacto knife using PZKut.  I was petrified of<br/>
the knife prior to carving rubber stamps.<br/>
<br/>
It is a process and I hope you try all types.<br/>
