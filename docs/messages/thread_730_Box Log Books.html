I agree with SpringChick, what is used for the logbook is a totally <br/>
personal decision. I've never make negative assumptions about any <br/>
logbook I've come across. Good heavens, unless it's part of the <br/>
clues or written in the logbook itself, how could I know what the <br/>
story might be behind the reason the placer used that particular <br/>
logbook?<br/>
<br/>
I've seen some beautiful hand-crafted books (Keltic Kara has some), <br/>
some hand-crafted books with wonderfully unique covers <br/>
(SpringChick's Indian Bay box comes to mind), some interesting <br/>
twists on logbooks (the box I brought back from the West Coast for <br/>
Maiden1976), plenty of those sketch books - some with modified <br/>
covers, a good share of other utilitarian style logbooks; including <br/>
a fair number of those little lined composition books.<br/>
<br/>
My own boxes have all different kinds of logbooks; sketch pads with <br/>
and without altered covers, little hand-crafted books with simple <br/>
bindings, strips of paper cut to size and covered then stapled <br/>
together, and one is a journal with a coptic stitch suede cover. <br/>
Some of my logbooks have a story behind them, which means something <br/>
to me and I usually don't share it. For example, one of my former <br/>
students, who now lives semi-independantly in an AFC home, gave me a <br/>
pack of those little composition books from the dollar store. Enders <br/>
Angel and I cut them down to tiny size and used them for the <br/>
logbooks in our Bonus Eggs series (which are now running around <br/>
loose as HH's) <br/>
<br/>
Lately, I find myself wanting my letterboxes to be smaller than what <br/>
one of those sketch books would fit into, so I've been coming up <br/>
with quickie logbooks made to size.  I love bookmaking/bookbinding, <br/>
but I'd never get any boxes planted if I had to wait to endulge in <br/>
creating each logbook by hand! lol<br/>

Here's another option for making logbooks that works for me.  A <br/>
couple office supply stores near me have pads of paper they make from <br/>
printing scraps and sell real cheap. (They're privately-owned shops, <br/>
not chains like Office Max or Office Depot - but they might have them <br/>
too.)   Since both stores are printers along with selling office <br/>
supplies, I give them the measurements that I need to fit my box and <br/>
they use their big die-cut machine to cut the pads down to size.  At <br/>
the same time they punch two holes near the binding.  I separate the <br/>
pads into the page count I want, make a cover and use brads to hold <br/>
them together.  I can be as creative as I like with the cover or just <br/>
use plain cardstock.  Since I use one of the printers for my projects <br/>
at work, they don't charge me for this service, but I can't imagine <br/>
it would cost too much.<br/>
