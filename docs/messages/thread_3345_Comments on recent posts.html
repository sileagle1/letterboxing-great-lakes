today's update, we're pushing 60!  How did this happen?  Hopefully my<br>

Had to think for a minute as to what congrats I was seeking more of...<br>
Actually, my meaning was that I still need to sew on my F1000 patch<br>
and maybe I'll get around to it when I sew on the new GL patch.  no<br>
more congrats needed, unless I make it to P200 by then as well.  Got<br>
that patch ready to sew on, but haven't quite met the criteria yet.<br>

 ========================<br>
<br>
You ask "How did this happen???" - As most of us know by now, the boxers in<br>
this region DO like a get-together!!  Even if it is in December.  (Anyone<br>
who wants to organize any type of informal or "formal" event is encouraged<br>
to do so at any time the mood strikes. The only thing to keep in mind is<br>
that the annual regional event is held the first Saturday in June.)<br>
<br>
Glad to see those elusive "Cat Herders" will be attending, still would like<br>
to do an exchange with them too.  Please, NO SNOW!! __<br>

Well, it depends on how spread out the boxes are!  Even if they are <br>
spread out quite a bit in a single park (someone estimated 14-15 <br>
miles of hiking were required to get all the boxes at the Wandering <br>
in Wonderland event in June), you will invariably meet up with other <br>
people on the trail.  It's a good chance to chat with other boxers.  <br>
However too large of a group descending on a single box require a <br>
wait for stamping in and require extra care & caution when replacing <br>
it, since often the person who actually found the box has already <br>
left the area, passing the box along to the next people who were <br>
waiting.  It's always a good idea to be sure people know exactly <br>
where the box should be replaced, and that the information gets <br>
passed along.<br>
<br>
If the boxes are spread out across several locations (which I think <br>
will be the case for this event), people tend to disperse a bit more <br>
since driving may be required to get to different areas.<br>
<br>
There are usually some boxes placed near the actual gathering spot, <br>
and people try to be somewhat discreet when finding these, to not <br>
spoil the fun for others.  However with all the people that are <br>
milling about, it's likely you might be observed by another boxer who <br>
is alert and looking for clues and boxes.<br>
<br>
Some people prefer to just hangout and chat rather than looking for <br>
many boxes.  This is especially true if the boxes will remain in the <br>
area for a while and the boxer knows that he/she will be able to come <br>
back a different day to look for them.<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to meeting you and some of the other newer <br>
boxers in our area!<br>

P.S.  It is recommended that you ask permission before flipping <br>
through someone else's logbook.  Sometimes there are stamp images in <br>
a logbook that may give away the location of a mystery box or a <br>
personal traveler and seeing it would giveaway the secret.  If anyone <br>
does have these types of stamps in their current logbooks, one <br>
approach is to paperclip some pages together to "secure" these images <br>
from the casual page flipper.  <br>
