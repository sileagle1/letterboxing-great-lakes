                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, I was thinking, winter gets a bit slow. Who here is up for an outdoors winter boxing event in the mid-Michigan area in February/March? There will be a shelter and you can bring the snowshoes and skies! Now, who can say no to that? Besides, what else keeps you busy with your addiction during this time (other than the fact that Tiptoe falsely will probably falsely claim to be the BINGO Queen (again?,the voodoo antics of LB bingo, or Azobox trying to swim in the icy river.) So, who's up for another round of winter boxing? I have a great place in mind....<br>

For the record...Tiptoe is still insisting that she simply missed a called word...and she came clean as soon as she realized her mistake....willingly gave up her status as Queen and settled for that of Jester.....<br>
<br>
As for another round of Michigan winter boxing...We'd LOVE it!  We had so much fun at last years event...we are still talking about all the work "Family of Many" put into this endeavor!<br>
<br>
Have a safe and blessed Thanksgiving everyone!<br>
We are thankful for our good health that allows us to enjoy the great outdoors searching for hidden gems of letterboxing joy, and for the wonderful folks that we've met along the way!<br>
