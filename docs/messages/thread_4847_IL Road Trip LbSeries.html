                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, this year has been tough.  3 weeks ago we found a box in <br>
northern IL, but all but the very top of the box were solidly encased <br>
in ice.  We couldn't even get to the flaps on the Lock'n'Lock.  <br>
Martini Man wanted to make another try today but we decided to wait <br>
until next weekend instead.<br>
<br>
We also were thwarted on a few boxes last weekend in Colorado.  <br>
They've had a LOT of snow this year, which made it great for skiing, <br>
but not so good for letterboxing.  Even what we thought would be an <br>
easy "drive-by" at the restaurant where we met some local boxers was <br>
unattainable.  It was outside next to the building, but there was so <br>
much snow plowed up onto it that we would have needed a bulldozer!  In <br>
the end we managed to find 5 boxes (one was indoors) but couldn't get <br>
to 4 because of snow.  However our big excitement was meeting several <br>
CO letterboxers at the mini-meet that Front Range Hiker arranged and <br>
logging our 500th Exchange!  We had some nice food & conversation and <br>
of course ended up bringing home a few cooties.  Luckily we're <br>
planning to attend a few gatherings this spring, so watch out!  We <br>
were also able to plant 2 boxes closer to Denver where the snow was <br>
mostly melted.<br>
<br>
If you want to see a photo from the MAR 8 mini-meet, you can check out <br>
AQ or our blog at http://wihimm.blogspot.com/  (Just scroll down to <br>
MAR 8). I really like the trail names of one couple we met there - Tai <br>
Chi and Chai Tea.  They also love to travel and recently returned from <br>
a trip to Greece, which included planting some boxes!<br>
<br>
We're looking forward to some better weather for boxing and hope it <br>
will be fine for the MAY 3 event in Iowa (7 weeks away...)<br>

It's frustrating to see a box and not be able to stamp in. We're hoping to<br>
find one of the newer ones in WI tomorrow (actually TODAY since I see it is<br>
just past midnight when we arrived home from a party) if the ice permits.<br>
We may also plant another one...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We headed to Peru and Princeton, IL areas to wander the large antique mall buildings and ... look for letterboxes, of course.  The snow was gone.  I found 7 boxes.  A great way to celebrate the start of Spring.  And, I 'officially' logged my 100th Find today and then went beyond that number.  I guess I'm hooked on this hobby.  I've actually found more than 100 boxes, but some could not be logged. Also today, I filled up my second logbook and I'm starting my third logbook now.  I found some soft ground and some muddy areas, but the snow in that area seems to have melted.  <br>
<br>
I have found two of the IL Road Trip boxes.  With the price of gasoline taking a huge price jump this last week, it's going to be important to map out and plan our trips.  What?  You think for a moment I was going to recommend staying home....NOT!  Today, we made a point of supporting those local, small IL town, family owned restaurants too.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping that ALL the letterboxes made it through this winter.  Good idea for all of us is to travel with extra supplies in case we find a box in need of some tender loving care.  Good to notify the placers too. <br>
<br>
I plan to go out on the trails again tomorrow.  I guess it's spring!  The letterboxers are back on the trails.<br>
<br>
Happy Hiking to all.<br>

I found your box and it was completely frozen to the ground under the logs.<br>
<br>
I was half tempted to melt the snow myself (don't think to hard on that),<br>
but decided to keep it a "sanitary" box for all future boxers and refrained.<br>
<br>
Someday I'll catch that goose!!<br>

<br>
They have about a million (or 20) boxes planted in the <br>
Littleton/Centennial area.  Which just so happens to be where I go, <br>
so that worked out for me!  I had some snow issues this year, too, <br>
but did manage to find a few.  I got within a foot of one of their <br>
boxes and couldn't get it without putting up a big red flag that <br>
there was something hidden there, so I had to pass on it.  That was a <br>
bummer.   Most of theirs tend to be quickie boxes, but they're pretty <br>
clever clues, fun boxes.  The one I did find, when you find the tree <br>
and look in the hole, you see the hole is about 4 feet down!  Way <br>
deeper than my arm is long!  The way you end up having to retrieve <br>
the box is pretty cool.  While I was there, when was the day before <br>
Christmas, two ladies came by on horses with actual jingle bells <br>
on.  It was great!  I don't think I ever actually saw a horse with <br>
sleigh bells on before.<br>
<br>
I've been going to that area for about 10 years, but I was only a <br>
'boxer for the last 2 years.  I haven't had a lot of luck because all <br>
of a sudden that area is getting slammed with snow over the <br>
winter.  Prior to me being a letterboxer, when I went there for <br>
Christmas, there was hardly any snow, 40-50 degree <br>
weather.  Perfect.  If it did snow, it would only be a few inches and <br>
melt by the next day.  The past 2 years have had record snowfalls, <br>
blizzard after blizzard.  preboxed is giving me one more year to come <br>
back, but says if it snows again that much next year, I'm banned!  LOL<br>
