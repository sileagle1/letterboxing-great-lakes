                    <div class="plaintext-content">In a message posted a couple of hours ago, readers were directed to <br/>
click a link at the bottom of the message at the bottom of the <br/>
message to avoid getting such junk in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Actually clicking the link will not prevent you from getting junk <br/>
mail, but it will UNSUBSCRIBE you from this group.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want to do this, but I have changed the membership to <br/>
moderated, which means that all new member requests will need to be <br/>
approved by the moderators.  Unfortunately some of the recent events <br/>
at the "big list" have left some people with the desire to sabotage <br/>
the legitimate letterboxing groups.  I was hoping we would not <br/>
become victims, but looks like that was wishful thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I will monitor the unsubscribes in case anyone advertently clicks <br/>
the link before reading this (as a few have already done) and <br/>
contact them personally about the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
