As the winter season closes in around us, I'd like to try to tie up <br/>
some loose ends in my letterboxing quest.  There are a couple boxes I <br/>
haven't been able to find and I'm wondering if anyone can give me <br/>
some info on them.  Mount Bieterman, Lucky Leprechaun, and Harbor <br/>
Island.  Has anyone found these boxes recently?  Does anyone know if <br/>
they are missing?  If they're still out there, I'd like to find them!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

Harbor Island was there 11/2/04.  It was a little lonely over the summer, so I'm <br/>
sure it will be glad to get some visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Dress warm and enjoy!<br/>
