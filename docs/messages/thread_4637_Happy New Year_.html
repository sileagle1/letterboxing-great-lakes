                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's a little early, but it's too late for Merry Christmas.  Speaking of New Year's, would anyone be interested in a "special" exchange?  Last year, since I failed to get the Christmas cards out at all, I sent out Chinese New Year's cards instead.<br>
<br>
So what I propose is a Chinese New Year's card exchange!  After all, Chinese New Year is a celebration of family and this group has shown again and again that they are as close as family, sharing joys and sorrows alike.  I would like to have an exchange of hand-made cards (traditional cards, ATC's, postcards, whatever strikes your fancy just as long as they aren't store-bought).  They don't have to be stamped, although I expect the majority will probably be...stamp carving being a major artistic outlet for this group...other art mediums are fine too.  <br>
<br>
The 2008 lunar calendar begins on February 7 and 2008 is the year of the rat.  Anyone interested in participating should email me off list at ainawgsd@yahoo.com with their trailname and address by January 10.  Real names are optional.  I will send the list of participants and addresses along with the mailing deadline.<br>

A fun time and we're looking forward to another day out on the trails with them tomorrow!<br>

P.S.  We have to admit that we hope our return flight gets cancelled - we could easily spend a LOT more time out here enjoying the sun and temperatures in the low 70s.  We are dreading our return to the cold reality of a Wisconsin winter...  oh well, at least we will have the BINGO calls to distract us!<br>

Hehehe we were just talking about that little incident a few days ago!  But, how do you know <br>
that we didn't just tell WiHi and MM that we had to attend a conference????   On second <br>
thought, the two lonely boxes we were able to stamp into this afternoon here in Tucson <br>
between meetings would verify our whereabouts!<br>
Darn work!  Staying at a resort....knowing that WiHi and MM are having a great little meet & <br>
greet with local boxers we've wanted to meet for three years at a great brewpub tonight is <br>
making us sad.  Instead Tiptoe will have to squeeze her blistered little tootsies into high <br>
heels for a formal dinner tonight!<br>
The first clouds we've seen in this blue sky have just rolled in!  Maybe with rain predicted for <br>
tomorrow it won't be so bad being stuck inside a conference all day!<br>
BTW..Yesterday we saw a first on the trail to a letterbox...a desert tarantula!  WOW!  It was at <br>
least four inches in diameter...we'll try to download a picture on our adventure page...along <br>
with one of Tiptoe in the snow on Mt. Lemmon!<br>
Happy Trails....<br>

Well, I guess I'll just have to wear my favorite pair of high heels to the next event...Wait, that <br>
is the Iditarod event...hum...that will be a bit far fetched...the dogs probably wouldn't like to <br>

I'd send tonight's picture but they aren't as pretty with all the moleskin I have on my heels <br>

make that feet!<br>

            This is starting to sound like a 12 step program meeting...." Hi, my name is (    ) and I'm addicted to letterboxing. " One problem: There is no 12 step program to cure this addiction.  So, may as well just enjoy it.  Besides, we're all in this together.  Won't find much help in this group; just more encouragement.  LOL!<br>

Hi, my name is Dreamer and I'm addicted to letterboxing. I've just <br>
<br>
  spent the last hour brainstorming all of the green things that could <br>
<br>
  be made into a LB for the GL spring event. I even asked the <br>
<br>
  teenagers to help. The list is really long.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My family thinks that I need help. I think that I can quit any time.<br>
