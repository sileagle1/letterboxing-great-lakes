<br/>
Back in the summer of 2005 we found 2 letterboxes, both in separate locations in the Chicago western suburbs and planted by two different letterboxers - both familiar.  Each box had a cleaned cat skull right next to the box. Being the nature nerd that she is, Tiptoe took them home to admire along with other assorted natural specimens she has accumulated.  This was the start of a small skull collection requiring a designated shelf that our son affectionately refers to as his mother's "shelf of death"!  BTW - she doesn't have a fox skull!<br/>
<br/>
Our experience, although weird, turned out to be a nice find.  However, both letterboxes were intact unlike your unfortunate situation.  We thought it strange that someone would place a cat skull near the box. ( We presumed that they were placed there as no other part of the skeleton was around.)  We've entertained each other with various hypothesis....<br/>

a geocacher and skulls are what he/she uses for trinkets.<br/>
