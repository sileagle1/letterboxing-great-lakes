<br/>
I read the clues to this one day only box and was sad that I would be at <br/>
the Calhoun County fair all day and would not be<br/>
able to hunt down this box. I managed to get all of the clues deciphered at <br/>
the time except the name... as my husband and I were<br/>
"silently communicating" that evening I stopped him to ask if "FE" meant <br/>
anything to him.. he didn't understand what that had to do with<br/>
what we were doing at that moment but I couldn't get it out of my mind.. he <br/>
told me what he thought and I knew he was right!<br/>
Thursday night we are coming home from having dinner at Hooters in Kzoo and <br/>
I see a horse in black clothing from the state of 10k lakes with<br/>
the name "FE GT".., (the clues!) I screamed!!! Hubby asked what the problem <br/>
was and I explained that we had just passed the Woodward Dream Cruise box <br/>
before it had reached its location.. I made him (I was driving) write a <br/>
message on paper and put it to the window.. I was trying to get them to <br/>
pull over as a rest area was coming up, hoping they would trade stamps with <br/>
me. I passed them while flashing my interior light and hubby holding the <br/>
paper to the window. They must have thought I was a complete nut case! I <br/>
guess it was too dark to read the note and they flashed their lights back <br/>
at me and continued on their way... I was bummed! but excited at the same <br/>
time..<br/>
Way too cool, PPP<br/>
