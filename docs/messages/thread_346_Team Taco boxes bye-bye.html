In light of a recent rash of M.I.A.'s among our letterboxes, we've <br/>
come to the conclusion that someone, most likely a non-letterboxer, <br/>

Kate and I have taken all our clues off the LbNA site, and they will <br/>

for the year went up to six earlier this month.  Now we're already <br/>
at nine missing, and we've come to a point where it seems like <br/>
having the clues widely available seems incredibly foolhardy. <br/>
<br/>
I think our mistake was telling friends and coworkers about <br/>
letterboxing in a naive attempt to share the fun.  The word must <br/>
have gotten around to someone who thought the fun in letterboxing <br/>
lies in messing with letterboxers. And you may be right, WI Hiker, <br/>
this new wave of publicity may spark pranksterism on even a national <br/>
level.  Who knows?  Tough clues may HAVE to be the way to go, just <br/>
for the sake of box survival. <br/>
<br/>
As for Team Taco, we'll figure something out, a new way to get clues <br/>
in circulation.  The words "fun" and "challenging" come to mind, and <br/>
we hope you think so, too.<br/>

&gt; That is really discouraging!  It could be just a coincidence, but <br/>
then again I'm not sure how many you have lost.  I was really bummed <br/>
when we discovered one of mine was missing.  I'm impressed that <br/>
you're keeping your chin up and working on alternatives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The increasing publicity re: LB does make me a bit nervous about <br/>
more pranksters surfacing.  Guess we may need to use more <br/>
challenging clues to weed out the riff-raff (not necessarily <br/>
Dragon's MATH MAN clues though!!).<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbGLK] Team Taco boxes bye-bye<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi, guys--<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In light of a recent rash of M.I.A.'s among our letterboxes, <br/>
we've <br/>
&gt; &gt; come to the conclusion that someone, most likely a non-<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxer, <br/>
&gt; &gt; is deliberately taking our boxes.  Why?  I'm not sure, who knows <br/>
&gt; &gt; why <br/>
&gt; &gt; people do the things they do?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Kate and I have taken all our clues off the LbNA site, and they <br/>
&gt; &gt; will <br/>
&gt; &gt; stay off indefinitely.  We're in the process of making our boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; available through some alternative means, so keep an eye out for <br/>
&gt; &gt; more information.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Illegitimus non carborundum! Viva el TACO!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Melinda and Kate  <br/>

&gt; That's one of the reasons I'm now in love with the "hidden" clues.  <br/>
It's like someone mentioned to me not too long ago- there's as much <br/>
of this game "underground" as there is in the public channels.  <br/>
Almost makes it more fun.<br/>
