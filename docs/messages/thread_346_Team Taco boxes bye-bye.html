<br>
In light of a recent rash of M.I.A.'s among our letterboxes, we've <br>
come to the conclusion that someone, most likely a non-letterboxer, <br>
is deliberately taking our boxes.  Why?  I'm not sure, who knows why <br>
people do the things they do?<br>
<br>
Kate and I have taken all our clues off the LbNA site, and they will <br>
stay off indefinitely.  We're in the process of making our boxes <br>
available through some alternative means, so keep an eye out for <br>
more information.<br>
