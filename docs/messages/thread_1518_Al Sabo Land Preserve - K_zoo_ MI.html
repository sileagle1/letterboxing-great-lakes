It was one of those finds that was more serendipity than skillfully following clues -- just happened to recognize something from the clues after I had resigned myself to not finding the box.<br>

placer is no longer active in letterboxing. A couple of years ago some<br>
of the trail markers were changed by the park people rendering the<br>
existing clues to be less-than-complete.<br>
I've emailed the placer about the discepancy but no changes have been<br>
forthcoming.<br>
Sorry about your disappointment at Al Sabo.<br>
It's a great park with lots of fun opportunities.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

I missed the Gathering, but was in MI last weekend.  It was fun<br>
following some of my fellow Wisconsinites back home (the rest of the M<br>
Clan was absent).  Saw you guys and Dragon repeatedly in the Lansing<br>
area, Kalamazoo, and in IN.  Perhaps a series along the WI <--> MI<br>
trail through Chicago would be in order.  Your comment in the Octagon<br>
House book about a nice break from traffic was right on.  Traffic<br>
wasn't bad for me late Monday, but a few Chicagoland breaks are always<br>
nice.<br>
<br>
Would anyone in the Chicagoland area, NW IN area, Milwaukee, Madison,<br>
SW MI, Lansing, Detroit, and even up into Minneapolis be interested in<br>
crafting a series.  I drive this route a lot and it'd be a riot to<br>
have some boxes close of the interstate.  I know Atlasquest will help<br>
with this, but a strictly "I-94 Series" could be fun and convenient.<br>
<br>
I'd be willing to help coordinate this.  Let me know if anyone's<br>
interested.  Or let a newbie like me know if it's already out there.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
