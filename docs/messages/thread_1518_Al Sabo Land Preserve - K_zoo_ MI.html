placer is no longer active in letterboxing. A couple of years ago some<br/>
of the trail markers were changed by the park people rendering the<br/>

I've emailed the placer about the discepancy but no changes have been<br/>
forthcoming.<br/>
Sorry about your disappointment at Al Sabo.<br/>
It's a great park with lots of fun opportunities.<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

I was just at the Belvidere Oasis on I-90.  The gyro wasn't too bad<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to find it, but was unsuccessful.  My<br/>

&gt; As soon as I found out that they were going to have<br/>
&gt; one of my favorite fast<br/>
&gt; food places repped there, I thought to myself "Hey,<br/>
&gt; I can carve that!"  But<br/>
&gt; then I couldn't.  It took me three tries to get a<br/>
&gt; decent stamp.  And I'm<br/>
&gt; still going to redo it again pretty quick here.  I<br/>
&gt; HATE eyeballs!!!<br/>

&gt; WOW!  LOL, so much for new ideas, right  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mosey, I'll contact you off list about the Oases<br/>
&gt; boxing ideas...<br/>

&gt; &gt; I've already got one planted off the Hinsdale<br/>

&gt; &gt; (I live about 10 minutes<br/>
&gt; &gt; from there) -- just haven't gotten the clues<br/>
&gt; written<br/>
&gt; &gt; and posted yet.  If<br/>
&gt; &gt; there's a specific prefix (to the box title) that<br/>
&gt; &gt; you plan for the LbNA or<br/>
&gt; &gt; atlasquest sites, let me know.  (Mine is hidden<br/>
&gt; &gt; outside tho.  I didn't get<br/>
&gt; &gt; permission from anyone connected with the Tollway<br/>
&gt; &gt; Authority.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I also had plans for the two rest areas / oases<br/>
&gt; &gt; going west on I-88 towards<br/>
&gt; &gt; DeKalb.  I wasn't too sure whether to do those.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; go out there only<br/>
&gt; &gt; sporadically and thus wouldn't be checking them<br/>
&gt; &gt; reliably.  Don't know if<br/>
&gt; &gt; it's fair to have people pay toll money to get to<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; box I wouldn't be<br/>
&gt; &gt; checking very often.  Maybe once every three<br/>
&gt; months<br/>
&gt; &gt; or if there was a report<br/>
&gt; &gt; that it couldn't be found.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I missed the Gathering, but was in MI last<br/>
&gt; weekend.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It was fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; following some of my fellow Wisconsinites back<br/>
&gt; home<br/>
&gt; &gt; (the rest of the M<br/>
&gt; &gt; Clan was absent).  Saw you guys and Dragon<br/>
&gt; &gt; repeatedly in the Lansing<br/>
&gt; &gt; area, Kalamazoo, and in IN.  Perhaps a series<br/>
&gt; along<br/>
&gt; &gt; the WI &lt;--&gt; MI<br/>
&gt; &gt; trail through Chicago would be in order.  Your<br/>
&gt; &gt; comment in the Octagon<br/>
&gt; &gt; House book about a nice break from traffic was<br/>
&gt; right<br/>
&gt; &gt; on.  Traffic<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn't bad for me late Monday, but a few<br/>
&gt; Chicagoland<br/>
&gt; &gt; breaks are always<br/>
&gt; &gt; nice.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Would anyone in the Chicagoland area, NW IN area,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Milwaukee, Madison,<br/>
&gt; &gt; SW MI, Lansing, Detroit, and even up into<br/>
&gt; &gt; Minneapolis be interested in<br/>
&gt; &gt; crafting a series.  I drive this route a lot and<br/>
&gt; &gt; it'd be a riot to<br/>
&gt; &gt; have some boxes close of the interstate.  I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; Atlasquest will help<br/>
&gt; &gt; with this, but a strictly "I-94 Series" could be<br/>
&gt; fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; and convenient.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'd be willing to help coordinate this.  Let me<br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; if anyone's<br/>
&gt; &gt; interested.  Or let a newbie like me know if it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; already out there.<br/>

&gt; This is the beginning of a new day. You have been<br/>
&gt; given this day to use as<br/>
&gt; you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What<br/>
&gt; you do today is<br/>
&gt; important because you are exchanging a day of your<br/>
&gt; life for it. When<br/>
&gt; tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in<br/>
&gt; its place is something<br/>
&gt; that you have left behind... let it be something<br/>
&gt; good.<br/>
