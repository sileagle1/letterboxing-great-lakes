Project Linus is a national organization that collects hand made blankets <br/>
for children in hospitals and otherwise in need. I invited letterboxers who <br/>
crocheted to make me a granny square to receive the box.  I thought piecing <br/>
together granny squares from around the country would be a fun way to create <br/>
a crocheted blanket for this wonderful cause.  I was hoping to receive <br/>
enough squares (around 36) to make one blanket.  As of last count, over 250 <br/>
squares have been received!   Our local chapter of Project Linus was so <br/>
thrilled with this project it even made their latest newsletter!<br/>

This postal letterbox has inspired other endeavors.  We had the Project <br/>
Linus mini-meet back in January where we worked on joining the squares that <br/>
had been collected.  A Pig Pen postal letterbox is circulating collecting <br/>
cotton squares for quilting.  The stamp from the mini-meet was (changed <br/>
slightly) recycled into the Project Linus mini-meet postal letterbox and <br/>
being circulated with a blanket being added onto by each recipient.  There <br/>
is even the Linus decodes K1P2 postal letterbox for knitters to add to a <br/>
blanket.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now its time for Linus to come to the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The original Project Linus plb stamp and log will be available to stamp into <br/>
at the gathering for those who would like to contribute.  Because we dont <br/>
need to mail things around I thought I would expand the criteria for <br/>
stamping in so that almost anyone who is interested can participate.  If you <br/>
would like to stamp into this box in June, please bring to the gathering:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-         a crocheted or knitted 6 inch square to be added into a blanket<br/>
<br/>
-         a handmade fleece blanket (e-mail me if you would like <br/>
instructions to make one, they are very easy)<br/>
<br/>
-         a piece of fleece 1  yards or larger to donate to be made into a <br/>
blanket<br/>
<br/>
-         a skein of acrylic washable yarn (such as 'Red Heart' brand)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

If you have any questions or need information you can contact me off list. <br/>
Thanks everyone in advance for your contributions to this wonderful cause.<br/>
