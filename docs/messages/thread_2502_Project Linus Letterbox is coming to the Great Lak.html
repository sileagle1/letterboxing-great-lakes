Project Linus is a national organization that collects hand made blankets <br>
for children in hospitals and otherwise in need. I invited letterboxers who <br>
crocheted to make me a granny square to receive the box.  I thought piecing <br>
together granny squares from around the country would be a fun way to create <br>
a crocheted blanket for this wonderful cause.  I was hoping to receive <br>
enough squares (around 36) to make one blanket.  As of last count, over 250 <br>
squares have been received!   Our local chapter of Project Linus was so <br>
thrilled with this project it even made their latest newsletter!<br>

This postal letterbox has inspired other endeavors.  We had the Project <br>
Linus mini-meet back in January where we worked on joining the squares that <br>
had been collected.  A Pig Pen postal letterbox is circulating collecting <br>
cotton squares for quilting.  The stamp from the mini-meet was (changed <br>
slightly) recycled into the Project Linus mini-meet postal letterbox and <br>
being circulated with a blanket being added onto by each recipient.  There <br>
is even the Linus decodes K1P2 postal letterbox for knitters to add to a <br>
blanket.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now its time for Linus to come to the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The original Project Linus plb stamp and log will be available to stamp into <br>
at the gathering for those who would like to contribute.  Because we dont <br>
need to mail things around I thought I would expand the criteria for <br>
stamping in so that almost anyone who is interested can participate.  If you <br>
would like to stamp into this box in June, please bring to the gathering:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-         a crocheted or knitted 6 inch square to be added into a blanket<br>
<br>
-         a handmade fleece blanket (e-mail me if you would like <br>
instructions to make one, they are very easy)<br>
<br>
-         a piece of fleece 1  yards or larger to donate to be made into a <br>
blanket<br>
<br>
-         a skein of acrylic washable yarn (such as 'Red Heart' brand)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have any questions or need information you can contact me off list. <br>
Thanks everyone in advance for your contributions to this wonderful cause.<br>
