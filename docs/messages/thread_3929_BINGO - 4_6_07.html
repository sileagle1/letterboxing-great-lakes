I also think that the perimeter and full card will be simultaneous.  <br>
Maybe next year a triangle could be one of the winning Bingos.  We'd need to get a half of an X and one of the sides to form a triangle at either the top, bottom, left or right.<br>

I keep thinking a cross would be nice. A parrellel and horizontal line <br>
crossing in any pattern. Maybe next year?<br>
