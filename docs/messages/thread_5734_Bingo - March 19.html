Are you kidding?  LOL I'm from Michigan and I think all the boxes <br>
/events/names that have been called were from IL & OH!   Funny how <br>
your perspective changes depending on where you live and what words <br>
you see/don't have.  I was thinking yesterday that at least MI people <br>
are winning, since so few of our words have been called!<br>
<br>
My guess is that in reality, it's all pretty evenly distributed <br>
across the states.<br>

If you are cursed in letterboxing BINGO, then that won't help either.  I have lots of general terms on my card, but SpringChick seems to call everything BUT the ones I have.  It amazes me every morning to see that she has called another general term.  I excitedly look at my card to see if it is one I picked.  But no....   She's got to be running out of general terms that I don't have.  One day, my turn will come.<br>
