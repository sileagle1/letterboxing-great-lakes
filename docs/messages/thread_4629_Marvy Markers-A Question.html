We were interested in experimenting with the Marvy Markers....the <br/>
trouble is we didn't realize that there were so many different kinds <br/>
out there. (Pigment, dye, water-based, brush tip, fine tip etc.) For <br/>
those of you who use the markers for letterboxing, which kind do you <br/>
use and enjoy...and why? Any help would be appreciated!<br/>

mini-meet last January. They're the larger tipped dye based markers<br/>
and are a big improvement on Crayolas, but I've kept looking for<br/>
something happier. The tips are very large, the ends pop off if I'm<br/>
not careful recapping, and the ink does indeed run if wet.<br/>
<br/>
So I invested in the LePlume pigmented double ended markers last<br/>
month. Wow. These are marvelous (so far!) and I'm really enjoying the<br/>
change. The brush tips are considerably smaller. The writing tips are<br/>
just what I wanted AND don't get lost separately in my bag! (ever go<br/>
digging for that pen you KNEW was in there..somewhere...?) I haven't<br/>
done a drip test yet, but I'm hopeful :)<br/>

of Marvy Markers only to find that there were soooo many choices. I <br/>
picked up a set of the water based Brush Markers. It was the Primary <br/>
Color Set. A word to the wise you should carry some water and paper <br/>
towles to wash the ink off of the stamp before you color it with your <br/>
markers. Otherwise the ink from the stamp gets into amd mikes with <br/>
the ink on your markers. Someone suggested using a spray bottle of <br/>
water to clean off the stamp. I just put one in my bag and plan to <br/>
try it the next time that I get out.<br/>

The brush ends are a little softer and "juicier", and the fine tip is a little less fine (not as good for writing, but better for small coloring - Marvy fine tips are harder and don't color as well).<br/>

Reading one right now, it does say "pigment" and also has "Quality Memory Book Markers", "Archival qualitye ink - acid free/non-toxic - photo activity tested (photo safe) - lightfast - smearproof when dry - water resistant".  They are dual tipped, broad (not brush) and fine.  I only have one which I accidentally bought, and honestly haven't used it on stamps (the non-brush tip isn't as easy to use), so I don't know how it would perform, but think it would be a good idea for logbooks which might potentially get wet.<br/>
