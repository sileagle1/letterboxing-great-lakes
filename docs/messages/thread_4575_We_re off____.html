Oh, I am so jealous (can I be a HH in one of your boxes)!!!!!  Have a <br>
wonderful time.  I think I remember reading that the Lord of the Rings <br>
and The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe were filmed there--so you <br>
should be in for some gorgeous scenery and hikes.  <br>

Also, we will pray that your boxes make it through airport security!! You  <br>

We will keep up with your blog... I enjoy reading up on you every week or  so <br>

I would put the carvings in a little pouch. The logbooks in another pouch  <br>
and let whatever happen to the boes happen. <br>
 <br>
I figure I could buy boxes in New Zealand... and paper for logbooks. The  <br>
carvings, however, I'd hate to see anything happen to them.<br>

When we flew to Alaska, we took 5 letterboxes to plant.  I had 5 camo <br>
Lock 'n Locks (with all their contents) in my carry-on bag, and had not <br>
a peep from security.  And after dropping all those boxes off, we had <br>
more room for things to bring back!  Again, I hope you have a wonderful <br>
trip!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, but Alaska is still considered at "domestic" flight. I think security  <br>
is much tighter on over-seas travel... as when I nearly missed my flight to  <br>
Israel in 1996 and was detained for reasons unknown :-) up until I thought I'd  <br>
miss my flight. Comforted only be the words of the security officer who told <br>
me  that the flight "knew about me" -- great, I thought, the whole flight is <br>
late  because of me and everyone knew about it.<br>
 <br>
Good news in the matter, they did bump me up to 1st class!!! <br>
 <br>
That was long before 9-11 though.<br>

enjoyed traveling along with them...It is one of those trips of a lifetime!  It is evident how <br>
letterboxing takes you to some very interesting places and you win some and lose some, <br>
but ultimately it's all about the hike!  You will see that WiHi has more than earned her trail <br>
name..And as for MM...he probably has spent the evenings after those long hikes working <br>
on his!  Check it out if you haven't done so already..National Geographic and the the Globe <br>
