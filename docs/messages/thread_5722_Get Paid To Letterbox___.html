P.S. I was the boss cracking the whip...she "didn't want to walk in the mud anymore today"...but I said it's not that bad...then she spotted the money. <br/>
<br/>
P.P.S. She asked what my highlight of the day was...I said "spending time out hiking with you." She says..finding the $10 dollars was her highlight and that made it all worth it! Ahh. She's hilarious.:)<br/>
