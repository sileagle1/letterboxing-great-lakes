                    <div class="plaintext-content">Placing and maintaining a letterbox (or many letterboxes) can be a lot <br/>
of work.  When a finder contacts the placer, it's one way to let the <br/>
placer know that the box is safe and sound. Some finders may not <br/>
contact the placer and leave a message because they are not as familiar <br/>
with the hobby as many of us are. It's just a common courtesy, sort of <br/>
like a thank you note, but how many people remember to send thank you <br/>
notes any more.  Just not viewed as socially important.  Or, could it <br/>
be that some finders don't want to contact the placer to report a <br/>
missing or damaged box for fear that they will be blamed?  I never look <br/>
at it that way, because the act of reporting a problem doesn't fit the <br/>
profile of a person who takes or damages a box. However, we get back <br/>
what we put into this hobby.  I have made some wonderful friends who <br/>
have shared their creative ideas and talents with me simply because I <br/>
took the time to contact them; the placer of a letterbox. Everyone is <br/>
different, so don't take it personally.  <br/>
