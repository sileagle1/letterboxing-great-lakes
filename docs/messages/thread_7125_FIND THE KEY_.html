                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today we launched the 'Search for the Key.' In order to find the key, <br/>
you need to find the other 18 boxes in the series. As you find each box, <br/>
RECORD THE CODE WRITTEN ON THE 2nd PAGE OF EACH BOX'S LOGBOOK. THESE <br/>
CODES ARE CASE SENSITIVE, SO MAKE SURE YOU COPY THEM EXACTLY. EACH CODE <br/>
HAS A NUMBER (1-18) AND THEN A 4 CHARACTER CODE. By DECIPHERING THE <br/>
CODES, you should be able to find this box. Thanks to Hartx6 for carving <br/>
the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Clues for all of the boxes should be posted today, and they will be <br/>
linked to the clue for the final box.<br/>

The Story:<br/>
<br/>
At a recent event, the following was overheard spoken by Mayor Daley to <br/>
Rahm Emanuel, I wish you the best of luck, and I had hoped to give you <br/>
the KEY I inherited from Eugene.<br/>
<br/>
While a small side note, it piqued the interest of several of the press <br/>
corps. Could this be the fabled Key to the city? It was rumored to have <br/>
been presented to Mayor Ogden by a local civic group back in 1838. <br/>
Although the actual key had never been seen, it is said to unlock all <br/>
the mysteries of the city of Chicago and Lake Michigan. Its existence <br/>
had been, long ago, dismissed as an urban legend, and even among the <br/>
true believers, it was thought to have vanished decades ago. Did Mayor <br/>
Daley actually once possess the key? Maybe, he was hazing the new guy <br/>
and just perpetuating a known Chicago myth.<br/>
<br/>
If you are as curious as I, you will need to search the region to find <br/>
clues to help you find the whereabouts of the lost Key. Lucky for you, <br/>
Ive done a bit of homework, and Ive uncovered some information that <br/>
you will find helpful. In doing so, you might decipher the code that has <br/>
kept the Key to the city hidden for nearly 200 years. You will have to <br/>
visit some old haunts, past notable figures, and find a few relics of <br/>
Chicago history. Now, a few of my leads are purely speculative, but a <br/>
few of them are much more likely. So to complete this journey, youll <br/>
have to visit each lead.<br/>
<br/>
GOOD LUCK!<br/>
