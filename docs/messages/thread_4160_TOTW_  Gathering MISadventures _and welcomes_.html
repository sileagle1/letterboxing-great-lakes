Glad to hear it was minor!  Same thing with our poison ivy - just a <br>
few scratches that itch and have scabbed over - no major outbreak.  <br>
There sure seemed to be a LOT of it at the park last weekend!<br>

I'll have to update the pics...those early ones I posted are nothing <br>

I'm sure there's one or two hanging about, but I haven't even heard one yet this year.  We're on a different cycle down here, we had our 17-year cicadas a few years ago so we aren't due for another decade or so.<br>
