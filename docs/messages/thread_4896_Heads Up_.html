It looks like Ryan is having a lot of fun with all of us ... he certainly went to a lot of trouble to work it all out.  But he gives himself away with getting "six figures" from McDonalds!  It's got to be an April Fools joke ... and a good one, at that!  LOL<br/>

It's all just an April Fools joke, no worries!<br/>
