The box then travelled to Maine for the Mid-Coast Maine Letterboxing Event in early August.  Again discounting write-ins, results were McCain 12, Obama 10.  And then the box went to the Beautiful Ohio's Edge gathering.<br>

I just received the box back and here are the results:  McCain 8 votes, Obama 2 votes.  For what it's worth, this gathering took place the weekend AFTER McCain announced Sarah Palin as his running mate.  <br>

Two months to go til the REAL election and the box hasn't been invited to any other gatherings.  Guess we'll have to wait 2 months to see if the general electorate follows the letterboxers' trend :)<br>
