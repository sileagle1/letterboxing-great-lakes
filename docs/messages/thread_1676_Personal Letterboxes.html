I have heard it mentioned about personal letterboxes or stamps that people carry on them and then if you see them you have to ask a certain question or make a certain comment. Could someone explain to me how it works? Is it that simple?<br>
<br>
Could I just carve a stamp and keep it in our RV than post that if someone finds the Indiana LTRBXRS they just have to ask?<br>
