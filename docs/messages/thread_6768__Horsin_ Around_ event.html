                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I'm finally starting to recover from Saturday's event - although I still do have to get back out on the forest preserve trails and pull 40+ stamps.  I intend to start doing that tomorrow afternoon.  To all who sent stamps for the event, they will be in the mail to you hopefully within a week or less.<br>
<br>
Where to start?  Well first of all, thanks to everyone who came!  It was great seeing so many old acquaintances plus lots of new faces.  As usual I missed getting some exchanges.  Hopefully at the next event ("Dead of Winter II"?).<br>
<br>
Secondly, a TREMENDOUS thank you to the following boxers (in no particular order) who provided so many wonderful stamps for the event:<br>
    Beetle<br>
    Funguswoman<br>
    Mars888 (traveling event stamp)<br>
    Maude<br>
    Nitrocat<br>
    Prairie Rose<br>
    Pugnasties<br>
    Archaeofrog (Black Beauty postal)<br>
    samwashere<br>
    Ferrit-It-Out<br>
    SunnySideUp<br>
    SweetEllGee<br>
    Sarcasmo<br>
    Wisconsin Hiker<br>
    Martini Man<br>
    PackerBackers<br>
    Pink Unicorn Girl    <br>
    Hartx6<br>
    Funrunner<br>
<br>
I hope I haven't missed anyone, if I have I apologize.<br>
<br>
And an EXTRA BIG thank you to Nitrocat who:<br>
    1.  Carved 19 stamps<br>
    2.  Provided over a dozen containers <br>
    3.  Supplied about 15 logbooks, all hand-made<br>
    4.  Drove up to deliver all this personally, and<br>
    5.  Put on a mini-workshop at the event on pouch-making<br>
<br>
Another big thank-you for all the wonderful dishes brought to the pot luck.  Russ and I are still talking about the soups, desserts, pasta dishes, etc.  (The bees loved it all too.)  So much food, I wasn't able to sample more than half of it.  And the bathroom scale is now my bitter enemy.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all who donated so generously to help cover expenses.  And finally, thanks to Pastor's Wife and Steering Lives.  PW is a great administrator, did all the printing, remembers all the important stuff that I forget, and is a an all-around great event-planning partner :)<br>
<br>
And - I only found two cooties . . . so far.<br>

We had a wonderful time on Saturday, in spite of all the bees  =)<br>
<br>
The hosts were wonderful, the food was great (nice job on the brats NamVet), the stamps were amazing, and the people were fun. I missed a lot of the newer boxers due to being out on the trail most of the day, so hopefully I can meet them at the next gathering. <br>
<br>
Thank you so much and we look forward to the next one!<br>
Oh, and I just posted our 2 boxes on AQ (Winged One and Unus Cornu) as traditional boxes. <br>
