What happens if people continue to add boxes that fall within or on <br>

<br>
The May 1st deadline was for getting boxes in place, but I am not really<br>
holding to that too tightly, I just needed some kind of a timeframe so I<br>
would have the information necessary to put the web page together.  If you<br>
have additional boxes you would like included, please e-mail me the<br>
information for them and I will add them.<br>
<br>
I too am really tied up with job-related things and haven't made as much<br>
progress on the Letterboxing 'Round the Lake web page as I would have liked.<br>
I am hoping to get a few hours this weekend to finish it up.  In that case I<br>
would still be able to get the link out the the tourist associations before<br>
the first of June.<br>
<br>
I am open to adding more boxes along the route on and ongoing basis, as long<br>
as they meet the criteria and are kept maintainted, etc.  It really takes<br>
minimal work on my part to put in additional boxes once the initial page is<br>
made.  I think the more boxes there are along the route, the more people<br>
will be interested.  So, the more the merrier!<br>
