We were in Hilton Head in March of 2011.  There weren't nearly the number of boxes to look for as there are now.<br>
<br>
We enjoyed finding the following boxes....<br>
The Gullah Storyteller - a quick driveby, loved the colorful stamp and history<br>
Doodle Box: Ellie - enjoyed the walk through the Audobon Newhall Preserve<br>
The Ghost of William Baynard - great historical spot....Baynard Ruins<br>
Beach Soire series - the wildlife stamp provided a nice hike through Sea Pines Forest Preserve and the sailing stamp at Baynard Ruins<br>
<br>
As far as the newer boxes planted that you might want to try (based on our visit to the island)...........Salty Dog is a fun place to eat, we loved Harbor Town and the lighthouse w/museum, and we rode our bikes through and past tCompass Rose Park quite a few times and took pictures of the Charles Fraiser sculpture.  The compass rose in the park is pretty cool.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.  Enjoy your trip!!!<br>
