I've been out of the letterboxing loop recently, but I am Optic's (Teresa) daughter, Kayakin' Monkey.  I know she's still active in the boxing community so I thought you guys should know what's going on.  (She's going to strangle me when she gets back to her computer.)  She went to the hospital yesterday with chest pain and they found she was having a heart attack.  She's going to be in the hospital until at least Tuesday because of a procedure that needs to be done on Monday.  I'd appreciate it if everyone would keep her in their thoughts and prayers.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
