                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have to make some sacrifices this year on our vacations... we have  <br>
eliminated 2 vacations, a long one to Virginia and North Carolina. Then in its  <br>
place we decided to make a shorter one to Door County . . . alas we have  <br>
scratched that one of the list as well :-(<br>
 <br>
We are still planning our Little House on the Prairie trip, though we have  <br>
decided to shorten it as well... we will not be going to De Smet, South  Dakota.<br>
 <br>
All this being said, I talked my lovely wife into scheduling our 4 day trip  <br>
over the annual Great Lakes Gathering as Pepin, Wisconsin is awful close to <br>
the  Gathering site -- Woo Hoo!<br>
 <br>
I just signed 4 of the 6 up (the twins will be staying with my  in-laws).<br>
 <br>
I was hoping to carve a series of stamps of "Little House on the Prairie"  <br>
theme (we will see how many I can get done, its a sad day when 4 months doesn't  <br>
seem long enough) and put them together in the same style as <br>
Boxer-in-Training's  Egyptian Series.<br>
 <br>
I also call dibs on a Wood Chipper... perhaps that scene took place in  <br>
Fargo, but that is close enough for me :-)<br>
