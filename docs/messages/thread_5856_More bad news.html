                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got word today that "Larry's Landing" appears to be gone.  If so, this would make three of my boxes missing from the same park.  This is really too bad, as my friend who carved all the stamps put a lot of work into these stamps and did a great job.  It seems someone deliberately targeted and removed these boxes - whom, I don't know.  It is doubtful that I will replace them.<br>
