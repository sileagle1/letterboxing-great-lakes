                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds good!   It will be good to get a date & location finalized for our<br>
planning purposes.  It's also great to know there are so many willing hosts<br>
in IL.  It means we should have plenty of opportunities to head "south" not<br>
only for the GL Gathering.  Whoever doesn't host in spring might be<br>
interested in hosting something in summer or fall.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Right now it looks like there are already plenty of events to pencil in on<br>
our calendars:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
DEC 12 (tentative) - "Bunnies, Bears, and Books Bash"  in Brookfield, IL<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
JAN 16 - "Dead of Winter" in Rockford, IL<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
FEB ? - "SILO 4 - Comic Book" in Oak Bluff, IL  [I think I remember reading<br>
about this in the last couple of months]<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
JUN ? - "2010 Great Lakes Gathering" in ??, IL<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Speaking of calendars, does everyone know that there is a calendar feature<br>
on this Message Board?  It would be great if people could enter info about<br>
the events they are hosting onto this calendar.  It would be an easy way to<br>
reference when events are scheduled and get some of the basic details in a<br>
handy calendar format for the Great Lakes Region.<br>

If there is anyone else who is interested in hosting the event in Illinois this year, please post to the list or contact me privately before Sunday -- you should have an approximate location in mind (do not reserve anything at this point -- just have a general area in mind) and some idea(s) as to theme.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Other Illinois people had previously expressed interest in hosting the Great Lakes Gathering.  The FAQ on which we have traditionally operated (which you'll find in the files section) indicates: <br>
<br>
"If more than one person/state volunteers, a poll will be used to allow group members to choose their preference of location."<br>
<br>
Since there is more than one potential host in Illinois, and the group hasn't yet voted to express our preferences, I think that event was posted prematurely.  <br>
<br>
Sounds like Spring Chick has a plan for allowing us to vote among all the kind folks who volunteered. Sounds fair to me.<br>
