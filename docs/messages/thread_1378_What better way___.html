Yes, I finally planted my first box tonight!<br/>
It was an awesome night too!  There were so many<br/>
critters out on the trail.  I saw 2 large (baseball<br/>
sized) frogs, a huge snapping turtle, and what I think<br/>
was a red colored crayfish (help me out here, it<br/>
looked like a minature lobster, about 4 inches long).<br/>
So be sure to look for the clues to the new box in<br/>
Homer Glen.<br/>
I can't get on the LBNA website right now... I'm<br/>
getting an error message, so I will try again later<br/>
tonight or first thing in the morning.  :-)<br/>
Happy letterboxing,<br/>

Sounds like fun to me!  I'm planning to finally get out and plant<br/>
Snowmiser and Heatmiser this weekend, despite the forecast of<br/>
thunderstorms.  Where is Homer Glen, anyway?  I couldn't find it when I<br/>
looked on the map a few weeks ago (there's an agility trial there, and<br/>
with a letterbox nearby, that trial seems more appealing...)<br/>
<br/>
Small red lobster does sound like a crayfish.  <br/>
<br/>
And I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one for whom the LBNA site was <br/>
acting up yesterday.<br/>
