                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not exactly sure how you may have listed the boxes previously and we normally plant our event boxes as permanent plants, but here's what we've done a few times:<br>
<br>
If we planted a box with clues at an event that didn't allow the box to remain permanently, we didn't even post it on-line, just distributed the clues at the event via the clue packet or a separate sheet of paper w/clues.  After we removed the box and replanted it permanently, we used the same logbooks, but put a note on the next blank page that the box had been relocated after the event.  We THEN  posted the clues on-line and noted in the clues that the box had originally appeared at an event.  We feel that is an important item to include in the clues so people that may have already found it don't accidently go looking for it again, thinking it is a new box/stamp.<br>
<br>
If you want to see examples of boxes that we replanted after an event, you can find some here:<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Also, AQ does not let you change the type of box (for example, from event<br>
to traditional), so you would need to officially retire your event box and<br>
then re-list it as a traditional box (with, as Wisconsin Hiker suggested) a<br>
note in the clues about its previous life as an event box.<br>
<br>
People might still go looking for it, even if they've found it already.<br>
Case in point, I spent time in South Dakota this past week finding several<br>
of my own stamps that Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man planted there last<br>
fall ... and I would have been first finder too if PoofMagicEvilKitty and<br>
group hadn't beaten me by just one week!<br>
