Is there no end to the craziness of this pastime?  We haven't recovered from the rigors of the Olympics that this madman put us through this past winter..and now having to think of his maniacal laughter each and every day... ALL WINTER LONG as he thinks of new ways to drive us nuts with BINGO twists and turns!<br>
We want to thank Spring Chick for being such a gracious Bingo hostess all of these years...TRUSTWORTHY and SANE...we can only hope for the some of the same qualities to be evident in "Bingo Boss #2"<br>
Nonetheless, we are a hardy group...we will survive and thrive under his hosting!  Bring it on my man!<br>

a "few extra" dolls to keep all those crazy players in check. However, where<br>
