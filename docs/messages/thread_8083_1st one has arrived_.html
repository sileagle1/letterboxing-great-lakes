                    <div class="plaintext-content">I guess it means we are getting closer...we have received the first <br>
stamp contribution for GLK 2015. Thank you to Twofreetimers for the <br>
great stamp and wonderfully related logbook.  You will all want to find <br>
this one!<br>
<br>
As a reminder, we are accepting stamps through the beginning of May.  <br>
There is a file in gathering folder <br>
(https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LBGLK/files/Gatherings/2015%20Great%20Lakes%20Gathering/) <br>
that we'd like you to include with your stamp...some paperwork so we <br>
don't misplace whose stamp is whose.  We forgot to mention the first <br>
time, but please include return postage equal to that which you paid to <br>
send your package if you want your stamp returned.<br>
<br>
It may be cold and snowy outside, but I'm thinking warm thoughts about <br>
the gathering in June!<br>
