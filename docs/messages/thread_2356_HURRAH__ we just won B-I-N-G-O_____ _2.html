it was a joke, but I only *hoped*  Glad to know that there's still a chance, however remote.<br/>

 I found this info on another list, You may find it interesting:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Pope Gregory XIII introduced a new calendar into the Christian world<br/>
&gt;and, in 1852, France was the first country to switch from the Julian<br/>
&gt;to the new Gregorian calendar. The significance of this switch was<br/>
&gt;that the beginning of the year was moved from April 1st to January 1st.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;However, there were some people who did not hear about the switch, or<br/>
&gt;did not believe it, or just refused to accept the change of the date,<br/>
&gt;and so they continued to celebrate New Year's Day on April 1st. Others<br/>
&gt;took this opportunity to play tricks on them and called them "April<br/>
&gt;Fools." In essence, they tried to make them believe that something<br/>
&gt;false was actually true and sent them on a "Fools Errand".<br/>

Bindle Babe - you rat!<br/>
We just got back from a funeral this weekend and weren't able to <br/>
catch up on the BINGO happenings until today...When I read your <br/>
winning proclamation we admittingly were a bit down that the game <br/>
was over and we had come up empty-handed...But, our frowns quickly <br/>
turned around when we realized that all was not lost!  April 1st was <br/>
our Azodate! If you had really won with the word "Degree" on April <br/>
1st - we would be the Azobox winners! <br/>
We can hardly take this roller coaster of emotions....and now we <br/>
must sit at 20 words and eagerly await for the BINGO email to send <br/>
10 quick words our way! Hope springs eternal!<br/>
