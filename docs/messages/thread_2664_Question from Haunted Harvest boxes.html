                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, this is a rather odd question, but I am asking anyway.  We are <br>
finishing up some boxes left from the Haunted Harvest gathering (last <br>
fall) over the next few weeks since the park is very close and we can <br>
go right after Mr. Cat Herder gets home from work - even if he works late.<br>
<br>
A group of the clues refer to starting at the "Family Picnic <br>
Area".  The problem is - there is no "Family Picnic Area" on the map <br>
or on the signage.  The closest is the "Family Camping", but we are <br>
not certain that this is the correct area.  Can anyone (perhaps WI <br>
Hiker or Martini Man) help me out with the correct name for the <br>
starting point?  Here is the link to the website for the map:<br>

I will say though, it was very neat to watch the bats at sunset <br>
flying around the lake eating bugs.  Very, very cool!<br>

boxes boxes.  I think Wisconsin Hiker is correct - it is picnic area <br>
#3 (or it's right in that area).  We got a map of the park when we <br>
got there and it is labeled on those maps.<br>
