We don't want to get ahead of things, but it's something to think about.  Let's wait and see how the gathering date will be determined and, if it floats, talk about the timing for hosting decisions.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Excellent point!  In some states/counties, reservations can only be made at<br>
the start of the year (January 1), but in other states/counties reservations<br>
can be made up to one year in advance.  Therefore it would be good to get<br>
things rolling regarding hosting a year in advance (for example in May/June<br>
2010 it would be good to make a decision for 2011).  If we wait until the<br>
end of the year, some desirable locations may have already been rented by<br>
other groups.<br>
