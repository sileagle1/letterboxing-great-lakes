Yup, it does.<br/>
New stamp, new clues, new location=new box. It's a first find.<br/>
(But, hey, there are no rules, right?)<br/>
Glad you were able to join the fun in McHenry -- it was so nice to <br/>
meet you two.<br/>
A little background for the rest of the group: I've been <br/>
corresponding with Lucky Charms for a couple of weeks -- they wrote <br/>
me a long, very detailed post about two of my boxes they were <br/>
hunting. And the whole post was in rhyme! How cool is that?<br/>
It's a bonus for us in Kalamazoo to have two new letterboxers who <br/>
have already planted a box, found a not-too-easy mystery box, and <br/>
were able to make the event in Il.<br/>

I had my first run-in with that stuff in April after a letterboxing weekend<br/>
in Maryland.  Luckily it was pretty much confined to my right hand and<br/>
wrist, but that seemed plenty bad enough.  (Although in hindsight I'd rather<br/>
have that again than this broken bone and aching arm...)<br/>
<br/>
Hope Will only has a little bit and recovers quickly.  A lot of tips for<br/>
remedies have been posted on "the big board".<br/>

Azobox, I was anxious to put a face with the name!  Sorry to hear that Will<br/>
got poison ivy -- at the gathering?  I was wondering if anyone would fall<br/>
victim -- I did see some along the pathways.  Have added your new box to my<br/>
