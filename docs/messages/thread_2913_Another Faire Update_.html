thanks for all the boxes, Dragon!  I was out with Rayzell (my new <br/>
convert to our obsession) and we found all 8 of the Performers of Faire <br/>
Series, plus we managed to tackle Jane the Phoole for her stamp while <br/>
she wasn't completely surrounded by patrons.  The Will Shakespeare <br/>
stamp wasn't quite where we tried the first time, but persistence did <br/>
pay off!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and we did manage one exchange!  Jean (Jane?) Ducat - and I know my <br/>
swiss cheese memory is probably butchering that, was stamping in by a <br/>
certain Celtic cross when we came upon her.  :)<br/>

One request though - not all of these boxes are listed on <br/>
Atlasquest!!! Can someone add them possibly? Maybe? No? LOL<br/>
<br/>
We had several exchanges, and found all the boxes - were looking for <br/>
other boxers ALL day!<br/>
