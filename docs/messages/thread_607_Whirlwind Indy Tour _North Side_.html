took a ride to Indy today to find some boxes...<br>
<br>
I found:<br>
36th in Kokomo<br>
Potter's Bridge in Noblesville<br>
<br>
Picnic in the Park<br>
Papillon<br>
Cicada Land<br>
Cross Country Crossroads<br>
Morning Glory<br>
Independence Day #1  <br>
<br>
all in Fort Harrison State Park. More Than Corn seems<br>
to be kinda missing (found the tree, looked under the<br>
rock, no box). All had nice hand-carved stamps. Boxing<br>
under the nose of 50 million cyclists and the DNR was<br>
pretty fun. No one seemed to notice me poking around<br>
in my "letterboxing getup" while they were having some<br>
big bicycle race around Harrison Trace. It was an<br>
ungodly humid day, so I pooped out pretty early.<br>
Didn't meet my goal of getting to Broad Ripple and<br>
Eagle Creek...but oh well.  I'll get back down there<br>
soon, i'm sure. <br>
<br>
Does anyone else have a "letterboxing getup" or outfit<br>
that they wear exclusively to letterbox? I'm finding<br>
that I am partial to an obnoxious tie dyed t-shirt,<br>
olive cargo pants that roll up, hiking shoes, and now<br>
i've added a tacky visor from work. I'm sure the<br>
walkers on most of the trails I took today thought I<br>
was certifiable...<br>
<br>
Time to gear up for Leland, MI trip next weekend! My<br>
host is dying to go boxing so....it should be fun!<br>
