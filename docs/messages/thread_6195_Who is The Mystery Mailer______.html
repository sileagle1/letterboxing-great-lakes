Fo6, actually you can send things to other cities to have them post marked there. You would send everything in a larger padded envelope or box addressed to the Post Master General then the city/state/zip.<br>
<br>
The Post Master would open and cancel everything inside with their post mark.<br>
<br>
This happens A LOT esp. this time of year with towns with names that correspond to Christmas. I know Joy, IL has a special postage cancellation image that is drawn and voted on each year and they get a HUGE amount of mail this time of year -- oh, and Joy, IL is a *little* podunk spot of earth that just so happens to have a P.O.<br>
<br>
This is how I believe MM is getting their Post Cards out... sending them to the Post Master General in each town that corresponds to their Post Cards.<br>

Neither do I. Also, I believe that you cannot send something to a Post Office in another city to have them mail it out from there, so I assume this person is well traveled. I have a suspicion of who it is and they may be from IL. <br>
