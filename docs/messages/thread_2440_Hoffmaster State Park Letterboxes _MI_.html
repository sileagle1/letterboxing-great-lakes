Muskegon.  My 3 boxes there (Spirit of the Dunes, Walk-A-Mile, <br/>
Dutchman's Breeches) are all doing good -- well one of them had to be <br/>
relocated because a tree had fallen and crushed the stump where it was <br/>
hidden, but at least I found it in one piece.<br/>
<br/>
I also checked in on PJ'S Pleasure, planted by Hummingbird, which was <br/>
in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who was hoping to still do Scheherezade's boxes at <br/>
Hoffmaster SP, looks like she has pulled them as I wasn't able to find <br/>
any of them even though I knew where they were as I had previously <br/>
found them.<br/>
<br/>
Gorgeous day for a walk along Lake Michigan!<br/>
