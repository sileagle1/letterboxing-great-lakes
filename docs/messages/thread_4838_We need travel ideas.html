<br/>
I know some of you have lots of experience planning letterboxing trips <br/>
(esp. WH &amp; MM).  Aimlesst and I want to plan a 2 or 3 day trip during <br/>
our Spring break. We'd be leaving from Milwaukee and want to head <br/>
toward dryer, warmer climates, hitting letterboxes along the way. My <br/>
mom will also be coming with and she's interested in finding some of <br/>
historical interest, or in a particularly scenic locale. <br/>
<br/>
I'm a little out of shape because of my 3 weeks of bronchitis and 2 <br/>
weeks being lazy on my honeymoon... so mountain climbing is probably <br/>
not a great idea. :)<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions for us?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
