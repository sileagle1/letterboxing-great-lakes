boxing the trails (Really, you guys HAVE to box with these two<br/>
ladies...hilarious!) Anyhow, Mrs. left early so Fof6 spent the rest of<br/>
the time boxing with Bali until the sun went down. Yes, we were in the<br/>
woods when it was getting dark. She was to meet up in the parking lot<br/>
with her friend. So, we devised a plan to tell her friend that Bali<br/>
sprained her ankle near marker #5 and vicious squirrels were<br/>
descending from the trees. So....Fof6 left her. (Not actually true)<br/>
Anyhow, those woods get creepy at night. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
....and yes, Wisconsin Hiker needs to take care of her coat! lol <br/>
