Savanah &amp; Spring Chick:  Oh count me in on that trip.  I loved Savanah <br/>
and would like to go again.  Last time was with my Girl Scouts (all <br/>
grown up now).  There was so much more i wanted to see but was not able <br/>
to do with our time limits and having the scouts in tow.  If you see me <br/>
sometime, ask me about the last place we went to supper there.   <br/>
