                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree. 2 years ago when we were just started getting into letterboxing, we were on Mackinac Island (ok, so not so far away), and we noticed that the group signing in to just about every logbook on the page before us was the same group. Didn't recognize their name (yet), but not too long after that, that same group found our box hidden here in town. It was cat people. Very neat that we had been visiting all the same boxes so close to each other.<br>
<br>
And (I think) it was Martini Man who found my Turkey Trot box that I planted in AZ. Very cool to have someone from the Great Lakes group find something that I planted so far away ;o)<br>
