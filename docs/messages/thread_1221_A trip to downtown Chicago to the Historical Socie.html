Hi - I'm going down to the Chicago Historical Mus. w/my dad tomorrow. <br/>
He can't do a ton of walking and I'm not super familiar with where <br/>
things are in relation to the HIstorical Society. Could any of you <br/>
recommend any boxes to find that are really close to that area. <br/>
<br/>
We're also going to take a drive down to 31st South and S. Cottage <br/>
Grove Avenue, near lake Michigan. My uncle's, great, great uncle was <br/>
in the Civil war and held as a POW at Camp Douglas by the Union Army <br/>
for 2 years(Camp Douglas was in the area of 31st near the lake). So if <br/>
you know of any boxes down that direction that are fairly easy to find <br/>
w/out too much walking we would love to hear about them. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks. Kimberly "The Honor Guards"<br/>
