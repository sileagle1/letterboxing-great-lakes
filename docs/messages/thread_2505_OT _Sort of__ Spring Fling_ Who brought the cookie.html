<br>
Ok, ok, I'll 'fess up: I like sugar. And carbohydrates. Especially<br>
combined in cookie form. It's one of my biggest weaknesses.... Which<br>
leads me to this question:<br>
<br>
Someone at the Spring Fling brought a pan of bar cookies that had<br>
among other ingredients butterscotch chips, chocolate chips, nuts<br>
(pecans I think,) and perhaps some coconut too. They were SUPERB!<br>
<br>
Could the supplier of these sinful goodies send me a note with the<br>
recipe? We'd love to make them sometime at home (my boys loved them<br>
too,) if the baker wouldn't mind divulging his/her yummy recipe!<br>
<br>
Have a great weekend, all...<br>

that is what we say if something is amazing and we want it all to ourselves.   More for me!<br>
