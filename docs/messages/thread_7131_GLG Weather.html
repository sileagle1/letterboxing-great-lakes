Saturday<br/>

Mostly cloudy. A chance of showers and thunderstorms. Highs 74 to 78. Chance<br/>
of rain 40 percent. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That means 60% chance of NO rain, right?<br/>

I hope that forecast stays true because we've been planting boxes the last 6 days and they've all been HOT.  Today was 94 degrees. Record high.<br/>
The forecast seems to have 40% chance of rain every day.  I would love some rain to bring down the temps.  The mosquitoes are really awful we think bug spray attracts this annoying super pest.<br/>
We would suggest a change of clothes if it stays this hot.<br/>
We were soaked after 2 mles today, thankfully we didn't have the kids along with us.<br/>
