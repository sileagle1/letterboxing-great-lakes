Oh, what we would give to be back down that way to fetch more boxes in that area of NC.  <br>
Most frustrating for us to be in an area with plenty of great boxes and only have an hour to <br>
box!   We made a quick trip down in August to celebrate a friends birthday in Asheville.  <br>
We had a great time, but disappointed about the lack of boxing time! <br>
<br>
My guess is that you found the fun box, "Waiting for Columbus: Fat Man in the Bathtub."  <br>
We will never forget that box!  It was a very warm day and we had our 20 y/o niece with <br>
us.  We told her it was just a short little hike and would be our last box before heading <br>
back to Cincinnati.  She was so hot on our way up (longer than expected) to the box, that <br>
she took her sweatshirt off and hiked in her "sports bra" ...We both looked at each other <br>
and decided that if we wanted to get that box we'd better keep our comments to <br>
ourselves.  I did take a picture to use as blackmail sometime...like for the slideshow at her <br>
wedding!<br>
<br>
This trail connects with a spur to the AP.  We got to the top and surprise, surprise totally <br>
misread the clues - we were blaming it on the heat.  Half-naked niece and Tiptoe <br>
searched and recounted steps.  All of a sudden we realized that we hadn't seen Tonto in a <br>
while.  We called and called.  Our shouts only echoed back to us.  We backtracked and <br>
shouted louder, I think the entire county could hear us, everyone apparently but Tonto.<br>
<br>
  Now Tonto does wander off, but I'd never had him ignore me like this.  I couldn't believe <br>
that he was unable to hear us.  I felt a strange fear come over me and my niece must have <br>
noticed it too.  She started yelling even louder, and my mind was racing with all sorts of <br>
horrible scenarios.  I had him falling off a cliff and hitting his head, or that the barking <br>
dog we passed on the way up had stalked him and attacked when we weren't looking.  I <br>
could here those "Deliverance" banjoes playing.  <br>
<br>
I wildly ran in panic shouting his name still not a word back.  My niece was sweating and <br>
panting as she followed.  I later on found out that her only fear was thinking that she <br>
would have to run back down that hill, find someone to help, and then have to hike back <br>
up in her underwear.  I told her to stay near the last spot we saw him and I would go <br>
around the "Bathtub".  I can't spoil the letterbox clues, but suffice to say it completely had <br>
blocked out the sound of our VERY LOUD voices with an acoustical shadow.   Right there <br>
about twenty feet out was Tonto happy as a hunting clam.   I burst into tears which <br>
freaked out my niece and she started to cry.  He was totally oblivious that we were having <br>
a stroke worrying about his whereabouts.  I was so relieved to find him, but at the same <br>
time, mad as....!  How long was he going to be away from us I wondered.  And of course, <br>
he was totally off mark from the clues, turning over every rock and looking behind every <br>
tree not remotely close to those in the clues.<br>
<br>
We all sat down to catch our breath.  Half-naked niece was in favor of giving up and going <br>
back down to the air conditioned comfort of the car.  Tonto and I gave each other a look, <br>
like "not so fast".  She couldn't believe we were going to look again for this stupid (her <br>
words not ours!) letterbox.  Sitting there we re-read the simple clues and immediately saw <br>
where we had misread them.  We were up like lightening, renewed by that "AH-HA" <br>
moment when stubborn clues become crystal clear.  Tonto found the box in no time and <br>
we happily stamped into it.  <br>
<br>
On the way down feeling relieved about finding the box, (and Tonto!) we had one of those <br>
moments to share with little Nieceie-poo about letterboxing lessons.  Today's topic was <br>
on the merits of perseverance!<br>
WIHI and MM....have a wonderful trip!  Wish we were there!<br>

<br>
Glad to hear you two are having a good time letterboxing--and that others have in the past, too--in one of the most gorgeous places we've ever visited. Makes me a little "homesick" just thinking about it.<br>

We're now in North Carolina and this morning found a box that contained <br>
a stamp carved by The Red Cat of Minnesota for the BABE event in April<br>
(the "Fairy Vantage" box).<br>
<br>
Later in the day we saw Tiptoe and Tonto stamped into a few of the Hot <br>

Sorry, but we won't make it that far!  We have one more day of hiking in the mountains out here near Hot Springs, then tomorrow we'll be heading back down to Charlotte to fly home.<br>
