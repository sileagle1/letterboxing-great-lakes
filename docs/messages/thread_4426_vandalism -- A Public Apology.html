<br/>
I was entrusted by Goose Chaser's family to re-hide Lincoln Park Art, the  <br/>
last box Goose Chaser planted before her death. <br/>
<br/>
This box means so much to so many, and I have let everyone down.<br/>
<br/>
I could have been more careful in my placing the box. I was too busy  writing <br/>
down notes and taking compass bearings that I neglected to take in my  <br/>
surroundings and those who may have been watching me.<br/>
<br/>
I lingered a bit at the hiding spot making sure that the box was well  <br/>
covered and out of sight.<br/>
<br/>
Big Purple Foot, I knew how much this box meant to you. I am deeply sorry  <br/>
for being careless in my search for a new spot. It was meant to "live" on for  <br/>
many more years.<br/>
<br/>
To the family of Goose Chaser, I'm sorry I let you down in your trust of me  <br/>
to take care of this box sufficiently. <br/>
<br/>
To all letterboxers, I hope you get the opportunity to find the rest of  <br/>
Goose Chaser's boxes. I also hope you have the chance to come to the "Wild Goose  <br/>
Chase" gathering on Oct. 6th to honor the memory of a letterboxing pioneer. <br/>
