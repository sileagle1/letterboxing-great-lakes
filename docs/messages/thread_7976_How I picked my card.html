                    <html><body><p>Congrats to all the winners. I did get the straight line this year in my first win in 4 years (I think) playing. I had two words left, but my wildcard was drawn so I was only looking for one more.  I thought everyone might find it interesting as to how I picked my card. I didn't have any trail names or boxes that I could write down this year. So I had a card full of general terms. I used a random number generator to fill out my card.  I numbered each general term and whatever the number generator picked is what I wrote down from top to bottom to fill out the grid.  I just kept going until the whole card was full.  So a totally random card and I was down to two words left. Not too bad :) It is the closest that I have ever gotten.</p><div><br/></div><div>Looking forward to next year</div><div>Jennifer</div></body></html>
