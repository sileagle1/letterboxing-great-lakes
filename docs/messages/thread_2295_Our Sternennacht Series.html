                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the update!  Ancient & I were going to go out and try for the<br>
various Elgin boxes early this afternoon.  Guess we'll wait a bit.<br>
<br>
I've been trying to combine it with trips to the canine opthalmologist out<br>
in Elgin but on any given day either the weather hasn't been cooperative or<br>
Eddie "The Lemon" Blue Pug hasn't been cooperative.  (Eddie says he won't<br>
participate unless I make him his own stamp and I haven't been very<br>
successful to date at carving a Pug.)  Today looks to be an absolutely<br>
beautiful day for boxing -- 55 degress, a little sunny, a little overcast,<br>
no snow.  Guess I'll stay home & finish making my St. Patrick's Day cards.<br>
Was up in Waukesha yesterday for a rubber stamp convention -- small but very<br>
nice -- but was just toooo tired to search for any boxes by the time we got<br>
finished at the convention.  Should've gone up early and stayed overnight.<br>
Next time.<br>

passed through the area it may be safe?<br>
<br>
But we shall return again. This stamp image is indeed a masterpeice and worth the drive. <br>
