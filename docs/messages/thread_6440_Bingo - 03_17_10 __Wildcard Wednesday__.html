For those of you who didn't select your home state for the wild card, <br>
why did you choose the state?<br>

Well, this isn't your question.. but I did pick my home state of <br>
Michigan again this year.  I wasn't going to pick it, but then I <br>
remembered that we were shut out on the wild card picking last <br>
year.  I figured by some weird twist in the law of averages, we <br>
should get picked this year.  But, it's looking like we're going to <br>
lose out again!  Ack.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also picked MN.  I picked it because I figured it wouldn't be as popular a<br>
pick as others and therefore I'd have an "edge" if it were called.<br>
Obviously that hasn't happened!!<br>
