 I was just curious since you mentioned the Illinois tourists. I grew <br/>
up in Lake Geneva and we were inundated with them every summer. <br/>
Yes, it is very beautiful, especially the lake. Of course you never <br/>
really appreciate the beauty of where you live while you are there. It <br/>
wasn't until I became an adult that I really appreciated it. Now I love <br/>
to go back! <br/>
I've been to Rhinelander, but that was so long ago. That's where we <br/>
would take our shopping trips during hunting season. <br/>

I was just curious since you mentioned the Illinois tourists. I grew <br/>
up in Lake Geneva and we were inundated with them every summer. <br/>
Yes, it is very beautiful, especially the lake. Of course you never <br/>
really appreciate the beauty of where you live while you are there. It <br/>
wasn't until I became an adult that I really appreciated it. Now I love <br/>
to go back! <br/>
I've been to Rhinelander, but that was so long ago. That's where we <br/>
would take our shopping trips during hunting season. <br/>

 I've never made it all the way around in one day. I made it halfway <br/>
when I was a kid. Had to call my Dad to come pick me up! You're right <br/>
in that it is a beautiful walk. I always loved looking at the huge <br/>
houses along there. There are some amazing yards too. <br/>
Another great way to see the lake is by tour boat. Have you been on <br/>
any of them? <br/>

 The mailboat is a lot of fun. It actually still delivers mail to the <br/>
homes on the lake. Also the Lady Of The Lake is great. I believe that <br/>
tour is longer than some of the others. You get to hear a lot about <br/>
the history of the lake as well when you're on the tour. It's <br/>
definitely worth it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if you have seen the news, but Lake Geneva is planning <br/>
on putting 81 painted horses around town starting Memorial weekend <br/>
through Labor Day weekend. Along the same lines as the cars here in <br/>
Janesville, the cows in Madison, etc.  I'm thinking of planting <br/>
some "horse" boxes during this time. Maybe I can beef up the area a <br/>
little  =)<br/>

&gt; Nope, never did the boat thing. Might be good for a day.<br/>

&gt; To all and sundry. There are at least 5 boxes that I can think of <br/>
off the<br/>
&gt; top of my head around the lake. We have found these over a number <br/>
of years<br/>
&gt; so some might have since disappeared.<br/>

The mailboat is a lot of fun. It actually still delivers mail to the <br/>
homes on the lake. Also the Lady Of The Lake is great. I believe that <br/>
tour is longer than some of the others. You get to hear a lot about <br/>
the history of the lake as well when you're on the tour. It's <br/>
definitely worth it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if you have seen the news, but Lake Geneva is planning <br/>
on putting 81 painted horses around town starting Memorial weekend <br/>
through Labor Day weekend. Along the same lines as the cars here in <br/>
Janesville, the cows in Madison, etc. I'm thinking of planting <br/>
some "horse" boxes during this time. Maybe I can beef up the area a <br/>
little =)<br/>
