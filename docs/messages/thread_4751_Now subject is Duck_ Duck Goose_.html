 I was just curious since you mentioned the Illinois tourists. I grew <br>
up in Lake Geneva and we were inundated with them every summer. <br>
Yes, it is very beautiful, especially the lake. Of course you never <br>
really appreciate the beauty of where you live while you are there. It <br>
wasn't until I became an adult that I really appreciated it. Now I love <br>
to go back! <br>
I've been to Rhinelander, but that was so long ago. That's where we <br>
would take our shopping trips during hunting season. <br>

Ok, this is cool. So where did you grow up? I was born and raised in <br>
Lake Geneva. Great, now I have to try and guess how old you are to see <br>
if you would have been near me in school  ;-P<br>

I've heard of both of those towns, but never been to either of them. <br>
Hmmm...a Dragon huh? That would either make you 4 years younger than <br>
me, or 8 years older. I think I'll go with the 4 years younger =) <br>
A snow day. How fun! Mine have a snow day from school today so I've <br>
got all 4 home with me. Oy! LOL<br>
Enjoy your day off.<br>

 I've never made it all the way around in one day. I made it halfway <br>
when I was a kid. Had to call my Dad to come pick me up! You're right <br>

 The mailboat is a lot of fun. It actually still delivers mail to the <br>
homes on the lake. Also the Lady Of The Lake is great. I believe that <br>
tour is longer than some of the others. You get to hear a lot about <br>
the history of the lake as well when you're on the tour. It's <br>
definitely worth it.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if you have seen the news, but Lake Geneva is planning <br>
on putting 81 painted horses around town starting Memorial weekend <br>
through Labor Day weekend. Along the same lines as the cars here in <br>
Janesville, the cows in Madison, etc.  I'm thinking of planting <br>
some "horse" boxes during this time. Maybe I can beef up the area a <br>
little  =)<br>
