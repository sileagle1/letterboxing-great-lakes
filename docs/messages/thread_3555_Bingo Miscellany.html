                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have set up a database with the Bingo words that have been called <br>
so if you are away from the list you don't have to hunt through the <br>
posts to find the words you missed (although I cannot imagine who is <br>
not sitting on the edge of their chair anxiously awaiting the next <br>
word to be called ;-)<br>
<br>
A reminder on the games that are being played:<br>
<br>
FULL CARD - this is the big game; all spaces on your card crossed <br>
off (settle in, this will be a while, I think last year we went into <br>
the first week of May, although there are a few less words this year <br>
so it shouldn't be quite that long)<br>
<br>
STRAIGHT LINE - 5 words crossed off in a straight line anywhere on <br>
your board (across, down or diagonally corner to corner)<br>
<br>
"X" - all words on both diagonals crossed off in an "X" configuration<br>
<br>
4 CORNERS - the words in the each of the 4 corners of your board <br>
crossed off<br>
<br>
PERIMETER - the words all around the outer edge of your card crossed <br>
off (straight lines across the top, bottom and down each side)<br>
<br>
There will be 1st, 2nd and 3rd place for the full card game; each of <br>
the others will have only a 1st place winner. A person can claim a <br>
win in more than one category.<br>
<br>
When you have a BINGO in any of the above listed ways, please e-mail <br>
me offlist at letterbox@comcast.net, within 3 days of getting the <br>
Bingo and I will verify against the copies I have here (you can also <br>
feel free to gloat to the list if you want).  The winner of a <br>
particular game is determined by whose winning word was called <br>
first, not necessarily who yelled BINGO first, so if you miss a day <br>
or two and your winning word is called while you are gone, you won't <br>
lose out.  If more than one person wins on the same day/word, a tie-<br>
breaker will be used.<br>
