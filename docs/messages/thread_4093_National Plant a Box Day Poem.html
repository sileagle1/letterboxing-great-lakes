<br>
Twas the Night Before Plant a Letterbox Day and all through the <br>
house, (1)<br>
Not a boxer was carving, not even a louse. (2)<br>
<br>
The backpacks were hung on the hook by the door, (3)<br>
In the hopes that a record, soon we would score. (4)<br>
<br>
The logbooks were nestled all snug in their ziplocs<br>
While visions of dryness surrounded their lock 'n locs (5)<br>
<br>
And I with my Mastercarve and Ryan with his Speedball,<br>
had just settled down to carve a great stamp! (6)<br>
<br>
And what to our wonder eyes did we see,<br>
An abundance of boxes hidden near trees (7)<br>
<br>
There were red ones, and blue ones, and camo and green<br>
All planted and covered n'er more to be seen. (8)<br>
<br>
We spoke not a word but went straight to our work<br>
Hunting a spot in the leaves, rocks and dirt (9)<br>
<br>
We found a great spot, we believe, this is true<br>
Now back to the computer to type out the clue (10)<br>
<br>
On Mama Cache! On Speedsquare! On Lundy & Vickster!<br>
On Mr. Yuk, Amanda, and every last trickster! (11)<br>
<br>
to the hole in the tree, to the crack in the wall,<br>
now stash away, stash away, stash away y'all! (12)<br>
