But now for my soapbox.  Am I the only one who gets really angry about the marketing of Federal Holidays in this country?  "Martin Luther King Day Sales Event at Store A"..."Veterans Day sale at your local Whatever Car Dealer".   Grrrrr!  It really aggravates me!  Okay, off the box now.<br/>
<br/>
But the last few evenings I too have been working on LTC's for SILO2.  (BTW...when you get one, check out the girl on the far left...that's my mother-in-law.)  I've also been carving sig stamps for my two nieces in AZ and creating boxes to place there and in Austin (TX) over spring break at the end of March.<br/>
<br/>
While we're talking about SILO, if anyone wants to carve a stamp for the event, please send me a dozen prints of the image on 3x5 index cards ahead of time, to be distributed as a set to those who send stamps but cannot attend.  (Send the images to me even if you intend on attending - I'm just trying to stay on top of things by having all the images ready beforehand and not have to deal with stamping them the day of the event.)  Contact me offlist for my address if you don't already have it.<br/>
