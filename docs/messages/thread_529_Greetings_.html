<br/>
I just signed up for the LbGLK group, have been letterboxing<br/>
occasionally for about 4 months with my family and have signed up on the<br/>
listserv's Daily Digest mode to get all my e-letterboxing info in one<br/>
electronic message bundle. <br/>
<br/>
We've only Letterboxed in SW Michigan and thus far our favorite finds<br/>
are: <br/>
<br/>
SpringChick's Serendipity  (we had to rent a canoe for that one!)<br/>
Lucky Charm's Election '04 Series  (nice series which led us to a place<br/>
we'd never been in Yankee Springs SP where we picked up out first<br/>
hitchhiker, Tag Along Tiger)<br/>
Azobox's I Spy  (great story and BEAUTIFUL walk and view)<br/>
and  <br/>
Bindle Babe's Misplaced Manatee  (Good story, nice big rock, and at a<br/>
low key, they don't make 'em like that anymore rest stop).<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards,  Roller (and Sprite, Sam and Molly)<br/>

Sounds like you have had some nice adventures already.  I am <br/>
especially thrilled to hear that you did my Serendipity box (will <br/>
write you offline about that also).<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to hearing more of your adventures as you seek (and <br/>
plant?) boxes in the area.<br/>

right next door!)<br/>
