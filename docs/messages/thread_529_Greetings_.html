<br>
I just signed up for the LbGLK group, have been letterboxing<br>
occasionally for about 4 months with my family and have signed up on the<br>
listserv's Daily Digest mode to get all my e-letterboxing info in one<br>
electronic message bundle. <br>
<br>
We've only Letterboxed in SW Michigan and thus far our favorite finds<br>
are: <br>
<br>
SpringChick's Serendipity  (we had to rent a canoe for that one!)<br>
Lucky Charm's Election '04 Series  (nice series which led us to a place<br>
we'd never been in Yankee Springs SP where we picked up out first<br>
hitchhiker, Tag Along Tiger)<br>
Azobox's I Spy  (great story and BEAUTIFUL walk and view)<br>
and  <br>
Bindle Babe's Misplaced Manatee  (Good story, nice big rock, and at a<br>
low key, they don't make 'em like that anymore rest stop).<br>
<br>
Warm regards,  Roller (and Sprite, Sam and Molly)<br>

Sounds like you have had some nice adventures already.  I am <br>
especially thrilled to hear that you did my Serendipity box (will <br>
write you offline about that also).<br>
<br>
Looking forward to hearing more of your adventures as you seek (and <br>
plant?) boxes in the area.<br>

(who is in Muskegon, but in the world of letterboxing, that is just <br>
right next door!)<br>
