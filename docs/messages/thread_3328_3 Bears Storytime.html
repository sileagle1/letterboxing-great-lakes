  Subject: [LbGLK] Letterboxing Addiction<br>
<br>
<br>
  Okay, I realized tonight that I have a small problem. As I was telling <br>
  my 2 year old a night time story (she likes the lights off, so they're <br>
  from memory) of the 3 Bears I made them go out letterboxing while the <br>
  porridge cooled. This is normal, right?<br>
<br>
  Travel'n Turtle... thinking of what the 3 Little Pigs can find tomorrow<br>

Okay Beetle, you asked for it. Feel free to use this yourselves tonight. Works well on sleepy husbands too to get them suggesting LBing the next day.<br>
 <br>
Once upon a time there lived 3 bears in the woods. One day Mama Bear was making them their favorite food for lunch, porridge. Once she ladles it out  into bowls she notices that it's too hot, so she gathers her family and letterboxing gear and they set off into the nearby woods to let the porridge cool. <br>
 <br>
A few minutes after they leave Goldilocks arrives and hoovers baby bears porridge (after going through the litany of chairs and bowls of porridge being to big). Then she sleepily chooses baby bears bed and falls asleep. <br>
 <br>
After finding a few letterboxes (and replacing a few baggies that were torn by wild animals...all very suspicious) they head home to notice the missing porridge. Mama Bear shares hers and Papas with baby and they say grace and chow down. Afterward Mama Bear shares her bed with baby bear.  <br>
 <br>
When they all wake up Mama Bear surmises that the little girl is visiting her grandma on the edge of the woods and brings her back. First she gives the two toddlers a snack and they become buddies. The find another couple letterboxes along the way. Goldie finds an especially well hidden one and gets hooked. Baby bear promises to come back and visit and take her letterboxing the next day.<br>
 <br>
The end.  Everyone lives happily ever after.<br>

Okay, it's been done: there is now a postal LB ring called the Fairy <br>
Tale Characters! I'm of course doing the 3 Bears (The 3 Bears go <br>
letterboxing in the woods while the porridge cools. Read the story, <br>
get the stamp!) <br>
<br>
Sign up and alter a story! When it's complete, we can hide them <br>
around the lakes!<br>
