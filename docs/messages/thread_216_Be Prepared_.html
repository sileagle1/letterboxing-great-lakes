Sounds like you have it pretty well covered!  It was very cold (and rainy)<br>
last year, even though it was May 31st.  But that didn't dampen spirits one<br>
bit -- we had a great time despite the uncooperative weather!  I really<br>
can't think of much besides the things you have mentioned.  A couple people<br>
brought items to show -- for instance Matt the Rat has taken some<br>
bookbinding classes and has done some awesome handbound books.  He brought a<br>
few of these with him and we all ohhhed and ahhhhed and vowed to run out and<br>
sign up for a bookbinding class.  A few people brought stamp carvings they<br>
were especially proud of.<br>
<br>
Although this didn't apply to our gathering last year, I know that at some<br>
of the other gatherings, people have taken the opportunity to distribute<br>
clues to unpublished letterboxes.  Also HH stamps are a common thing to<br>
bring to gatherings.  I am not a big fan of the HH table concept, where a<br>
bunch of HH are just laid out on the table and all of the people at the<br>
gathering just stamp the HH (except in the case of legendary HH like<br>
K-Martha), but since there will be opportunity to do a fair amount of<br>
'boxing and I believe Tim has a HH hostel coming, you may want to have a HH<br>
with you.  Don't have one in your possession right now?  Make a new one and<br>
launch it at the gathering!<br>
<br>
No doubt I have left off something -- anyone else?<br>

Yeah, and did SpringChick mention that it was really, really COLD?<br>
There was a wonderful urban/microbox workshop by Yooperann and <br>
samples of boxes and camouflage techniques were available for <br>
examination. So,if you have special containers, 'cammo', ways of <br>
hiding or attaching microboxes, or other techniques you've been using <br>
successfully, bring them along and share your ideas.<br>
(I'll bring one of my urban 'library' boxes since there have been <br>
some questions about that genre.)<br>
<br>
I'll try to remember if there was other 'stuff' that caught my <br>
attention last year and post more later.<br>
<br>
How about other readers of this list who've attended gatherings <br>
elsewhere -- anything to add?<br>
