I'm glad you posted a more personal note!  I wasn't too sure about <br>
completing the survey before, but having this little bit of background <br>
info helps.  I'll complete it in the near future.<br>
<br>
Will the results of the survey be available to us sometime?<br>

our end of season cross country party tonight, and in the casual talk<br>
some of us discussed letterboxing, and we were debating whether it was<br>
a sport, hobby, obsession, etc.<br>
<br>
And, yes, there seems to now be at least 3 CC Families letterboxing in<br>
WI now!  And one of the many great gifts I got from the team this year<br>
for coaching . . . A CC medal hitchhiker to send on its merry way! <br>
Look for it in a box near you soon!<br>

So, you're just as curious as I am.  I look forward to posting my<br>
results here and other websites.  Keep posted.  So far I have over 120<br>
responses.  I am looking for 500.  Spread the word.  <br>
Thanks <br>
