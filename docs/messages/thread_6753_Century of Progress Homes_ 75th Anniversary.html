                    <div class="plaintext-content">We actually took Mark & Sue and Cardinal over to Beverly Shores for a look at the city of Chicago from Indiana's perspective (and to see the Indiana National Lakeshore) last week.  One of our favorite spots is right where the Century of Progress Homes are being renovated.  It has been interesting over the last 30 plus years to watch as they fell into decay and now the slow transformation back to their original luster.<br>
Part of their private purchase agreement included that they not only be restored as close as possible to their original plan, but they would be open to the public at least once a year.<br>
On our trip we started at the fair's site near the Museum of Science and Industry by nabbing Atomic Beans White City box and driving where the houses originally were installed before being barged across the lake to their current site.  It was a nice tie-in to the plaques outside the houses explaining the trek.<br>
