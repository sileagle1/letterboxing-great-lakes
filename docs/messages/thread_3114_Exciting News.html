                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some time back, months actually - I had asked a location for <br>
permission to plant several Boxes there - a very public location <br>
that I assumed would LIKELY say No, but what the heck.<br>
<br>
Well, I emailed them initially explaining letterboxing and its <br>
attitude towards the preservation of the surroundings, being <br>
discreet, and what its all about. I got a reply about a week later <br>
asking about the boxes, would it be disruptive for people to search <br>
for them, etc...<br>
<br>
I replied, and heard nothing for about a month or so. <br>
<br>
Well... a few days ago, I got an email granting permission for <br>
myself and my husband to go to the location and plant several Boxes <br>
INSIDE for people to seek! We will be working with the zoo on the <br>
boxes and locations, but expect them to be up somewhat soon! <br>
<br>
So... watch for some NEW boxes soon at...<br>
<br>
BROOKFIELD ZOO!!!!!!!!!! They WILL be educational, and animal <br>
related, as per our discussion with our contact, but thats even <br>
better!<br>
<br>
<br>
Their actual words were "Sorry this has taken so long for a <br>
response.  Brookfield Zoo would be happy to be a sight."<br>
<br>
VERY COOL!<br>
<br>
IM VERY EXCITED!!!!! And a BIG thank you to the Zoo - please support <br>
the zoo when you can for supporting our hobby!  <br>

now letterboxes!!  The girls will be so excited!<br>
A friend of ours says "If you don't ask, the answer is always No."  <br>
We're so glad you took the trouble to ask. :)<br>
