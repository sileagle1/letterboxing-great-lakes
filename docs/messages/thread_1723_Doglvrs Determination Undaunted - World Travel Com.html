"Around the World in 80 Days" adventurers; and arm-chair<br>
travelers everywhere.<br>
<br>
From: Travel Documents Division, "80 Days"<br>
Department of Passports<br>
Itinerary Special Section<br>
Certification Office<br>
<br>
The Travel Staff and all associated ancillaries are pleased to<br>
announce that another resourceful traveling troupe has successfully<br>
circled the world, "80 Days" fashion.<br>
<br>
               drumrolltrumpet fanfare<br>
<br>
The determined and relentless Doglvrs have completed the "Around<br>
the World in 80 Days" series and have provided certification of proof<br>
as required. In addition, Doglvrs have completed their journey within<br>
the time constraints required by the original challenge.<br>
<br>
So therefore, let it be known, that Doglvrs will receive not only the<br>
"World Traveler" stamp for completing their journey, but will<br>
receive in addition, the coveted "Around the World in 80 Days"<br>
special bonus stamp. Their names will also be entered into that select<br>
company of those who have also accomplished the same feat.<br>
<br>
Again the "80 Days" staff is left speechless at this accomplishment.<br>
(Yet they do seem to go on and on, don't they?)<br>
<br>
The Travel Staff is receiving regular reports from and about other<br>
world travelers. There have been near-collisions at some foreign<br>
cities, according to reports. And recent dispatches also include<br>
stories of younger travelers receiving Social Studies credit for their<br>
journeys.<br>
The travel office neither endorses nor disputes these claims.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
