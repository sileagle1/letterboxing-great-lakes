Oh don't get me started on the Dutch...they are taking over the <br>
world!...At least my world!  It all started 28 years ago...and as I <br>
recall I was eating pudding!  Yeah! That was it!...Pudding!  When <br>
all of a sudden my own (not so small) Dutch treat popped out!  His <br>
name was Tonto!<br>
I had no idea Dutch people lived outside of the Netherlands!  Oh boy <br>
was I wrong!  Slowly but surely my world has turned into a very <br>
Dutch world...My husband...ALL of my in-laws....my place of <br>
employment...my neighbors...my church...my co-workers... I thought I <br>
could detox by entering into the world of letterboxing...and what to <br>
my wondering eyes did appear....let's see... more Dutchies...(one by <br>
the name of ...Spring Chick!)...and let's see who else?...Fess up <br>
all you other Wooden Shoes out there!  Stop rolling out <br>
your "sticks" or "letters" of Banket, and let the rest of the <br>
letterboxing world know you have indeed infiltrated this world as <br>
well!<br>
Gotta love 'em!  After all the Dutch are the tallest people group in <br>
the world!....And I have to admit, I've become quite fond of <br>
them...but all the talk about Polish restaurants etc. made me <br>
recollect that there aren't "Dutch" restaurants...I guess pot roast <br>
& potatoes just doesn't seem too exciting!<br>
Tiptoe...and Tonto who has no idea I'm writing about him...his head <br>
is in the clouds or maybe he is digging into some pudding....<br>

Every year for Christmas, we explore how a different country celebrates <br>
the holiday.  This year we picked Holland--and it sounds like they must <br>
be letterboxers at heart.  Some of their gifts are wrapped as surprises <br>
and are disguised as much as possible (small gifts hidden in a <br>
vegetable or a pudding perhaps)--not that far from stamps hidden in <br>
camo-taped boxes.  Other gifts are hidden, and the recipient has to <br>

That's too bad about the lack of Dutch restaurants.  Every year, after <br>
learning about that country, we go down to the Museum of Science and <br>
Industry in Chicago and check out the Christmas tree decorated by that <br>
country.  Then we find a restaurant with that ethnicity.  So far, over <br>
the years, we have found Swedish & German & Mexican & Egyptian & <br>
Filipino.  But it sounds like we might strike out looking for a Dutch <br>
restaurant.  <br>

The other night our church went Christmas Caroling and a very sweet old man sang a bit of Silent Night in Dutch to us...to which my pastor replied...IN DUTCH!!!  Wow!

Of course, the food served here isn't described as<br>
Dutch but rather "Amish Kitchen cooking," and I think<br>
I was like, 5 the last time I ate at one of them, so<br>
I'm not sure if it's really comparable to all the<br>
Dutch treats that the list has started talking about.<br>

Wow, Dutch Babbelaars! We used to sell those when I was in grade<br>
school in Grand Rapids, MI many years ago......*many* years ago. They<br>
were a fundraising item that came in paper sacks, as I recall. <br>
I suspect that some others on this list have those same memories. In<br>
fact, I *know* that some others have those same memories! Talk about<br>
the Dutch influence throughout a whole community.<br>
 <br>
And, we also sold small square anise candies at the same time but they<br>
were never as popular as the babbelaars. (Somehow, that's not the<br>
spelling I remember, though.) Hey, Grandvilla, help me out here!<br>

That reminds me of my trip to Europe many, many years ago.  My friend <br>
and I went out to dinner when we were in Amsterdam.  There was an <br>
English menu at the entrance to the restaurant, so we pored over it and <br>
decided we would eat at that restaurant.  Well, when we sat down, the <br>
menu was NOT in English, so I tried to remember what it was I wanted to <br>
order.  I didn't remember very well :(  When I got my meal and bit in, <br>
I discovered it was some sort of stew full of organ meats.  Yuck!  So, <br>
I'm not too sure about eating Indonesian here (but the menu is probably <br>
in English, so that would be a plus).<br>

That all sounds yummy but I am a terrible cook. Maybe I can go back to Holland and get <br>
some of this stuff made for me there.<br>

You know, except, in Holland they eat their fries with mayonaisse. GROSS!!! :-)<br>

I was very disappointed ot not get to practice my Dutch more when I was there!<br>

Though yes some food was verrrry strange. We ordered a pizza at an "Italian" restaurant <br>
while in Maastrict. the restaurant was owned by a man from Italy. We ordered it with <br>
olives. And got a cheese pizza with 3 whole green olives sitting in the center.<br>
<br>
Very odd! But of course that is part of th efun. I had dinner at a restaurant in Amsterdam <br>
and though I did not know what i was eating it was DELICIOUS! Especially the salad. Am I <br>
am super picky!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Apparently the Spanish love Nutella too.  I was served breakfast that<br>
included toasted bread with a thin layer of nutella.  The spread melted<br>
and it was delicious.  I can't say I'd want it regularly, but a treat once<br>
in a while isn't bad.  I think I'd sprinkle some dried cranberries on it<br>
to add some more flavor.<br>
<br>
I cannot bring myself to put mayonnaise on fries.  For me, mayo goes in<br>
egg salad and other COLD dishes, never hot.  The thought of that makes my<br>
stomach flipflop.  Ironically, some Europeans thought putting ketchup on<br>
ANYTHING was odd (daresay, barbaric) some 20 years ago.  I suspect the<br>
invasion of McDonald's and others has changed the perception a little for<br>
the younger generation.  In addition to the mayo sauce for pommes frites,<br>
I think they have varieties, like mayo with curries, mayo with herbs.  I<br>
haven't tried them, but how many Americans eat buffalo wings with ranch<br>
dip?<br>
<br>
My brother studied in Melbourne, Australia and he said they referred to<br>
ketchup as just plain "sauce."<br>
<br>
Our Spanish exchange student could not understand how we could eat<br>
corn-on-the-cob.  From his perspective, corn was used only to feed<br>
livestock.  We did get him to try it.  Never did know if he enjoyed it or<br>
was trying to be a good sport.<br>
<br>
Just my ramblings before the big feast,<br>
