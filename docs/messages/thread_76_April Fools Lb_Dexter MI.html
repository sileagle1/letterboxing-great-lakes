You are right, it would be difficult without the boulder, especially <br/>
since there are other boulders in the park there and using one of <br/>
them would lead you severely astray -- trust me, I speak from <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the clues should be changed to use another landmark -- would <br/>
hate to lose that box as it is our first state box.  Silent Doug <br/>
from PA adopted that box.  He checks in here periodically, but you <br/>
could e-mail him to let him know.<br/>

Thanks for the idea, we had no clue (ha ha ha)that was the first box<br/>
in Michigan, and to think Bill and I have been looking every so often<br/>
for it for about a year. That was the first one we started our quest<br/>
on and our only problem with it was the pace. So, I have mailed silent<br/>
doug and hopefully he'll come up with some other clues for it.<br/>
