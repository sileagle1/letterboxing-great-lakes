are relatively new to Letterboxing and we really appreciate all the <br/>
hard work that people put into these - the clues are great and the <br/>
hunt, well that is almost as much fun as the find.  <br/>

CignaCats - your Retzer notebook is just beautiful! There were only a <br/>
very few entries since we found your box on Mother's Day.<br/>

checked it <br/>
&gt; recently but plan to do so next week since someone reported they <br/>

hope <br/>
&gt; they're both still in place!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I haven't heard anything about the class either, although it <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; &gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; interesting to know what box they plan to find.  One of our boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Waukesha, the Retzer box, has gotten a lot of activity lately, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of it has been from kids (judging by the hand writing) but <br/>
&gt; &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn't mean anything.  Wisconsin Hiker, perhaps your Retzer box <br/>
&gt; &gt; has <br/>
&gt; &gt; gotten a lot of activity too?<br/>
