                    <div class="plaintext-content">My friend, Jacqui, and I made it up to the faire on Saturday. She had <br/>
never been there before, so I was a little worried about how she <br/>
would like it. It seems that when it comes to the faire, people <br/>
either love it or they hate it. Well, she had a great time and even <br/>
did some boxing.<br/>
<br/>
We found a few boxes here and there while we shopped and explored. We <br/>
even got an exchange with Jane the Phoole. She seemed to be hiding <br/>
the rest of the day because that was the only time we saw her while <br/>
we were there, and she isn't hard to miss! <br/>
<br/>
After having lunch out in the car, we noticed that the sky was <br/>
getting a little dark. Eh...let's keep going anyway. So we set out to <br/>
find the feather fans for Jacqui and also to find Howling Coyote. We <br/>
knew she would be there, we even had her picture printed out, so it <br/>
couldn't be that hard to find her. (I did go up to someone I thought <br/>
looked like her and asked if she was HC...and got a very strange <br/>
look) For whatever reason, we kept missing the stage she said she <br/>
could be found at, but finally walked by it and heard the sweet <br/>
music. Guess who was sitting in the front row? Finally! Well, we sat <br/>
there and listened to the music. When it was over we saw her and her <br/>
husband walk over. I yelled her name and actually had the right <br/>
person this time.<br/>
<br/>
So with the help of Howling Coyote, we found the last three boxes we <br/>
were looking for in the Shoppes series just as the start of a storm <br/>
was rolling in. Wouldn't you know it...as Jacqui and I were stamping <br/>
into that last box...the tornado siren went off!!! Life at Bristol <br/>
stopped at that moment. Everyone seemed to stop in their place and <br/>
just stare at the others around them. Nobody knew what to do. I <br/>
replaced the box as HC went to find out what was happening. It ended <br/>
up that it was actually a thunderstorm warning. The tornado warning <br/>
had been lifted shortly before the sirens went off. We took shelter <br/>
in Laughing Coyote's shop for a while because the storm got bad <br/>
fairly quick...heavy downpours, lightning and such. Jacqui and I <br/>
stayed in the shop for a while until the rain died down enough to <br/>
make a mad dash for the car. We were still soaked, but we made it <br/>
without getting hit by the lightning striking over our heads.<br/>
<br/>
So at the end of the day we had two exchanges and found all of the <br/>
Shoppes boxes. Well, one we couldn't get because of the storm and all <br/>
the people crowded around it. But we saw it, so we know it is in good <br/>
shape and know where to find it when/if we go back again. :)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to those who will search later in the season. The stamps, <br/>
and not to mention the faire in general, are great, so you won't <br/>
regret going.<br/>
