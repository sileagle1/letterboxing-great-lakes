                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, like some others in this regional group, we know we're a bit <br/>
obsessed.  Why else would people voluntarily go out in this heat &amp; <br/>
humidity?!?!<br/>
<br/>
First, here are the low points of the weekend:  HEAT, LOTS OF <br/>
HEAT, "SWEAT DRIPPING FROM US MAKING IT TRICKY TO STAMP OUR LOGBOOKS <br/>
WITHOUT DESTROYING THE IMAGES" HEAT!<br/>
<br/>
Annoying flies &amp; mosquitoes.  However they were no match for the PAIN <br/>
we experienced when stung by some type of ground wasps as we were <br/>
following Ebenezer's instructions in Blue Mounds, WI. Martini Man was <br/>
walking ahead of me when all of a sudden he started hopping around <br/>
yelling and swatting at his legs.  At first I thought it was stinging <br/>
nettles (which we always seem to encounter), but he was even more <br/>
excited than usual.  He told me he had been stung and I should be <br/>
careful.  I then saw a swarm of bees a foot above the trail, so I <br/>
carefully took a detour around the area.  We stopped a short while <br/>
later so MM could examine his wounds (He had been stung on each calf, <br/>
almost symetrically) and I could check the clues. I actually SCREAMED <br/>
when I was stung on the tip of my middle finger by some of the same <br/>
wasps!  We did manage to find the box after all of this agony, but I <br/>
couldn't open it with my injured hand - MM had to take care of that.  <br/>
This all happened before 2 pm.  After a party at our friends in <br/>
Janesville and returning to our hotel room, we both were STILL in <br/>
pain at 11 pm that night.  Luckily by the next morning we were <br/>
feeling OK.<br/>
<br/>
OK, now for the HIGH points!  We found 8 boxes in south-central WI on <br/>
Saturday (3 FF and 2 Hitchhikers).  While at the Rest Stop box we saw <br/>
a teeny hummingbird.  At first I thought it was a bee going from <br/>
flower to flower, but it looked odd.  Upon closer observation I <br/>
realized it was a hummingbird - maybe a baby hummingbird? We also had <br/>
a nice lunch at the Grompy Troll in Mount Horeb.  If anyone is boxing <br/>
out that way, we'd highly recommend this brew pub for lunch or dinner!<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday we boxed in North Central IL, finding several River Rat, <br/>
Hiker Babe and Nature Nerd boxes. While biking on the Jane Addams <br/>
trail, a bird once again caught my attention.  This time I yelled as <br/>
we were passing between some scenic rock walls and a LARGE turkey, <br/>
who was startled by us, flew directly over me from one side of the <br/>
wall to the other!  I don't know who was more startled, the turkey or <br/>
me!<br/>
<br/>
We also stopped in to see Raqs at her rummage sale, and managed to be <br/>
in time to say Hi! to Acorn &amp; Golden Boy as they were leaving.  Raqs <br/>
had done a great job hiding the Rummage Sale logbook and stamp, so we <br/>
had a challenge to get stamped into this one!  We went on to find a <br/>
few others in the Rockford area before heading south to search for <br/>
some P. Granola boxes.  We did well at Shabbona State Park, finding <br/>
all 7 new boxes (even though we were using flashlights for the last <br/>
two....).  Our tally for Sunday was 20 boxes, 1 miscellaneous stamp <br/>
(the Rummage Sale stamp), and 1 hitchhiker.  We reached a personal <br/>
milestone on the very creative "Creatures Along the Trail" series, in <br/>
that we logged our 1,500th box!  This was about 2 weeks after our 3rd <br/>
anniversary of finding our very first box (on July 13, 2003).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks SO MUCH to all of you that hide boxes for us to find, <br/>
especially Dragon, who did a lot to get the Milwaukee area seeded <br/>
with boxes.  Our counts as of today are:  1504 boxes found, 70 <br/>
plants, 268 exchanges, attended 7 events, found 72 hitchhikers, and <br/>
also stamped 94 "miscellaneous" images (personal travelers, traveling <br/>
event stamps, boxes we hid for others, etc).<br/>
<br/>
After 3 years we are still enjoying this hobby immensely and are <br/>
looking forward to meeting more of you at events and enjoying the <br/>
adventures of looking for the boxes you place.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations! on your 1,500th find Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man.  You're not <br/>
obsessed, just focused 8-).  We really appreciate the boxing report, but you didn't have to <br/>
stay up until one in the morning after a hot day on the trail. Hope the wasp stings heal <br/>
quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I know few boxers who move with the speed and organization of Wisconsin Hiker and <br/>
Martini Man, but they always have time to chat (the only boxers we've met on the trail <br/>
more than once) and enjoy their surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Dragon.  Congratulations on your milestone, too.  I am also grateful for your seeding <br/>
the Milwaukee area, particularly when we had only a few here in Northern Illinois.  You <br/>
gave me the courage to make a clumsy carving (for the Cambridge Parkway series), so I <br/>
could go on to make better ones.<br/>
<br/>
Acorn, <br/>
who started in August 2003, has only a third of WH and MM's F-count, and who really <br/>
values the wonderful people she's met since taking up this solitary obsession.<br/>

baby hummingbird, you might have been seeing a "Hummingbird Moth" (Hemaris <br/>
thyshe). They look like little hummingbirds, but just a little different. We see <br/>
them all the time during the summer and early fall at work. Book says they <br/>
inhabit forest edges, meadows and cultivated flower gardens and produce a buzz with <br/>
their wings that is similar to but softer than a hummingbird. They're cute.<br/>

For the wasp stings -- my parents live in Florida and are big golfers.<br/>
 They have fire ants and bees (and probably wasps and other stinging<br/>
insects).  They carry a benedryl spray bottle in their golf cart so<br/>
they can immediately put it on all stings.  I was stung a couple of<br/>
years ago down there, and about 10 seconds after my dad sprayed the<br/>
benedryl on the sting, it stopped swelling and stopped hurting, so I<br/>
can vouch for the fact that it works, surely for bee stings.  My<br/>
parents have used it with the same results on fire ant stings.  So,<br/>
that might be something to add to the letterboxing pack.<br/>
