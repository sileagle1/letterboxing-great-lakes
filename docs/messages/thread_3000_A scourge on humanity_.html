                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree!  You should try getting them out from between the pads of a dog's <br>
paws!<br>
<br>
A friend's dog got them in his feet and was so traumatized that he had to be <br>
muzzled and pinned down to get them removed (his feet were covered with them <br>
and then he got some in his mouth trying to remove them from his own feet.) <br>
We had to get the ones out of his mouth first and that's when he was sure we <br>
had lost our minds and were trying to kill him.<br>
<br>
Thankfully I moved quick enough not to be bitten before all of the ones in <br>
his mouth were out.  And thankfully we had our first aid kit in a backpack <br>
and that included an emergency muzzle and pliers.   It pays to be prepared! <br>
I'm sure someone would have been seriously bitten if we hadn't had the <br>
proper supplies.  No way to carry a 120 lb dog over a mile out of the woods <br>
(or safely remove burrs from the mouth of a dog in that condition without <br>
tools.  As it was, we needed the bandages that were in the kit too because <br>
some had gone deep enough to cause bleeding.  It was also a blessing that no <br>
one else was around because anyone coming up on us would have thought for <br>
sure we were torturing this dog and killing him slowly.<br>

Boxers tend to be dramatic. I SHOULD say FEMALE boxers - males are <br>
more, "Whatever" while the girls are SERIOUS Drama Queens! <br>
<br>
I had one who would SCREAM whenever you touched a single toe with the <br>
nail grinder! (NEVER was she ever hurt during a nail trim, but you <br>
would have thought we were boiling her.)<br>
And, this was when you would even touch the HANDLE of the trimmer to <br>
her paw.<br>
<br>
Maybe boys are the ones to take along - although my youngest girl is <br>
one tough cookie!<br>

Be careful what you wish extinct, stinging nettles are a fantastic <br>
herbal precautionary for prostate health, much more effective than saw <br>
palmetto. Don't know what the little green monsters are good for, but <br>
they must have a reason for being here.<br>

LOL Jeff, I would sympathize, but I dont have a prostate. <br>
<br>
(Kidding.. Well, I mean, I DONT have one, but I understand the value. <br>
Of the plants that is... not that prostates aren't nifty things!? I'll <br>
stop here before I dig myself any deeper.)<br>
<br>
Those little green monsters are here to annoy - I was hoping that if I <br>
didnt pick ALL of them out of my shoelaces the next day - they may <br>
help them stay tied a little better. No luck. Sticks to everything BUT <br>
shoelaces, so Im guessing that they ARE here actually for the purpose <br>
of annoying hikers and dogs. <br>
<br>
Oh well..  I tried to give them SOME value. Didn't work.<br>
