Second, I'd like to add support to CBs idea of the + (as I must)...it <br/>
would be a nice addition, since it would make every space on the board <br/>
part of some additional game (perimeter spaces are covered, X covers <br/>
more than half of the middle, then the + would cover the remaining <br/>
middle spaces).<br/>
<br/>
Third, I'm a LONG way from UNO or DUO or BINGO...so I'm curious who else <br/>
is having a rough bingo year....4 spaces on my card (No perimeter, X, OR <br/>
4 corners!)...how about the rest of you?<br/>

THANKS Spring Chick for running this game again, it is really so much fun even though I know I haven't a chance this year.  Like any good Cub fan, my motto is "Wait til next year!"  <br/>

Even though I am in the DUO club, I do not have X or 4 corners or <br/>
perimeter.  My 2 remaining words (which some of the UNO folks are <br/>
eagerly awaiting) are parked in the upper 2 corners.  I too hope <br/>
for "next year", but hope I won't be waiting a century like the Cubs <br/>
have!  :~)  <br/>

My DUO doesn't have a chance ... since just calling one of them will bring the other two winners to the forefront.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, like the idea of the + ... a great addition to the game.<br/>

Thanks, SC, for another year of fun!! Now that the sun is finally out (though not all the water gone), we can get out on the trails!<br/>
