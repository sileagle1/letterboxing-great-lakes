After all the rainy weather we endured last weekend while <br/>
placing boxes for our new "The Hauntings" series, I decided <br/>
to take advantage of today being a beautiful, brisk day and <br/>
went out to find some letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
On the way down to the first park, I was gifted with being <br/>
able to observe a mature Bald Eagle soaring above the <br/>
freeway for at least five minutes.  He had an amazingly large <br/>
wingspan and had fully developed his white head feathers. <br/>
<br/>
Great way to start the day   and it only got better. <br/>
I found all of the boxes (placed by DogLvrs  wow, some great<br/>
clues and stamps!) that I had planned on getting today, plus <br/>
a HH and a bonus box; which took me to a wonderful little <br/>
restaurant with unbelievable hand painted murals on all the walls.<br/>
<br/>
The over-all theme is Hiking the Appalachia Trail. If you should find<br/>
the box that contains the clue to this bonus box and then go to<br/>
retrieve it, please take the time to closely examine the animal life<br/>
in the mural.  The birds are so life-like, you almost expect them to<br/>
begin singing!<br/>
<br/>
Then, at the end of the day, as I was adding the new images<br/>
from today's boxes to my logbook, I discovered that I had <br/>
reached F100  I knew I was getting close, but had not realized<br/>
that today would actually put me there. I hope to have my "P" number<br/>
up to 100 before we move back aboard our boat this spring.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
