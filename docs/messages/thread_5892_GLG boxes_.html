The box that I contributed to the LbGLK Gathering in Door Co. was never returned.  Has anyone else had that same experience?  What happened?<br>

<br>
I know this is kind of late notice, but I found this letterbox (created for the WI-10 gathering last year) amongst my collection of stuff here at home and decided to bring it along to the GLG.  However instead of pajama pants, to receive this stamp, please bring a box of cold drink mix packets for bottled water (such as Propel, Gatorade and Crystal Lite To Go), as requested on the Operation Support Our Troops - Illinois website.  Please do not bring any out-of-date or soon-to-be-expiring products.<br>
<br>
I AM NOT COLLECTING PAJAMA PANTS OR SUNDAY COMICS, SO DISREGARD THAT PART OF THE MESSAGE IN THE AQ CLUES.  <br>
<br>
Letters to the troops are still welcome.<br>
<br>
See http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=91695 for more information.<br>

The pile o' boxes were organized for redistribution during Easter break, then "school" took over again.<br>

Thanks for the update.  Yes, life begins when school is out.   And letterboxing starts.<br>
<br>
And I think I over did it this weekend.   Those long hikes are a challenge after sitting indoors all winter.  I'll wait and keep a watchful eye on the mailbox.  <br>

It is called "school" - that's what happened.<br>
So called "school" is over this week. <br>
"Life" begins soon after.<br>
"Life" includes "letterboxing" and "catching up on emails".<br>
