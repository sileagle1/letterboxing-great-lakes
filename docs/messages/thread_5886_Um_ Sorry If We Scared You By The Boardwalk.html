He was on his way to return the log book with some bonus box clues on it to it's spot when he saw a lone female rummaging under the boardwalk where the box was hid - he called "Ma'am" - and she promptly ran away.  Sorry if that was one of you all.<br/>
<br/>
When he was telling us later, DS and niece suggested he call out to her, "Which way is North?"  I'm so proud of them! :)<br/>
