We had a great time meeting LOADS of Ohio boxers...and we finally got to <br>

emails.  We had loads of fun doing exchanges at the campsites, sock hop <br>
(Thanks to Rosmarinus!) , and main gathering.  There was just so much to do!<br>

Bars...definitely worth the 800 mile roundtrip.  But of course, there <br>
would have been no gathering for him to bring them to without the <br>
hard work of our wonderful hosts, Mn8X and Eagle Eyes.  Great job!  <br>
Thank you so much for all you put into it.  Beautiful choice of <br>
locale, too.  We had a great time...yes, even Michelle/Papillon <br>
didn't complain too much about being tricked into attending.  (Those <br>
of you who didn't hear the whole story...she is currently grounded <br>
until July 1st, but I granted her three days off her sentence for <br>
good behavior this weekend....)<br>
