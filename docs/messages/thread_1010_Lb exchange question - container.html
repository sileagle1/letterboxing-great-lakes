You have some valid points, but in an exchange I participated in about a <br/>
year ago we did it that way -- for pretty much the same reasons -- to save <br/>
on postage. People sent just stamps and log books and the recipients were <br/>
responsible for putting it in a container and planting it. It seemed like <br/>
that held some people up with getting the box planted -- having to get a <br/>
container that the parts would fit in. Seems like when the box is sent all <br/>
complete and ready to go, the process flows smoother. So in answer to your <br/>
