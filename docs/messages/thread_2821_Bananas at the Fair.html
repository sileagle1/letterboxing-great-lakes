  Why yes, this is Jigsaw's Jezebel! You can usually find her near the <br/>
  dockside of the new ship or wandering about with Foster (her smiling <br/>
  banana). She's listened to me talk about letterboxing and I helped her <br/>
  carve her stamp last year when the Wenches were discussing using stamp <br/>
  images for a scavenger-type hunt we were planning last season. Once <br/>
  you find her, you'll never forget her!<br/>
