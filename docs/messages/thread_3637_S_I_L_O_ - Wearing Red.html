OK, so maybe this method works for determining the age of a tree and it isn't the best method for determining the age of a human.  But with that thought, maybe people will voluntarily just tell us their age.  Or, they may not want to reveal their true age because they feel so young a heart.  I certainly don't feel my age...and I'm not telling.  You'll have to catch me and cut my head off.<br/>

  &gt; Yes, we should wear red. The point my coworker made was that the <br/>

  Yes, but then we are back to my question: Who will claim to be the <br/>
  oldest? Martini Man is sure hoping it isn't him, since he doesn't <br/>
  have any red pants to wear! Now that would be a sight....<br/>

It's funny that you mentioned several things that will be stamps at <br/>
the Great Lakes Gathering in June!  According to the database of <br/>
stamps people have volunteered to carve, they include Jonas Salk, <br/>
Disney, and James Dean...<br/>
