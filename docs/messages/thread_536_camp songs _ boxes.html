this...she's been through that a couple of times with councils merging and<br/>
camps being sold.  We are just praying now that our little council survives<br/>
in this day and age of finacial woes.<br/>
<br/>
I always tell my girls when I die I want to be cremated and my ashes<br/>
sprinkled over a campfire at River Trails, and they can all sit and make<br/>
s'mores over me...really grosses them out!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have many fave songs...Hynaserarius, Life of a Voyageur, Flicker, of<br/>
course the Buzzards....  And what do you mean, Deedle by "_USED_ to sing"???<br/>
<br/>
I dedicated one of my camp boxes to a latrine...how's that for sick??<br/>

&gt; Hey! Another Boxing Girl Scout! What council are<br/>
&gt; you...where's your camp?<br/>
As a military brat, I belonged to several councils<br/>
over the years including Commonweath Virginia, SE<br/>
Louisiana, and most recently Tribal Trails (central<br/>
IN) council as an adult. I have not kept my membership<br/>
up because of my own personal war with Tribal Trails,<br/>
WHO SOLD OUR CAMP. Thankfully, our camp, Kokiwanee,<br/>
was bought by a land trust, who has made into a<br/>
wonderful nature preserve. The council didn't give a<br/>
rip about what current and former scouts wanted, as<br/>
the overwhelming majority wanted the camp to stay<br/>
open. Politics. Ug. I've been considering becoming a<br/>
leader in the Singing Sands council, where I live<br/>
now...when and if my job becomes less demanding.<br/>
Anyway, I dedicated a series to Kokiwanee and named<br/>
each stamp after a former unit. I also made a<br/>
hitchhiker called "the Princess Pat" after my all-time<br/>
favorite camp song. What's everyone's favorite camp<br/>
song?<br/>
