23rd. If you missed out once, you wont want to miss it again (Dragon). <br>
We will be having a mini meet in the 23rd at the Honey Tree, contact <br>
me if you want to go. Lets say about 10:30 ish. I have not been back <br>
to check on the boxes because it has been raining sooo much, and I <br>
have had to paint my old house so I could put it up for sale. There <br>
will be no prizes and the maps and scrolls will be given out at the <br>
meet site. Sorry but once was enough (too much walking)! If you all <br>
who carved for this event don't mind there are still some people who <br>
would like to visit these boxes, so I would like to keep them a while <br>
longer. I should have them back to you mid Oct. if that's ok? Rabbits <br>
and if you could bring your original map and scroll that would be <br>
great! Any questions email me. Oh you might want to bring a large back <br>
pack with you, because you will be picking up the boxes as you find <br>
them. I plan to make an 8 box series out of this using stamps that <br>
people don't want back.<br>
