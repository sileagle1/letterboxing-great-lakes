<br/>
I think of pigment ink as paint.  It does take longer to dry, it's thicker so it does fill in fine detail on the stamp, it has a longer "smudge time," if you close the logbook before it's dry, it transfers to other pages and if it's on a stamp sealed in a baggie, it might not dry at all.  If you use pigment ink on other people's stamps, I think it's courteous to also carry wet paper towels so you can clean the stamp off. Otherwise, if the next person uses a dye based pad, the pigment ink gets transferred to their dye based ink pad and then to other stamps put on that pad- yuk.  But carrying supplies to clean the stamps is good no matter what ink you use.  Just don't carry anything more than plain water on a paper towel kept in a baggie.  Anything with a scent (like baby wipes) can attract critters. Anything harsh, like acetone, can damage the rubber over time (especially if it's not completely dry when placed back in the baggie.) <br/>

As for putting ATC's in the log book, that would work OK till you get to this area where 90% of the boxes are micro boxes.  Pill bottles, film canisters, etc.  An ATC wouldn't fit.  Also won't fit in the log of some hitch hikers.  Just something to consider.<br/>

  Has anyone ever considered not stamping into a letterbox's logbook itself?<br/>
  I was thinking of making some ATCs which would include my stamped image of<br/>
  my sig stamp and putting one in the logbook when I find a box. That way I<br/>
  could make my own backgrounds, do some embellishing, etc, plus laminate the<br/>
  ATC at home before I set out, and just tack it into the logbook.<br/>
  Obviously, this isn't something that's going to interest anyone who likes to<br/>
  find a ton of boxes in a day and anyone who isn't an artist. Altho it's<br/>
  easy to make a lot of ATCs at once as far as background goes -- designing<br/>
  and making one large background sheet and then cutting it up. But Ancient<br/>
  took my idea and made a bunch of ATCs using her sig stamp with some<br/>
  background papers Ancient had made last summer but hadn't found a use for<br/>
  yet, and they look terrific. But to stand up to the elements in a logbook,<br/>
  the ATCs would have to be laminated. Or possibly use acetate with an acohol<br/>
  ink background but then something like Stazon would have to be used for the<br/>
  sig stamp which I wouldn't want to do to my sig stamp.<br/>
  . <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too have come across stamps swimming in pigment ink inside their baggies, often having been like that for several weeks or even months.  It is nasty to have to put your hand into that goo to use the stamp.  I've also had more than one image unintentionally smear in my logbook after stamping with pigments, even with a blotter paper.  For letterboxing I much prefer dye-based inks because they are less messy and dry faster.  There are both permanent and non-permanent varieties, so if you choose a waterproof/permanent dye ink (i.e. Ranger, Memories, Ancient Page), you don't have to worry that your stamp will be washed away in a wet logbook.<br/>
<br/>
I also like the solvent-based inks like Stazon as they tend to give a more vivid color than many of the dye inks without the mess of pigments because the solvent aids in quick drying -- although this also tends to dry out the ink pads quicker than other inks.  I've not had a problem with solvent inks harming hand-carved stamps.  We've been using Stazon black on OldShoe's stamp for nearly 5 years now (same stamp, carved from MasterCarve) and there is no indication of the stamp getting worn down or being otherwise compromised.<br/>
<br/>
Pigment inks are wonderful for artwork and I love the vivid colors and brilliant effects, etc. but for letterboxing, they aren't my favorites.<br/>
