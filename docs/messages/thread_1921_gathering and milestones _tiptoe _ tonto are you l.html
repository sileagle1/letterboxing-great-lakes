<br/>
We were busy winterizing for my mother-in-law up North and when The<br/>
Foot demanded my attention, I went indoors and put on an icepack while<br/>
I took my old (filled up) logbook apart and sort of scrapbooked the<br/>
entries.<br/>
<br/>
I discovered that I reached X100 at the 2005 GLK in Hudson Mills Metro<br/>
Park! Yeah .. now I'm at 100 (at least) on all 3 milestones (PFX)!!<br/>
<br/>
Our CT visiting dignitaries Mark and Sue Peppe were close at x99 but<br/>
Tiptoe and Tonto are the lucky ones to be my exact X100.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped counting my P and F numbers after they reached 100 so I<br/>
guess I'll stop with the X now, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who helped me reach this milestone (as well as the<br/>
others)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

about every letterboxer in the GLK area!  Mark and Sue must be very <br/>
jealous about now!  I hope that the prize isn't to be tied to one of <br/>
your dry boxes and strung up on some sunken ship off the coast of <br/>
Michigan!...We send a BIG congratulations!<br/>
