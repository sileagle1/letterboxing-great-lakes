Well after months of procrastination, we have FINALLY carved our first <br/>
stamp.  It's a simple one but it came out pretty darn good for a first <br/>
try.  Hopefully within the next few weeks, we can find it an <br/>
appropriate hiding place and get our first plant out there.  I was <br/>
wondering if someone could tell me where to find some camo-tape for our <br/>
box.  I looked at Walmart and Meijer but they don't seem to carry it.  <br/>
<br/>
Another first this weekend was finding our first geocache.  I got a <br/>
handheld GPS for Xmas and have been dying to try it out.  We were <br/>
successful in our find but . . . I still enjoy letterboxing more :)<br/>
<br/>
I will definitely post here once our first plant is ready. Can't wait <br/>
to get one out there!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yay!  First stamps are always exciting.  As for the camo-tape, Walmart only carries it in the fall when they have their bow-hunting stuff out.  I believe Meijer should have it though...you might have to hunt for it.  I got my last roll of tape from Dick's sporting goods store, although I'ld rather not buy from there if I can avoid it (didn't know that our local Meijer has it in stock year-round).<br/>
