by the amount of effort and miles that have been driven (in both<br>
states) since this little competition began.<br>
<br>
Great job, everyone! As has been said, more boxes for everyone to<br>
find... and that's a very good thing.<br>
<br>
I'd really like to thank WI Hiker who has been keeping track of<br>
counties covered and kindly posting the updates to the list for some<br>
time now, it was her posts that inspired me to put this little contest<br>
together.<br>
<br>
I've got the points and prize drawing slips all made up for those who<br>
placed boxes ... anyone can still place boxes in MI until Thanksgiving<br>
and get a point for each box.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
