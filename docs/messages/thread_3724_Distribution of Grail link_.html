<br>
If it doesn't, here's some basic info on the project (taken from the <br>
website):<br>
<br>
The Holy Grail Series<br>
Created by the letterboxers of the Great Lakes Region<br>
<br>
Sometimes it is amazing what a simple comment on a message board can <br>
accomplish!  What started as a quick witticism to the GL group grew <br>
into this gigantic series which took about a year to create.  With the <br>
aid of some 20 letterboxers from the Great Lakes and beyond, we offer <br>
this series of letterboxes centered around one of our favorite movies <br>
for your enjoyment!<br>
<br>
Being a GL group project, all of the letterboxes in this series are <br>
scattered around the Great Lakes region.  It is your quest to find <br>
each of the 40 letterboxes and the series hitchhiker and collect not <br>
only the stamp images, but also the encrypted clues they contain.  <br>
Once you have collected all the clues, you can put them in order to <br>
decipher the clues to the location of the Holy Grail box.  Since <br>
accomplishing this task will be a huge undertaking, there will be <br>
prizes for the first three individuals that complete the series in its <br>
entirety.<br>
<br>
For the sake of those questing, please do NOT distribute secret <br>
information about the series (via WOM, email, etc.).  Do note that the <br>
location of the series hitchhiker should be regularly reported, and <br>
that the hitchhiker MUST be placed only in HG series boxes (excluding <br>
the Grail box of course). <br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps!<br>

Both of your emails helped a tremendous amount! The link worked and  I <br>
see the light!  Wow.  No wonder this took so long?!  This was quite a <br>
project.  Very impressive.  The talent in this Great Lakes Region is <br>
amazing.  Thank you for helping me understand.  :)<br>
