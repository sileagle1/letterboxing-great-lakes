If it doesn't, here's some basic info on the project (taken from the <br/>
website):<br/>
<br/>
The Holy Grail Series<br/>
Created by the letterboxers of the Great Lakes Region<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is amazing what a simple comment on a message board can <br/>
accomplish!  What started as a quick witticism to the GL group grew <br/>
into this gigantic series which took about a year to create.  With the <br/>
aid of some 20 letterboxers from the Great Lakes and beyond, we offer <br/>
this series of letterboxes centered around one of our favorite movies <br/>
for your enjoyment!<br/>
<br/>
Being a GL group project, all of the letterboxes in this series are <br/>
scattered around the Great Lakes region.  It is your quest to find <br/>
each of the 40 letterboxes and the series hitchhiker and collect not <br/>
only the stamp images, but also the encrypted clues they contain.  <br/>
Once you have collected all the clues, you can put them in order to <br/>
decipher the clues to the location of the Holy Grail box.  Since <br/>
accomplishing this task will be a huge undertaking, there will be <br/>
prizes for the first three individuals that complete the series in its <br/>
entirety.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of those questing, please do NOT distribute secret <br/>
information about the series (via WOM, email, etc.).  Do note that the <br/>
location of the series hitchhiker should be regularly reported, and <br/>
that the hitchhiker MUST be placed only in HG series boxes (excluding <br/>
the Grail box of course). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

Both of your emails helped a tremendous amount! The link worked and  I <br/>
see the light!  Wow.  No wonder this took so long?!  This was quite a <br/>
project.  Very impressive.  The talent in this Great Lakes Region is <br/>
amazing.  Thank you for helping me understand.  :)<br/>
