Mr. Doglvrs is not nearly as addicted to letterboxing as I am - and <br>
certainly not as talkative.  He generally comes along as long as the kids <br>

It sounds like she likes letterboxing.  Perhaps she is uneasy about meeting<br>
"a group of strangers"?  If so, I can guarantee that you will be welcomed<br>
like long lost friends when you show up.  Last year we attended the huge<br>
Monster Mash event in Connecticut and didn't know a soul there when we<br>
arrived.  We just hung out the whole day at the event, chatting with lots of<br>
boxers, meeting their babies and dogs.  We really enjoyed it!  This year we<br>
traveled to Pennsylvania for 10 days and Oregon for 9 days.  On both trips<br>
we blindly met "strangers" that we only knew through email and postings on<br>
letterboxing boards.  We shared some great hikes and nice meals with these<br>
people and now consider them friends.  Our experience has been that the<br>
letterboxing community is like a big extended family, very welcoming to<br>
fellow addicts!<br>
<br>
However if your wife still doesn't want to come to the gathering, I agree<br>
with those that suggested coming alone.  In our travels, and even here<br>
locally, we have met many other people whose "significant other" just isn't<br>
as obsessed as they are.  In other regions these "singles in letterboxing"<br>
seem to search each other out to share hunting expeditions, then happily<br>
return to their significant others to resume the rest of their "normal" life<br>
activities.  We're currently encouraging a lot of single women to<br>
start/continue boxing and have planned a few joint excursions with them.<br>
We're hoping that this area will develop a sense of camaraderie that will<br>
allow the "single" boxers to communicate with each other on-line to plan<br>
impromptu excursions to hunt boxes together.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you on OCT 1!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I 100% concur with what SpringChick says (except in my case his eye rolling<br>
would NOT be inconspicuous!).  My husband had no interest at all - and to<br>
drag him unwillingly to an event is just asking for a miserable day for both<br>
of us.  The idea of "I'll go to [fill in the blank] with you if you go<br>
boxing with me" can backfire.  I know I'd be perfectly miserable going to an<br>
all-day car show or fishing trip with him, and would roll my eyes just as<br>
much as he would over boxing.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
That being said, I am still trying to talk him into going to the gathering<br>
with me!!  (-:  But on the pretext that there is fishing nearby, and he<br>
doesn't have to stay the whole time with me.  (I just want him to see what a<br>
nice group of people you all are!  And besides, the old adage "the way to a<br>
man's heart is through his stomach" definitely applies to Mr. FungusWoman,<br>
so the potluck lunch is a plus.)<br>

I have a partner who is not always quite as enthusiastic about LB as I am<br>
also.  Sometimes he is eager to go, sometimes not.  Same with gatherings.<br>
My feeling...  if he doesn't want to go to the gathering, I don't beg.<br>
There are bound to be lots of people there I will enjoy meeting and hanging<br>
out with and I would rather go alone than with an unenthusiastic companion<br>
who is inconspicously rolling his eyes as we tell trail stories and recount<br>
moments of letterboxing enlightenment, and counting the minutes until we can<br>
leave.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If she doesn't want to come with you, just come alone.  We will be nice to<br>
you and perhaps the decision for you to go independently and the respect you<br>
give her by not forcing the issue will make her see how important this is to<br>
you and encourage participation in the future. <br>

I'm in the same boat!  I would love to attend gatherings and not have to<br>
<br>
beg my dh to come along.  I am independent, but he doesn't like the idea<br>
<br>
of me travelling alone.  And it doesn't help that Oct. 1 is his birthday<br>
<br>
and he will be in class ALL day long.  Any ideas?<br>

<br>
To get back to the original topic...everyone else has offered some good advice.  Just remember that if he's still reluctant it probably won't pay to push the issue.  If I had begged my husband to come with me on all of my letterboxing excursions he probably never would have gotten into letterboxing.  And if he doesn't mind you going alone even though it's his birthday...we just happen to be in Indianapolis the day before the gathering.<br>
