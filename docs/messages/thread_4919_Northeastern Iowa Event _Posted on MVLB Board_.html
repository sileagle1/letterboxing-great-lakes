Event, held in Decorah, IA on May 3, 2008!!! We are so excited and<br>
look forward to a great event with lots of neat stamps to be planted<br>
in an area that has yet to see letterboxes!<br>
<br>
All are invited and encouraged to attend! Please see the event link<br>

<br>
And, if the raffle prizes aren't enough to tempt you... I have it on<br>
good authority that there will be a special appearance by a bagpiper! ;-)<br>
<br>
A wonderful day in the beautiful Oneota River valley meeting fabulous<br>
people and finding terrific artwork in a fun and casual atmosphere.<br>
What could be better?!<br>

For the potluck, put us down for Chocolate Revel Bars (since the Atomic Beans will be too busy to attend) and some Wisconsin cheese.<br>
