please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Merlin has been having a problem, and I might have the reason why, <br/>
and I thought I'd share it with the group to give some a chuckle, <br/>
and others the reason why the pages might not be coming up...<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so here's the story.  In creating the clue pages for the Grail <br/>
site, I made a generic page for the clue pages and called it "XXX".  <br/>
Then, as I created each clue page, I saved it with a title fitting <br/>
the particular box, but Frontpage doesn't automatically change the <br/>
title of the "window" that pops up for that page to the name of the <br/>
file.  So, all of the clue pages currently come up named "XXX".  <br/>
So... if you have anything on your computer that blocks, um, X-rated <br/>
material, um, you're not privy to view the Grail clues it would <br/>
seem...<br/>
<br/>
I'll fix the problem in the next upload of the website, hopefully <br/>
this weekend.  In the meantime, I do have all the clues in a Word <br/>
document if anyone would like them sent to them.  I promise - no X-<br/>
rated material, unless you're the tick inspector and you show up at <br/>
my door (boy, was that embarrassing....)!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

Tick Inspector just sounds like too good of a story for me to miss. <br/>
Can anyone save me from having to paw through the archives and let me<br/>
in on the details of this story.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, Dragon ... not trying to dredge up embarrassing memories but<br/>
you have to admit that line ~has~ "ask me" potential, don't you?<br/>
(grin) Especially if you have a personality like mine. LOL<br/>

Sail on!<br/>
