I don't want to make any hard feelings, but I don't care for the top <br/>
two themes and some of the rules for playing in the offical box <br/>
exchange so I made up a database and will host an alternate exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who wants to play can sign up in the database by clicking on <br/>
the left hand side menu. Then when you reach the database, click on <br/>
add record.<br/>
<br/>
Sign up available until Monday morning only. Then I will assign you <br/>
a trading partner and add their name to the database under your name.<br/>
<br/>
You will be responsible for using edit record to add the dates you <br/>
do your mailing, planting, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There is no specific theme for this exchange, you choose your own. <br/>
You can make it a regular boxe, virtual, or postal. Hand carving a <br/>
stamp is a option but store bought are also allowed and they can be <br/>
placed anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
When you accept a box you agree to plant it, post the clues, and do <br/>
the maintance on it.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing. When you exchange with your trading partner, you <br/>
must include a print of your personal stamp for the partner to <br/>
include in their own logbook.<br/>

Another exchange? Hooray! <br/>
<br/>
(We can play in both without engendering hard feelings, right? The more boxes the <br/>
merrier...)<br/>
