                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I suppose you could say that the absolute worst thing that<br>
could've happened has now happened.  We are submerged in snow. <br>
Unfortunately, today I already had off of school and was planning to<br>
go hide the remaining boxes and get everything else ready, but now I<br>
am homebound and finding spots to hide the boxes I have will be very<br>
difficult - other than just burying them in the snow on Sat morning.<br>
<br>
I believe that 1) we are a hardy bunch, and like mailmen, we will<br>
trudge through, and 2) the roads and conditions will be better on Sat,<br>
so unless I hear a huge outcry - THE GATHERING WILL GO ON!<br>
<br>
However, unless things clear up early this afternoon, I will not be<br>
able to hide the boxes I have until Sat. morning before the gathering<br>
which will probably make me getting to the gathering a little late. <br>
My plan right now is to hide the boxes Sat. morning, hand write the<br>
clues, then print them at a copy shop nearby.  Sorry, you'll just have<br>
to persevere through my handwriting! :-)  <br>
<br>
Also, as my Christmas tree is in my classroom at school, and I won't<br>
make it up there to get it, I'm hoping that there is a pine tree near<br>
the shelter we can decorate and use for the gift exchange.  (Anyone<br>
know whether there is a tree nearby or not?) BTW, for the gift<br>
exchange, we'll take names and exchange names at the gathering seeing<br>
who can actually show up and take it from there, so you won't know who<br>
you have until almost just before we exchange gifts.<br>
<br>
On the bright side, I have a day off to get things done around the<br>
house...weeeee!  Bring out the "honey-do" list. :-(<br>

We'll definitely be there (easy to do for us since we only live a <br>
mile or so from the park!)  Chili is made and spiced cider is ready <br>
to go.  I've added shovel and brooms to my list of things to bring so <br>
we can clear some space in the shelter and clear off the picnic <br>
tables.<br>

Unfortunately, I don't think there are any trees anywhere near the <br>

Hope to see as many of you as possible tomorrow - it will be an <br>

ones by the tree that we could see are gone along with their light rings.<br>
