                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I suppose you could say that the absolute worst thing that<br/>
could've happened has now happened.  We are submerged in snow. <br/>
Unfortunately, today I already had off of school and was planning to<br/>
go hide the remaining boxes and get everything else ready, but now I<br/>
am homebound and finding spots to hide the boxes I have will be very<br/>
difficult - other than just burying them in the snow on Sat morning.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that 1) we are a hardy bunch, and like mailmen, we will<br/>
trudge through, and 2) the roads and conditions will be better on Sat,<br/>
so unless I hear a huge outcry - THE GATHERING WILL GO ON!<br/>
<br/>
However, unless things clear up early this afternoon, I will not be<br/>
able to hide the boxes I have until Sat. morning before the gathering<br/>
which will probably make me getting to the gathering a little late. <br/>
My plan right now is to hide the boxes Sat. morning, hand write the<br/>
clues, then print them at a copy shop nearby.  Sorry, you'll just have<br/>
to persevere through my handwriting! :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Also, as my Christmas tree is in my classroom at school, and I won't<br/>
make it up there to get it, I'm hoping that there is a pine tree near<br/>
the shelter we can decorate and use for the gift exchange.  (Anyone<br/>
know whether there is a tree nearby or not?) BTW, for the gift<br/>
exchange, we'll take names and exchange names at the gathering seeing<br/>
who can actually show up and take it from there, so you won't know who<br/>
you have until almost just before we exchange gifts.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, I have a day off to get things done around the<br/>
house...weeeee!  Bring out the "honey-do" list. :-(<br/>

&gt; Well, I suppose you could say that the absolute<br/>
&gt; worst thing that<br/>
&gt; could've happened has now happened.  We are<br/>
&gt; submerged in snow. <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, today I already had off of school <br/>
<br/>
That is what my father, a high school guidance<br/>
counselor, would refer to as "a waste of a perfectly<br/>
good snow day!"<br/>

the roads are pretty clear.  I drive past the park to get to work and <br/>
its all okay as of 20 minutes ago.  Shouldn't be too bad driving <br/>
there, but the actual trails, yeah, they are not there.  <br/>

&gt; Since you are so close to the gathering site, could you give us <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; insight on exactly how much snow there is there?  Here, south of <br/>

&gt; &gt; Dragon, I didn't know that your wife's trailname was so <br/>
accurate!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Didn't "Jinx" predict a snow storm?  (I'm glad I hid my box on <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanksgiving day.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We'll definitely be there (easy to do for us since we only live a <br/>
&gt; &gt; mile or so from the park!)  Chili is made and spiced cider is <br/>
ready <br/>
&gt; &gt; to go.  I've added shovel and brooms to my list of things to <br/>
bring <br/>
&gt; so <br/>
&gt; &gt; we can clear some space in the shelter and clear off the picnic <br/>
&gt; &gt; tables.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I don't think there are any trees anywhere near <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; shelter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope to see as many of you as possible tomorrow - it will be an <br/>
