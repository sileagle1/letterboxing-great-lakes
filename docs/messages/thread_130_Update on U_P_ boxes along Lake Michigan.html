                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's what we found out along the U.P. portion of the Lake Michigan <br/>
Circle Tour this weekend, going from east to west:<br/>
<br/>
Mighty Mac (St. Ignace - by Esperanza):  Straits State Park is <br/>
currently closed for some construction, so we weren't able to get in <br/>
to check on the box.  It was fine as of last August.<br/>
<br/>
Cut River Bridge (Epoufette - our box):   Box is fine, though it's <br/>
currently covered by a few inches of snow.  The last visitor was on <br/>
March 8th.<br/>
<br/>
Top O' The Pickle (Naubinway - by Esperanza):  Box is in great shape, <br/>
completely dry, and has had over 16 different visitors/groups.   We <br/>
found the Blackjack Acorn Hitchhiker here, and sent it along at <br/>
another box.<br/>
<br/>
Seul Choix Point Lighthouse (Gulliver - by SpringChick):  Seems to be <br/>
missing.  At least, it was not in the same spot as when we found it <br/>
one year ago.  I'll e-mail SpringChick off-list to discuss, so that <br/>
she can make the final determination.  This is still a great spot to <br/>
visit -- a neat lighthouse on Lake Michigan, just a few miles south <br/>
of the highway.<br/>
<br/>
Kitch-Iti-Kipi (Manistique - our box):   The area around the box has <br/>
lots of standing water (melting snow), but luckily the box itself was <br/>
just above the water line.  Doing fine, but has only had a couple of <br/>
visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Fox Park (Cedar River - our box):  We re-planted Beach Bum, formerly <br/>
of Wells Park, here.<br/>
<br/>
Wells Park boxes (Cedar River):   Sadly, we removed our 3 boxes <br/>
here.  The web site has been updated.  <br/>
<br/>
Henes Park boxes (Menominee - ours):   Poplar Point and Lily Pad Pond <br/>
were both in fine shape.  Babbling Brook was gone!  We searched <br/>
around for several minutes and finally found it under a bush about 10 <br/>
yards away.  Probably was moved by an animal.  It's now in a <br/>
different, nearby location with better protection, and the clue page <br/>
has been updated.<br/>
<br/>
Menominee North Pier Light (Menominee - our box):  Doing fine and has <br/>
had several visitors.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We hope that more of you will have a chance to find these boxes this <br/>
summer.  The new Lake Michigan Circle Tour publicity should bring a <br/>
little extra attention, too.  Also, we noticed some good parks and <br/>
locations along the route that are worthy of new letterboxes.... time <br/>
to get the carving tools out again!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tom and Jill, Thanks for checking on all the boxes while you were up <br/>
there!  Sounds like most of them are in good shape and survived the <br/>
winter okay.  Sorry to hear about the Seul Choix Point lighthouse <br/>
box.  Tim had mentioned a while back that he had been unable to find <br/>
it, so it probably has been missing for a while now.  I do not think <br/>
I will replace it since I am trying to avoid placing boxes so far <br/>
away from me.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you had a nice trip -- I was a bit surprised to hear there was <br/>
still some snow up there!<br/>
