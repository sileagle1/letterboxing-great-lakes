We also had a busy weekend - planted 22 boxes for the gathering, checked on<br>
2 of our older boxes, and found 3 new boxes.  Now working on writing up<br>
clues for the gathering boxes.  Hope everyone is ready for some hiking!<br>

However I can assure you that SunnySideUp is still quick on the hunt - less<br>
than 24 hours after I posted the clues to my new box she has reported<br>
finding it.<br>

<br>
We might get out to find 1 or 2 this Sunday, and hopefully permanently plant<br>
our stamps from the Horsin' Around event.<br>
