everyone has just been using this message board to record info on <br>
campsites/hotels and what stamps they plan to carve. The organizers <br>
haven't set a deadline yet that I know of.   I just checked, and it <br>
looks like there are at least 28 stamps planned so far.  Just add yours <br>
to the list.  Here's a link:<br>

There are basically 3 options...<br>
1. If you are going to the School House Cabin Fever Reliever gathering <br>
in April, you can have your stamp contribution ready and just give it <br>
to me personally.<br>
2. You can have your stamp contribution ready before May 12th and mail <br>
it to me. (E-mail me for the address. Clearly mark it for the <br>
gathering, as I receive MANY PLB's and I don't want there to be any <br>
confusion.) <br>
OR<br>
3. You can bring your stamp contribution with you, plant it yourself <br>
and post the clues on the bulletin board.<br>
Which ever option you choose, please let me know if it is to be a <br>
permanent or temporary (just for the event) plant.<br>
Thanks!<br>
