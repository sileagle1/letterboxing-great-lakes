I will not bother you with the details but Heather was able to gather some from various sources and print them out for everyone.  We have just over sixty of these packets. Each packet contains four maps.  One map shows the large broad overview of the park and the surrounding roads.  Another map is a blown up version of the first map.  A third map shows the hiking trails with the trail markers.  The final map shows the horse/mountain biking trails located across Wixom Road to the west.  This map also contains the roads sourrounding this area of the park.  You will need to drive from the meeting place to access these trails and there are three seperate locations to park at.  I do not know if Heather is able to send any of these maps to anyone prior to the event.  I can tell you that I am confident that due to the size of the park and the number of boxes planted, noone will be able to find every box in a single day.  Please feel free to ask us at the event or even prior to for details regarding the seperate trails/loops.<br>
