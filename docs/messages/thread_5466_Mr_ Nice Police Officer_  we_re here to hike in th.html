it was better than waiting for tomorrow since we now have more snow coming<br/>
down and "bitterly cold wind chills" predicted.<br/>

Based on our experience in our own yard, I'd guess those tracks might be<br/>
deer eating the tree!  (Although they could be a geocacher since we did find<br/>
one in the woods while we were checking on the box last weekend.)<br/>

I'd better make my clarification right now, before somebody asks me... No,<br/>
we didn't find a GeocacheER laying in the woods, just a regular metal<br/>
geocache box.  No grisly remains or anything like that, otherwise we might<br/>
have a lot of explaining to do if the Nice Police Officer showed up!<br/>

guys! You both go so fast that the footprints would have been filled<br/>

<br/>
So did you pick "slackboxing" as one of your bingo words? I thought of<br/>
you guys right away and just had to add that one to my list  =)<br/>
<br/>
Congrats on finding the box. You two sure are crazy...er I mean<br/>
determined to go out in this kind of weather. <br/>
