                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a tough call...  I think finders tend to use this for a <br/>
personal record of "boxes that we did not end up with even though we <br/>
tried" (and I use the word *tried* loosely here).  This may be after <br/>
5 hours of searching the spot where it *should* have been, or it may <br/>
be after 5 hours of searching a *fitting* spot in the wrong park.  <br/>
On the other hand it may be because they got halfway down the trail <br/>
and it got too dark to continue or they realized they hadn't done <br/>
their homework thoroughly and couldn't decipher a critical piece of <br/>
the clue.  To them it simply means -- "we need to keep this one on <br/>
the to-do list."<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, more and more people are looking at those <br/>
*attempted* status logs and using them to gauge whether or not a box <br/>
is in place.  A box with several *attempted* reports in a row may <br/>
leave potential seekers thinking that the box is likely missing and <br/>
deter them from even trying, choosing instead to spend their time on <br/>
a box that has had recent found reports.  This is too bad because <br/>
the attempted reports are not an accurate reflection of the box <br/>
availability.  Can you imagine if this option had been available for <br/>
MapSurfer or Legerdemaine boxes?  Those boxes can go unfound for <br/>
months, even years, although many try on a regular basis.<br/>
<br/>
I know some placers will make a point to add an *OK* status report <br/>
after each *attempted* report just to give people some security that <br/>
the failed find is not an indication of a missing box.  Personally I <br/>
don't feel comfortable putting in an *OK* report unless I have <br/>
physically gone out and checked the box and this is not always <br/>
possible for me to do at the time. <br/>
<br/>
This is one of the reason that I have the logging feature at LbNA <br/>
disabled on my boxes.  While people can still log status and I <br/>
receive these reports in e-mail so I an follow-up on potentially <br/>
missing boxes, the status logging history is not available to <br/>
potential seekers.  I realize this may turn away a few who were <br/>
looking for a guarantee of the box existence, but it is their loss, <br/>
not mine -- it probably wasn't the right box for them in the first <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
When looking for boxes, I very rarely even check the status reports <br/>
before going out.  Just because somebody else didn't find the box, <br/>
doesn't mean that I won't find the box and I really don't even want <br/>
to know as it may influence my efforts or make me give up quicker.  <br/>
Besides, missing boxes are just a part of letterboxing...  Some of <br/>
the best trail stories come from people's tireless efforts to find <br/>
an elusive box.<br/>

I actually stopped logging our finds and attempts because we had the same thoughts. Personally an attempted was just to keep the information for ourselves so that we could attempt the box again later or know that if at a later date it was reported missing we wouldn't feel so bad for not being able to find it.<br/>
<br/>
  The only time an attempted has detered me from looking for a box is if someone who has several hundred finds was unable to find it. That combined with other circumstances (long hike, time of day we might attempt it, having 2 small children) might make us skip the box for now.<br/>
<br/>
  I agree that the fun is in the hunt although it can be quite frustrating to feel like you are so close yet not find the box. It's all a learning process.<br/>
<br/>
  Jeff and I were talking on one of our many driving sessions last weekend in search of the 80 days boxes that we must be coming up on 200 finds yet we still feel so new to the whole adventure. <br/>

<br/>
However, after the first month or two, we changed our minds about this <br/>

we tend to be less inclined to search for a box in a far-off location if <br/>
it hasn't recently been found but had also been marked "attempted" <br/>
months ago).  We try to contact the placer and describe where we think <br/>
the box should have been.  So far our "attempted" rate is maybe only 50% <br/>
(ie, half the boxes where there, but we interpreted the clues <br/>
differently)....but we are getting better with more experience (and we <br/>
try really hard to read the clue fully!) <br/>
<br/>
Usually, after contacting the placer...the placer might mark the box <br/>
"missing" or tell us we had the clue wrong (either way, we no longer <br/>
need to mark it as "attempted").<br/>

people will then avoid those boxes, so "Attempted" isn't usually used<br/>
lightly.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I mark any box that I am unable to find after a decent search as "attempted," even if<br/>
I am not 100% sure that I was in the right place.  If I know that I didn't actually get to <br/>

an attempt and don't mark it.  <br/>
<br/>
I think marking "attempted" in cases where you just plain couldn't figure it out is also<br/>
valuable, even if you don't have reason to think the box is missing.  It can help the<br/>
placer gauge whether his/her clues are too confusing.  I appreciate knowing how often<br/>
people are trying to get my boxes and a couple of times I have rewritten clues because<br/>
of a high proportion of unsuccessful attempts.  <br/>
<br/>
If I tried and couldn't find it but am not confident I was in the right place, I just mark<br/>
it as attempted, and let the placer decide whether it's worth investigating.  If I am quite<br/>
sure I was in the right place and did not find it, then I also send a note suggesting that<br/>
the box might be missing.<br/>
<br/>
When looking at boxes to hunt, I am not too dissuaded by seeing one "attempted," but<br/>
I am cautious if there have been more than one in a row.  I do use it to decide how <br/>
confident I am that the box is there in cases where I would be making a long, special <br/>
trip to get the box.  But if the last find date is a really long time ago, I am equally <br/>
suspicious of that.<br/>

mystery boxes.  In my opinion, if you think a clue is "too confusing", <br/>
it would be better to try to contact the placer to see if they are <br/>

I suspect that there are some letterboxers who would find the notion<br/>
of clues that are "too confusing" as an oxymoron. A well-known east<br/>
coaster will not give any hints to his terribly confusing clues, and<br/>
he is very upfront about it.<br/>
There are reportedly many boxes that have never been found.<br/>

<br/>
Of course, if people want to make their boxes hard, that's their<br/>
right.  I just like to know about how many people are finding my<br/>
boxes.  In the case of two of my boxes, the local landscape had<br/>
changed, rendering the clues harder to follow (if not outright<br/>
inaccurate).  Getting a lot of unsuccessful attempts alerted me to<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I like having fairly straightforward clues, as I like to <br/>
have my boxes get found.  <br/>

<br/>
I did this with a letterbox in my town that was driving me batty because the same thing was happening. People were wasting their time looking for it, some were even emailing me (because the owner was not responding to email and I been one of the first to find it) asking if it was really gone. So I petitioned Choi asking to adopt it and I've since replaced it, carved a new stamp that is a copy of the old stamp, put it in a nearby but less conspicuous place and changed the clues to reflect the new location.<br/>

I had no idea everyone regarded marking a box as "Attempted" as being<br/>
such a dire thing to do.  If it isn't merely meant to indicate that the box<br/>
has, in fact, been attempted, maybe it should be named something else, like<br/>
"Believed Missing."<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking about my own boxes and whether I, personally, after <br/>
noticing repeated attempts, think my own clue might be badly written.  (As<br/>
I said, in a couple of cases it turned out to be due to changes in the landscape<br/>
that I had not yet noticed.) Also, I just like to  know when people look for my <br/>
boxes even when they do not find them.  It's good to know; otherwise I might <br/>
just think no one was even tried.<br/>
<br/>
I'm kind of surprised by the vibes I'm getting off some of the responses<br/>

who can't handle hard boxes or something like that.  :(<br/>

Clues that may be confusing to one person, causing them to miss a box and thus mark an "attempted" status, may be crystal clear to the next person -- we all interpret things differently and approach clues from a different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
As many people have indicated, they do use the status history as an influence in planning future box hunts, so it only stands to reason that marking a box as "attempted" is not something that should be done haphazardly as it can be like red-flagging a box to future seekers.  Even though there are situations where this may obviously be warranted (i.e. the case in point that you mentioned about the long-missing box), there are many other situations where it may just be a difficult box or a misinterpretation of clues.<br/>
<br/>
But...  on the flip side, for any planters who feel this is a deterent or wish to maintain more of a mysterious nature with their boxes, there is the option to disable status comments from showing up with your boxes.  I have done this and it is not because I don't want people to know the status of my boxes, rather I don't want them to be misinformed about the status of my boxes based on the unsuccessful attempts of previous seekers.  I provide a box status with all of my clues and will gladly answer e-mails from potential seekers inquiring about status.<br/>
