                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sad to say, but I have been informed that two of my boxes in Butler Lake Park in Libertyville, Illinois are missing.  I checked out the locations today and this is what I found.  At the location of box #1, I found a package of soggy Kool cigarettes; almost a full package too.  At the location of box #2, I found the cap from the film canister with some remains of black tape still evident, but the cap was well chewed up.  No other items found in the areas of box #1 or #2.  Sad, but that's how it goes sometimes.  I recall the first time one of my boxes went missing - I was devastated!  But since then I've learned that some boxes don't last forever and that's just part of the hobby.  <br>
<br>
Here's hoping that all letterboxes stay safe and dry this winter.  <br>

I recall the first time one of my boxes went missing.  I was so depressed over that first experience.  But I've learned that some letterboxes don't last and that's just part of the hobby.  The hiding spot is very important.  <br>
