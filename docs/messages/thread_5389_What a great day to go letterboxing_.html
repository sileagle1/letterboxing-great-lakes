                    <div class="plaintext-content">You're not going to believe this, but I went with the kid and her BF <br>
(the ones who unravelled the mystery of FOOW2 this summer) to <br>
Matthiessen SP yesterday.  She of course, performed the Million Death <br>
Routine because I talked to him about Lbing and showed him my <br>
logbook.  Couldn't exactly tell if he was interested or just being <br>
polite, but either way, I had a captive audience.  His main reaction <br>
was "I'd be so p***ed if I put all that work into that and someone <br>
took it." which unfortunately may have been the situation with three <br>
of the four boxes we were looking for (talking to the placers about <br>
them offlist).  But he did seem to be genuinely pleased with the <br>
Batman stamp I carved for him, and used it to log into those boxes we <br>
were able to find.<br>
<br>
So anyway, we were coming up from lower dells and all were tired, but <br>
I needed to find this one last box.  I'm sure we were in the right <br>
place, but it didn't make sense.  Not to post any spoilers here, but <br>
something just didn't seem right about the clues.  So I'm <br>
watching...one likely spot, but no...the placer wouldn't do that.  So <br>
I started looking at the other side of the trail and investigating <br>
suspicious looking hiding places off that way.  Eventually though we <br>
reached the landmark that says we've gone too far without finding <br>
it.  Oh, well.  <br>
<br>
Then I realized I lost my sweatshirt.  Think the young lovebirds <br>
would offer to go look for it for me?  "We'll wait there on the <br>
bench."  Sure, let the old lady with raging plantar fasciitis go <br>
search for it.  So I left my bag with them (shoulder's getting a <br>
little sore by now too) and started back.  Asked some hikers I passed <br>
if they saw it..."Yeah, out by the stairs".  Dang!  So back I <br>
trekked.  Yep, there it was...all the way back at the far end of the <br>
stairs.  Well, at least nobody took it.  So back I went.  Guess I'll <br>
look for the letterbox as long as I'm here.  Back to that suspicious <br>
spot.  What the heck.  I'll check anyway...there's no one around to <br>
observe me.  YES!!!  There it is!  Of course I have nothing with me, <br>
so I must admit what I did...I tore a page out of the logbook and <br>
huffed on the stamp.  A very faint image, but I got it!  And I did <br>
have my necklace with my mini stamp around my neck.  Huffed again and <br>
I was able to log in (no pen to write the date though - next time!).  <br>
Victory is mine!<br>
<br>
The park itself was really crowded, whether that was due to the <br>
campaign to pack the parks or just plain gorgeous weather, I don't <br>
know.  I was able to locate all five of my Matthiessen and Buffalo <br>
Rock boxes, so that's a good thing, though I was not able to open any <br>
up (other than Bluffalo, which had no one around at the time) to <br>
check inside because there were so many people around.  The Lower <br>
Dells at Matthiessen looked like Oak Street Beach in Chicago on a <br>
summer weekend it was so swarmed with people.  (So much for a <br>
peaceful commune with nature....)<br>
<br>
But the best part of the day?  When we dropped "Batman" off at his <br>
place, he thanked me for taking him along, and when Papillon left to <br>
head back to her dorm she hugged me and said "I really had a good <br>
time today, Mom."  Like the commercial says, "Priceless!" <br>
