Well, it's official.  My husband, who works for Ford, went and got us transfered.  And to *Memphis* of all places.  Memphis, as in "hey y'all, how all y'alls doin' I reckon you're fixin' to have some sweet tea" Memphis.  (Unless there's a Memphis, Michigan, in which case I have NO idea what's going on)<br>
<br>
This presents a multitude of difficulties, some of which I'll list below for your email amusement (hey, it's not you being shipped off down south, you might as well get a good chuckle)<br>
<br>
difficulty one:  My husband is leaving in ten days.  I'm not leaving until Christmas break.  This means that it's me who gets to fix the house, clean the house, get the house up on the market and get it sold, all before December 21st.  No biggie.<br>
<br>
difficulty two: I've never moved in my life.  Well, there were those exile years I spent up in Lansing during college, but other than that, I'm SE Michigan, born and bred.  And I'm *moving*??  Did I mention that I'm moving to **MEMPHIS**?<br>
<br>
difficulty three:  I have to find a new hair stylist!  This fact alone might make me stay if I dwell on it too long.  I went to school with my stylist!  She stole my sixth grade boyfriend from me!  She's the only one in the world who knows just how long to leave the highlights in!  I can't leave her!  Maybe she'll move down to Memphis with me....<br>
<br>
but the BIGGEST problem is this:<br>
<br>
Go look at how many boxes there are in the Memphis area.  Go ahead- look.  And I'll even broaden the field for you, since we're looking for houses across the border in Mississippi...I'll wait...you go look.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Grim right?  THREE BOXES!  And my mother-in-law placed one-third of them.  So there we are.  I'm leaving the only home I've ever known, to go across three states, one time zone, and a whole culture, only to settle in a landscape barren of letterboxes.<br>
<br>
But, there's a silver lining in this ugly, ugly cloud- I'm taking all but two of my boxes with me (my apologies to Team Taco, who went searching for one of my boxes I'd pulled for this reason and hadn't warned about) and planting them down south.  I'll be the foremost letterboxing presence in the greater Memphis area.  All will fear me!  I will rule by madness and tyrany!  All will bow down before my-  well, you get the point.<br>
<br>
So, the rest of my boxes will be pulled in the next month or so, with the exception of "Kensington Haiku" and my new box, carved just for the occaision- "So Long Michigan, '75-'05".  Team Rabbit has generously agreed to not only adopt those boxes, but also take over planning for next year's Gathering- which I will be at, come hell or high water.  And I WON'T be sporting a new southern accent.  But I might be sporting some extra pounds if there's a Waffle House anywhere near me.  *grin*<br>

Sorry to hear you're moving, and glad to hear you had a darn good <br>
reason for pulling that box!<br>

Looking forward to vacationing in your future Lb empire,<br>

Oh, and I forgot, if anyone would like to carve a stamp for me to place down there, please do.  I was planning a "Icons of the South" series....there's a Waffle House stamp (did I mention how much I love that place?), a Sweet Tea stamp, a Graceland stamp, a vicious Fire Ant stamp, a Magnolia stamp, and a Mint Julep (as soon as I figure out what the heck a mint julep even IS) stamp.  If you've got any ideas, carve them up and send them my way- I'll plant them for you and call you one of my legion.<br>

Drat!  There's no way we're going to get to SE<br>
Michigan again before your move!  I _knew_ we should<br>
have spent more time there this past August :)<br>
<br>
However, I'm sure that we'll get a chance to visit you<br>
(and your relocated boxes) one day, since Deedle LOVES<br>
Elvis, and although he's been to Graceland before,<br>
every-so-often he talks about going again with me in<br>
tow.  I do not exagerate his love of Elvis.  His<br>
living room is "the jungle room," a la Elvis's jungle<br>
room.  I've never really seen Elvis's room, but my<br>
Jeff's is actually pretty classy.  But then there's<br>
the Elvis lamp.  Imagine a bust of Elvis of the<br>
jumpsuit days, with a great big lampshade on top of<br>
it.  This is our equivilant of the leg lamp from A<br>
Christmas Story.  *shudder*  Luckily the lamp is up in<br>
the attic right now, though, 'cause he doesn't have<br>
enough space to display it.  <br>
<br>
(Of course his love of Elvis does not rival his KISS<br>
collection.  But that's just another story....)<br>
<br>
Good luck with the move....even if you're moving<br>
physical locations, I hope you're staying on the Great<br>
Lakes mailing list?<br>
<br>
Doodle (still trying to come up with creative ways for<br>
the Elvis lamp to "mysteriously" disappear....)<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>

moving.  Your posts are so funny.......I always get a good laugh!  <br>
Hopefully you'll stay tuned to this chat group and keep us informed <br>
of how you conquer the south.....I hope they're all ready for <br>
you....is is possible that there's another Civil War brewing as one <br>
crazy yankee heads south??????<br>
<br>
We moved about two years ago......not fun, but somehow you get <br>
through it.  Best of luck.<br>
