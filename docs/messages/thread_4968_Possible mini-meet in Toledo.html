<br>
Thanks for the tips! I will definitely post on AQ - I didn't realize <br>
that the board there was active. In my region, almost all of the <br>
activity is on our Yahoo list. I'd found a number of possibilities, <br>
but I'd missed some of those that Hart x6 mentioned, so I appreciate <br>
all the suggestions!<br>
<br>
A mini-meet is definitely a possibility. I am actually the maid of <br>
honor in the wedding, so I think my sister will be keeping me hopping <br>
when I'm in Cleveland, so maybe Toledo might be a better possibility. <br>
Speaking of mini-meets, Beth, will you be coming back to visit us <br>
again? It would be great to see you again in either place.<br>
<br>
I notice that the one state without many suitable boxes is Indiana, my <br>
home state! I may need to leave another box behind when I pass <br>
through. ;)<br>
