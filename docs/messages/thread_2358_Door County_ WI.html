letterboxer, chances are you're looking for a vacation spot that <br/>
offers great scenery and lots of great letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I'd put in a word for Door County, WI.  If you've never <br/>
visited this little peninsula that juts out between Lake Michigan and <br/>
Green Bay, you're in for a real treat.  You will find quaint towns, <br/>
art galleries, antique shops, parks, lighthouses and lots of hiking <br/>
opportunities.  Not only is the area packed with things to do and see <br/>
and some of the best scenery around, but there are several fantastic <br/>
letterboxes to be found here.<br/>
<br/>
I just finished posting my photos from our Door County trip last fall <br/>
to my Flickr account.  You can view them here (you do not need to <br/>
create an account there to view photos):<br/>
