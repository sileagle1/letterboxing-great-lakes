LOL! Lots of fun and a lot of hiking! Thanks go out to Wisconsin Hiker <br/>
and Martini Man for organizing such a great time!<br/>
<br/>
So good to see people I recognized from the last gathering and meeting <br/>
new people! Big H and Lil' H, my hubby loved the coffeecake! <br/>
<br/>
We may have a new LB'er in my family. My son came with me but didn't <br/>
want to go look for boxes. That's fine cuz he's a teen and they seem <br/>
to "poo-poo" their parents' ideas. LOL! He helped with cooking (being <br/>
a boy scout he has had lots of training) so no complaints from me. But <br/>
he went out with me, Shooting star, Mr. Conductor and Madame Butterfly <br/>
in the early evening. He had a great time and even lead the way on a <br/>
couple of boxes! On the ride home, he was thinking of trail names and <br/>
stamp images for himself!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for so much fun packed into one day!<br/>
