 Glad you liked the stamp!  And glad you made it home safe!<br/>

 Today for work I had a stop in Oregon, Illinois. The last time I had <br/>
 a stop in Oregon was November 16th and I found Pastor Wife's "John <br/>
 Deere Plow II" after dark during hunting season!! <br/>

Well Kimono Girl...you are more than welcome to come and shovel our 9 <br/>
inches of snow we have already received  =)  We are still expecting 6-<br/>
8 more! <br/>
Sorry to hear about your basement. Hope it gets fixed soon.<br/>
