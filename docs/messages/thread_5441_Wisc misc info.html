growing up, though not the chocolate ones.  I always assumed everyone had<br>
them as a child???  Come to think of it, I don't really remember seeing them<br>
at other people's houses, but they just "appeared" at our house every Dec<br>
1st.  Where would my Mom have gotten them?  Is this some Scandinavian thing?<br>
 Espresso Beans, do you recall seeing them at other people's houses when you<br>
were young?  Was I just not observant?<br>

P.S.  Natural butter is a whitish color.<br>
