Some Chinese New Year celebratory tidbits I learned from a Chinese coworker - the oldest and youngest attendees should dress entirely in red for good luck....  The proper greeting for the day is Congratulations or Happy new year, the former because tradition says a beast (the name is something like "Nyah" - does anyone know the anglicized spelling?) is known for snatching people away overnight, so you congratulate everyone for surviving the beast....  The traditional gift is money.  (I'll be happy to accept any gifts you guys would like to give me!!!!)<br>
 <br>
Good thing we aren't meeting on the actual day - tradition calls for EVERY article of clothing (from undies to coats) be brand new...could get expensive!<br>
<br>
Assuming we have no dissention, are we going with this theme??<br>

Actually, we all SHOULD wear at least some red according to <br>
tradition.  "Red clothing is preferred during this festive occasion. <br>
Red is considered a bright, happy color, sure to bring the wearer a <br>
sunny and bright future."  We also should all clean our houses before <br>
we head to the event.  If you'd like to know why, and learn a few <br>
other things about Chinese New Year customs & superstitions, you can <br>

Yes, but then we are back to my question:  Who will claim to be the <br>
oldest?  Martini Man is sure hoping it isn't him, since he doesn't <br>

Humph! Even if there were red pants in the house my size, I would have to be<br>
laid out to wear them. I am your basic IBM type. You know...Blue, grey,<br>
black and (let's get adventurous! ) brown. Being a letter boxer, earth tones<br>
suit me.<br>
<br>
Best regards, young 'uns.<br>

Yes, but then we are back to my question: Who will claim to be the <br>
oldest? Martini Man is sure hoping it isn't him, since he doesn't <br>
have any red pants to wear! Now that would be a sight....<br>
