Using all the charm I could muster, I tried to convince them to bend the rules for our group, but to no available. BUT, please believe me when I say there is a lot of camping spots! There are a total of 193 designated camping spots at this park. In the past the park has only filled up on Labor Day & Memorial Day weekends. Check out all the details at:<br>

For the GLG 2010: I don't know if I'm remembering correctly, but I thought somebody was going to approach the park about taking reservations at the campground. Did that ever happen? I would prefer to camp, but it freaks me out to not be able to make a reservation. I'd hate to get there and find out I didn't have any place to stay. Any chance they would bend the rules for a large group?<br>
