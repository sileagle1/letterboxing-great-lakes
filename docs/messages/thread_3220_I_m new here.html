I'm new to this group. I found out about letterboxing at the doctors <br>
office in a magizine.  My friend and I have found 3 boxes so far and we <br>
just started last week.  We meet and take our boxer dogs with us. It's <br>
been a little cold but it's great getting outside and enjoying the fall.<br>
When we find a box I yell I found it and the dogs go crazy jumping up  <br>
to see what I have.  Were looking forward to finding more.<br>

To your knowledge, are there any boxes that are perticularly dog friendly? My 6 y/o blk lab loves to go every where I do, but I have found that some boxes that I have tried are far from dog friendly.<br>

I too love your trailname. I know I take my dog/dogs with me boxing <br>
as companions as well as for safety. I take mine with me to "almost" <br>
all my boxes. Like anyone else.. we do have to be careful not to let <br>
them trample the foliage....  ;-)<br>
