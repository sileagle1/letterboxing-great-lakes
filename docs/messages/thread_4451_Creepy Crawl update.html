SE Michigan.<br/>
Check out the blog for more information!  http://creepycrawl2007.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
The "destination clues" for the first 7 boxes have been <br/>
posted!  You'll want to get started on solving these as you need <br/>
these names to complete the hunt successfully.  I'll get the 8th clue <br/>
posted as soon as we figure out a "movie" and a "placement site".<br/>
<br/>
There have been some minor rule changes, notably the age of kids who <br/>
count as a "team member" has been raised to 8.  Teams can have a max <br/>
of 4 people, and please keep your total group limited to 6 people, <br/>
including the younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
If you're planning on attending, please RSVP on AQ by 10/1, so I can <br/>
get an idea of what to do about <br/>
food.  http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=449<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Hope to see you there!<br/>

  This isn't technically a "real" road rally!  The clues you have to figure out for the locations are provided ahead of time, so you have time to work on them rather than doing it on the fly like you would in a real road rally.  <br/>

You could come up!  We're only a couple hours from Cleveland!  There <br/>
are a couple other Ohioans and now Wisconsinites coming!<br/>
