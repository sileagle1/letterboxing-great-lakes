 <br>
Box #2 on our list was Big Creek Park.  I swear, someone up there must know when we plan on going letterboxing because it started to pour as we tried to find the park's entrance (which was a little difficult because the road leading to the park was closed on both ends for construction!).  We finally found a way to get to the park, and thank goodness we bought those rainjackets.  We ate our picnic lunch first, and by then the rain let up.  Beautiful park, and we passed a pond filled with lillypads.  Being the city girl that I am, I'd seen lots of lillypads but never actually seen a frog on any of them before.  Much less seven of them.  <br>
 <br>
Box #3 was supposed to be Burton's Log Cabin, but given the warning about "trail might be muddy after rain" in the clues, and references to the, um, atmosphere of this local on this list by previous finders, we decided to skip that one for the time being.  It was also about 2 PM by this time.  <br>
 <br>
So next stop was the Punderson Park box.  Lesson learned:  cross country ski trails are always going to be soggy and buggy.  Well, the fact that it poured a few hours earlier didn't help, either.  We finished up with West Woods.  All-in-all, a nice afternoon, but to all the power boxers out there - are all ya'all crazy?  We only found 4 boxes and were exhausted by the time we got home (whcih was 7 PM).  On paper they seemed close together, we just didn't take into account all the half hour hikes....or the humidty...<br>

So then Monday we finally did it, we placed our first box!  Kumbaya is resting peacefully in Strongsville, Ohio, and we'll get clues posted tonight.<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.

Congratulations on your first plant!!  Isn't it a great feeling to <br>
know you've put something out there that will bring such enjoyment?  <br>
I especially love checking on my boxes after a while to see the new <br>
stamp-ins.  It's also fun to find out what your local boxers think of <br>
your new boxes (i.e. clues, stamp, overall experience).  I often <br>
imagine (especially when I'm at work!) people hiking the trail and <br>
deciphering the clues - were they too hard or too easy?  Is the trail <br>
in good shape?  Has the park run out of trail maps (which actually <br>
happened recently)?  Great fun!<br>
<br>
Now that you've broken the ice I'll bet you've got plans for lots <br>
more!<br>
