As it looks right now, All Things Minnesota will be<br>
the theme this year. If that is the case I call dibs<br>
on the Minnesota State Mushroom Stamp. For those of<br>
you who don't know the MN. State Shroom is the much<br>
sought after Morel. I think it's only fitting I do a<br>
Morel Mushroom box since I'm a member of the M.M.S.<br>
(Minnesota Mycological Society). I can't wait for the<br>
gathering this year!!!<br>
<br>
Red Cat, contact me offlist/offline so we can talk<br>
aboot all the wonderful things we have to organize.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing EVERYONE (I'm hoping for the<br>
biggest GLG yet) in May.<br>

Bring on the Tinea Pedis, I will send you send you a<br>
nice infestation of Serpula Lacrimans to your home<br>
which is much harder to get rid of. <br>
<br>
On a lighter note, will you be making the gathering<br>
this year? I can't remember if Papillon graduated last<br>
year or it's this year. Hope to see you there.<br>

Nope, can't make it this year.  I couldn't convince the kid to drop out of HS so I could attend the gathering.  Dang her!  Now I have to not only stay here for her graduation on the 30th, but have to pay for her college education (well, I guess I don't HAVE to pay, but at least it will get her out of the house).<br>
