As it looks right now, All Things Minnesota will be<br/>
the theme this year. If that is the case I call dibs<br/>
on the Minnesota State Mushroom Stamp. For those of<br/>
you who don't know the MN. State Shroom is the much<br/>
sought after Morel. I think it's only fitting I do a<br/>
Morel Mushroom box since I'm a member of the M.M.S.<br/>
(Minnesota Mycological Society). I can't wait for the<br/>
gathering this year!!!<br/>
<br/>
Red Cat, contact me offlist/offline so we can talk<br/>
aboot all the wonderful things we have to organize.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing EVERYONE (I'm hoping for the<br/>
biggest GLG yet) in May.<br/>

Bring on the Tinea Pedis, I will send you send you a<br/>
nice infestation of Serpula Lacrimans to your home<br/>
which is much harder to get rid of. <br/>
<br/>
On a lighter note, will you be making the gathering<br/>
this year? I can't remember if Papillon graduated last<br/>
year or it's this year. Hope to see you there.<br/>

Nope, can't make it this year.  I couldn't convince the kid to drop out of HS so I could attend the gathering.  Dang her!  Now I have to not only stay here for her graduation on the 30th, but have to pay for her college education (well, I guess I don't HAVE to pay, but at least it will get her out of the house).<br/>
