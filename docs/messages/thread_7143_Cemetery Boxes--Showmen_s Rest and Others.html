                    <div class="plaintext-content">When my husband was at the library and looking at the new book shelf, he saw a book: The Great Circus Train Wreck of 1918. Bless his heart, he brought it home.  There was a lot of interesting information in there relating to the Showmen's Rest, so I added a little bit of that to the story in the clues.  And I planted 2 more cemetery boxes, so there is now at least one box for each of the 5 cemeteries in Forest Park.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Even though I've already found Showmen's Rest, I re-read the information on the box ... ironically on the 22nd of June!  The new info is really interesting.  This was one of my favorite boxes ... so much history, and so sobering to read the names on the grave stones! Now to find the Cemetery boxes we haven't found yet.<br>
