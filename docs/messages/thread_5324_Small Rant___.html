I can understand the average muggle-without-a-clue coming upon a<br/>

be clued into the fact that people play games hiding little rubber<br/>
containers in the woods?  Even if this person has been living under a<br/>
rock and has no clue what letterboxing is, given that they themselves<br/>
hide caches in the same sort of places, wouldn't you think they would<br/>
have at least opened it up to see what it was while they were there<br/>

We honestly didn't even check for a couple of weeks because we thought it was a bad joke from one of our muggle friends who doesn't get our hobby, especially since the box had been reported found just a day prior. No one was more surprised than us when we actually did find our LB under the tree at campsite 117. It was the original Andrus Lake LB which had gone missing and and been replaced for over a year. According to the logbook, it got moved afewtimes, with lots of muggles logging in. The email message wasn't even from the first party to move it, but the last!We were pleased to get our original LB back and properly thanked the party who hid it well and notified us. <br/>

I don't see anything which suggests that this box was found in a hidden <br/>
location.  In fact the tone of the note seems to indicate that it was <br/>
lying around in someplace where it probably did not belong. If that is <br/>
the case then in my opinion the finder did the proper thing picking it <br/>
up from it's unsecured location, notifying the placer that it had been <br/>
found, and asking for guidance on what to do with it.<br/>

I have discovered two letterboxes recently that had been chewed upon and <br/>
drug out into the open by critters looking for winter food supplies.<br/>

Perhaps we are jumping to conclusions here??<br/>

Of course, I could be mistaken as my assertion is based purely on what I would have done and one cannot know exactly what the situation was.  I just found it odd that a person who themself hunts for caches in the woods would jump to the conclusion that a rubber container in the woods didn't belong there.<br/>
