                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I received the following message a couple of days ago in regards to<br>
one of my letterboxes located at Saugatuck Dunes State Park, a box<br>
which has been quietly in place for nearly 5 years:<br>
<br>
"I found this container in the woods one day, While out checking on my<br>
Geocache, Didn't think it belonged there. I removed it. Sorry. Not<br>
sure if i still have the coords' where i found it, But you can have it<br>
back. Just let me know what to do with it."<br>
<br>
First let me say that I really do appreciate the fact that this person<br>
took the time to write and apologize and offer to let me have my box<br>
back.  Many people don't even give that courtesy.<br>
<br>
But, here's the part that gets me...<br>
<br>
I can understand the average muggle-without-a-clue coming upon a<br>
letterbox and perhaps picking it up thinking it is trash or "didn't<br>
belong" in the woods...  but wouldn't you think that a geocacher would<br>
be clued into the fact that people play games hiding little rubber<br>
containers in the woods?  Even if this person has been living under a<br>
rock and has no clue what letterboxing is, given that they themselves<br>
hide caches in the same sort of places, wouldn't you think they would<br>
have at least opened it up to see what it was while they were there<br>
rather than just removing it thinking it didn't belong there?  Duh!<br>
<br>
And then people wonder why letterboxers and geocachers don't always<br>
see eye-to-eye...<br>
<br>
Okay, rant over, please return to your regularly scheduled Wednesday.<br>

"we found your box down at the white fish bay state boat harbor next to a rock. we had never heard of boxing so we took it thinking that we were suppose to move it into a different hiding place and leave clues on this web site. your box is now at river mouth state forest campsite on the rustic side. its by the river next to site 117 under neath the huge pine tree leaning over the river. its under the roots. :-) good luck if you want it back"<br>
<br>
We honestly didn't even check for a couple of weeks because we thought it was a bad joke from one of our muggle friends who doesn't get our hobby, especially since the box had been reported found just a day prior. No one was more surprised than us when we actually did find our LB under the tree at campsite 117. It was the original Andrus Lake LB which had gone missing and and been replaced for over a year. According to the logbook, it got moved afewtimes, with lots of muggles logging in. The email message wasn't even from the first party to move it, but the last!We were pleased to get our original LB back and properly thanked the party who hid it well and notified us. <br>
<br>
We continue to be puzzled when our boxes go missing whyanyone would ever want to take/move/destroy something that's not theirs????!<br>

I don't see anything which suggests that this box was found in a hidden <br>
location.  In fact the tone of the note seems to indicate that it was <br>
lying around in someplace where it probably did not belong. If that is <br>
the case then in my opinion the finder did the proper thing picking it <br>
up from it's unsecured location, notifying the placer that it had been <br>
found, and asking for guidance on what to do with it.<br>

I have discovered two letterboxes recently that had been chewed upon and <br>
drug out into the open by critters looking for winter food supplies.<br>

Perhaps we are jumping to conclusions here??<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had thought of that when I initially read it, but it does seem like he/she would have said that rather than apologizing for taking it with them.  Of course, I could be mistaken as my assertion is based purely on what I would have done and one cannot know exactly what the situation was.  I just found it odd that a person who themself hunts for caches in the woods would jump to the conclusion that a rubber container in the woods didn't belong there.<br>
