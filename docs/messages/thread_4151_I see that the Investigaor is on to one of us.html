Don't worry about it - it just refers to some shenanigans on the "big <br>
board".  It would only make sense if you read the national message <br>
board.<br>

Gosh no!  Just the opposite!  As far as I know it was the original <br>
message board/talk list for letterboxing.  After that, some regional <br>
groups were formed (such as the Great Lakes group).  I subscribe to <br>
the "big board" since that is all that existed when I first started <br>
letterboxing.  A lot of "old timer" boxers follow this board.  Not sure <br>
if I qualify as an "old timer", but we are coming up on our 4-year <br>
letterboxing anniversay next month.<br>
