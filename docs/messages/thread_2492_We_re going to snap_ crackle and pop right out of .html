Well based on our experience this weekend - they are ALREADY OUT in <br>
Wisconsin!  Yes, out <br>
in western WI and yes, out in our backyard in eastern WI.  This seems <br>
awfully early to <br>
us - usually we can box in peace until early to mid-June.  Yikes!  <br>
Where's that bug <br>
spray again?????<br>
<br>
Wisconsin Hiker<br>
<br>
P.S.  Congrats to cerealcityboxers!  Were they the latest date guessed <br>
or are some <br>
still to come?<br>

They were the final guessers. And as you may have noted with chagrin,<br>
some guessers 'held' only a single day before someone else came on the<br>
calendar. And some chose dates that allowed them to stake out as much<br>
as a week or even two.<br>
Turns out that cerealcityboxers were the most pessimistic among the<br>
BINGO guessers....and they were right.<br>
