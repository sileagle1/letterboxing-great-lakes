Then we'll take them to a park, split them up into groups of 3 and send them out (an adult in each group) to find the 3 boxes I will have planted. I've got the stamps carved, stamps & logbooks for each girl, compasses for each one, etc.<br>
<br>
For the past few months, I've been planning to use Grand River Park. Love the trails there. They are numbered so it's easy to figure out where you are at any given time (and the numbers are great references in the clues, especially for beginners). Found some great spots, only to find out a couple weeks later once the greenery started blooming, that the best location is filled with poison ivy. I definitely don't need a bunch of itchy 11 year olds! So I found alternate spots. Then the river overflowed and a good section of the trails have been under water ever since. Still not dry as of last week and I'm sure the heavy rains on Monday didn't help.<br>
<br>
So this week I decided to use Hudsonville Nature Center instead. I've been out there 3 times this week scouting box locations and writing clues. Trying to keep the flow from one box to the next nice & smooth so they aren't jumping all over from one side of the park to the other, and back. Everything was good Tues & Wed nights. Tonight, I went to finish up writing the clues, and now there are a couple trees down blocking the trail. Not tree trunks & limbs, but the big branchy leafy part of the trees. Plus, there's caution tape up all around that area, including blocking off a couple bridges. No close alternate trails to get to that area, and that's leading to one of the boxes. ((sigh)) I was able to make my way through the downed trees and blocked off area. The bridges are still stable (though one seems to have been moved by workers?). Hopefully the workers will finish what they are doing tomorrow and we'll be free to use that area on Saturday. Provided it's not storming at the time of the party, LOL!<br>
<br>
If you made it this far, thanks for letting me vent. The upside is that after Saturday, you locals will have 3 more boxes to go find! I'll put the clues online after the party.<br>
