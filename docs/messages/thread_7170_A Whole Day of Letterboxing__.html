  I started letterboxing 2 years ago, and probably have around 50 finds.  I usually tote my 4 year old along with me.

Well, as for today, I have a sitter, and the day off work, and my sister and I have plotted a course a bit further away than I would go with my boy.  I am very excited to get out there! I love my boy, and I love that he likes to go with me, but I also love the fact that today - for the whole day - I get to go with someone who doesn't start whining about going back to the playground we passed on the way in!!  (At least I hope she doesn't!)<br/>

Happy boxing!!<br/>

I know what you mean about not being able to letterbox as much as you might like. This summer I only got to go letterboxing a couple of times.... family commitments, uncooperative weather (thunder/lightening)when I did have the time,so when nonboxing hubby suggested we go on a mini letterboxing vacation I jumped on it.  LOL  <br/>
<br/>
We just got back from spending four days around the Indianapolis area. It was mainly a driveby letterboxing vacation (I wanted to have some seriously inked fingers!) and we had a great time complete with picnics, bike rides, a little hiking when the opportunity presented itself and exploring a really cool big city.  Thanks to all the Indiana carvers and planters who made our trip so enjoyable.<br/>
