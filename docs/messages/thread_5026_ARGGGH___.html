                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well today I had my friend and co-worker "krait" re-carve the Capricorn stamp for the Signs of the Zodiac series, and when I got home from work I mounted the stamp and assembled the replacement box.  NamVet and I loaded our two shelties into the Prius and drove off to the conservation area to find a new and hopefully safer hiding place for Capricorn.<br/>
<br/>
We were walking down a trail through a grassy field when I glanced down at Silvie and saw that she had somehow picked up some small brown burrs or stickers on her white legs and chest.  When I crouched down to pull them off, I realized to my horror that these were not burrs but at least a dozen TICKS swarming on her, each one intent on burrowing through all that Sheltie fur down to the skin.  I immediately began pulling them off (I was wearing leather gloves) and naturally they turned their attention to ME and I was soon frantically trying to shake them off my arm.<br/>
<br/>
Now nothing can turn NamVet into a horrified quivering mass of jelly faster than a tick - and here there were over a dozen of them.  He immediately checked HIS dog and found that Harry had his share of them too.  We pulled off all that we could find and then cravenly turned tail and beat a hasty retreat back to the parking lot as fast as we could.  Back at the parking lot we re-checked the dogs, removing yet more ticks, and then inspected each other and found one on my glove.  I took off the glove and STOMPED it and that spawn of the devil was still alive and wiggling all those legs menacingly!<br/>
<br/>
We leaped into the car and took off for home, NamVet still shuddering.  As I was racing down the road (why does one feel one has to SPEED AWAY from ticks???) I felt something crawl out of my hair and start down the back of my neck.  I quickly grabbed it and flung it out the window.  Back home we re-checked the dogs with the proverbial fine-tooth comb.  All seems well . . . <br/>
<br/>
Capricorn will be re-hidden at a DIFFERENT LOCATION . . . when NamVet has sufficiently recovered and is willing to go boxing again :)<br/>

It worked so well that we were hoping he would get more ticks so we could do this <br/>
remarkably easy trick to remove them....Tiptoe actually has a thing for insects, bugs etc.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which..we replaced "Cicada Mania" today..the box had been burnt (actually <br/>
looked like a lightening strike to a nearby tree had caused a natural burn of the general <br/>
area), the handmade log was in very bad shape as had been reported...but the stamp was <br/>
fine.  We brought a new box, generic log, new ziplocks and the little cicada is back in <br/>
business!  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, no one broke into our car in the parking lot!  Oh, that's right, I forgot... WE are <br/>
the letterboxers that plant boxes as bait and then wait, days, weeks, months, years if we <br/>
have to for some unsuspecting person to get out of their car fumbling with lots of printed <br/>
off clues thus identifying themselves as letterboxers so that as soon as they round the <br/>
corner we can break into their cars!  We haven't had much luck lately in the parking lots, <br/>
so it was really a good thing we came in 2nd place in the Bingo game.  Spring Chick was <br/>
so generous that we can live a crime free letterboxing life for at least a year!<br/>
