 Nothing going to or from gatherings but I got a metal arrowhead in my nearly brand new truck tire at a park in Rushville Indiana and then there was the time A Deer destroyed my little red truck as I was returning from some boxes.<br/>

Friday night, PoPoBullyGrl accidentally slammed her daughter's hand <br/>
in the van door as we were getting back into it after <br/>
dinner!!  Yikes! It was a lot of drama and hurt quite a bit, but <br/>
fortunately no real damage!  A little bruised.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night, in the freezing cold camp showers, I dropped my <br/>
shampoo bottle, bent down to pick it up, stood up and smashed the top <br/>
of my head on the metal faucet/soap dish contraption!  OWWWW!  As if <br/>
my screams from the cold water weren't enough for the neighboring <br/>
campers! LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the minor sunburn, and raccoon incidents previously <br/>
mentioned, we didn't have any "downsides".  We got completely lost <br/>
looking for Barbie and thought we might be stuck in the woods all <br/>
night with no dinner or water, but we managed to find our way back to <br/>
the parking lot, even if we didn't find the stamps!<br/>
<br/>
(This isn't a gathering mishap, but I just slammed the same spot on <br/>
my head into the door frame of my dad's van when I was getting back <br/>
into it.  So, I double-hurt my head!)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, Aina tried to eat someone every day of the weekend except Sunday (she's usually good, but she can get fear-aggressive in the car apparently...next time she comes with us we'll have to remember to be sure to roll the back windows up enough she can't get her head out).  But at least on Sunday she let several people pet her on the trail!<br/>
Then there was Sunday night.  I think we were the only ones left in that part of the campground.  Even the geocachers in the big RV in site M10 had left when we got back to camp.  It was kind of eerie and strangely quiet after being full all weekend.  We bought enough firewood to get a good bonfire going and even scavenged some wood from the empty fire pits in the M loop.  Then it started to rain, then let up a bit, and then it poured!  We found out that our tent is still waterproof (mostly, the seams around the windows need resealing).  Around midnight (local time) the thunder was so loud that we decided we'd be better off breaking camp and wasting a few hours at Cracker Barrel.  So we started packing our junk inside the tent and waited for the rain to let up.  As soon as it did, we got everything else together and broke camp at 1am.  Then we were off to Cracker Barrel, which was open 24 hours last time I ate at one, only to find that they had JUST closed and wouldn't be<br/>
 opening again until 6am!  So, with only about 4 hours of sleep, we decided that we should skip the boxes we had planned on for the morning (the ones by the dog park :( and a grail box in the Dayton area) and drove straight home, bypassing all of the construction traffic along the way.  Ironically, by the time 6am Eastern rolled around, we had literally just crossed the Illinois state border and the local Cracker Barrel was still closed for another hour.  We kept looking for an IHOP or something similar along the way, but breakfast just wasn't to be.  Pulled into the driveway at 6am Central time and collapsed until later this morning.<br/>
<br/>
Even with the rain and the cranky dog it was a wonderful weekend!  We had a great time thanks to our wonderful hosts and all the great letterboxers who attended.<br/>

Jenco98 found a tick crawling on her and promptly tossed it out of my car<br/>
at the Speedway we stopped at before coming home.  Gas was ONLY<br/>
3.149/gallon.  Not exactly a MISadventure, but a memorable experience.<br/>

Probably not.  We were so tired Saturday night that we weren't very persuasive.  Wandering Dragon and her brood did an excellent job of explaining the sport to them though, so perhaps they will check it out anyway.<br/>
I also discovered a quasi-misadventure this morning while folding the laundry.  FD had thrown all of the clothes, blankets, and towels from the weekend into the wash when we got home.  I pulled them out of the drier this morning and started folding only to discover our signature stamp in amongst the clothes!  It had been in my pants pocket and went through the washing machine AND the drier!!  It's very clean now.  And not too much worse the wear...parts of the border have broken off, but I haven't yet decided that it's damaged enough to be worth recarving.  And despite the cloth it was wrapped in being a very different color than it was before going into the  wash, none of the clothes seem to have picked up any stray ink!<br/>
