AAARGH!  Finally, a general word is called and I didn't pick it, <br>
because I don't know what it means in relationship to <br>
letterboxing.  LOL Figures.<br>

Thanks!  I did read that at some point, but didn't remember what it <br>
was.  I knew what an Easter Egg was in relation to movies, computer <br>
stuff, etc.  I thought it might mean something like that, but wasn't sure.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the refresher course!<br>
