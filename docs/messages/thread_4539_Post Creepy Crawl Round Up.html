be 60 degrees and sunny all day. It was perfect weather for us to <br/>
gather up all the stamps from Saturdays gathering. Bali did all the <br/>
wonderful clues for the gathering and we got to do them on Sunday to <br/>
pick them up, so we could see all the wonderful tomestone art in the <br/>
cemeteries. I warned you all... as TrailTroll said on her most <br/>
spectacular dessert "We're soggy from Double Dragon's curse. The <br/>
forecast was bad, the weather is worse!!" Oh well, at least WI Hiker <br/>
and Martini Man got some excellent weather for there final day of <br/>
boxing in MI.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to give a special thank you to Bali, without her attention <br/>
to details and great planing skills this gathering would not have <br/>
been as great of a success as it was.<br/>
<br/>
As always it was so great to see new faces along with some old <br/>
friends! We hope to see all of you in our box's log books sometime in <br/>
the future! We also want to thank you all for making a monetary <br/>
contribution to the gathering which allowed us to pay for the food, <br/>
prizes, gas, and all the rest that goes on with putting one of these <br/>
events together. Thank you all again for coming, and we hope you had <br/>
a great time!!<br/>
Double Dragon<br/>
