I've heard on the AB group that people cut books into shapes and do stuff<br>
like that with power tools.  I look forward to seeing your technique.<br>
<br>
I was trying to think of how to do something in a library without having the<br>
staff in on it, and also figured it would be too troublesome to proceed.<br>

Kathi,<br>
I've done quite a bit with books and niches.<br>
Although I considered using one for a letterbox container in a<br>
library, my plans were slowed when librarian acquaintences cautioned<br>
me that the books are regularly moved within a libray's shelving<br>
systems. That, of course, would preclude a successful and secret<br>
placement without the "intruder" book being detected by staff.<br>
So that plan went to the back burner.<br>
Nevertheless, I have made many "hollowed-out" books and developed a<br>
rather interesting method of removing a major part of the page block<br>
without using a craft knife.<br>
I'll bring some samples to the gathering, although the method is not<br>
one that can be done without special power tools. And it does not<br>
lend itself to conventional book altering.<br>
