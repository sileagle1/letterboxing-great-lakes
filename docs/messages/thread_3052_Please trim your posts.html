course, then you also have to fill in the subject and To: address, but it's <br/>
a way to only get the text you want from the original email.<br/>

<br/>
When you reply via mail rather than on the site, the original msg just ends up as a file <br/>
attachment, but we will all see it. <br/>
You will find the file attachment up above the blue box for your new mesg. It has a <br/>
paperclip icon. Just click on the arrow next to it it and choose the "remove" button. I guess <br/>
if you want to leave a portion of the original msg like I did above, you have to copy paste <br/>
before you reply. (I am replying from the site).<br/>
Hope this helps the new Mac users.<br/>

Change your Message Preference  to TRADITIONAL rather than the "New <br/>

like about the New and Improved stuff is the Digest - it is great, <br/>
but otherwise, forget it!  On the groups that I get individual emails <br/>
from, I have changed it to traditional.  Even the groups that I have <br/>
digest on, if I think I will be replying regularly to the group, I <br/>
change the digest to Traditional.  Just something to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, being on Digest has its pitfalls and remembering to <br/>
Snip is one of them.  At one time or another, we all forget - and <br/>
sometimes, people are not aware that there are a ton of emails below <br/>
that were not snipped.  I am guessing for many of us, this is not the <br/>
only Yahoo group we are on and therefore, we are used to working <br/>
around it.  You soooo do not want to know how many groups I am on, <br/>
LOL!   Anyway,  I hope the first paragraph is helpful.<br/>
