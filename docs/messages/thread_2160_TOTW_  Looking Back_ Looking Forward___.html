  My first year letterboxing!  It was all great to me!  It was really fun though squeezing in time to find some boxes while on vacation in California (on the way to the airport to fly home).  Then there was the time I was boxing in Libertyville and the forest preserve closed while I was still hiking back to the car, and the "Forest Preserve Police" were waiting for me at my car when I got back and they gave me a ticket  :-O<br/>
  And last but not least was finding CMoon's Forest Grove Lane box to make F100!<br/>
<br/>
  Looking Forward:<br/>
  There are some boxes in the Myakka State Park in Florida near where my parents are retired.  I LOVE that park and I would like to go back, do some hiking and canoing, and find the boxes there!<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
