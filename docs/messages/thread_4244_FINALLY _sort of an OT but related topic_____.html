some of you are impacted or interested:<br/>

&gt;HEY VA! HAVE YOU HEARD? July 12, 2007<br/>
&gt;VA has made it easier for next of kin and loved ones of honorably<br/>
&gt;discharged deceased veterans to request Presidential Memorial<br/>
&gt;Certificates, engraved paper certificates bearing the President's<br/>
&gt;signature that express the country's grateful recognition of the<br/>
&gt;veteran's service in the United States Armed Forces.  A new request<br/>
form<br/>
&gt;has been established and can be accessed online at<br/>
&gt;http://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA40-0247.pdf<br/>
<http: pdf="" va="" va40-0247.pdf="" vaforms="" www.va.gov=""> . The Presidential<br/>
Memorial<br/>
&gt;Certificate program was initiated in March 1962 by President John F.<br/>
&gt;Kennedy and has been continued by all subsequent presidents.  Eligible<br/>
&gt;recipients include the next of kin and loved ones of honorably<br/>
discharged<br/>
&gt;deceased veterans.  More than one certificate may be provided if<br/>
&gt;requested. VA's National Cemetery Administration processes more than<br/>
&gt;400,000 certificate requests each year.  More than 11 million<br/>
&gt;Presidential Memorial Certificates have been issued since the program<br/>
&gt;began. More information about the Presidential Memorial Certificate<br/>
&gt;program can be found at http://www.cem.va.gov/cem/pmc.asp<br/>

&gt; I second Hales Angels' comments, Hart x6! You put a tremendous amount<br/>
&gt; of thought and care into every word and it shows! This is an<br/>
&gt; outstanding tribute to our Vietnam Vets! I really hope I get to Iowa<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; some point---but if not, and you CAN make it to the All-Military Event<br/>
&gt; on November 10th (OH)---I'd LOVE to have you bring those stamps with<br/>
&gt; you!! (shameless hint!) =)<br/>
