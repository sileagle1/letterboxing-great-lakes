<br>
 <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I've received some not-so-good news on the topic of<br>
proper placement and land usage in State Parks.  I was contacted last<br>
week by a (very friendly) employee at a Michigan State Park where we<br>
have multiple letterboxes planted.  She let me know that there is a new<br>
policy on geo-caching at Michigan State Parks.  Essentially, they've<br>
decided that a Use Permit must be filed for each letterbox or other<br>
physical object placed in a park, and a $35 fee must be paid.   The<br>
letterbox can remain in place for a maximum of 3 months.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
This is quite a bit different than the existing State Park practices<br>
which are shown on the Michigan Geo-Caching website.  Perhaps this<br>
policy has not been communicated to many people yet.   Even though I was<br>
disappointed to hear about it, I was glad that this particular State<br>
Park employee brought it to my attention in such a friendly, positive<br>
way.  That will give us a chance to remove our boxes the next time we're<br>
in the area; perhaps we'll be able to find a non-State-Park location for<br>
them in the future.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Below, I have pasted the message from State Park Headquarters, which the<br>
employee forwarded to me.  She also forwarded the 2 documents mentioned:<br>
the new policy, and a sample Use Permit.  I'll place those 2 documents<br>
in the GLK group's Yahoo! database for anyone who is interested.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
My reason for bringing this up, is not to start a flame war on why this<br>
is or isn't a good policy. in fact, I was very excited to see this new<br>
Great Lakes Group was started, since I know this group will be able to<br>
have a much calmer discussion about such topics!  But I  wanted to alert<br>
you all to it, in case other State Parks don't take the time to e-mail<br>
or call you, like they did for me.   As you'll see in the policy, they<br>
have the authority to remove "unpermitted" boxes as of 6/1/2004, and I<br>
would hate to see any of you lose the stamps and log books that you have<br>
out there.<br>

Attached is a new policy addressing geocaching on PRB lands. This is a<br>
new treasure-hunting type "hobby" made possible through the use of GPS<br>
units and the internet. In a nutshell, a geocacher places a container of<br>
interesting items (?) in the park, then posts hints and GPS coordinates<br>
on the geocaching website. Geocaching "hunters" look up these items on<br>
the internet then go look for the cache. Typically, the finder will sign<br>
the required log book and may exchange some items. We already have a<br>
number of these geocaches on our lands.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Another form of this activity is known as "letter-boxing". While this<br>
policy refers to geocaching, any activity which involves the placement<br>
of items on PRB lands for others to find would be covered by this<br>
policy.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Virtual caching involves the posting of hints and GPS coordinates to<br>
direct "hunters" to an existing feature. It may be a sign, a waterfall<br>
or other natural feature. There is no actual placement of materials on<br>
site and there is no Use Permit fee charged for such virtual caches,<br>
although a Use Permit is still required. Virtual caches are preferred<br>
over physical caches (and there is a financial incentive, too!).<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
This policy is to take immediate effect. A sample Use Permit is also<br>
included to provide guidance. Please distribute to your respective<br>
units.<br>
