this park when I saw some gorgeous blank note cards at Schwartz<br/>
bookstore. I thought to myself "Wow, what a beautiful park. That looks<br/>
almost like Lake Park. Oh! It IS Lake Park..." I bought the bookmark. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Lake Park is one of those urban treasures that you may not<br/>
even know about. I've been told the designer also designed Central<br/>
Park in New York. His name is Olmsted. Here's a website discussing the<br/>
park's history: http://www.lakeparkfriends.org/history.shtml  It has a<br/>
lighthouse, statues of lions and other folk. I think you can play<br/>
golf, there are concerts, it's near the lake (duh) and near UWM.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to break any rules... but there may or may not be a very<br/>
nice letterbox series there. I'm just sayin'. (IS that rule breaking?)<br/>
