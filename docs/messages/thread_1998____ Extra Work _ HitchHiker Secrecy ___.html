If I had known that the owner of the HH I picked up had no intentions of ever registering it with www.letterboxing.org or www.atlasquest.com I would never have taken it with me. I also don't see what's the big deal about letting everyone know where a HH is located. The reason I mentioned it was to let others know so that it will speed up its journey. Isn't the objective to help keep HHs moving along and one LBoxer helps another. Especially, with winter approaching and many searchers hiberating for the next few months. I will be taking the HH back where I found it later today and will remove my entries from the little journal.<br/>

What's the big secret about HHs when there isn't anything extra special about the stamp or journal compared to a traditional LBox. The HHs I've come across are ordinary and not as nice as some of the traditional LBoxes I've found. The people that are out searching for LBoxes where HHs may be hidden are not part of an exclusive group. It could be a newbie, a child or a seasoned professional that happens upon a HH. If you don't want the public~AtlasQuest.com and Letterboxing.org~to know the whereabout's of a HH like "Christmas Swish" then it should not be placed in a LBox that just anyone can find. Perhaps a treasure like "Christmas Swish" should only be placed in exclusive LBoxes that are not public knowledge via www.atlasquest.com or www.letterboxing.org     <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of course you are entitled to make your own choices as to how you wish to participate in the game/hobby/sport of letterboxing, as is everyone else.  From what I hear you saying, I don't think that you quite understand the nature of a HitchHiker.  Even though they are comprised of a stamp and a log book as a regular, planted-with-clues letterbox, HH are not traditional letterboxes, rather they are created, planted and moved from one letterbox to another as little "surprises" for finders.  It is not that they are exclusive or meant only for certain people, rather they are meant for anyone -- as a surprise!  To many [most] letterboxers this is an enjoyable aspect of the game -- to seek out a letterbox and unexpectedly happen upon a HH, a special bonus left by the previous finder.  To specifically state where you have placed a HH takes away this element of surprise for the next finder.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise because HitchHikers are not traditional letterboxes and because they are supposed to have an element of secrecy about them, many people choose not to list them at AtlasQuest or letterboxing.org, preferring to keep their location and sometimes even their identity a mystery.  As a previous poster pointed out, letterboxing.org is first and foremost a clue site and HH do not have clues so there really is no reason to list them there.  It is only very recently that the ability to log finds was added to the site features, and even more recent is the ability to list HH there.  Many people choose not to use these features, feeling they detract from the focus of the site as a clue repository.  Perhaps once you have been involved with letterboxing for a bit longer, you will better understand the subtle nuances of the game and that secrecy and mystery can be very intriguing and enjoyable aspects of the game.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, you are free to play however you wish and if it is your prefence only to search for boxes registered at both AQ and letterboxing.org, you will certainly have many boxes to look for, but you will no doubt be cheating yourself of some wonderful boxes.  There are actually many letterboxes that are not listed on either AtlasQuest or letterboxing.org, or any other public site.  They are known as WOM (word-of-mouth) boxes and clues are passed verbally or via e-mail, etc. from one letterboxer to another.  Many of these boxes are quite sought after and contain the work of some very talented carvers.  It is their secrecy that makes them special -- to be given a clue to one of these boxes is like being given the key to a special treasure.<br/>
