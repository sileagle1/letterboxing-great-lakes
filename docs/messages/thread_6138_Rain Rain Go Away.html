Not sure if it was the flu (had a fever) or just a cold (also had sore throat). But she seems to be on the mend and will probably be full of energy come this weekend. I think Saturday will be a bust with the expected rain. But Sunday is looking to be very nice. I'm hoping Lulu &amp; I can get back out to Grand River Park and finish off the remaining boxes from last weekend's West Michigan fall gathering. I think we got all but 4. Plus the one permanent elusive one that we can never find, but that we heard through the grapevine, is still out there.<br/>
