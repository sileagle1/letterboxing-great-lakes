I noticed there are only about 5 groups that have listed where they are<br>
staying for the big regional event on June 5. If anyone else wants to add<br>
their name to the list, just add a record to the database:<br>

We will actually be in town the weekend of the 12/13 of April. I have a<br>
conference on Sunday and Monday to attend... but we are hoping to do some<br>
boxing on Friday and Saturday, including the pi series in West Bend (my<br>
hometown) and your New Year's box. Hoping to plant a box while we are down<br>
there too! :) But! We would love to have an impromptu get-together! We miss<br>
our Milwaukee lbxg pals, and it would be super great to see some of you<br>
again. Saturday evening would probably work the best for us, if you think it<br>
might work for you. If not, no worries. We will keep everyone posted as to<br>
what we are up to. ;)<br>
<br>
I have to write a paper on Wednesday... and then work at the desk. Which<br>
means the whole 73 degree day I will be stuck INDOORS! Forecast for our MN<br>
Easter weather- Rain. *scowls* I really am passionate about the field I'm<br>
getting into, and I know it will pay off some day (I continue to rehearse to<br>
myself) but sometimes... I just don't like that Grad school interferes with<br>
all my opportunities for play time!!<br>
<br>
Oh I'm such a complainer tonight!<br>
<br>
Still going to Easter hunting anyway. Rain. or. shine. hehehehehehe! Not for<br>
eggs tho, or course! Happy Hunting to all of you as well!!!<br>

I agree. We'd love to make it down for WI or IL events, whenever possible.<br>
We will actually be in town the weekend of the 12/13 of April. I have a<br>
conference on Sunday and Monday to attend... but we are hoping to do some<br>
boxing on Friday and Saturday, including the pi series in West Bend (my<br>
hometown) and your New Year's box. Hoping to plant a box while we are down<br>
there too! :) But! We would love to have an impromptu get-together! We miss<br>
our Milwaukee lbxg pals, and it would be super great to see some of you<br>
again. Saturday evening would probably work the best for us, if you think it<br>
might work for you. If not, no worries. We will keep everyone posted as to<br>
what we are up to. ;)<br>
<br>
I have to write a paper on Wednesday... and then work at the desk. Which<br>
means the whole 73 degree day I will be stuck INDOORS! Forecast for our MN<br>
Easter weather- Rain. *scowls* I really am passionate about the field I'm<br>
getting into, and I know it will pay off some day (I continue to rehearse to<br>
myself) but sometimes... I just don't like that Grad school interferes with<br>
all my opportunities for play time!!<br>
<br>
Oh I'm such a complainer tonight!<br>
<br>
Still going to Easter hunting anyway. Rain. or. shine. hehehehehehe! Not for<br>
eggs tho, or course! Happy Hunting to all of you as well!!!<br>

Wihi (and others)... We will be staying in Mke Saturday night and Sunday<br>
night for sure. We may or may not stay in WB on Friday night. Trying to make<br>
sure we have a place for our dog. Hard to find a sitter for so many days<br>
when we are in a new community of people. I have the annual Wisconsin<br>
Association for Marriage and Family Therapy 2010 conference to attend on<br>
Sunday and Monday in Waukesha.<br>
<br>
It looks like I have a free dinner time on Sunday after 5:30 but my guess is<br>
that my cohort and other MFT's are going to do dinner together, so it might<br>
not be the best time... otherwise Friday might be a possibility... or even<br>
Monday night. (I'm not sure when we need to head back... if it will be<br>
Monday after the conference or Tuesday morning...<br>
<br>
Thoughts?<br>
