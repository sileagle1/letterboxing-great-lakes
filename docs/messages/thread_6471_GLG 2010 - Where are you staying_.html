We will actually be in town the weekend of the 12/13 of April. I have a<br/>
conference on Sunday and Monday to attend... but we are hoping to do some<br/>
boxing on Friday and Saturday, including the pi series in West Bend (my<br/>
hometown) and your New Year's box. Hoping to plant a box while we are down<br/>
there too! :) But! We would love to have an impromptu get-together! We miss<br/>
our Milwaukee lbxg pals, and it would be super great to see some of you<br/>
again. Saturday evening would probably work the best for us, if you think it<br/>
might work for you. If not, no worries. We will keep everyone posted as to<br/>
what we are up to. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have to write a paper on Wednesday... and then work at the desk. Which<br/>
means the whole 73 degree day I will be stuck INDOORS! Forecast for our MN<br/>
Easter weather- Rain. *scowls* I really am passionate about the field I'm<br/>
getting into, and I know it will pay off some day (I continue to rehearse to<br/>
myself) but sometimes... I just don't like that Grad school interferes with<br/>
all my opportunities for play time!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh I'm such a complainer tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Still going to Easter hunting anyway. Rain. or. shine. hehehehehehe! Not for<br/>
eggs tho, or course! Happy Hunting to all of you as well!!!<br/>

I agree. We'd love to make it down for WI or IL events, whenever possible.<br/>
We will actually be in town the weekend of the 12/13 of April. I have a<br/>
conference on Sunday and Monday to attend... but we are hoping to do some<br/>
boxing on Friday and Saturday, including the pi series in West Bend (my<br/>
hometown) and your New Year's box. Hoping to plant a box while we are down<br/>
there too! :) But! We would love to have an impromptu get-together! We miss<br/>
our Milwaukee lbxg pals, and it would be super great to see some of you<br/>
again. Saturday evening would probably work the best for us, if you think it<br/>
might work for you. If not, no worries. We will keep everyone posted as to<br/>
what we are up to. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I have to write a paper on Wednesday... and then work at the desk. Which<br/>
means the whole 73 degree day I will be stuck INDOORS! Forecast for our MN<br/>
Easter weather- Rain. *scowls* I really am passionate about the field I'm<br/>
getting into, and I know it will pay off some day (I continue to rehearse to<br/>
myself) but sometimes... I just don't like that Grad school interferes with<br/>
all my opportunities for play time!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh I'm such a complainer tonight!<br/>
<br/>
Still going to Easter hunting anyway. Rain. or. shine. hehehehehehe! Not for<br/>
eggs tho, or course! Happy Hunting to all of you as well!!!<br/>

&gt; Oh, that is TOO bad! Hopefully there will be some other events you CAN<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; this year. I know you're in MN now, but it would great to see you back at<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; WI or IL gathering. Let us know if you head back down this way and perhaps<br/>
&gt; we can have an impromptu get-together.<br/>

&gt; P.S. I just found out that it is supposed to be in the low to mid-70s from<br/>
&gt; Wednesday through at least Easter Sunday!!! Whooppeee!!!!! I hope everyone<br/>
&gt; has a chance to get out to do some planting, finding or box maintenance<br/>
&gt; during the unseasonably WARM weather!<br/>

&gt; *cries* Eheheheheheheheheheheheheh!!!!! *pouts* Lighthouse Keeper and I<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; been looking forward to this event SINCE WE LEARNED OF IT! Which was<br/>
&gt; like...<br/>
&gt; last summer. And guess what?! I have one single summer class and it's<br/>
&gt; primarily online... except for 2 weekend 8hour classes... the first of<br/>
&gt; which<br/>
&gt; just so happens to be on JUNE FIFTH! *hangs her head in dire<br/>
&gt; disappointment* I'm soooo bummed about it! *sigh* I mean, I know this is<br/>
&gt; only one year out of the rest of our lives of boxing, but this is the<br/>
FIRST<br/>
&gt; year for us. Oh well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We hope to at least carve stamps to send... but keep your fingers crossed.<br/>
&gt; We had some issues with paypal in trying to order some carving materials,<br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; we will be getting them really late. And it's going to be a rush to get<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; carved and sent in on time. Wait... do we need to send them in by April 6<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; May 6. I've been thinking int was April, but now I think it might be May.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway... that's my pitty rant. :) You all better have a phenomenal event<br/>
&gt; for us! I'll be thinking of you while in class!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; with love,<br/>

add<br/>

Wihi (and others)... We will be staying in Mke Saturday night and Sunday<br/>
night for sure. We may or may not stay in WB on Friday night. Trying to make<br/>
sure we have a place for our dog. Hard to find a sitter for so many days<br/>
when we are in a new community of people. I have the annual Wisconsin<br/>

Sunday and Monday in Waukesha.<br/>

It looks like I have a free dinner time on Sunday after 5:30 but my guess is<br/>
that my cohort and other MFT's are going to do dinner together, so it might<br/>
not be the best time... otherwise Friday might be a possibility... or even<br/>
