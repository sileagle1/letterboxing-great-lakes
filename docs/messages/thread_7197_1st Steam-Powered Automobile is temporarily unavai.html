<br/>
"found a box and your card was in it. do you want it back?"<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm... this didn't sound good!  I sent an email back:<br/>
<br/>
"What box and where?  Do you have the box or the card?"<br/>
<br/>
Here is the somewhat humorous response:<br/>
<br/>
"found the box in cliff side park along lake Michigan in Racine wi,<br/>
don't know how to tell what box it is , says its not a geocache!<br/>
I am just a old guy that walks the woods, looks like its been lost about a year, the last stamp is from 9-2010<br/>
I have the box at my house, I can put it back about were I found it or send it to you.<br/>
thanks R"<br/>
<br/>
We're planning to be in the Racine area on Sunday, so hopefully I'll be able to reclaim the box and get it back in place in the near future.<br/>
