Although it won't be as much fun as attending the actual event :), I appreciate the opportunity to look for the boxes.  Hopefully I'll be able to  make it to my first event sometime in the near future.  I'm looking forward to putting faces together with trail names and signature stamps.<br/>

Thanks again,<br/>

Yesterday was a beautiful day to search for the Viva! Grand Haven boxes.  I must honestly say I don't think my team would have faired very well in the points standing.  I had to kkep telling my crew (daughter and boxer by marriage hubby) to  "stop playing", "speed it up" :)  They laughingly told me "It's not a real race for us!"  And can you believe they actually wanted to stop for some nourishment during our excursion?! LOL  Oh well, so much for getting them all in one day!  We were able to collect 11 of the 14 boxes and just for the fun of it, we took some of the pictures suggested.  Thanks again spring chick and doglvrs for the opportunity to search for these letterboxes.  The carves were great and the search took us to parks we hadn't had a chance to explore before.  We will definitely be returning to these great parks to explore more; especially Coast Guard Park.<br/>
