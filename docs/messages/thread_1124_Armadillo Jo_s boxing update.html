missing or buried under a fallen tree. Regardless,<br/>
it's retired. Thanks to everyone who found it...and<br/>
next time I won't plant in a 100 year flood plain! <br/>
<br/>
Magnetic Park box will be going back to it's home this<br/>
coming week. <br/>
<br/>
Power of the Force was planted in Indianapolis today.<br/>
Clues will be posted on LBNA and Altas Quest tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Trail of Death is indeed alive and well after<br/>
numerous missing reports. The clues have been updated<br/>
with compass bearings to make directions more concise.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Angry Woodchuck of the Tippecanoe, Forgotten Park,<br/>
and Reading, 'Riting, 'Rithmatic boxes are all alive<br/>
and well as of 3/30/05. <br/>
<br/>
Today I went to Indy and found 7 lovely boxes in some<br/>
of the most beautiful and amazing areas of<br/>
Indianapolis! Thanks to Trail Mail Junkie, Artdog,<br/>
Fever Fan, and Speedsquare for the adventures! I will<br/>
be contacting each of you tomorrow with updates! <br/>

<br/>
ps: Catch the Brass Ring and Chuck Taylor have not yet<br/>
been planted. I will update the list when they are. <br/>
