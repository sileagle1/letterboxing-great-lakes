OH! It feels so good to be out and about boxin' again.  I took some<br>
time around the teacher conferences today to go check up on my<br>
Creative Writing, Watery Grave, and Squished Pennies boxes.  All are<br>
in good shape and the last two now have camoflauge tape on them. <br>
There seems to be alot of new letterboxers in WI.  I hope they can<br>
make it to the gathering!<br>
<br>
For you train lovers out there, when I went to check on the Squished<br>
pennies box, I found there weren't many left, so I put 10 pennies on<br>
the track closest to the box and waited.  To my excitement I heard a<br>
train approaching soon and looked forward to many squished pennies. <br>
But NO!  It was on the wrong side - on the other track!  Argh!  So<br>
then I had to leave and go back to the conf.  I returned a couple of<br>
hours later and found all ten pennies still sitting on the track<br>
unsquished!  I couldn't believe it!  So, I took out 10 more pennies<br>
and put them on the other track, thinking I got to win one way or<br>
another.  Then I sat back and rested on the rocks over the box and<br>
waited for one of the many trains that travel through to squish my<br>
pennies.  I waited for 30 minutes, then decided to stroll through the<br>
woods some, since no train had come.  After waiting an hour, I was<br>
just about to give up, when finally a train came on the far track!  It<br>
was Amtrak passing through going to MN.  The train quickly passed and<br>
I jumped out and started looking for my pennies.  Only one was<br>
squished!  The others had just fallen off before being squished!  Then<br>
as I'm collecting my unsquished pennies, I hear another train coming<br>
on the same track - just behind the Amtrak!  So I quickly replaced my<br>
unsquished pennies and went back to my observation spot.  I was having<br>
so much fun watching the second train pass that I suddenly jumped out<br>
of my shoes when another train came roaring through from the other<br>
direction on the closer track!  Never heard it coming.  "Woohoo!!" I<br>
thought, "I've got me 20 squished pennies in one sitting!"  After they<br>
passed, I spent a few minutes searching for the pennies and had only<br>
had a chance to find a few when two more trains came through - just<br>
minutes after the other two!  Unfortunately, one of the trains stopped<br>
to layover and prevented me from going back to the letterbox directly.<br>
 So I had to walk west down the track to the end of the train to get<br>
around it.  On the way, yet another train came by!  Finally I was able<br>
to get back to the box and place the 8 new squished pennies into the<br>
box.  The other 12 must've went to "Squished Penny Heaven".  (There<br>
MUST be a place - right Czeltic Girl?)  Anyway, as I was heading home,<br>
yet another train came through minutes after I left.  So after waiting<br>
an hour with no trains, I get 7 within 40 minutes!  WEEEEEEEE!<br>

Well, most of the pennies I squish don't get thrown too far, <br>
(that'd be a pretty cool machine, though), but I've lost a few <br>
I've squished on the tracks. And I have no doubt there's a <br>
squished penny heaven. :-)<br>
