OH! It feels so good to be out and about boxin' again.  I took some<br/>
time around the teacher conferences today to go check up on my<br/>
Creative Writing, Watery Grave, and Squished Pennies boxes.  All are<br/>
in good shape and the last two now have camoflauge tape on them. <br/>
There seems to be alot of new letterboxers in WI.  I hope they can<br/>
make it to the gathering!<br/>
<br/>
For you train lovers out there, when I went to check on the Squished<br/>
pennies box, I found there weren't many left, so I put 10 pennies on<br/>
the track closest to the box and waited.  To my excitement I heard a<br/>
train approaching soon and looked forward to many squished pennies. <br/>
But NO!  It was on the wrong side - on the other track!  Argh!  So<br/>
then I had to leave and go back to the conf.  I returned a couple of<br/>
hours later and found all ten pennies still sitting on the track<br/>
unsquished!  I couldn't believe it!  So, I took out 10 more pennies<br/>
and put them on the other track, thinking I got to win one way or<br/>
another.  Then I sat back and rested on the rocks over the box and<br/>
waited for one of the many trains that travel through to squish my<br/>
pennies.  I waited for 30 minutes, then decided to stroll through the<br/>
woods some, since no train had come.  After waiting an hour, I was<br/>
just about to give up, when finally a train came on the far track!  It<br/>
was Amtrak passing through going to MN.  The train quickly passed and<br/>
I jumped out and started looking for my pennies.  Only one was<br/>
squished!  The others had just fallen off before being squished!  Then<br/>
as I'm collecting my unsquished pennies, I hear another train coming<br/>
on the same track - just behind the Amtrak!  So I quickly replaced my<br/>
unsquished pennies and went back to my observation spot.  I was having<br/>
so much fun watching the second train pass that I suddenly jumped out<br/>
of my shoes when another train came roaring through from the other<br/>
direction on the closer track!  Never heard it coming.  "Woohoo!!" I<br/>
thought, "I've got me 20 squished pennies in one sitting!"  After they<br/>
passed, I spent a few minutes searching for the pennies and had only<br/>
had a chance to find a few when two more trains came through - just<br/>
minutes after the other two!  Unfortunately, one of the trains stopped<br/>
to layover and prevented me from going back to the letterbox directly.<br/>
 So I had to walk west down the track to the end of the train to get<br/>
around it.  On the way, yet another train came by!  Finally I was able<br/>
to get back to the box and place the 8 new squished pennies into the<br/>
box.  The other 12 must've went to "Squished Penny Heaven".  (There<br/>
MUST be a place - right Czeltic Girl?)  Anyway, as I was heading home,<br/>
yet another train came through minutes after I left.  So after waiting<br/>
an hour with no trains, I get 7 within 40 minutes!  WEEEEEEEE!<br/>

Well, most of the pennies I squish don't get thrown too far, <br/>
(that'd be a pretty cool machine, though), but I've lost a few <br/>
I've squished on the tracks. And I have no doubt there's a <br/>
squished penny heaven. :-)<br/>
