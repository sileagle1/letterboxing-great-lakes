                    <div class="plaintext-content">Why is it that Illinois is the only state with this regionless area? <br>
Is it some technical problem with the website or is it a mystery? I <br>
live in Rockford and I placed a box in Cherry Valley, both being <br>
regionless areas. It doesn't bother me to have to look on two <br>
seperate pages to find nearby clues, but it just seems strange that <br>
IL is the only state that has that.<br>
<br>
Is this something that has been discussed before and has a reason <br>
behind it? Is it something that IL boxers will just have to deal <br>
with? Does anyone else think this should be fixed, if at all possible?<br>
