the weekend with Grandma and Grandpa.  When we picked them up last <br/>
night, Do-Re-Mi Gal and Ball Magnet informed us that they had taken <br/>
Grandma and Grandpa out letterboxing!  They looked up some clues and <br/>
went out for a little walk.  They looked for "Biker's Path" but the <br/>
box wasn't there, which I believe since the kids are good at finding <br/>
the boxes--and there are several "attempts" listed on the Web site.  <br/>
They did find Scott &amp; Lisa's Wedding Box, so Grandma and Grandpa got <br/>
to experience the thrill of finding a box.  No word as of yet if they <br/>
will be joining us in this obsession called letterboxing.  <br/>

Do-Re-Mi Gal is in  6th grade and loves to go boxing--and is very good <br/>
at spying out where the boxes are hid.  Ball Magnet is in 4th grade--<br/>
sometimes he complains when we mention letterboxing, but then has a <br/>
great time when we are out doing it.  Since he is sometimes reluctant <br/>
to go, I was surprised at how gleeful he was when they informed us <br/>
they had been boxing (and now had one more stamp than their mother!)<br/>
