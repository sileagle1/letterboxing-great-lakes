back from a couple of folks who had made suggestions as to their <br>

<br>
Today was the first day we could make reservation requests at the <br>
local parks and I'm happy to report that we have reserved space for <br>
the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering on Saturday June 3 at Lapham Peak <br>
State Park in Delafield, WI.<br>
<br>
There will be a discounted daily rate for attendees who don't have a <br>
WI State Park sticker.  Here's a link for more info about the park:<br>
<br>
http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/land/parks/specific/lapham/<br>
<br>
Martini Man & I have been tossing around a few ideas for a gathering <br>
theme, but if anyone else wants to make some suggestions, please send <br>
us an email or post something to the board.<br>
<br>
I'm really busy at the office this week, but will create a website <br>
for the gathering in the near future.  <br>
<br>
We hope to see many of you at this event, so be sure to mark the date <br>
on your calendars!  (It will give us SOMETHING to record, since WE <br>
sure haven't been marking any BINGO items yet...)<br>

volunteered to carve him and earlier this morning Team Rabbit asked <br>
about him.  If anyone wants to do another White Rabbit, I suggest you <br>
coordinate with Acorn to choose him in a different setting or scene <br>
than what she is planning.  Or you could pick out a different character <br>
or item.  I'm trying to keep the list on the website as current as <br>
possible, so you can check here:  <br>
www.2006greatlakesgathering.homestead.com  to see what images have <br>
already been spoken for.<br>

It's great to see such a strong early response!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, here is some good news for Cigna Cats!  I just started looking at <br>
the on-line text of "Through the Looking Glass" and how does it <br>
start ....<br>
<br>
                            CHAPTER 1<br>
<br>
                       Looking-Glass house<br>
<br>
<br>
  One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to<br>
do with it: -- it was the black kitten's fault entirely.  For the<br>
white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for<br>
the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well,<br>
considering); so you see that it COULDN'T have had any hand in<br>
the mischief.<br>
<br>
  The way Dinah washed her children's faces was this:  first she<br>
held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with<br>
the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way,<br>
beginning at the nose:  and just now, as I said, she was hard at<br>
work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying<br>
to purr -- no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.<br>
<br>
  But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the<br>
afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner<br>
of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep,<br>
the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of<br>
worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it<br>
up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was,<br>
spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the<br>
kitten running after its own tail in the middle.<br>
........<br>
<br>
<br>
For those of you who want to read basic on-line versions of the two <br>
books, you can find them here: <br>
http://www.cs.indiana.edu/metastuff/wonder/wonder.txt.gz and here: <br>
http://www.cs.indiana.edu/metastuff/looking/looking.txt.gz<br>
<br>
There are also .html versions available and if you go a-googling you'll <br>
also find illustrated versions.  It is amazing how many different <br>
artists have done illustrations for these books!<br>

Hey, I wonder if we can keep up a 1+:1 ratio of boxes to boxers?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've just been putting the people on the Attendees page if they have <br>
SPECIFICALLY told me they were coming.  The priority so far has been to <br>
try to claim an image!  Speaking of which, I will post a list of <br>
additional possible images/scenes tonight or tomorrow night for those <br>
that are still thinking about what to carve.<br>
<br>
But back to Attendees:  You all may want to check the Attendees page on <br>
the website (www.2006greatlakesgathering.homestead.com) to see if I <br>
have you listed.  If I don't, please send me another email and let me <br>
know what state you are from, your trailname(s) and whether you are <br>
adults and/or kids.  For the kids I like to list the age and whether it <br>
is a girl or boy.  That helps reassure some families that other kids <br>
will be there (and possibly help persuade the reluctant ones to come).<br>
