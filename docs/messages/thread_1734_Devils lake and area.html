<br>
As long as Devil's lake and the area is being discussed, I thought I'd<br>
tell my little story of our trip.  My family and I were taking a<br>
letterboxing day-trip to central Wisconsin and we hit about 7 or so<br>
sites.  Funny enough, every single one was stamped by Wisconsin Hiker<br>
either eariler that day or very recently.  We kinda thought that was<br>
neat, but we were curious as to why there were none at Devil's lake<br>
yet.  Sure enough when we get home, three more were planted over the<br>
weekend.  We just missed being able to get those too, which is too bad<br>
because we don't get to go up there very often.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just wanted to say hello.  Hopefully you'll be seeing some<br>
boxes from me sometime soon, but work and school keep me pretty busy.<br>
 I got some ideas though.  :)<br>

You'd be pretty hard pressed to find a box that Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man have <br>
NOT stamped into.  8-><br>

recently here in the Madison area.  <br>
<br>
I'd really encourage you to make it back up to Devil's Lake if you can <br>
this year - the hike and the stamps are awesome!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to some Riiyak boxes,<br>
