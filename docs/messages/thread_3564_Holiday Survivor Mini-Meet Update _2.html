                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally went and signed the contract for using the Auditorium<br/>
tonight.  As such, I now have more details about the space. <br/>
Basically, I'll break down the brochure they gave me with the rules<br/>
and regs.<br/>
<br/>
-Must be held by a non-profit group and may not charge admission or<br/>
take up collections, donations or buy and sell.  <br/>
<br/>
-Any person from the general public must be welcome, non-members<br/>
cannot be excluded from events.<br/>
<br/>
-Food and beverages may be served as long as you intended to pick up<br/>
after yourselves.  Fridge and sink are available for use.  Red,<br/>
orange, and purple drinks are not allowed as they stain carpeting. <br/>
Any spills requiring cleaning will be charged to your group.<br/>
<br/>
-There is a handicapped accessible restroom in the hallway behind the<br/>
auditorium that is also equipped with a baby changing table.<br/>
<br/>
-The outside door in the hallway is an emergency exit and is locked<br/>
and alarmed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These basics being said here's how it affects us.  <br/>
<br/>
*The Raffle - We can't sell tickets inside the library without<br/>
violating the rules.  So our answer is to designate a person as a<br/>
ticket holder (person TBA before the meet).  That person will make a<br/>
general announcement to the room that they are leaving to "Go Outside"<br/>
or "Going to Lincoln Square" and will ask if anyone needs anything. <br/>
They will then go wherever they announced and will sell tickets then.<br/>
 This will be done probably 3 times throughout the afternoon,<br/>
currently planned at 1:30, 2:30, and 3:15 with the drawing at 3:30. <br/>
Anyone not known to the ticket holder as a letterboxer will be told<br/>
that the tickets were pre-sold before the meeting in order to avoid<br/>
violating the rules.  More details about the Raffle will be announced<br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
Our current list of prizes include:<br/>
* Set of LePlume II Brush Markers<br/>
* 3 Great Lakes Regional patches<br/>
* Telescopic walking stick (courtesy of MRSHAT)<br/>
* Centrifuge tubes [great for microboxes] (courtesy of Katy)<br/>
* Gas Card (courtesy of Basket Case)<br/>
<br/>
*Food - We aren't thinking of this becoming a potluck.  If people wish<br/>
to bring snacks or drinks to share, feel free to do so.  Just follow<br/>
the guidelines above regarding drinks.  There is a fridge in the<br/>
auditorium if there is something to keep cold.  People can e-mail me<br/>
with items they wish to bring, and I'll post it on the Atlas Quest<br/>
site.  I will announce right now what we are bringing.  We will be<br/>
providing a Dairy Queen Ice Cream cake, as the 21st is my birthday.<br/>
<br/>
*Public - This event will be open to the general public, which means<br/>
we will probably have Muggles coming in and out of the event.  We will<br/>
have information about letterboxing and how to get started so that we<br/>
can be welcoming to the public, we might even get a convert out of it.<br/>
 We are not allowed to tell anyone they have to leave just because<br/>
they aren't part of our group.<br/>
<br/>
*Setup - We will be able to start at 1:00 p.m., but will have to set<br/>
up our own tables and chairs.  This means that while we might want to<br/>
start talking and exchanging right off the bat, we'll have to restrain<br/>
ourselves for a few minutes and set up some tables and chairs and set<br/>
out our info and displays if we have any.<br/>
<br/>
*Parking - Metered spots are available in the library parking lot and<br/>
on surrounding streets, they are free on weekends.  There are also<br/>
some non-metered spots along the roads.  The Busey Bank parking lot<br/>
behind the library is also available for free.<br/>
<br/>
*Finding the Auditorium - We will be located in the Lewis Auditorium<br/>
in the Ground Floor level of the Urbana Free Library.  It can be a<br/>
little difficult to find, but if you are absolutely lost, you can ask<br/>
for help at the circulation desk.  If you ask for help, ask where the<br/>
Lewis Auditorium is, do not ask where the Letterboxing<br/>
Mini-Meet/Gathering is located as they will have no idea what you are<br/>
talking about.<br/>
<br/>
To find the Auditorium, enter the library through the doors on the<br/>
south side of the building.  Go up the stairs in front of you (or take<br/>
the elevator to your left if needed.  Go through the doors and past<br/>
the anti-theft devices and turn right.  Go past the circulation desk<br/>
and either take the stairs or the elevator on your right and go down<br/>
one floor.  If taking the stairs, the Auditorium is found to the left,<br/>
if taking the elevator it is on the right.  <br/>
