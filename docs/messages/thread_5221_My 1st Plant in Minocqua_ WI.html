It's always so cool to do a plant, you feel like it's one of your kids or something and you want everyone to like your "kid". :) Did you know that if you hide a gift in a box and don't tell anyone it's called an "Easter Egg". I love the terminology in boxing!<br/>

I have long heard stories and seen photographs of the beauty that awaits me Up North, but I can't convince the family to change our traditional Door County vacation plans and go the Rhinelander, Eagle River, Minocqua WI. for some variety and adventure.  I most want to see the snowshoe softball games at the American Legion woods.  It sounds like a real hoot!  Someday......till then I can only dream about the northwoods and all those lakes and white birch trees.  <br/>
