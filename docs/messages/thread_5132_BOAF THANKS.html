                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, I would like to thank everyone who attended and brought all that delicious food!  Also, many thanks to my cohorts Pastor's Wife and GGG Hiker.  Without PW's organizational skills this event could not have been brought off so well.  GGG Hiker really helped by manning the sign-in table and also by bringing her husband, Gruntmur, who helped man the grill along with NamVet.  Thanks also to Pastor Mark and PW's sister who took pictures, helped where needed and in general made the event run smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who chipped in by purchasing 50-50 raffle tickets - also, thanks to GGG Hiker for generously donating back a large portion of your 50-50 raffle prize to help defray the expenses for the lodge rental, brats, hot dogs, buns, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those who brought birthday cards for my husband, NamVet.  He had no idea I had requested them in advance and was surprised and delighted.  He loved each and every (especially the SCHMOOCH from Fungus Woman) and tucked them away to keep.<br/>
<br/>
A very special thanks to all those who hid, sent, or brought bird-themed letterboxes to the event (Wisconsin Hiker/Martini Man; Lock Shock n Barrel; Pitties; Beetle; Fungus Woman; Nitrocat; Atomic Beans; Questar; Hartx6; Library Grrl).  Your contributions helped make the event more memorable for us :)<br/>
<br/>
Now for our election results.  The final vote as as follows:<br/>
    McCain - 11 votes<br/>
    Obama - 8 votes<br/>
    Micky Mouse - 1 vote (write-in)<br/>
    Pastor's Wife - 1 vote (write-in)<br/>
<br/>
Now to the subject of cooties.  To the sneaky person who tucked a cootie into my bag of bathroom supplies (and you know who you are), be advised that someone had my back and you were ratted out immediately.  Look around :)<br/>
<br/>
THANKS AGAIN everyone for making yesterday a most enjoyable day!  I will be uploading the few pictures I managed to take to the "BOAF" photo folder shortly.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">And a huge THANK YOU to you TrailRider, Pastor's Wife, and GGGHiker! <br/>
We had such a great time yesterday. The food was excellent (awesome <br/>
job on those brats Gruntmur and NamVet), the park was just perfect <br/>
for hiking, and the stamps were beautiful (and very COLORFUL)!<br/>
I couldn't believe that 3 of my 4 kids went home with something from <br/>
the door prizes. Man were they excited. And not to worry TrailRider, <br/>
the littlest PackerBacker was made happy again with the promise of <br/>
hershey kisses on the way home =) <br/>
It was wonderful seeing familiar faces again and meeting some new <br/>
people like NorthStarr and Espresso Beans. I enjoyed getting to know <br/>
FungusWoman, BirdWoman, Do-Re-Mi Gal, and Prairie Dog better while <br/>
we boxed as a group. And Hartx6, it's always a pleasure to box with <br/>
you. Glad you and the girls could make it. <br/>
I can't wait to go back and find those last elusive boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A BIG thank you to all of you Great Lakes Letterboxers for making my <br/>
first LB Event the BEST time ever! It was everything I had hoped for <br/>
and more. I have been reading all about your past events for over 7 <br/>
months now on this web site and couldn't wait to get out to one. You <br/>
would always read something from some newbie talking about how much fun <br/>
they had and how welcoming everyone was. Well they were absolutely <br/>
right. I couldn't have met a nicer bunch of people. EVERYONE was so <br/>
nice to this newbie. Special thanks to PW and TR and all the of rest of <br/>
you that helped them put this GREAT event together, you should be <br/>
pleased with the wonderful job that you all did. In addition I want to <br/>
thank those "professional boxers" Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man for <br/>
letting me me see how real letterboxers hunt for those ever elusive <br/>
boxes. Trekkie Gal for helping me work my way through the overwhelming <br/>
event stamping table. Then there's Cherokee Rose 2 and Hawkeye for <br/>
taking me under their wings in the afternoon for some more boxing out <br/>
on the trails. It was so exciting to meet in person all of you that I <br/>
have been reading so much about and who's boxies I have found. Hart X6 <br/>
thanks for pushing me one step closer to carving my first stamp. <br/>
Lastely those Packer Backers. I made sure to check my backpack closely <br/>
for those coveted cooties, didn't want to be stuck with any before I <br/>
left the event. I thought that this newbie was going to escaped the <br/>
event without cathing any but that was not the case. <br/>
Made my way out to my car in the parking lot, had everything packed up, <br/>
ready to go. Reached into my cooler to grab a drink for the ride home <br/>
and you guessed it I caught a cootie! Thank you ALL. Can't wait to do <br/>
it again<br/>
