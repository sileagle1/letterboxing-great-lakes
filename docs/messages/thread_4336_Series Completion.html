If you just find my Channel Cat series (in its entirety) you will find <br/>
9 stamps. If you find the boxes within walking distance from other <br/>
letterboxers you will find another 6 more stamps and if you bring your <br/>
bike you will find another 2 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
So you will enjoy the Quad Cities from the Mississippi River. You will <br/>
stop in 5 cities and possibly find 17 boxes!! Sounds like fun (I just <br/>
had someone from New Mexico find all but the two I planted today and <br/>
got great feedback).<br/>
<br/>
Also, you can get to all of them by car in the off season, however, I <br/>
plan on pulling the one from the Channel Cat itself by Labor Day.<br/>

Let me know the date you are going to be in town and I will see about  <br/>
leaving the box on the Channel Cat (as it runs weekends through Oct -- I think).  <br/>
Perhaps, you could ride the Channel Cat and collect the box for me then we could <br/>
 meet up for a quick exchange??<br/>
<br/>
I had a couple from New Mexico find this series the day I planted the last  <br/>
two boxes. I was so disappointed for them as they didn't have the chance to get <br/>
 the last two stamps I hid. I wrote them and told them about just missing <br/>
them  that day.<br/>
<br/>
They wrote me and said they spent an extra day in this area and DID drive  <br/>
out to collect the last two stamps and we met up last night at their hotel. I  <br/>
was thrilled as just this past Saturday we found several boxes in north easter  <br/>
Iowa just having missed them at each one!! We chased them all the way to the  <br/>
Quad Cities so it was a thrill to sit and chat with them a while.<br/>
