&gt; Have you all tried winter boxing, if so what was your favorit time <br/>

<br/>
The kids and I went on a day-long boxing trip in early January of <br/>
this year--right before they had to go back to school after <br/>
Christmas break.  We headed up to Lake County and did alot of boxes <br/>
by Beetle and a few others as well.  It was a wonderful day!  There <br/>
was a little bit of snow on the ground so everything looked pretty, <br/>
but it wasn't that cold (for January).  We had our boots and mittens <br/>
and plenty of layers on.  I packed lots of snacks and a big thermos <br/>
of hot chocolate and we were ready to head out.  We would do a few <br/>
boxes and then have some snacks and hot chocolate (and also warm up <br/>
as we drove to the next area where boxes were).  The kids had a <br/>
great time climbing on the giant rocks at one of the beaches we went <br/>
to in search of a box.  And I saw a common goldeneye duck out on <br/>
Lake Michigan (a new find for me).  <br/>
<br/>
I think it worked because we stayed warm, we alternated boxing trips <br/>
from more urban ones to ones out in the woods, because there were <br/>
plenty of snacks and hot chocolate, and probably because the kids <br/>
were getting tired of Christmas break and were ready for an <br/>
adventure.  The only downside to the trip was driving back home in <br/>
rush hour traffic all the way from Lake County(but we just had to <br/>
get those last few boxes!)<br/>

highly recommend a cell phone and an automobile association card. The<br/>
other thing that can be irksome are frozen boxes - some of my boxes<br/>
are guilty of getting frozen-in. I put a note in my clue pages to let<br/>
people know that it's likely that certain boxes will be frozen in the<br/>
winter. <br/>

Absolutely! I love winter boxing. I am big on boxing<br/>
when most others aren't i.e. I do ALOT of my boxing<br/>

winter boxing escapade was last winter here in<br/>
Minneapolis. I was looking for "Bridging the River 2"<br/>

I had just finished work and it was about 1:30 a.m. <br/>
(try combining winter and late night boxing for a real<br/>
treat). It was about 12 degrees outside and the river<br/>
was maybe 15 feet from the boxes hiding spot. My work<br/>
shoes were completely devoid of any  traction, think<br/>
racing slicks. I walked around the side of the tree<br/>
that was facing the river and before I knew what<br/>
happened I was sliding towards an icy, dirty river. I<br/>
was able to stop myself 5 feet from the rivers edge<br/>
after sliding for 10 feet. My hands were cut up from<br/>
trying to grab branches and hold on which is hard to<br/>
do when it's 12 degrees outside. Even harder though<br/>
was climbing back up the embankment with freezing<br/>
bleeding hands and then finding the box and stamping<br/>
in. Ah yes, the things we do to find a piece of carved<br/>
rubber : ) Good times people, good times.<br/>

 &gt; Have you all tried winter boxing, if so what was your favorit time<br/>
 &gt; out?<br/>
<br/>
I learned about letterboxing in February 2005, and since I didn't  <br/>
want to wait to get started, all of our first boxes were found in the  <br/>
winter.  Probably my favorite letterboxing memory is of my first box,  <br/>
"Red Cedar Box" on MSU's campus.  It was snowing very hard but I was  <br/>
determined to go anyway since I had spent the weekend getting my  <br/>
stamp and logbook ready.  My husband and I found it (I remember how  <br/>
amazed I was that it was right where it was supposed to be) and went  <br/>
back to the car to stamp in.  We got a few other boxes that winter  <br/>
including "Patriarche Park" (it's a wonder we found it since the  <br/>
trail referenced in the clue was not visible due to snow cover),  <br/>
"Burchfield's Bounty," and "Fitzgerald's Find."<br/>
<br/>
A more recent winter letterboxing experience was less successful, but  <br/>
makes for a good story.  Last March we went to the Traverse City area  <br/>
for a few days.  On the way up we tried to get a box that I had long  <br/>
wanted to get -- the Clare Roadside Park box.  What we didn't realize  <br/>
is that the park is not maintained in the winter.  We pulled in and  <br/>
then immediately realized that it was a mistake because it was  <br/>
completely covered with snow.  We then got stuck and spent a while  <br/>
trying to dig out before a guy in a big pickup pulled in.  "Need some  <br/>
help?" he said.  I didn't know how to explain why we had thought it  <br/>
was a good idea to pull a Honda Civic into a snow-covered roadside  <br/>
park.  I said, "I guess you're probably wondering how we were stupid  <br/>
enough to get into this situation."  He just said, "It happens," and  <br/>
then helped push us back out.<br/>
<br/>
I was disappointed that we weren't able to look for the box and hoped  <br/>
to get it on my next trip up north.  Unfortunately, by the time we  <br/>
next headed up that way, the box was reported missing.<br/>

 On snowshoes, stop at the box, but don't move around as you open the box and stamp <br/>

would work on foot.<br/>
 Bring a little bottle of yellow food coloring and camouflage your activity.<br/>

I've also had to pass by boxes hidden in more open areas where camouflaging my <br/>

Of course, it's frustrating when you've been oh so clever and discreet and the darned box <br/>

That assumes you are lucky enough to GO right to the hiding place!  <br/>
Sometimes we end up wandering around enough trying to find the box that <br/>
there is no need to worry about tell-tale tracks.  If we do find it <br/>
quickly, we just walk around in circles in the area so there is no <br/>
obvious "path".<br/>

P.S.  We particularly like hiding boxes in winter.  If it is hidden <br/>
well in winter, it will be hidden REALLY WELL in the summer (much to <br/>
the dismay of those who search for it in the summer).  We generally <br/>
recommend looking at what month a box was hidden to understand what the <br/>
conditions were like.  There is a lot less undergrowth in winter, <br/>
making it much easier to get to off-trail locations.<br/>

fingers crossed) it will be the best "field" test of the lock and <br/>

should occur in the next 5 minutes with the weather we've been having <br/>
lol) and I'll let everyone know how it performs.  On a funny note I <br/>
went last night and bought every last 2.5 cup lock and lock Target <br/>
had so I can continue to replace my boxes with them.  The poor boy at <br/>
the check out looked at me like I was nuts?  I was like what? People <br/>
don't come in every day and buy 15 lock and locks?  LOL<br/>

No. We'd leave a trail of snowshoe prints....<br/>
<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
This is really no different than in the summer -- if you're not <br/>
careful, you can leave traces of your footsteps as you trample ferns <br/>
or other plants as you head from the trail to a box hiding place, <br/>
which can develop into a social trail over time. This is why you <br/>
should *never* walk from a trail directly to an off-trail hiding <br/>
place, and always find a non-direct route. When we letterbox in the <br/>
snow, we always look for a roundabout route to the hiding place, <br/>
finding a place where our footprints aren't going to be obvious and <br/>
hike over to the hiding place via the back way.<br/>
<br/>
Since there are so relatively fewer hikers in the winter, there's <br/>
much less risk of being seen or having your footprints be seen, too. <br/>
And it's easy to use a branch to sweep snow into your footprints and <br/>
cover up your trail completely as you back away from the box.....<br/>

<br/>
After getting lost(not the first time and likely won't be the last), in<br/>
Riverside, IL this morning looking for a new box -- by the time I realized<br/>
that I had ended up in Lyons and needed to head back north, I had too many<br/>
errands to run to attempt to look for the box -- I think *I'll* plant a<br/>
"Heffalumps and Woozles" box down here next spring in honor of<br/>
the'shroomlady.  :-)  I know Milne would have no complaints -- all he'd have<br/>
to do if he was alive today is take a look at a map of that town.  I never<br/>
go to the end of 31st St without feeling like Captain Kirk has gone into a<br/>
black hole and Scotty will be of absolutely no help.  Or, speaking of Milne,<br/>
maybe I feel more like James James Morrrison Morrison Weatherby George<br/>
Dupree (commonly known as Jim)'s Mother when I hit the end of 31st St.<br/>
<br/>
So I moseyed on out of Riverside without having found the box.  But I didn't<br/>
leave any social trail either!  I don't recall ever covering the same ground<br/>
twice this morning.  :-)<br/>
