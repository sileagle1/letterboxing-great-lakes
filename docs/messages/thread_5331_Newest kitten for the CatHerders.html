Can you tell us his first &amp; middle name?  "Baby G" sounds like "Baby Girl" and I'm not sure he would like that...  Or perhaps he already has a trail name?<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to meeting him, perhaps at an event next year.<br/>

Congrats to you all!  I hope all is well, and it sounds like Baby G is getting lots of love from big sis and bro.  =)  Take care! ((HUGS)) <br/>
