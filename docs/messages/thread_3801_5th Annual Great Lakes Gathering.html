Someone has been very studious.  It's got the name and it's got the <br>

<br>
http://www.cafepress.com/letterboxing<br>
<br>
I have previously purchased items from here.  I was satisfied with the quality of the t-shirt material that I received -- it was a mid-weight cotton knit and did not shrink too badly -- but they probably vary by style.  The one I purchased was just a basic grey T-shirt that had the "Get a Clue" logo on it.  It looks like he is not carrying that item any longer.  I also purchased that great "Get A Clue" steel coffee mug that people are always asking me about and I have left behind at numerous gatherings (thanks to all those who have sent it back to me)...  mine has seen a lot of use over the past few years and countless trips through the dishwasher and finally the coating with the print on it beginning to peel off.  I was hoping to replace it, but it doesn't appear he is carrying this any more either ;-(<br>
<br>
I don't know for sure, but I wouldn't think the GLG5 merchandise is a Silent Doug endeavor for a couple of reasons -- first, I seriously doubt that he would do this without asking the group or the event planners, and secondly, it is a different cafepress store.<br>

   <br>
  As those of who have been reading the firestorm on AQ know, I am the one who put up the sayitstore.com site.  First, I want to say here, that I hope I have not stepped on any toes and if I did, I appologize.  Second, I want to answer some of the questions that were posed.  M&8X was not behind the design idea, but I have spoken to her and she has said she liked it very much and has endorsed it.  I am going to split any profits with her, since she is putting in so much effort to pull this gathering off, she deserves it.  I have ordered one of the Ohio Letterboxer shirts (the womens V neck) and the shirt quality is good.  (I wanted to make sure of that before I made anymore designs.)  The items are printed as they are ordered, so that is why there are so many choices.  I put them all up, to give everyone somethig they liked.  They use a direct print (instead of iron on) method on the shirts, which like any other shirt, should hold up if turned inside out in the wash.<br>
   <br>
  I hope I have cleared things up.  Please contact me if you have any other questions or concerns.<br>

Hey everyone!<br>
<br>
The above links are very recent posts that 3BuckeyeKids made.  She is a <br>
relatively new letterboxer from here in Ohio.  Some of us here met her <br>
for the first time at M&8x and Eagle Eye's gathering last summer.  She <br>
is a very nice mother of children and she is going out of her way to <br>
apologize for these t-shirts and not really knowing how it all works.  <br>
Please take a moment to read through these posts.  I don't know where <br>
all they were posted but I think at least one of them was on the EVENT <br>
board.  Once you read them, I think everyone's understanding will go way <br>
up.  It helped me understand.  She really laid herself out there to make <br>
this right.<br>
<br>
I ***THINK*** next Sunday is when daylight savings time changes---the <br>
new date?!  (Please jump in if I heard that incorrectly.)  If it is <br>
true, then we all may have a better chance to finally get back out and <br>
box!!!!!<br>

It snowed all day long like that yesterday...like we were inside a shook <br>
up snow dome, but it is almost gone today.  Nothing much left on the <br>
ground and yet it is COLD?!<br>
<br>
I looked on weather.com and later this week is it supposed to get up to <br>
45 and even 50 degrees and sunny!!!  Woo hooo.  I hear boxes a <br>
callin'!!!! :)<br>
<br>
Thanks for the confirmation!  That is CRAZY it got moved so much <br>
earlier?!  I saw where it is making computer techies crazy (especially <br>
those who work for hospitals) (and my son who works for Ohio State <br>
University) because of all the time-sensitive appointments, surgeries, <br>
meds....and scheduling classes, for example. <br>
<br>
I am pushing hard to finish carving so I can be OUT when the weather <br>
finally FINALLY breaks!<br>

Dr.Watson, Griffy and I must be crazy!!!  We went a "hunt'n" <br>
yesterday in the "Shook-up" snow dome.  Only our hair was messed up <br>
all day (like I got some to mess up).  We got 7 boxes "whooo <br>
hooo"....  Can't wait for warmer than 28 degree weather to look in <br>
the "unfrozen" tundra for treasures.<br>

I hope you got some good pictures!<br>
<br>
I went out the day before when the sun was out and the wind was <br>
outrageous!  Way to brave it yesterday!!  I did have to sort of pry a <br>
couple of frozen boxes out but not too bad.  My dog, Gunner, fell <br>
through the ice?!  Goofy thing went out on it not realizing as he had a <br>
great point on a duck!!  Scared me--but good.  One more try of him not <br>
getting back out and I was going to have to go in after him?!  He was <br>
one HAPPY DOG once he finally got back out!!!  I got some good pictures <br>
of him after?!  ughhhh<br>
<br>
Go-Becky-Go!!!  Carve those stamps and get that camo tape goin'!  :)  <br>
Take today for YOU!!! ;) <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do understand where 3BuckeyeKids is coming from and actually admire her spirit of entrepreneurship, although I will admit I don't quite understand the reason for her initial dishonesty.  If she thought this was such a great idea why didn't she just post that she had started this site to sell LB merchandise?  It would appear that she thought it may not be acceptable.<br>
<br>
For the most part, the items she is selling are innocuous, and really no different than the items that Silent Doug sells at his cafepress store.  Where I feel the line has been crossed is with the event shirts.  Although many events have an associated T-shirt, this is really something that should fall to the event planners to design and/or commission.  Planning a gathering is a lot of work, some of it fun, some or it just plain tedious.  Some people would consider designing the "official" gathering shirt to be fun and would look forward to the chance to create this, others might consider it to be tedious and would just as soon somebody else did it.  But...  that should be the decision of the event planner.<br>
<br>
So it really is up to M&8x and Eagle Eyes.  If they want to go with this design, that's fine.  If they would rather come up with something else, just tell us when/where to get the "official" GLG5 shirt and we will support that.<br>

  Hey everyone!<br>
<br>
  The above links are very recent posts that 3BuckeyeKids made. She is a <br>
  relatively new letterboxer from here in Ohio. Some of us here met her <br>
  for the first time at M&8x and Eagle Eye's gathering last summer. She <br>
  is a very nice mother of children and she is going out of her way to <br>
  apologize for these t-shirts and not really knowing how it all works. <br>
  Please take a moment to read through these posts. I don't know where <br>
  all they were posted but I think at least one of them was on the EVENT <br>
  board. Once you read them, I think everyone's understanding will go way <br>
  up. It helped me understand. She really laid herself out there to make <br>
  this right.<br>
<br>
  I ***THINK*** next Sunday is when daylight savings time changes---the <br>
  new date?! (Please jump in if I heard that incorrectly.) If it is <br>
  true, then we all may have a better chance to finally get back out and <br>
  box!!!!!<br>

  Hello all,<br>
<br>
  As those of who have been reading the firestorm on AQ know, I am the one who put up the sayitstore.com site. First, I want to say here, that I hope I have not stepped on any toes and if I did, I appologize. Second, I want to answer some of the questions that were posed. M&8X was not behind the design idea, but I have spoken to her and she has said she liked it very much and has endorsed it. I am going to split any profits with her, since she is putting in so much effort to pull this gathering off, she deserves it. I have ordered one of the Ohio Letterboxer shirts (the womens V neck) and the shirt quality is good. (I wanted to make sure of that before I made anymore designs.) The items are printed as they are ordered, so that is why there are so many choices. I put them all up, to give everyone somethig they liked. They use a direct print (instead of iron on) method on the shirts, which like any other shirt, should hold up if turned inside out in the wash.<br>
<br>
  I hope I have cleared things up. Please contact me if you have any other questions or concerns.<br>
