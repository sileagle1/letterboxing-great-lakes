Did you close the T-shirt poll?  I know I am a little behind the 8-<br/>
ball here, but I just tried to go and vote and it says the poll is <br/>
closed.  Anyway, I was going to vote "yes" so you can add that to <br/>
your list if you are keeping track.<br/>

&gt; The T-shirt poll is still going - or rather, going again.  If you <br/>
&gt; voted last week, please vote again this week, because the results <br/>
&gt; were reset by accident.  I need to know whether we'll have enough <br/>
&gt; people to go ahead with the T-shirts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, if z-fan comes, you're dad will have someone to discuss <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey, what's the scoop on the t-shirts?  Do we preorder, or will <br/>
&gt; you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; them there?  Did I miss that somewhere?  What's the cost?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I've also seen those LbNA patches.  Does anybody have a couple <br/>
&gt; extra they'd<br/>
&gt; &gt; be willing to sell?  (I'd like two or three.) Otherwise I forgot <br/>
&gt; where I saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; them.  Was it on Silent Doug's site?<br/>
