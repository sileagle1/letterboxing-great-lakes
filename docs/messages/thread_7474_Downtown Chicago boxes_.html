                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm going to be staying at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Chicago next week. It's for work. On the weekend, my family is coming to join me. I am wondering if there any boxes right downtown that we could visit. Ideally walking distance from the Hyatt (151 east wacker drive).  I have such a hard time finding boxes to find in specific locations when I'm not familiar with the area. (I have a four year old so walking distance is active four year old distance)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are many great boxes in and around Chicago, some are more difficult than others. There should be some in walking distance, but check the last find date as many go missing.<br>
Another idea would be some of the Metra line boxes (FungusWoman and Beetle have done some, plus many others. On weekends, you can get an unlimited ticket, so you can ride the train, pop off for some quick boxes in walking distance, then hop on the next train going out or back.<br>
Many of us will be up near Madison for the GLG, but have fun in Chicago and good hunting!<br>

The dumb thing is that I am from Madison, but had to come down here for work, so I had to miss the GLG. :(<br>
