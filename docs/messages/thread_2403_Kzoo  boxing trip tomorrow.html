school bus tomorrow morning! (Mon 4/17)<br>
<br>
We're hoping to catch up with you guys and maybe even a couple of<br>
others, too.<br>
<br>
Later today we'll be sorting through the clue sheets I printed off and<br>
making some decissions on which boxes we want to go after.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who sent replies about boxing in Kzoo, those notes<br>
are helping us make box choices!<br>
<br>
This is a "no kids" trip so Naughty Dog doesn't have to worry about<br>
not bouncing anyone off from logs. (Besides, he's a naughty dog, they<br>
do naughty things like that, they can't help themselves. lol)<br>
<br>
Sail on!<br>

logs this time!<br>

Hmmm...this doesn't sound like someone who's giving up on <br>
letterboxing! :-)<br>
