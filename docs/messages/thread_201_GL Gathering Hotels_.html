I understand that some in this group are waaayyyyy ahead of me and <br>
have already made motel/hotel arrangements for the Gathering.<br>
So, any suggestions?<br>
We went online and looked for accomodation in/around McHenry, but <br>
since we're totally unfamiliar with the area, any suggestions from <br>
locals or others who've already made some deals would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>

heavy road construction with frustrating delays.<br>

For those of you in a retro mood, there's a great drive in movie <br>
theater in McHenry.   It's cheap, clean and orderly--lots of <br>
families as well as teenagers and those of us who like to recall <br>
what it was like to be a teenager. Call (815) 385-0144 for listings <br>

plenty of time to do a bit of night letterboxing before the late <br>
show.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That sounds like a blast.  Night'boxing and a flick at the drive-in <br>
after a day at the gathering!  With enough coffee, all things are <br>
possible!<br>
<br>
We just might look into it....  Hopefully they won't be showing that <br>
Olson twins movie.  I hear that's even scarier than "Van Helsing".<br>
