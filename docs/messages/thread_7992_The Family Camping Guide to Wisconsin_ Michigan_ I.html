</p><p>I received this email today and thought some of you might be interested in it:</p><p><br/></p><p>Dear Outdoor Recreation Enthusiast:</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>I would like to announce the publication of
my new book titled <i>The Family Camping Guide to Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois
&amp; Indiana</i> and ask that you tell other outdoor enthusiasts about this
valuable resource for planning basic tent vacations to any of the four Lake
Michigan states. The book was written for tent camping families who want to
find safe and comfortable public campgrounds with large, level, grassy and
shady campsites plus plenty of children’s and adult activities. It provides
basic information about virtually all 720 state, federal, county, and municipal
camping destinations rather than a few arbitrarily selected “favorite
campgrounds” in the four states. Other unique features of this book are
summarized below.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p><span>·</span><span>        
</span>It summarizes popular activities and tourist attractions near each camping
destination.</p><p>
</p><p><span>·</span><span>        
</span>It organizes public campgrounds in each state by geographic location,
management authority and number of campsites so that families can easily
identify potential campgrounds near planned travel routes and ultimate
destinations.</p><p>
</p><p><span>·</span><span>        
</span>It identifies campgrounds that have been cited by other authorities as
good camping destinations in addition to campgrounds that the author favors.</p><p>
</p><p><span>·</span><span>        
</span>It explains how to plan safe and comfortable tent camping vacation trips
to unfamiliar destinations and how to secure good campsites in popular
campgrounds during busy summer weekends.</p><p>
</p><p><span>·</span><span>        
</span>It uses a unique system of reference towns, highways, and landmarks to
help readers easily locate each property on a highway map.</p><p>
</p><p><span>·</span><span>        
</span>It provides phone numbers for each campground so that users can call the
campground office if necessary and GPS coordinates so that campers can easily
navigate to it, even in the dark.</p><p>
</p><p><span>·</span><span>        
</span>It includes over a hundred photos of popular camping destinations in the
four states.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>The book was published by Trails Books in June 2014 and is
listed for $19.95. To purchase a copy, visit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.Amazon.com</a>
