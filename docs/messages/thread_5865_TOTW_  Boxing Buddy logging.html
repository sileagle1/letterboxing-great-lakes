I don't know as "Boxing Buddies" are necessarily stuffed animals.  For some,<br>
they might be, and I think it's a cute idea.  It's probably someone with a<br>
little more creative mind and if they go to the trouble of carving a stamp,<br>
this is supposed to be an imaginative game, right?  An artistic game?  I<br>
have a friend who writes clues using photos of a particular stuffed animal<br>
along the way for each clue........so why not finders with stuffed animals?<br>
A stuffed animal following the clues of a stuffed animal.  :-)<br>
<br>
It could also be someone boxing with a small child who feels their stuffed<br>
animal is "real" at that point in their life or boxing with someone mentally<br>
handicapped who's very attached to a stuffed animal.  Or a stuffed animal<br>
that belonged to a child who has passed away.<br>
<br>
I don't know as if I'd use up 3 pages on a logbook, however, but who knows?<br>
Maybe they contacted the creator and asked them what they'd like.  I often<br>
do that if I'm boxing with friends or relatives -- we'll contact them and<br>
ask them if they want all our sig stamps or just one group stamp.  Frankly,<br>
quite often the creator will say the more stamps the merrier.  But even if<br>
I'm boxing with real live humans, we try hard not to use up 3 pages of a<br>
hitchhiker logbook if we can possibly help it.<br>
<br>
But a Boxing Buddy, to me, is just anyone not human and/or not present.<br>
<br>
It can be a dog that a person is boxing with and that has had their own<br>
stamped carved for them.  I know one person in the southwest who boxes with<br>
a pet ferret that has it's own stamp and they print b.b. for boxing buddy<br>
for the ferret since the ferret can't stamp in for itself and thus is only a<br>
boxing "buddy" and not a boxer.<br>
<br>
It can be someone deceased who might have loved to box and/or whom the<br>
finder was very close to.  I take Ancient's stamp with me and stamp it,<br>
along with mine, into those boxes where I think to myself "Yes, this is<br>
really a box that Ancient would have enjoyed finding."  And maybe, looking<br>
down from Heaven, Ancient IS there boxing with me.  Ancient always WAS<br>
rather fanatical about boxing.  :-) Sometimes I write "boxing buddy" and<br>
sometimes I don't.  Ancient was human but is now totally Spirit.<br>
<br>
When one thinks about it, isn't most everything about letterboxing, not to<br>
mention letterboxing itself, kind of a silly notion?  :-)  That's one of the<br>
things I love about it.  Adult humans searching the woods for tiny boxes<br>
with rubber that other adult humans have taken so much time and energy to<br>
carve and write clues for, some of them very elaborate and creative and<br>
mysterious clues.<br>
<br>
Most of my non-boxer friends think the whole "letterboxing thing" is rather<br>
silly.  Some of them not only use the word "silly" but also use the word<br>
"stupid" along with "silly" and now that..........that...........that really<br>
hurts.  :-)<br>

<br>
When we last checked our BB, aka "Kemosabe," had a pulse!   With that said, he isn't imaginary!  Had we given him the trail name of "Harvey", you might have a case against us.  He falls into the 4-legged canine type of a BB.  He does have his own stamp which we kindly stamp into logbooks for him (right next to ours-never on a separate page) if he has indeed helped in finding the box!  He often offers a great distraction to our "silly" letterboxing activity and we feel as his reward he should get to have his portrait stamped into the box.  Often he offers more to the find than the off base Tonto.  <br>
<br>
It might be said that if muggles were around, and a letterboxer was creative..or desperate enough to begin talking to his imaginary BB to scare away the muggle that could be considered (like our Kemosabe) a distraction....But then again, if we were honest...haven't we all talked to ourselves reciting clues aloud to no one in particular while trying to find a box?  We just didn't know we had imaginary BB's! <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, our imaginary BB's must be little tricksters because they are always leading us astray!<br>

Nope, not "just you"!  We are in the same camp as you.  I particularly don't<br>
think so much space should be taken up in logbooks by stuffed animals.  I've<br>
seen this on several occasions in box logbooks, but when I saw it in the<br>
small HH logbook, that really seemed to be the time to question things.<br>

We didn't think you were rude at all - of course letterboxing is silly!  That is why we all LOVE it!  Many things in life that are considered silly have value and add to the richness of our lives.  For us letterboxing is the "silliness" of choice!  Personally, putting spiky shoes on and hitting a little white ball around the grass into 18 strategically placed hidey holes with metal or wooden endowed sticks is SILLY...to each his own kind of silliness!<br>
<br>
 Furthermore,  the concept of BB's (if understood as imaginary companions) IS funny.  That doesn't mean someone should or shouldn't stamp them in - it just means that it strikes some of us as humorous!  <br>

But in answer to WiHi's original inquiry, My personal thought is that it is kind of inconsiderate to take up a lot of space in a logbook, be it just one person's oversized sig stamp or lots of smaller ones.  If a logbook is small or doesn't have much room, I will stamp just a portion of my stamp, enough to recognize it.  (I also carry my mini-siggie which also works in that situation.)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just as a note about the AQ glossary, the term "boxing buddy" may kind of<br>
pre-date AQ's definition.  Either that or different areas or groups of<br>
people have a different definition.<br>
I know folks who have been boxing for many years with boxing buddies and it<br>
has nothing to do with stuffed animals nor did it come from the idea of<br>
postal boxes.  Elmer used to be my boxing buddy before Ancient passed over<br>
and he was a 120lb yellow Lab.  A mascot, maybe.  Small, no.   :-)<br>
<br>
Now I use the spirit of Ancient as a boxing buddy and not the spirit of<br>
Elmer since I don't figure that Elmer, also having passed over, is looking<br>
down at me with boxing in mind.  If he's looking down, he's looking towards<br>
romping thru ponds so that he's soaking wet when we get back to the van (and<br>
waits to shake until he jumps into the van) or he's looking towards losing<br>
his tennis ball in the tall grass so that we're not only searching for a<br>
letterbox but have to spend an extra hour searching for his tennis ball that<br>
he insists on finding before we leave.  Altho I did catch on to carrying<br>
extra tennis balls in my backpack so that I could wade into the tall grass,<br>
pick up a few ticks along the way, pull a tennis ball out of the backpack<br>
and proclaim "Here it is! I found it! We can keep hiking now!"<br>
<br>
But maybe it's nice that AQ attempted to put some sort of definition on it.<br>
I guess.  Sometimes I wish, tho, that websites didn't attempt to define<br>
things when there isn't necessarily a concensus on a definition.  But AQ's<br>
definition is a little too "cute" for me anyway.  If I had read that<br>
definition, I'd probably agree that it goes over the top in silliness.  :-)<br>
A stuffed animal having their own sig stamp I can understand...........their<br>
own logbook???  That's a little Twilight Zoney for me.  Not to say that I<br>
didn't love Twilight Zone.  :-)<br>
<br>
Forget the hitchhiker logbooks, heck, regular letterbox logbooks are often<br>
so small now that a really small stamp seems almost a necessity.  I can't<br>
carve small enough to make a really cool one that small so all I can do is<br>
use part of my regular stamp.  I was thinking of drawing my sig stamp really<br>
small and having nwstamps.com make a custom stamp of it for me.  The drawing<br>
I could do.  The carving, no way.<br>
