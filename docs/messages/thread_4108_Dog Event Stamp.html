                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, if I hadn't already decided I couldn't attend the gathering<br/>
Saturday because of work, I would now not be attending because of an<br/>
injured dog.  Somehow, don't ask me how, Claire rolled on a dead bird and <br/>
ended up needing surgery to remove a wing bone that was protruding from<br/>
her side.  Sitting with woozy dog was a great opportunity to finish the<br/>
dog event stamp I had planned and started months ago.  I've handed it<br/>
over to Kimono Girl and Flying Dragon, so Claire, Yuki, and I will be<br/>
there in spirit, if not body.  Claire knows from repeated experience<br/>
(she's persistent) that Kimono Girl is not particularly fond of having<br/>
her face or teeth or tonsils licked, so try to find some other way for<br/>
your wonderful pup to ask for it!  The stamp is for dogs attending the<br/>
gathering and their owners only (although if your dog is like mine and<br/>
prone to freak accidents that cannot really be explained and is at home<br/>
for that reason, I'm sure KG and FD could be talked into letting you<br/>
stamp in sans dog).<br/>
<br/>
I hope every one has fun at the gathering!  I'm looking forward to seeing <br/>
all the dogs' stamps in my book when KG and FD return.<br/>
