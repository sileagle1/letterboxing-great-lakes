You checked both listings on AQ and LbNA?  Maybe it's not a HH, it just looks like one.  Maybe it's a Cootie or a Flea or a Bonus stamp.  Check those listing areas on AQ and LbNA too.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I find those all the time.  Lots of folks who create hitchhikers have no<br/>
interest in listing them online at either LbNA or atlasquest.  If it has a<br/>
logbook with it and looked like every other hitchhiker, then I'd say just<br/>
move it on.  If it has a logbook, does it have an email addy for the creator<br/>
that you can contact them that you found it?  Most do of the ones that I've<br/>
found, altho many times the addy is no longer valid.  Once a hitchhiker is<br/>
placed out there, there's little way for the creator to change the logbook<br/>
to reflect a changed email addy.<br/>
<br/>
As far as changing your name, that would involve changing things in your<br/>
email system.  At least, in my case it would.  I use MS Outlook and I put<br/>
"xxxxxxx" down in MS Outlook for who was sending email out from this email<br/>
address since it's my farm/business address and is used by folks other than<br/>
myself at times.  So I didn't want it to reflect any one person's identity.<br/>
I'm assuming there must be someplace in your email system on your computer<br/>
where you can change the name of who is sending out the emails.<br/>
<br/>
But be aware that it'll be that way for any emails you send out that aren't<br/>
letterbox related too.  At least that's how it works for me in MS Outlook.<br/>

I found at least one where the HH name was misspelled when it was <br/>
originally entered on AQ.  The HH name was "Post cards from Home," but <br/>
it was entered as "Post crads from Home."  Try searching just a few <br/>
letters from the name and maybe you'll find your HH buried in a <br/>
spelling permutation!<br/>

  &gt; another box or what. Any suggestions? <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Also, I've noticed that everyone has their trail name on here but mine <br/>
  &gt; says my real name. Any idea how I can change that?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Thanks,<br/>
