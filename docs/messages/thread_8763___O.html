If you don't have some of the boxes, this weekend would be a great time to try and get them!

</div><div><br/></div><div>Cards are due to me by 12/31/18. Booty is due by 1/12/19.</div><div><br/></div><div>Please also sign up in the database on the Yahoo Groups page so everyone knows who is playing. I'll update it when i get your cards and booty. <br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Please note a few rules changes for 2019. These are meant to help speed up the game (vs last year) and maybe make it a bit crazier.</div><div><br/></div><div>1. There are only 4 Interim games this year: Straight line, "X", four corners, and the 6-pack.</div><div><br/></div><div>2. Wild Cards can be used for the Interim games.</div><div><br/></div><div>3. You can win only one Interim game.</div><div><br/></div><div>4. YOU MUST CLAIM YOUR WILD CARD WITHIN 3 DAYS OF IT BEING CALLED.</div><div><br/></div><div>5. I will not call any of the 'zero' terms than no one picks. Instead, I will call a wild card on that day. So, it is possible that many of the wild cards will get called this year.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>6. Due to some of the issues last year with this board, I will also be posting the calls on a Google sheet for redundancy at <a href="https://tinyurl.com/LB-BINGO2019">https://tinyurl.com/LB-BINGO2019</a> . You shouldn't need to logon to view it. <br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Please take a look at the Rules_FAQ document for all the details. I highlighted all the new changes in red.</div><div><br/></div><div>OK, I think that is all the official notification.  Now, LET THE GAMES (and taunting) COMMENCE!</div><div><br/></div><div>If this is your first year playing BINGO, this is what we do to cross of the cold winter days until its time to get out and find some boxes. It makes winter fly-by...you may not even notice the feet of snow you shovel.</div><div><br/></div><div>A of Atomic Beans<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div>
