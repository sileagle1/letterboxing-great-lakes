considered a techie too since I do a lot of techie stuff, AND I love <br>
Star Trek! Oops! That's Trekkie, sorry :-)<br>
<br>
And before I hear any more "teachers have the summer off" comments <br>
(grrr), I actually planned to take all of July off before my school <br>
tacked on more responsibilities for me to do during the summer.  <br>
Apparently checking in ALL of the textbooks, assessing fines, taking <br>
two AP Calculus workshops/classes, reviewing and deciding on two new <br>
textbooks, planning 5 courses (2 new), redesigning 5 school web <br>
pages, and getting ready for cross country season isn't enough to do <br>
during the summer!  (Sorry for the rant.)  <br>
<br>
Trust me, I can't wait to "get away" from it all!  Ah... peaceful <br>
Ohio beckons me with its 400-some boxes.............<br>
