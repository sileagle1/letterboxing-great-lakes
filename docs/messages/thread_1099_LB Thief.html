Actually, it's kind of fun having people contact me.I can get a feel on how<br/>
much activity an area is supporting.  I've also "met" some nice people this<br/>
way, whom I've invited to join the group.the benefit here also becomes<br/>
better informed letterboxers as they learn from what they read.<br/>

Oh no!  We were hoping to plan some boxing weekends in IL this<br/>
<br/>
spring/summer.  If I recall correctly, some other people in IL had problems<br/>
<br/>
last year with their boxes being destroyed.  Unfortunately you may have to<br/>
