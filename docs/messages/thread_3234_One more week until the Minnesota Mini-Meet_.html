<br>
If you're going to be in the Twin Cities area, feel free to stop on <br>
by!  It'll be a very casual, informal affair, just a chance to put <br>
faces with trail names and stamps and get to know other Minnesota <br>
letterboxers.  <br>
<br>
Place: Aster Cafe (125 Main Street, Minneapolis, MN) <br>
Time: 1:00 pm until ??<br>
Parking: There's a ramp a block or two away, the meters along Main <br>
Street aren't, well, metered on Sundays (that means free parking!) and <br>
there's street parking in the Marcy-Holmes neighborhood off of <br>
University Avenue.<br>
<br>
If you would like to come, you can sign up on AQ or email me at <br>
the_red_cat529@yahoo.com.  Or, of course, you could just show up.  <br>
