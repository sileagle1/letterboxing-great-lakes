                    <div class="plaintext-content">... but we're happy to report we did our first December boxing today!  <br>
We're out in Arizona and of course saw evidence of previous Great Lakes <br>
visitors.  We didn't recognize the trail names, but the first few boxes <br>
we found had already been stamped in by boxers from Illinois (Bothman <br>
Famiy from GraysLake) and boxers from Minnesota (Keith & Barb from <br>
Woodbury).<br>
<br>
Even after only 1 day of hiking & boxing we know we love this area!  <br>
Bright blue sunny skies and some great mountain hiking, what more could <br>
we ask for??  Here's more: we'll be meeting up with TipToe & Tonto in a <br>
few days when they make their annual trek to Tucson.  Should be fun to <br>
hike with this duo!<br>

P.S.  We have our BINGO cards with us so we won't miss the first few <br>
calls!<br>
