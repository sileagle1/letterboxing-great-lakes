someone fitting the description listed and say, "Hey, cough up the box?"<br/>
<br/>
July is totally out for me...if not at camp, I'm at work on the other<br/>
weekends.  Not sure what August holds yet.  When is Scout day?  I haven't<br/>
been there in eons either.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I hope to get over to Silver Springs to check out that box.<br/>
Plus I have four to place...two at camp and two for you guys.  One last<br/>
scouring to look for the AWOL FOOW2.  If definitely gone (not that I don't<br/>
believe you, Dragon, just in denial) I have a replacement ready.  I'll have<br/>
to pick a slightly different place, since I showed him a pic of where it<br/>
was!  Not sure where the other two are heading yet.  Have to look for<br/>
opportunity to strike!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, so in answer to your question, did I go boxing over the holiday...no,<br/>
but I was getting ready for this one!<br/>
<br/>
Dragon...your check should arrive soon.  I lied about when I mailed<br/>
it...didn't realize it was in my purse over the holiday weekend and I forgot<br/>
to get it out until yesterday.  Duh.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails to you!<br/>
