**************************************************** <br/>
Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to warn you all in Ohio about something that<br/>
ended up in my inbox<br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Back story:<br/>
<br/>
I was on vacation in Ohio last week, and planted two<br/>
boxes near our vacation house on Lake Erie. The clues<br/>
were up for a couple of days when I realized<br/>
(the hard way) that there's some kind of poisonous<br/>
plant near the tree where I planted Box #1. It doesn't<br/>
look like poison ivy, but let's just say that the<br/>
left side of my face got all red and swollen, but it<br/>
didn't itch. When I was trying to figure out where I<br/>
picked it up, I narrowed it down to that. On the<br/>
day we left, I removed the box, and updated the clue<br/>
on the letterboxing.org page, stating that it had been<br/>
removed, and why. Box #2 remains in its original<br/>
location. I just felt that it wouldn't be right to<br/>
send people to this location, after I got sick.<br/>
<br/>
I got an email tonight from someone saying that he was<br/>
upset that he couldn't find the Miniature Golf box. I<br/>
responded by telling him the story, but said<br/>
that I was glad that he had located my Eddie's Grill<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote back saying that he was very angry with me,<br/>
because he wasted a lot of time searching for the Mini<br/>
Golf box. He told me that he was going to<br/>
remove my Eddie's Grill box (which he has NO right to<br/>
do, but as I live in Connecticut, I have no way of<br/>
preventing him). He went on to say that he would<br/>
be relocating 15 boxes in eastern Ohio and attempting<br/>
to return the stamps to their owners, and that I've<br/>
ruined the hobby of letterboxing by removing the box<br/>
near the plants that would make people sick.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I can think of at this point is to<br/>
inform you of this, in case anyone here who has boxes<br/>
in Ohio wishes to write to this guy and tell him to<br/>
STAY AWAY from their boxes. I can forward his email<br/>
address. I'm sorry this happened. I really don't know<br/>
what else to do about this, but I did email<br/>
him and ask him not to remove my Eddie's Grill box, or<br/>
anyone else's. I also told him that I stand by my<br/>
decision to remove the Mini Golf box, rather than to<br/>
leave it in a location that may cause other people to<br/>
have an allergic reaction, particularly because I<br/>
updated the website on the same day.<br/>

I mean, it sucks that that guy got sick, but the placer tried to be responsible and remove the box before too much harm happened.  And obvisouly that guy just didn't get that you won't always find what you set out to find.... I'm sure we all agree, though, that despite his grudge he has no right to mess with others' boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
With time restraints, I'm not going to have a chance to check on a lot of the NE Ohio boxes since a lot of them are at least a half hour drive from where we live.  As much as I want to be guardian angel for them...I'll try to check on some of the closer boxes this weekend, though.<br/>

<br/>
Since the boxes threatened in the below message are my area's boxes, and I don't believe that a lot of the placers belong to the Big List to even know what's being threatened, I took it upon myself to ask Chrissy for the writer's contact info.  I assumed it was maybe a newbie who hadn't learned to deal with the disappointment of not always finding what you set out to seek.  I searched for the person's trail name, and he's a member of the Big List who's been boxing for a few years, which completely shocked me.  Why would someone who letterboxes, and reads the Big List, make threats to destroy boxes placed by people who had nothing to do with his experience?  I wrote to him, and this is what his response was.  I wanted to quote it directly, because I didn't think I'd get the "mwah-ha-ha-ha" mad scientist tone I'm inferring from it if I paraphrased:<br/>
<br/>
"This Chrissy was the first I've ever encountered who placed a box, posted the clue, and removed the box and left the clue on the list.  That is not funny.  Nor is what I am going<br/>
to do about it!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, this guy lives a few hours away from any boxes in Ohio, so would he REALLY drive all that way just for a sabatoge mission - but he almost sounds crazy enough to do it.  (For the record, Chrissy DID post on letterboxing.org that the box had been pulled.)  Should Ohio be taking his threats seriously?  Or do you think he's simply resorting to terrorist tactics to ruin letterboxing in my state, where we'll all pull our boxes and clues so that he won't potentially harm them?  Any ideas on how to handle this?  Should I call him out on the Big List, so that anyone who does have their box sabatoged knows who's responsible?  The Big List doesn't seem too concerned with the threats in the initial post.  Should I just move to Southern Ohio, which he doesn't seem interested in?  (But I don't want to root for the Reds...no offense to any Reds fans.)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your wise counsel.<br/>
