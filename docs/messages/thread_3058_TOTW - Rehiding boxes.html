                    <div class="plaintext-content">  There is an interesting thread going on right now on the NY board <br/>
about rehiding boxes. Basically about the explosion of new boxers <br/>
and boxes being left out in the open. There is also an email about a <br/>
series of boxes that were found after a VERY experienced boxer was <br/>
the last to stamp in that were also all left out in the open.<br/>
<br/>
 My question is this - If someone found a box that you were the last <br/>
one stamped into would you be offended if that person emailed you <br/>
and let you know?? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Personally I would not. I have learned alot about rehiding boxes <br/>
since we started. My feeling is that yes it appears to us that we <br/>
rehid a box well enough that weeks or months later the box is still <br/>
well hidden and if no one ever contacts us to let us know it was not <br/>
how would we ever be able to improve upon it ???<br/>
<br/>
  Is there a page or article out there that talks about the things <br/>
to do or not to do when rehiding a box?? Sometimes the obvious do <br/>
not sprinkle a handful of dry leaves over the top of a box and call <br/>
it rehidden needs to be said.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Cindi and all,<br/>
The very same thing is happening in central and southern Ohio after a <br/>
couple of magazine articles about letterboxing were published.  I just <br/>
walked in my house from taking a hike in a nature preserve where I have <br/>
7 boxes placed and every single one of them was left in the open or very <br/>
close to it.  In our area, we are finding that folks are going out in <br/>
large groups (10-18 ppl?!) and the last one is perhaps being left <br/>
behind?? and not taking the time to rehide well.  We are also seeing <br/>
that some of the very best stamps are being stolen.  We are seeing <br/>
geocachers are taking the stamp (and in my case leaving a quilting <br/>
brochure in it's place??) and we are seeing that some parents (not all) <br/>
are perhaps letting the kids toss the box back on the ground, not <br/>
covering with the original rocks or logs etc. as well. <br/>
<br/>
To answer your question, I personally would like to have someone let me <br/>
know....if I didn't do a good job and would not be offended, but I also <br/>
know that when I have given some VERY gentle feedback about clues, I <br/>
have gotten some mighty strong feedback.  I look back at this point and <br/>
wonder how well I put boxes back when I first started.  What I read <br/>
constantly was to be discrete and so I was very worried about that far <br/>
more than anything else and so I may have compromised a bit in the <br/>
beginning.  It wasn't until I carved and put my first box out there that <br/>
I began to understand that a box is best if it is sort of anchored down <br/>
etc.  Some placers ONLY use leaves to cover and I just cringe knowing <br/>
there will be problems after I have stamped in and recovered with only <br/>
leaves because there were no rocks in the area they chose.   This IS <br/>
when I have gone back to let them know I found their box, the clues and <br/>
stamp were fantastic, but that an animal or bad storm will blow their <br/>
box right out into the open.  This is where I really learned from others <br/>
about better placement choices--when others gave ME feedback.<br/>
<br/>
I have been trying to let new letterboxers in my area know these things <br/>
via email and encouraging them to come to an event.  This way they may <br/>
be able to pick up some of these things including "leave no trace" habits. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know that my comments have solved anything, but I'm hoping to <br/>
hear how others are handling this as well!  Thanks for letting us know <br/>
Cindi!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been very interested in the topic of rehiding boxes.  Most of my boxes are in the Marshall County area of IN.  I however live in Columbus, OH.  I have had a number of missing boxes (9) the past few months.  There are a lot of new boxers in the area (which is what I was hoping would happen when I planted).  Many are families who are very excited about their new hobby.  But I think what is happening is one child gets to retrieve the box and another child replaces it, not knowing where it really goes or how it was concelled.  My suggestion is if the person who found it isn't rehiding it: the box should not be removed until everyone sees how it was hidden - and maybe discuss if they think it needs to be hidden even better, maybe the last person was careless.  Another problem seems to be lids not replace tightly.  Also if there is a stone that is supposed to be one top of the box, put it back!  It may be there to hide or in some cases to keep animals from carring it away.<br/>
  One of my boxes hidden along an old highway behind and tucked under a rock with a historical marker was left on top of the rock in plain view.  Are they gathering the supplies and getting littles ones into the car and seatbelts and not even paying attention to where the box is being placed?  Full of Heart happened to see it when she was driving by!!!  <br/>
  I think this is a wonderful family activity and a great opportuity to teach so many things - respect for the prize should be one. "How can we take as good or better care of the box that we have found so others will enjoy it too."  I had thought about pulling all my boxes.  I replaced one in an eight box series and it was gone the next week!!!  Just needed to vent.  Sorry.  I always read the emails but have never written - you're probably wishing I hadn't started :)<br/>

by leaves we try to find bark, rocks, log, anything at all to hide it <br/>

be a diplomatic as possible about it.  Boxes out in the open are not <br/>
always the fault of the previous placer.  I have one box in paticular <br/>
that every time I'd check on it, it would be out of the log it was <br/>
hidden in.  I couldn't figure out what was up, until I started to <br/>
notice some teeth marks in the box.  I guess the critter that lived in <br/>
the log did not like sharing his space.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Because of the way I have my clues posted on LbNA ("contact me to obtain the rest of the clues"), I have been getting a LOT of messages from new boxers.  It is interesting to "see" their thought processes, which may give some insight as to what everyone is mentioning about poorly hidden boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
 It sounds like many of them can't wait to create and hide their first box, often without the experience of finding a good number of boxes first.  For example, someone wanted to find one of my indoor "password protected" boxes before placing their first.  I warned them that that particular box was not a typical letterbox and would not give their children a good idea of what the sport entailed.  Perhaps we are seeing the letterboxing version of the "telephone game", where the examples the new boxers are following are not the best ones, as the hiding techniques have gotten lax over time???<br/>
<br/>
 We must all remember that letterboxing is a four-season activity - the fall leaves will be gone come spring, and the spring-hidden landmarks may become overgrown by summer.  And snow - I won't even go there...!<br/>

We who have even only planted a few boxes realize the time, effort and thought that went into them. I agree that the gentle feedback mentioned is helpful and appreciate hearing and reading it.  Sometimes we hide a box and it appears to be quiet but lo and behold later in a season some activity is booming and no one can get to the box.  <br/>
