                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, we went out to find the Lake Park Series in Downtown Milwaukee. We found the first of the two boxes in the series with no problem (#1 was in bad shape and I am attempting to contact Agent Ink about it). We searched in vain for #3. Normally I would attribute this to our unrefined skills in locating hard-to-find boxes but these boxes were placed six years ago and likelihood that one has gone missing is greater than normal. <br>
<br>
I am curious to know if anyone has found Lake Park #3 in the last six months to a year. If someone has, we will go back out and make another attempt. If not, We will chalk this up as missing box and not worry about it.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>
