                    <div class="plaintext-content">Both the Twin Cities Area Gathering and the Fall 2006 Northern IL <br>
gathering sound like great ideas!<br>
<br>
I imagine during the next few months as our letterboxing activity <br>
subsides a bit for the winter, we will see others begin planning for <br>
more localized events in the Great Lakes states.<br>
<br>
I am thinking that to keep everything straight, let's use the group's <br>
calendar feature so everyone is aware of gatherings that are in the <br>
planning stages and can plan their own events and vacations accordingly.<br>
<br>
If you don't know the exact date or location for your event yet, that <br>
is fine, just make an entry on the first day of the month you are <br>
planning (you can always moved it later if you want to).<br>
<br>
I have added the MI Fall Gathering in October 2006, as Azobox and I <br>
have decided to make this a yearly thing.  Date and location are still <br>
unknowns.<br>

<br>
22-OCT-05  Get a Clue Gathering, MI (SpringChick & Azobox)<br>
<br>
<br>
We could possibly use the calendar to record past events or a simple <br>
file could be developed and included in the files section of this <br>
group.  If others think this is a good idea, I'd be willing to compile <br>
the info.  There may be other details we might like to include for each <br>
event, so feel free to post your ideas.<br>

I also wanted to mention that there is a new Yahoo! group in the works for Letterbox Event Planners across the country, which will also be very helpful for future planners to be able to find information and resources as they plan their events.  I should be able to pass on additional information on that by early next week.<br>
