<br/>
The first mailing is going out on Monday for those who have requested passports.  Sorry for the delay -- beauacracy you know...  things got caught up in the red tape between the Kalamazoo office and the Muskegon office, but all is back in order and final processing and paperwork was completed yesterday.  We trust that those who are anxiously awaiting with their carpet bags packed will find the adventure to have been worth the wait.  We intend to keep this series up and running for at least a couple of seasons so you should be okay for next year if you make it back to MI then.<br/>
<br/>
Just as a reminder...  in order to qualify for the bonus "Around the World in 80 Days" stamp, you have to complete the 15 boxes in 80 days -- 80 calendar days as measured from the day the passport in mailed to you until you return to us the "postcard" of your travels (this is explained in the passport), so if you are hoping to get the "80 Days" bonus stamp, don't request the passport until your schedule will allow you to do some traveling.  If you just want to find the letterboxes, but don't care so much about the bonus "80 Days" stamp, feel free to request the passport at any time.  There is also a bonus "World Traveler" stamp for anyone who completes the entire 15-box series, no matter how long it takes.  To give you a little idea as to the travel requirements -- the boxes are located throughout the lower peninsula of Michigan.<br/>

  Sounds very interesting!  Too bad we probably won't be back in MI this year.<br/>
  Maybe next year ...  Hopefully the "Around the World" series will still be<br/>
  available then also.<br/>

  Team Bindlestiff announcing the creation of our latest series.<br/>
<br/>
  The first few boxes have been placed and clues have been posted.  You<br/>
  can find the clues on letterboxing.org and our yahoogroup. FYI- lots<br/>
  more interesting stuff at our yahoogroup than what is at the big site.<br/>
<br/>
  We anticipate this to be a very long-term project (series) with<br/>
  constant additions, albeit at irregular intervals.<br/>
<br/>
  With the Hobo signs series, I'm limbering up my writing skills so I<br/>
  can put together a good tale of story-based clues for the series we<br/>
  are working in cooperation with the DogLvrs family on.<br/>
<br/>
  HINT: The plot line of our cooperative series involves the Greatest<br/>
  Piano Teacher in the World having her Piano kidnapped by an evil<br/>
  character who not only wants to silence music but also to keep<br/>
  children from ever being able to create it in the future. The stamps<br/>
  for this large-ish series are all carved, the location all picked out<br/>
  with the prelim trips made. We simply need to coordinate our schedules<br/>
  to get them placed (not an easy feat in the summer!)<br/>
