Martini Man is putting his box together and we're packing our <br>

early so we can plant our boxes before it gets dark tomorrow night <br>
(assuming any storms are finished!).<br>

We're looking forward to seeing a bunch of you on Saturday!<br>

P.S.  I think Indiana is up for the GLG next year, assuming someone is<br>
willing to host (and can get a place reserved soon).<br>

the Mid-Atlantic. Have fun, every one! And remember to check for ticks<br>
