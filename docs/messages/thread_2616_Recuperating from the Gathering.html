                    <div class="plaintext-content">We add our heartfelt thanks to Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man for <br>
all their hard work in hosting an awesome gathering!! We truly <br>
appreciated their organization, the Web site, the clever clues and <br>
hiding spots, the post event pizza party, etc.  Thank you to <br>
everyone who carved such great stamps--they are definitely works of <br>
art.  The Traveling Event Stamp Showcase stamps were a delight as <br>
well.  I knew that IL had some great carvers--I can't wait until we <br>
go to Michigan this summer to see some more of the great Michigan <br>
carvers.  <br>
<br>
I couldn't convince my not-as-obsessed family to come back on Sunday <br>
to look for more stamps.  Even so, I logged in 70+ stamps between <br>
letterboxes, all those event stamps, and exchanges.  No wonder my <br>
ink pads were drying up!  Even though I would have liked to hunt <br>
more boxes on Sunday, it was nice to put our feet up at our campsite <br>
and start recovering from all of Saturday's hiking and other <br>
busyness.  Since so many of the boxes are permanent, we'll just have <br>
to make another trip up to Wisconsin.  <br>
<br>
I really enjoyed meeting so many fellow letterboxers--putting faces <br>
to postings or to stamps I've seen in logbooks.  I couldn't believe<br>
(well, really I could) how pleasant everyone was and how easy people <br>
were to talk to.  Boxers are a great group of people.  I wish we <br>
could have stayed longer at the post event pizza party--I know there <br>
were some people we didn't have a chance to meet--but our camp site <br>
was half an hour away and we didn't want to get locked out (in case <br>
the DNR were overly punctual about closing the gates).  We got back <br>
with a little bit of time to spare and crawled into our tent for a <br>
good night's sleep.<br>
<br>
The best part of the event for me was meeting so many people--and <br>
logging my 200th find!  The last box of the day was #200, which I <br>
didn't realize until Monday.  The kid's hightlight--in a morbid <br>
sense--was stumbling upon a severed deer head on the path on the way <br>
to White Rabbit #3.  To each his own.  Can't wait until the next <br>
gathering!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We too are relishing and recuperating from the gathering....and <br>
replacing all the things Tiptoe lost...too bad we didn't win the <br>
BINGO booty, we could use it!  As for the fascinating "fawn head" - <br>
we saw it as well, but with a twist.  As we were approaching that <br>
area, we spooked a "four-legged coyote" by the kill and it ran off <br>
into the fields to the south.  This was the first time we'd ever <br>
seen a coyote while letterboxing, but the twist is that we were <br>
boxing with the "two-legged howling coyote" who calmly claimed that <br>
she sees a coyote just about every time she's out boxing!<br>
<br>
We ran her ragged around that park in order to keep her pre-occupied <br>
from thinking about biting our heads off!  We reminded her that she <br>
now gets to go into the T&T Hall of Fame for surviving a <br>
letterboxing outing with Tiptoe & Tonto....Dragon also qualifies for <br>
bravely accompanying us in the morning round!<br>
<br>
Speaking of Dragon, he did it again this gathering by coming up with <br>
the most clever "Drink Me" box...We still are talking about <br>
his "Mo'Mustang" box from the 2005 gathering..What will he think of <br>
next?<br>
<br>
A big thanks to all you incredible GLK carvers - the quality is <br>
reaching an all-time artistic high.  You can stand proud in the <br>
world of letterboxing!<br>
<br>
Oh, and before we forget,to whomever made that incredible log book <br>
for the Great Lakes Traveling Showcase...WOW, Awesome, You the Girl! <br>
You are the best!...Need we go on? Is that enough words of <br>
affirmation?  Ruff..Ruff!<br>
<br>
We echo the kudos lavished on Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man - you <br>
two are incredible!  Thanks just doesn't do your deeds justice, but <br>
will have to suffice until we can come up with a way to crown you <br>
the Letterboxing King and Queen of Gatherings!  <br>
If we're not mistaken, that would make Tabby Tales the Queen Mother <br>
of Letterboxing.  Right?<br>
<br>
It was a pleasure seeing former boxing mates and meeting new ones!<br>
A great way to kick off the letterboxing season!<br>
Be safe & box responsibly!<br>
Tiptoe & Tonto<br>
