                    <div class="plaintext-content">Saturday was a beautiful day for boxing--we found 3 boxes (and a HH)<br/>
and had the time to plant 2 boxes.  We decided to do a series on the <br/>
Underground Railroad, which I have always been interested in.  I read <br/>
a book about the Underground RR in Illinois and was surprised by all <br/>
the nearby sites. So we decided to plant some boxes by some authentic <br/>
sites.  The stamps will all be quilt patterns that are supposedly <br/>
connected with the UGRR (I say supposedly because some historians <br/>
think this quilt code is real and others think it is fiction).  Either <br/>
way, it is interesting and gives us ideas for stamp images to carve.  <br/>
I like quilts, but since I can't sew I guess I'm left with carving <br/>
quilt pieces. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  we hope people will enjoy visiting these historic sites--and <br/>
finding a letterbox to boot.  The first 2 boxes are in the <br/>
Maywood/River Forest area and in Lombard.  Hopefully it won't take us <br/>
too long to explore some other sites and plant some boxes.<br/>

I was planning on having a Underground letterbox at the Levi Coffin House.<br/>
 Haven't started working on it yet, but I have ideas.  If you are<br/>
interested, I hear the Freedom Center in Cincinnati is not to be missed. <br/>
I plan to get down there sometime this fall (and snag a few boxes on my<br/>
way home.)<br/>

I had thought about that possiblilty.  However, these stamps will <br/>
probably be rolling out slowly--we just didn't have the time to do all <br/>
the stamps and find hiding places close to the historic sites.  Plus, <br/>
each stamp (so far--we've only carved 3) is about 2 inches square, so <br/>
it might be hard to fit too many onto a page.  So far, they are about <br/>
the same size so they would probably fit together OK.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm working on replacing the one that Pippi had out at Graue Mill.  I hadn't<br/>
really bothered with the DuPage County Forest Preserves because of the<br/>
permit that's now required, but that was one of my favorite stamps, so I'm<br/>
hoping to place that one back there again.  I've got the permit, but<br/>
supposedly the placer has to meet with someone from the forest preserve<br/>
district at the site, so I don't know how tricky the timing of that might<br/>
be.  It'll depend on when that person is available to meet.   If they allow<br/>
the placement with the permit, that box will go back on LbNA instead of just<br/>
my own little website.<br/>
<br/>
Tho Pippi thought it would be hard to find and thus wouldn't get all much<br/>
traffic.  But a lot of folks found it.  I think there's at least one full<br/>
logbook, if not two, to go with that box.  But talk about not re-hiding<br/>
well.  That was one Keith was complaining about all the time whenever he<br/>
went out to check on it.  Thankfully, it won't be too far for me to go check<br/>
on.  If the forest preserve district approves it, that is.<br/>
<br/>
If the permit for that one goes well, I might also apply for a permit to put<br/>
back the Underground Railroad one that Pippi had at Blackwell Forest<br/>
Preserve.<br/>
<br/>
That's such an important part of history for this area that it would be nice<br/>
to see a lot of boxes devoted to it.<br/>
