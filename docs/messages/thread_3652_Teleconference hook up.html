  Cool, the teleconference idea will be fun! Come on Michiganders... we're hoping to have a few more voices coming from our side of the lake ;-) and looking forward to a day to just sit around and carve and talk letterboxing.<br>
<br>
  BTW -- I am willing to relinquish the rat to anyone who is going to the event and would like to be included in the carving. Otherwise I will happily contribute my rat.<br>

  Sure, SC, we'd love to have you attend vicariously through your Rat <br>
  stamp, and Mrs. D. if you'd like to do the dog, I relinquish to you (I <br>
  love your doggie stamps!).<br>
<br>
  As to the Tiger, both Martini Man and Big Brat have offered. I'll let <br>
  you two duke it out between yourselves...just let me know who will be <br>
  carving it so I can log it in on AQ.<br>
<br>
  Speaking of the East Siders (of the Lake) who will be meeting on the <br>
  same day as us West Siders...we're going to perhaps witness a <br>
  letterboxing first. I was talking to Doglvrs offlist the other day. <br>
  We're going to hold a cellphone teleconference between the two <br>
  gatherings! Is that cool or what?!?!<br>
