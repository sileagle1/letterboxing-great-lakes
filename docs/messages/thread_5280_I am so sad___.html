than I)invited me along to the 10th anniversary event!  Eagerly I<br/>
signed up and said I would bring my signature Spicy Western Bean dish<br/>
to share...I checked out the travelers, started thinking about what<br/>
else I could bring, was looking at boxes nearby and POOF!  DD16 comes<br/>
in and says, "Mom, did you forget that Matt's wedding is on the 4th?"<br/>
<now cartoons="" deflating="" from="" hear="" noise="" that="" the="" you="">  Well, all the<br/>
air certainly was let out of MY balloon!<br/>
I will be there in spirit fellow letterboxers!  I had such fun at the<br/>
mini-meet and was really looking forward to Door County in the fall! <br/>
Maybe the next one!  Terrio<br/>
