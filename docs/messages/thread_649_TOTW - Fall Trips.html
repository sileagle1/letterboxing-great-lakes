just so happy to be outside in the woods when it's not hot and <br>
humid - and BUGGY - that anyplace is fine.....from a small city park <br>
to a National Forest.  I love temps in the 60's & 70's and find that <br>
as I continue to have "power surges", lower temperatures are easier <br>
to take so summer is my least favorite season.  First Fall, then <br>
Spring, Winter next.....and Summer I just have to try and survive! :)<br>
<br>
Had two nice days of boxing this weekend and got my "F" count to 25 <br>
which encompasses 6 states.  Still hoping to find a hitchhiker and <br>
am thinking of making the first stamp I try carving a HH to ease <br>
into this business of planting.<br>
<br>
Eileen......hmmmm, must re-read Delirium's message about trail names <br>
(what a crack-up that was!)<br>
