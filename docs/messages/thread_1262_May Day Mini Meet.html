HavyBeaks and I had fun meeting other letterboxers for the first time.<br/>
 We're glad we changed our plans around so that we'd be able to come<br/>
and hang out for a while.  Sorry we had to take off a little early<br/>
though.  Hope you didn't get rained on (or hailed upon) too much!<br/>

Kadoolies getting all of the exchanges; finding out more about each <br/>
other; sharing stories, personal travelers, AND someone even caught <br/>
a "cootie" (which they passed on) There was good food, prizes, laughs <br/>
and all kinds of good confusion goin' on. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Enders Angel and I had to leave before the boxing began, but it <br/>
was the very last day to get all the remaining "stuff" Bindle Bum and <br/>
I had left at the off-season rental house.  Thanks everyone who <br/>
picked up some parent sheets of paper, inpads and re-inkers .. you <br/>
saved them from the Goodwill donation box (grin)<br/>
<br/>
It was great fun to put names and faces together. Now I'm really <br/>
looking gforward to the GL gathering!<br/>
<br/>
The pictures I took are stuck in my digital camera for a few days. I <br/>
had hoped to get them posted as soon as I got back, but Bindle Bum <br/>
had already taken down my desktop, the wireless net and had the phone <br/>
service off.  We've stashed some of our "stuff" at my MIL's in <br/>
Traverse City .. when we go up this weekend, I'll have access to my <br/>
desktop again so I can get the pictures posted. For now it's back to <br/>
only being able to use the computer at the library.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who wants a copy of the group shot, email me and I'll figure <br/>
out a way to get you a high res file of it that you can print.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Mrs DogLvrs for being the hostess with the mostess.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
