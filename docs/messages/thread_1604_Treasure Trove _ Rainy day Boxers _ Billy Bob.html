                    <div class="plaintext-content">Three Things:<br>
1.  Treasure Trove:  I was just wondering if anyone was trying to solve <br>
the Treasure Trove book puzzle.  Although 8 of the 15 prizes have been <br>
found (you find a gold token - sorta like CATCF) and can redeem it for <br>
a jeweled bug.  Three of the ones found were in knot holes of trees.  <br>
Any way, I bought the book for my great nieces at Christmas and I <br>
finally started looking at mine copy because they were pestering me and <br>
it is fun.  Why I'm asking - I'm in NW Ohio and if someone near me is <br>
working on it, I'd be glad to help and mostly I'd like to learn more <br>
about doing these type of mysteries. My goal - sharpen my ciphering <br>
skills.<br>
<br>
2.  Rainy Day Boxers:  Yesterday as I was all dressed for work (that <br>
means stockings, suit, polished shoes) jumped in my car and roared out <br>
the driveway only to be stopped by a truck at the end of the driveway!  <br>
It was Letterboxers that were checking out a nearby box and it was <br>
raining, so they parked in my driveway to stamp out of the rain.  I <br>
think I really startled them!  Such fun to finally meet someone while <br>
boxing.<br>
<br>
3.  Billy Bob:  While looking for one of Spring Chicks Lighthouse boxes <br>
in MI, we arrived at the park with <br>
1)gas light of car blinking <br>
2)9:30 PM and yes, it was getting dark even in MI in the summer <br>
3)no sticker for park on car.  That is where Billy Bob Thorton comes <br>
in.  You see, I'm sure that the DNR Ranger was really the famous actor <br>
working on his next movie getting first had knowledge about parks.  He <br>
flagged me down at the gate (I was going to stop, really) and asked <br>
what I wanted to do this late in the evening - due to my honest nature <br>
and dumb struckness at the thought that this was Billy Bob - I blurted <br>
out:<br>
"I'm here to look at the 'letter-light house'".  The passengers in my <br>
car went silent, you could cut the air with a lumberman's axe and he <br>
responded:<br>
"The Letter-Light House? Well, just get out of my hair and go do what <br>
you need to do".  With that Billy Bob waved us through without a <br>
sticker and we directly found what we came for and even made it to the <br>
gas station. I did purchase an out of state sticker for MI at the next <br>
park  want to support those great parks.<br>
<br>
So stealth is something I have to work on - but FUN I am having.  <br>
You'll know me if you see me on the trail - I'm probably still looking <br>
for Billy Bob and am often confounded by the three dog leases tangled <br>
about my legs with a compass in my hand.<br>
<br>
Happy Boxing.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few of us in Rockford were working on the Treasure's Trove book for a <br>
couple weeks. I got annoyed with it much faster than the others. I knew <br>
that the ciphers were way above my head...and now that I have heard <br>
about some of the solutions I KNOW I would never have figured them <br>
out. ;) Once in a great while I will pick it up and look through it. <br>
Now I'm just waiting for all the tokens to be found so they will print <br>
a solution book.<br>
<br>
Good luck with the stealth! When I've arrived at a park late, I always <br>
want to say, "My child left something here and I just have to find it." <br>
That would solve the problem of rooting around in the leaves too. But <br>
the problem is...I don't have kids! Maybe next time you could say you <br>
are from out of town and are on your way home, but you just HAVE to get <br>
that last picture before leaving. Make sure you have a camera <br>
though...lol. At least your park ranger was a little nicer than the one <br>
we encountered while looking for the Dead River box. ;)<br>
