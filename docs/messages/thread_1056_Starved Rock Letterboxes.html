Hello Group,<br/>
I am new to Letterboxing, it's nice to have this place to get <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Just kind of an FYI - I recently stayed at Starved Rock, and talked <br/>
with some of the staff there.  We were trying to locate the Starved <br/>
Rock Lodge #3 Letterbox, no luck.  The staff told us that the hiding <br/>
place for SR #3 had been moved, and that they had not yet decided on  <br/>
a new location.  Also, SR #5 "The Point" is missing.  Again, they <br/>
have a replacement for #5, but have not placed it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing,<br/>
Mike<br/>

I know #5 had disappeared some time between July and early October.  I<br/>
didn't know that the staff at SR Lodge were behind that series of boxes.<br/>
Hmmm.  Learn something new every day!   Thanks for the scoop.<br/>
