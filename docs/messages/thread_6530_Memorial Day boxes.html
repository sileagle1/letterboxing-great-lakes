As a result of our excursion, we can HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Memorial Day boxes that CC Family has planted. They are temporary and will only be available until mid-June. We were able to find the first 5 tonight and are looking forward to finding the 6th sometime next week.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On a day when our military was very much in the news, we had the pleasure of finding this year's edition of Memorial Day boxes created by the CC Family.  If you've found previous series by them, you know how much work they put into them - amazing carvings accompanied by clues and logbooks that give a glimpse of specific individuals and battles throughout US history.  They create a story that starts in the clues and is completed in the logbook, which also includes several photos.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in these 6 new boxes, put them on your "TO DO" list soon, since they are listed as only being available in May and June.  Here's a link to the first box clue:<br>
<br>

<br>
All boxes are listed separately, but can easily be done as a 1-2 hour series.<br>
<br>
Thanks CC Family!<br>
