                    <div class="plaintext-content">One of my favorite places to get containers is Dollar General.  All of the ones here in Champaign/Urbana carry a brand called Aero.  I think they sell the larger of the two sizes that I use 2 for $2 and the smaller size 3 for $2, but it's been a while so I don't really remember.  I have found them to be quite durable...even when chewed!  Several of my Hidden Village boxes have chew marks on them, but no punctures.  As for duct tape, I usually get that at Walmart.  This time of year, they should have some in the sporting section with the hunting stuff.<br>

We've had problems with critters enjoying those Rubbermaid boxes.  We <br>
originally thought the Rubbermaid containers seemed like the sturdiest <br>
choice and sealed tightly, but that doesn't help when those rubber-<br>
loving critters gnaw through the cover.  I'm considering going back to <br>
harder plastic which isn't so attractive to the critters (but more <br>
prone to cracking....)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Birdwoman,<br>
I've tired lots of differnt boxes.  My favorites du jour are either the <br>
Country Lemonade or any type of powdered drink mix containers. I run <br>
them through the diswasher at least 2 times.  Wrap them in camo tape <br>
and then they are ready.  I have also cut the top lip down so that I <br>
could get a larger log book into one of these - other wise you either <br>
need a flexable one or small.  Haven't had a problem with critters <br>
eating through, yet.<br>
<br>
I get my camo tape at Cabelas - mail order - saves driving around  <br>
