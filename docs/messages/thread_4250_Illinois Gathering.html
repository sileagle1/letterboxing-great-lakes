Pavilion there for $20 last September for my husband's luau (50th BD) <br/>
and it was for the WHOLE day!  I was floored.<br/>
<br/>
It's big, has a fire place and lots of tables, as well as decent <br/>
bathrooms.<br/>
<br/>
I also realize it's the same place they had the Mining For Boxes <br/>
event, but that might be an advantage as everyone has already been <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Forest Glen was also a good idea!<br/>
<br/>
Will Katy be moved by then or could this also be her last "Illinois" <br/>
gathering?<br/>
