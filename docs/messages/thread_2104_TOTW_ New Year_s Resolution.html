  Every weekend this year that there was a gathering, I had some crazy family function or some prior committment that I couldn't get out of.<br/>
  I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone!<br/>
  Oh, and I have to carve my personal traveler too   :-)<br/>
<br/>
  Happy holidays!<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
