We will be driving up to the Livonia area Friday (the 7th of July). <br/>
Saturday we will be boxing in Ann Arbor. We have to get Brave Little <br/>
Buckeye (and we'll get some others too)! And then we'll have dinner in <br/>
Troy. <br/>
Anyone want to meet (maybe Friday evening) for an exchange? <br/>

love 'boxing there!  If you're going for the Little Buckeye, I know <br/>
Flying Saucer is not too far and it was one of my favorite walks.  <br/>
Kind of long, but interesting trail and fun clues.  I had several <br/>
others I was going to recommend, but I see that the clues are gone <br/>
now.  And there are a lot I haven't done, so I can't really give you <br/>
any advice.  I guess letterboxing is a dynamic hobby!<br/>
<br/>
If you happen to take Pontiac Trail on the way from Ann Arbor to <br/>
Troy, you might check out the Wetlands Wanderer (3 boxes) and Seasons <br/>
(4 boxes) series.  I haven't heard anything about the Seasons boxes <br/>
in a while (they're not mine), but I know the Wetlands series is all <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I have plans for Friday night, or I'd love to do an <br/>
exchange.  Hey, what time are you coming?  I work right off the <br/>
highway in Livonia!  Good luck, happy anniversary, and enjoy your <br/>
southeastern Michigan experience!<br/>
