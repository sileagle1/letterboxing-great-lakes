<br/>
  Sorry for any cross-posting.<br/>
<br/>
  It is with sadness and excitement that I make the announcement:  we are moving to Salt Lake City!  My husband starts a new job there Sept. 5.  <br/>
  It is all happening much faster than we anticipated.<br/>
  I will still be here for a while to wrap up the house sale, etc., and make sure that my mom is fully recovered from her hysterectomy, its been a rough month for her.<br/>
<br/>
  I am hoping that someone will adopt my boxes I have planted here, since I will not be around to look after them.<br/>
<br/>
  Hopefully when the dust settles, Ill start back up postal boxing again.<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

with you on Earth Day..or a Linus mini-meet...You really didn't have <br/>
to go to such lengths to avoid us as your boxing partners at a <br/>
gathering?  Letterboxing just won't be the same without you!  This <br/>
duo will really miss you!  How could your "pirate" husband do such a <br/>
thing as move you to Utah...for Pete's Sake he can't even make <br/>
someone walk the plank - they'd float in that Salt Lake of theirs!<br/>
Do promise us that you will keep in touch - you never know when <br/>
travels might take us to Utah!  <br/>
We will all miss your wonderfully carved stamps and infectious <br/>
laugh!...We hope you will find time to plant some great stamps in <br/>
your new stomping grounds!  Watch out Utah...a coyote is a comin' -  <br/>
the likes you've never seen before!<br/>
We send along prayers for a safe &amp; smooth transition from <br/>
Midwesterner to Westerner!<br/>
