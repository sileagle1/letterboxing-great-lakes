                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks to Housepitality Hostess and Happy2Bmom (and other helpers) for a fun event!  The many pirate themed decorations were fantastic and the very creative clues added to the fun of finding all the fabulous pirate stamps.  Adding to the enjoyment of the event was seeing so many folks dressed in pirate garb. <br/>
<br/>
As always, it was nice to chat with people we have known for quite a while and also meet a few new folks.  The park was very scenic with some nice trails and we had to drag ourselves back by the deadline for prize drawings and much needed food.  The potluck provided lots of tasty treats and we (and many others) headed back out to find more boxes before they closed the park at 7:30 pm.  Some of us were back at the park before 7:30 a.m. this morning to find even MORE of the boxes and help collect them since they were only allowed as temporary boxes.  I don't have a final count of the clues - but there were definitely well over 100 boxes out there!<br/>

I uploaded a group photo and may add a few more later this week.  Here's a link to the photo and if you want to see a larger view to see a close-up of people, just click on "Original" near the top left above photo.<br/>

Looking forward to more gatherings in the Great Lakes region in the next year!<br/>
