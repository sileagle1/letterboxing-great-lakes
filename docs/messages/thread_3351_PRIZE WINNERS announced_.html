contest Bindlebabe!  Congratulations to all the winners.  Thanks to <br/>
all the placers in MI that helped fill up the state!  And thanks to <br/>
Dragon and the other Wisconsinites that helped make a great race.  I <br/>
hope you fill up the rest of the state soon.  May Wisconsin <br/>
be "fully boxed" by 2007!<br/>
<br/>
Happy post-Thanksgiving everyone!  I hope you all had a wonderful <br/>
holiday and are recovering nicely.  I didn't manage to get any <br/>
boxing in yesterday.  I wanted to plant a box in Oakland County <br/>
yesterday on my way to or from my destination.  But it didn't work <br/>
out.  I hope to get there tomorrow to launch my new gnome box.  Be <br/>
on the lookout for Jerome.  He's hoping to have many visitors from <br/>
you all soon!<br/>
