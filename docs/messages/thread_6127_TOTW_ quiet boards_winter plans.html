Nonetheless, as for the TOTW, we think ALL of the seasons are beautiful...think winter woods!  That is precisely why we love living in the midwest - we get to experience the full onslaught of all seasons (Well, maybe Spring is too short and muddy!)  But all offer great opportunities for hiking.  That said, we are sorely going to miss "escaping" to Arizona this winter!<br/>
We've said before, and it bears repeating, one of our all-time favorite events was the mid-winter outdoor Iditarod event!  And as we recall, there was an event in Wisconsin a few winters ago that, if not enjoyable, was certainly memorable for several on the board!<br/>

Awww, Ggghiker, you really should have planned an LB gathering just for my <br/>
birthday (onthe 17th)...just kidding! I only have one possible conflict - I <br/>
really hope they're on separate weekends.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love winter boxing.  The cold does not stop me, though I have had some<br/>
difficulties in the past because of the frozen water.  There was one<br/>
letterbox I could not find because it was very difficult to determine where<br/>
the "dry creek bed" was under several feet of snow.  There was another box,<br/>
which I really need to go after again, that I could see and almost touch -<br/>
frozen solid in a block of ice in a tree hole.  While I did contemplate<br/>
chipping it out, I decided since it is not that far from my house, I can<br/>
always return again.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I would rather outfit myself with gloves and wool socks than the<br/>
plethora of water bottles necessary for some summer hikes.  The cold doesn't<br/>
hold the dogs back at all, and as an academic, I have this marvelous break<br/>
in December during which I traditionally drive across several states and box<br/>
en route.<br/>
<br/>
This year I plan to finally plant my Rankin and Bass series, based on my<br/>
favorite Christmas specials.  I have Rudolph, Snowmiser and Heatmiser,<br/>
Nestor, and a Bumble carved and ready to go.  I just have to decide where.<br/>
And they will be limited time, only available during the holiday season (the<br/>
real one, not the retail one).  The poor stamps have been sitting in plastic<br/>
bags with their logbooks for close to 3 years now, so it's past time for<br/>
them to see some action.<br/>

We have noticed the hushed board as well. Possibly Facebook and the like<br/>
have spread the chatter thin. <br/>
Nonetheless, as for the TOTW, we think ALL of the seasons are<br/>
beautiful...think winter woods! That is precisely why we love living in the<br/>
midwest - we get to experience the full onslaught of all seasons (Well,<br/>
maybe Spring is too short and muddy!) But all offer great opportunities for<br/>
hiking. That said, we are sorely going to miss "escaping" to Arizona this<br/>
winter!<br/>
We've said before, and it bears repeating, one of our all-time favorite<br/>
events was the mid-winter outdoor Iditarod event! And as we recall, there<br/>
was an event in Wisconsin a few winters ago that, if not enjoyable, was<br/>
certainly memorable for several on the board!<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I<br/>
am hoping to plant more boxes this winter, now that I am getting sort<br/>
of into carving and have always loved fall/winter hiking the best<br/>
anyway.  Also, I am planning a mini-meet "Dead of Winter" in Rockford<br/>
for January 16, mostly for a hot lunch, fireplace blazing, idea<br/>
sharing, hiking, etc.  It will be at Severson Dells Nature<br/>
Center--already have the building reserved (I volunteer there once a<br/>
month).  I'll post soon!  <br/>

This is one of those projects that just kept growing.  It started with wanting to redo the floor and counters in the kitchen.  Then we had talked about adding a powder room on the first floor. Then.... So, the main thing is gutting the kitchen and totally redoing it.  And adding a powder room.  And moving some wall openings around a little. Basically, the entire first floor is going to be a mess for a while.  But it should be really nice when it is finally done.<br/>

And you have the find count to prove it!!!  Mine has not bumped up much this year--these darn kids and all their activities.  But getting out to find some boxes might be a good way to get out of the contractor's hair.  <br/>
<br/>
My fall/winter plans are to get some more cemetery stroll boxes out there--I have the ideas for 5 or 6 more.  And find a way to get out there and find some more boxes.  I don't like to box alone and DH has really gotten into long bike rides and the kids are into so many things that boxing isn't high on their radar screens.  Guess I will need to search out those drive-bys or ones that seem to be in populated areas.  <br/>

Oh, yeah, we've been in that same situation!  One of Lock, Shock &amp; Barrel's<br/>
sneaky sisters encased herself solidly in ice.  All we could do is touch the<br/>
cover.  The ice was up over the LnL side flaps, so there was no way we could<br/>
open it and nothing to safely chisel with.  We had to return after the<br/>
spring thaw, and after they found her a drier home.<br/>

Hmmm.. I think we found your Snowmiser in IL in April 2008.  Is this the<br/>
same stamp?  We also found a Heatmiser box in Connecticut in OCT 2004.  Was<br/>
that a stamp you had contributed to the Monster Mash?<br/>

Wow--all these January birthdays.  If you had all been born 2 weeks earlier, you could have been nice tax deductions for your parents  ;~)<br/>
