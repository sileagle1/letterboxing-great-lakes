                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sure most of you are aware of the recent enhancements on the LbNA <br>
site, that<br>
allow a Placer of a box to log the status as "OK," "Missing," "Retired,"<br>
"Repair," or "Unknown."  Also, everyone other than the Placer is able to log a<br>
personal status for each box:  "Found," "Attempted," or "Ignore."   Only the<br>
placer can see the entire list of everyone else's status.<br>
<br>
The site's new Help page even suggests that Placers don't delete boxes that go<br>
missing or are retired, since they would then disappear from everyone else's<br>
"Found" lists.  Instead, just mark the status appropriately.  Makes sense to<br>
me... until I found out yesterday that the statuses I assign to my <br>
Placed boxes<br>
are only visible to me, the Placer.  They don't seem to be shown to <br>
anyone else.<br>
So now I'm confused.  Am I missing something here?<br>
<br>
I'd like to keep our missing/retired boxes listed on the site, if possible --<br>
especially the missing ones that I plan to replace.  But I don't want to do<br>
this if it's going to cause confusion to all future searchers.  Has anyone<br>
figured this out?  I can e-mail the webmasters with this question, but thought<br>
I'd check within our local group first.  Thanks for any help that anyone can<br>
provide.<br>

like to clutter the site with boxes that no longer exist.  Since not <br>
all boxes I find (nor all boxes I place) are listed on LBNA, <br>
the "count" on the site isn't accurate anyway.  I am continuing to keep <br>
my own list for box statistics. <br>
<br>
However I do LOVE the tracking statistics on the site for several other <br>
reasons.  It gives you some info as to who has found your box and when, <br>
and it allows you to "hide" all the boxes you have placed or already <br>
found and thereby show only those that you still may want to hunt for.  <br>
This is a GREAT enhancement to LBNA!  <br>
