the "count" on the site isn't accurate anyway.  I am continuing to keep <br/>
my own list for box statistics. <br/>
<br/>
However I do LOVE the tracking statistics on the site for several other <br/>
reasons.  It gives you some info as to who has found your box and when, <br/>
and it allows you to "hide" all the boxes you have placed or already <br/>
found and thereby show only those that you still may want to hunt for.  <br/>
This is a GREAT enhancement to LBNA!  <br/>
