Sounds like you guys did a great job of stressing some of the aspects of the hobby that are often overlooked in other publicity pieces.  I like how the reporter kept it very much an overview and didn't go into detail about any one particular thing.  I think this encourages a reader to do a little research and look for more information before running out to look for a letterbox.<br/>
