<br>
Steam Engine 261, one of the largest ever built, is coming back to <br>
Milwaukee today (Wed) to give a few excursions over the weekend.  <br>
(It was built in Milwaukee and used by the Milwaukee Road.)  As best <br>
as I can tell, it will be traveling the CP tracks to the Amtrak <br>
station in Milwaukee tonight as well as during the excursion.  These <br>
are the tracks that are near the following boxes of mine:<br>
<br>
Mitchell Park Domes (MCP Series)<br>
Watery Grave<br>
Squished Pennies*<br>
Hansen Park (MCP Series)*<br>
<br>
*best viewing site<br>
<br>
Right now, I'm planning to be at my Squished Pennies box tonight <br>
around 5:30 to watch it come in if anyone wants to join me and get <br>
some squished pennies from a STEAM train!<br>

There is a number for information in the article I linked in my first <br>
post.  I was considering it for a father's day gift for myself and my <br>
daad, but a bit expensive...<br>
