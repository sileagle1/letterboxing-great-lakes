<br/>
Where are you located in Illinois?  My husband is not a letterboxer <br/>
although he does go with me.  After he saw an unsavory character out <br/>
on the trail while we were hiking, and he saw me take a tumble down a <br/>
ravine ("and why do you like this activity?") he made me promise I <br/>
would not go out alone. I realize he doesn't want me out alone because <br/>
he loves me but it is frustrating at times. So if you are looking for <br/>
a soul to box with let me know!<br/>

I think this is a great idea, but we need to make sure we list our <br/>
added assistants. Some letterbox with kids or dogs and this would be <br/>
good to know. I'd love to box with someone who doesn't mind a toddler <br/>
being on the trail and if they have kids too, an added bonus!<br/>
