<br/>
"The Ridges" was the nickname for an insane asylum on the edge of town.  Ohio University aquired the property I forget how long ago...within the last decade.  I forget the aslyum's real name, but if you're into ghosts you may have heard of it before - it's been featured on shows about the ghost/s who roam the main building.  There's an eerie story about a woman who got trapped in part of the building that wasn't used any longer...<br/>
<br/>
OK, maybe I just spooked myself too much to hide a box there.  But anyone else in the area, feel free to!<br/>

I've learned a lot and traveled to some interesting locations and <br/>
hope to do much more. I especially love finding places close to home <br/>
(Minnesota), that I've never ever heard of or been to before. <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorites is Matt the Rat's "Grasshopper Chapel" box. It's <br/>
the first box I ever found so it holds a fond place in my memory for <br/>
that reason but, aside from that, the location and the Chapel has a <br/>
really neat story behind it.<br/>
<br/>
It's a sweet little chapel, in a secluded, wooded clearing, at the <br/>
top of a hill, that commemorates the advance of a locust plague in <br/>
April, 1877, near Cold Spring, Minnesota. When it appeared that the <br/>
creatures would inundate the town and decimate its crops, residents <br/>
gathered for a day of prayer sanctioned by the governor. Amazingly, a <br/>
snowstorm descended, freezing the insects and preserving the town. <br/>
Officially called Assumption Chapel, most people refer to it as the <br/>
Grasshopper Chapel. I probably would have never heard of it or <br/>
visited it if it hadn't been for Matt's box. So, thanks Matt!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and by the way, Matt has carved the perfect stamp for this <br/>
location! <br/>

I've thought quite a bit about this over the past week.<br/>
While creating my box, "I Spy", I learned a lot about Great Lakes <br/>
shipwrecks, especially the sinking of the paddle wheeler Alpena.<br/>
A curious fact came to my attention after I'd created and placed the <br/>
box. (check out the clues to get the gist of the situation).<br/>
I learned that the nameplate from the paddlewheel box on the doomed <br/>
ship finally washed ashore just north of Holland, MI almost 30 years <br/>
after the ship sank. I later learned that the beach near Holland was <br/>
named Alpena Beach for the ship that was lost in 1880. Another eerie <br/>
experience I had was reading an eyewitness description of the storm <br/>
from a sailor who saw the Alpena in her final hours from another ship.<br/>
He was interviewed about 1921 and excerpts were reprinted in a local <br/>
newspaper. <br/>
By the way, the wreck has still not been found.<br/>
Despite the fact that my clues were only peripherally connected to <br/>
the wreck of the Alpena, reading that account of a sailor who lived <br/>
through that storm brought a sense of reality to me that I would not <br/>
have expected.<br/>
<br/>
A thought provoking TOTW.<br/>
