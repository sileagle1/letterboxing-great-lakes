weekend so everyone would have a chance to nab 'em during the nice <br>
weather that was predicted.<br>
<br>
Took a little longer to get the clues done than expected, but we <br>
finally have The Fate of Easter series (6 boxes!) placed and posted <br>
on the LbNA clues list. <br>
<br>
If any of you are first finders, could you please do me a favor and <br>
put the date 3-28-2004 on the first page of the logbooks?  LOL .... <br>
guess what we forgot to do!<br>
<br>
BTW - these are the boxes Angela had painted with acrylics and <br>
coated with matte medium. I told her I thought it wouldn't last, but <br>
they held up to the scratch tests she tried and she wanted to <br>
experiment.  Guess what? (grin) So, while these boxes started out <br>
wearing camo, but they may not be by the time you get to them. <br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

one to do with my 7-yr. old granddaughter.  She has come with me a <br>
couple of times when I've done box maintenance and she keeps begging <br>
me to take her looking for more "treasure boxes."  The Easter Egg <br>
theme will be fun for her!<br>
