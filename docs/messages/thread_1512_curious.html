                    <div class="plaintext-content">Atlas Quest.com is a fun way to keep track of your placed and found,<br>
they provide a logbook, which everytime you add a find it sends<br>
alittle e-mail to the placer! Very helpful for both the finder and the<br>
placer!!!<br>
<br>
I have a little file cabinet to keep paper stuff in. Hard boxes that<br>
take puzzle solving or research. This also houses my "original" notes<br>
of the boxes I have planted. Also, I index folders according to park<br>
or city and keep then full of printed out clues, in case I have to<br>
rush out the door and then I can just grab the folder and run!<br>
<br>
My LB logbook is the way I keep track of what I have found (only<br>
25ish, so they are pretty fresh in my brain still. We also take notes<br>
in our logbook while boxing...for example: Puss-n-Boots fell down hill<br>
while finding Blue Moon box." This is maybe one of the nicest things<br>
about Lb, Sitting on the sofa with family and re-reading our<br>
adventures is so nice!!!<br>
<br>
As far as planting, yhough I have only planted 12? I have huge word<br>
files on Lb in which I keep the images I worked with to carve the<br>
stamp, or an image of the completed stamp (in case I ever need to<br>
replace it.) Clues, placed by documents,What is Lb document blablabla.<br>
<br>
I hope that helped, Im sure others will chime in their ways.<br>
Take care,<br>

<br>
We use an Excel spreadsheet to track our "statistics".  One tab in the<br>
workbook is for the PFX count stuff.  We enter each new stamp in a row and<br>
put the date in the appropriate column (Placed, Found, Exchange, Hitchhiker,<br>
Event, Adopted or Miscellaneous.  The spreadsheet is set up to automatically<br>
sum the number of dates in each column, so every time we add a row our<br>
counts are automatically updated.  We use another sheet in the workbook to<br>
keep more info on boxes we've placed (location, box name, stamp image, when<br>
placed, what (if anything) we used as a first finder prize and the last date<br>
it was checked or found.  I use this same page to also keep track of ideas<br>
for future letterboxes, even if I only have a location in mind or just an<br>
image.  The third tab is for keeping track of what states and countries<br>
we've found boxes and placed boxes.<br>
<br>
We keep a separate spreadsheet because the websites such as AtlasQuest and<br>
LBNA don't include all the boxes we've found.  For example, they usually<br>
don't list any bonus boxes or WOM boxes.  However I really appreciate the<br>
ability to log a find so you can filter out previously found boxes and so<br>
placers can get some feedback on activity at their boxes.<br>
<br>
As you can guess, we like to keep track of things! (Letterboxing is just one<br>
thing for which we have developed spreadsheets or databases.)<br>
<br>
I use Word or .jpg files to keep track of stamp images and clues for boxes<br>
we have placed.<br>
<br>
We've been using this approach for almost 2 years and it works well for us.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although I don't have mine set up to automatically total boxes because I stopped counting boxes placed and found, my method is very similar to the way WI Hiker described...  An Excel spreadsheet with a tab for boxes planted/found/attempted/etc.  There is another tab that is my "boxes to find" list, another that is a maintenance and reports log, another tab that is my working "to do" list, another with future box ideas, another where I keep track of to whom I have distributed WoM clues and still another is my "people" sheet on which I record exchanges and it also functions as an address book.  Additional tabs are added for information and details about specific projects if it is more than just a regular box (i.e. group projects, series, mystery boxes with puzzles, etc.).  At one time I had set it all up in an Access database and it was more complicated than I liked and I couldn't discipline myself to use it faithfully.  The Excel worksheet is much easier to make quick updates.<br>
<br>
I do log plants and finds on Atlasquest, but as previously said, it is not everything planted, and not everything found, thus the separate worksheets for my own records.  I have an online filing system with folders for each box that I've planted.  Files in each include the original graphic image for the stamp, the "sized and doctored" image (the one I actually carved from), a scan of the stamp image, a copy of the clues, and any maps or other information I used or found when researching the location or theme.  The image files are all in .jpg format, the text documents are generally in MS-Word.  Puzzles I save both in the original format (generally MS-Word or MS-Excel) and also in the converted .PDF format.<br>
<br>
As far as preparation for box-hunting expeditions, other than the "boxes to find" list on my Excel spreadsheet -- which I add to whenever I become aware of a new box in MI, northern IN, Chicago area or other place I am planning to travel to -- I don't do much else.  I have a huge collection of maps -- state, local, county, park, etc. and keep a file of those.  I don't generally print out clues to boxes ahead of time because I've been caught with outdated clues a number of times and also have spent considerable time looking for boxes that had been pulled, gone missing and even though a status note had been added to the clues, I missed it because I had printed the clues prior to that.  So I print them out before I head out for the day or on a trip -- usually more than I could possibly do in the time I have available, but better too many than not enough.<br>
<br>
I too, tend to be a compulsive list-maker and organizer and would be completely lost without MS-Excel to organize my life.<br>

separate tabs to segregate the different kinds of<br>
boxes, though.  Everything is listed on the first<br>
sheet, and at the top I have formulas to calcuate our<br>
most recent stats based on the code that's put in the<br>
code column (ie, F for Find, P for Plant, HH for<br>
Hitchhiker, but I also have the F formula set up to<br>
also count HHs).  Then if I want to see, say, just our<br>
Plants, I can filter the code column to show just the<br>
F's.<br>

I would love to use Access to track our stuff (make a<br>
nice form to enter the information in) but alas, I am<br>
a Mac lover, and Access is only for PCs.  <br>
