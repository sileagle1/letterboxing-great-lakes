                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm thinking the group home page can use a facelift for the new <br/>
year.  I would like to post photos from group members taken while <br/>
letterboxing in the GL Region, rotating them out at the start of each <br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
I created a folder in the PHOTOS section called ~Home Page Photos (it <br/>
is the very last folder).  If you have any scenic photos taken while <br/>
letterboxing in the GL Region that you would like to see on the group <br/>
home page, please feel free to upload to this folder.  I'm looking <br/>
primarily for scenery photos, not so much people photos -- unless you <br/>
have an absolutely adorable shot (with a scenic background) of your <br/>
little one or four-legged friend letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Please resize your photo to be 500 pixels wide with a 72 dpi <br/>
resolution before you upload it.  In the comments, include your name <br/>
or trail name, the place where the photo was taken and the date it <br/>
was taken.  I will use photos from this folder for the home page <br/>
based on appropriateness to the month, trying to give everyone who <br/>
submits something a chance.  Preference will be given to letterboxers <br/>
who actually live in the GL Region, although any group member can <br/>
submit a photo taken in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing some nice photographs from around the GL <br/>
states!  Thanks!<br/>
