                    <div class="plaintext-content">None of the three cooties by Orion at Emersonhad logbooks with them, but they are listed on AQ. From what is recorded there, the carver is from Cambridge, MA,and she attended the "ElectricMedic Meet and Greet" December 30th in Los Altoswhere shereleased them. Many of the attendees at that event also attended the "Fungal Infestation" and they in turn infested this fungus. I brought back with mefrom San Jose.<br>

To clarify what Beetle said, there really was no connection between the five Hollywood Micro-Meets (held at The Paw between Jan '05 and Jul '06) and SILO. Those were just random local meetups. My real plan was to hold that event at the Zoo, but with my Dad passing in the fall of '06, I didn't have my heart in it. The first SILO came (obviously) several months later. As to the date of this year's SILO, part of the date change was due to V-Day falling on Saturday.<br>

(Dottie...I hear you about working Sundays...kind of the busy day for you and the Rev Mr Pastor's Wife, eh? Once I was talking to my Pastor, complaining that I couldn't come to church because of working the weekend, playing the "poor me" sob story and all, and then I realized I was "preaching to the choir" so to speak...not going to get a lot of sympathy aboutthat from a clergyman!)<br>

and attend bible class's, Sunday meets are definitely out or extremely difficult for those of <br>
us that would otherwise attend. i would have loved to come,But missing my favorite <br>
church service to attend a letterboxing meet would be a difficult option for me. But it <br>
sounds as though i missed a great time!!!If it had only started two hours later..... :(  <br>
