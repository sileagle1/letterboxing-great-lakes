Underground RR boxes placed in the Dupage County Forest Preserves <br/>
(Graue Mill).  The ranger was VERY nice to work with, but we kept <br/>
running into snags.  The first site we found was too near some <br/>
geocaches.  The next site ended up being in a restricted area.  Then <br/>
our schedules kept conflicting--but it finally has happened.  Clues <br/>
will go up later today on LbNA and AQ.  <br/>
<br/>
I do have one question.  As I was leaving, the ranger said something <br/>
like "this will be up on the web site by Friday--the guy in charge of <br/>
geocaching will get it online". ???????????   I couldn't stay and <br/>
talk with him because I needed to get to a funeral, so I need to <br/>
email him about this.  Does anyone know what website he is talking <br/>
about or if this is standard procedure for Dupage County?  The clues <br/>
that I gave the ranger so that he could find the proposed site were <br/>
very simple and direct--I don't want those on a website.  I like to <br/>
write my clues a little harder and with compass settings, so that <br/>
they don't disappear right away.  Plus, if it is a list of geocaches--<br/>
I don't want my stamp getting traded out.  <br/>
