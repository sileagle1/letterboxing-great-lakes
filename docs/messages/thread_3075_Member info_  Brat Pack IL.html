                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI!!! We are Brat Pack IL, and we're from Alsip, Illinois.  We <br>
consist of my parents, Gramma and Papa, me,Big Brat, and my <br>
crew...Bitty Brat, Bubba, Peanut, Monkey, and Swee' Pea.  Also, I'm <br>
expecting another letterboxer to be near the end of December. =)  We <br>
started Letterboxing in July, and we were lucky enough to run into <br>
the Wormy Wanderers on our 1st outing out.  We've been dedicating one <br>
day on the weekend to go out letterboxing, and at least try to find <br>
what we can in an area.  So far, we've found almost 100 boxes, a few <br>
hitchhikers, and planning to plant our 1st box real soon.  The kids <br>
and I are involved in postal letterboxing as well, and they enjoy <br>
making the stamps and receiving them in the mail.  (I'm just glad to <br>
get something other than bills in the mail..LOL)  =)  We're making <br>
plans to be at the gathering in November here in IL.  We feel we know <br>
Funguswoman personally as well. =) We've met so many wonderful people <br>
thru emails and the Yahoo groups.  At the Ren Faire, we met the <br>
Cottontails, and the Biker Cats, oh and Bare foot Ahnk.  Everyone is <br>
so wonderful and we have such an awesome time!!!! Even if we don't <br>
find a box, either missing, or we were in a wrong area, the kids are <br>
bummed but then they can't wait to go to the next spot to see what's <br>
there.  Other than that, we enjoy the adventures every weekend, and <br>
trying to think of places to plant some of our own boxes.  =)<br>
