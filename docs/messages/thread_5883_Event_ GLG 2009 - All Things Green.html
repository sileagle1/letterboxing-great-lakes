===========================================<br>
Event: GLG 2009 - All Things Green<br>
<br>
I'm getting really excited for this day to arrive. I hope you are too. Just a couple of items I've been thinking about today:<br>
<br>
1. I listed bringing covers for the picnic tables. I'm feeling guilty about getting plastic covers for one-time-use. If you have cloth table covers that you'd be willing to bring, let me know. I'll fill in as needed with disposable covers.<br>
<br>
2. I'll be bringing water for your hikes. I prefer non-carbonated drinks for all day events, so I am planning to bring raspberry tea drink mix. If anyone has a spare igloo/thermos I can borrow, I'll provide tea and/or lemonade at the shelter.<br>
<br>
3. Since this is a GREEN event and I'm a Freecycle junkie, I will bring crafting items and logbook papers that will be free for your taking. If you also have the urge to share some of your overabundance, you are welcome to participate. It's not a swap, but a pay-it-forward gesture. And a way to keep my closet organized.<br>
<br>
4. I've received permission to plant the trail boxes early. With the utmost stealth DH and I will be out Sunday and Monday planting. The park interpreter said he would be busy during our event but would really like to find some of these before we pull them late on Sunday. If I can get the clues typed up Monday or Tuesday, I will give him an advanced copy. Perhaps he'll find them first. He seems pretty excited about our event from the last emails I've received. This is such good news.<br>
<br>
If there is anything we've overlooked, please let me know. The weather looks promising for this weekend. Hope that continues.<br>
