No mistakes.  Sadly, the MI event is a good distance, and Mr. Beetle is not interested in driving that far.  So right now, I'm hoping to attend the event in Indiana and support the event in MI by sending some event boxes.  But I think the MI event theme will be FAB!  However, things could change if I can catch a ride on the yellow submarine and take a travel short cut across Lake Michigan... <br/>

&gt; &gt; No mistakes.  Sadly, the MI event is a good distance, and Mr. Beetle is not interested in driving that far.  So right now, I'm hoping to attend the event in Indiana and support the event in MI by sending some event boxes.  But I think the MI event theme will be FAB!  However, things could change if I can catch a ride on the yellow submarine and take a travel short cut across Lake Michigan... <br/>

a couple months when it needs to be held, I can't remember about this <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first couple of years the date of the gathering was random and then once it <br/>
was apparent this was going to become an annual affair, we set up the state <br/>
rotation plan and decided to stick with the weekend after Memorial Day so people <br/>
could plan on a specific date.  This was the date for a few years thereafter, <br/>
but it always caused conflicts for teachers as it was at the end of school. <br/>
Also, as the gathering grew it became more difficult to find locations that were <br/>
suitable for a group our size, especially having a specific date to work with. <br/>
So once we went full circle with states hosting, we voted here at the Yahoo! <br/>
group about the possibility of changing the date.<br/>
<br/>
There were a few different options, one to leave it on the Saturday after <br/>
Memorial Day, a few others that weren't very popular and then the option of <br/>
making it "host's choice" within the time frame of May - September, hoping a <br/>
flexible date would make it easier to secure a location and also reasoning that <br/>
moving the date around a bit would make it possible for people who had conflicts <br/>
with any set date to be able to come at least some of the time.  The "host's <br/>
choice" option was by far the popular choice and last year was the first year <br/>
under the new date guideline, although I think it still ended up being the <br/>
Saturday after Memorial Day.<br/>
<br/>
While changing the date addressed some of the problems, it did open the door to <br/>
new ones...  nothing is perfect I guess.  I think it points out the importance <br/>
of lining up a host as early as possible, so that a location can be secured and <br/>
a date set early enough that conflicts will not be an issue.  I have <br/>
traditionally waited until later summer or early fall to do this, but I think in <br/>
the future, it is something that should be done as soon after the current year <br/>
gathering as possible.  My only hesitation with choosing a host too far out is <br/>
that people come and go and lose interest in the hobby, especially over the <br/>
winter, and I would hate for somebody to volunteer to host and then fizzle out <br/>
before the event came around.<br/>

just a little disappointed... when did it become hosts choice for the date?  <br/>
Last I remember reading was that GLG was always the weekend after Memorial <br/>
Day...  It doesn't affect us all that much because I'm due June 21 with twins so <br/>
if we even make it to June 1 we'll all be happy, so GLG was out of the question <br/>
for us this year.  My disappointment comes for the future, is it hosts choice in <br/>
a certain month? or can it be anytime in the year?  This sure makes things more <br/>
difficult to plan and count on so it WILL cause more conflicts.  I'm sure when <br/>
Jabber planned the "Springtime in the Woods" event she was under the impression <br/>
that GLG would be the week before.  <br/>

The first couple of years the date of the gathering was random and then once it <br/>
was apparent this was going to become an annual affair, we set up the state <br/>
rotation plan and decided to stick with the weekend after Memorial Day so people <br/>
could plan on a specific date. This was the date for a few years thereafter, <br/>
but it always caused conflicts for teachers as it was at the end of school. <br/>
Also, as the gathering grew it became more difficult to find locations that were <br/>
suitable for a group our size, especially having a specific date to work with. <br/>
So once we went full circle with states hosting, we voted here at the Yahoo! <br/>
group about the possibility of changing the date.<br/>
<br/>
There were a few different options, one to leave it on the Saturday after <br/>
Memorial Day, a few others that weren't very popular and then the option of <br/>
making it "host's choice" within the time frame of May - September, hoping a <br/>
flexible date would make it easier to secure a location and also reasoning that <br/>
moving the date around a bit would make it possible for people who had conflicts <br/>
with any set date to be able to come at least some of the time. The "host's <br/>
choice" option was by far the popular choice and last year was the first year <br/>
under the new date guideline, although I think it still ended up being the <br/>
Saturday after Memorial Day.<br/>
<br/>
While changing the date addressed some of the problems, it did open the door to <br/>
new ones... nothing is perfect I guess. I think it points out the importance <br/>
of lining up a host as early as possible, so that a location can be secured and <br/>
a date set early enough that conflicts will not be an issue. I have <br/>
traditionally waited until later summer or early fall to do this, but I think in <br/>
the future, it is something that should be done as soon after the current year <br/>
gathering as possible. My only hesitation with choosing a host too far out is <br/>
that people come and go and lose interest in the hobby, especially over the <br/>
winter, and I would hate for somebody to volunteer to host and then fizzle out <br/>
before the event came around.<br/>

<br/>
just a little disappointed... when did it become hosts choice for the date? <br/>
Last I remember reading was that GLG was always the weekend after Memorial <br/>
Day... It doesn't affect us all that much because I'm due June 21 with twins so <br/>
if we even make it to June 1 we'll all be happy, so GLG was out of the question <br/>
for us this year. My disappointment comes for the future, is it hosts choice in <br/>
a certain month? or can it be anytime in the year? This sure makes things more <br/>
difficult to plan and count on so it WILL cause more conflicts. I'm sure when <br/>
Jabber planned the "Springtime in the Woods" event she was under the impression <br/>
that GLG would be the week before. <br/>

my apologies to anyone who is unable to attend GLG due to the scheduling conflict. i wasn't planning on hosting the event this year, but when the opportunity arose i picked up the ball and ran with it. i asked some friends, who had volunteered to help, about the date, and they expressed similar concerns about school days. i decided that the weekend of the 11th was the most appropriate, as i knew the event was usually held in early june. i was unaware of jabberjobob's event (my bad), and i offered to change the date, but she said it was unnecessary. for that reason and to accommodate the wishes of other boxers, i decided to keep it on the 10th-11th. i am disappointed to see negative reactions amongst my friends, but i'm afraid it was inevitable, as i knew i didn't have much time to make decisions and prepare for the event. we will miss seeing the terrorists, charlie'sdayout, and other friends we have met, but hopefully both groups will have a good time<br/>
 that weekend.<br/>

&gt; Thanks Springchick and Bali for the quick responses...Â  Good to know that there are still some guidelines as we are wanting to be hosts when we get back to Indiana.Â  Anyway, I guess some years we'll just have to understand that we can't make it due to other arrangments.Â  <br/>

&gt; Â  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The first couple of years the date of the gathering was random and then once it <br/>
&gt; was apparent this was going to become an annual affair, we set up the state <br/>
&gt; rotation plan and decided to stick with the weekend after Memorial Day so people <br/>
&gt; could plan on a specific date. This was the date for a few years thereafter, <br/>
&gt; but it always caused conflicts for teachers as it was at the end of school. <br/>
&gt; Also, as the gathering grew it became more difficult to find locations that were <br/>
&gt; suitable for a group our size, especially having a specific date to work with. <br/>
&gt; So once we went full circle with states hosting, we voted here at the Yahoo! <br/>
&gt; group about the possibility of changing the date.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There were a few different options, one to leave it on the Saturday after <br/>
&gt; Memorial Day, a few others that weren't very popular and then the option of <br/>
&gt; making it "host's choice" within the time frame of May - September, hoping a <br/>
&gt; flexible date would make it easier to secure a location and also reasoning that <br/>
&gt; moving the date around a bit would make it possible for people who had conflicts <br/>
&gt; with any set date to be able to come at least some of the time. The "host's <br/>
&gt; choice" option was by far the popular choice and last year was the first year <br/>
&gt; under the new date guideline, although I think it still ended up being the <br/>
&gt; Saturday after Memorial Day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While changing the date addressed some of the problems, it did open the door to <br/>
&gt; new ones... nothing is perfect I guess. I think it points out the importance <br/>
&gt; of lining up a host as early as possible, so that a location can be secured and <br/>
&gt; a date set early enough that conflicts will not be an issue. I have <br/>
&gt; traditionally waited until later summer or early fall to do this, but I think in <br/>
&gt; the future, it is something that should be done as soon after the current year <br/>
&gt; gathering as possible. My only hesitation with choosing a host too far out is <br/>
&gt; that people come and go and lose interest in the hobby, especially over the <br/>
&gt; winter, and I would hate for somebody to volunteer to host and then fizzle out <br/>
&gt; before the event came around.<br/>

&gt; just a little disappointed... when did it become hosts choice for the date? <br/>
&gt; Last I remember reading was that GLG was always the weekend after Memorial <br/>
&gt; Day... It doesn't affect us all that much because I'm due June 21 with twins so <br/>
&gt; if we even make it to June 1 we'll all be happy, so GLG was out of the question <br/>
&gt; for us this year. My disappointment comes for the future, is it hosts choice in <br/>
&gt; a certain month? or can it be anytime in the year? This sure makes things more <br/>
&gt; difficult to plan and count on so it WILL cause more conflicts. I'm sure when <br/>
&gt; Jabber planned the "Springtime in the Woods" event she was under the impression <br/>
&gt; that GLG would be the week before. <br/>

&gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that there are two events in the region that conflict this <br/>
&gt; &gt; year, but I think going forward as letterboxing continues to grow and events <br/>
&gt; &gt; become even more prolific, it is likely to happen from time to time. There was <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; no intentional overlap, but there are only so many weekends in that area of <br/>
&gt; &gt;time <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and working around the schedules of those doing the planning and location <br/>
&gt; &gt; availability limits that even more. As we have learned, you are never going to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; be able to accommodate everyone -- even if it had been possible to change the <br/>
&gt; &gt; date, it is likely there would be other folks negatively impacted by the new <br/>
&gt; &gt; date. It was agreed by the group to make the date of the GLG "host's choice." <br/>
&gt; &gt; While that offers the benefit/flexibility of acquiring a desirable location and <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; moving the date around to make the event more accessible to folks who have <br/>

&gt; my apologies to anyone who is unable to attend GLG due to the scheduling conflict. i wasn't planning on hosting the event this year, but when the opportunity arose i picked up the ball and ran with it. i asked some friends, who had volunteered to help, about the date, and they expressed similar concerns about school days. i decided that the weekend of the 11th was the most appropriate, as i knew the event was usually held in early june. i was unaware of jabberjobob's event (my bad), and i offered to change the date, but she said it was unnecessary. for that reason and to accommodate the wishes of other boxers, i decided to keep it on the 10th-11th. i am disappointed to see negative reactions amongst my friends, but i'm afraid it was inevitable, as i knew i didn't have much time to make decisions and prepare for the event. we will miss seeing the terrorists, charlie'sdayout, and other friends we have met, but hopefully both groups will have a good time<br/>
&gt;  that weekend.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Â  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The first couple of years the date of the gathering was random and then once it <br/>
&gt; &gt; was apparent this was going to become an annual affair, we set up the state <br/>
&gt; &gt; rotation plan and decided to stick with the weekend after Memorial Day so people <br/>
&gt; &gt; could plan on a specific date. This was the date for a few years thereafter, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but it always caused conflicts for teachers as it was at the end of school. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, as the gathering grew it became more difficult to find locations that were <br/>
&gt; &gt; suitable for a group our size, especially having a specific date to work with. <br/>
&gt; &gt; So once we went full circle with states hosting, we voted here at the Yahoo! <br/>
&gt; &gt; group about the possibility of changing the date.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There were a few different options, one to leave it on the Saturday after <br/>
&gt; &gt; Memorial Day, a few others that weren't very popular and then the option of <br/>
&gt; &gt; making it "host's choice" within the time frame of May - September, hoping a <br/>
&gt; &gt; flexible date would make it easier to secure a location and also reasoning that <br/>
&gt; &gt; moving the date around a bit would make it possible for people who had conflicts <br/>
&gt; &gt; with any set date to be able to come at least some of the time. The "host's <br/>
&gt; &gt; choice" option was by far the popular choice and last year was the first year <br/>
&gt; &gt; under the new date guideline, although I think it still ended up being the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Saturday after Memorial Day.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; While changing the date addressed some of the problems, it did open the door to <br/>
&gt; &gt; new ones... nothing is perfect I guess. I think it points out the importance <br/>
&gt; &gt; of lining up a host as early as possible, so that a location can be secured and <br/>
&gt; &gt; a date set early enough that conflicts will not be an issue. I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; traditionally waited until later summer or early fall to do this, but I think in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the future, it is something that should be done as soon after the current year <br/>
&gt; &gt; gathering as possible. My only hesitation with choosing a host too far out is <br/>
&gt; &gt; that people come and go and lose interest in the hobby, especially over the <br/>
&gt; &gt; winter, and I would hate for somebody to volunteer to host and then fizzle out <br/>
&gt; &gt; before the event came around.<br/>

&gt; &gt; just a little disappointed... when did it become hosts choice for the date? <br/>
&gt; &gt; Last I remember reading was that GLG was always the weekend after Memorial <br/>
&gt; &gt; Day... It doesn't affect us all that much because I'm due June 21 with twins so <br/>
&gt; &gt; if we even make it to June 1 we'll all be happy, so GLG was out of the question <br/>
&gt; &gt; for us this year. My disappointment comes for the future, is it hosts choice in <br/>
&gt; &gt; a certain month? or can it be anytime in the year? This sure makes things more <br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult to plan and count on so it WILL cause more conflicts. I'm sure when <br/>
&gt; &gt; Jabber planned the "Springtime in the Woods" event she was under the impression <br/>
&gt; &gt; that GLG would be the week before. <br/>

Take it as a compliment for those who have done such a wonderful job in years past.. and to those who will do a fantastic job in the future :-)<br/>

&gt; a thought popped in my mind with Springchicks comment about picking a host too far in advance for fear of them fizzling out of letterboxing. Is there any guidelines for choosing a host? Do they have to meet any certain criteria besides just being willing??<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks Springchick and Bali for the quick responses...  Good to know that there are still some guidelines as we are wanting to be hosts when we get back to Indiana.  Anyway, I guess some years we'll just have to understand that we can't make it due to other arrangments.  <br/>

&gt; &gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The first couple of years the date of the gathering was random and then once it <br/>
&gt; &gt; was apparent this was going to become an annual affair, we set up the state <br/>
&gt; &gt; rotation plan and decided to stick with the weekend after Memorial Day so people <br/>
&gt; &gt; could plan on a specific date. This was the date for a few years thereafter, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but it always caused conflicts for teachers as it was at the end of school. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, as the gathering grew it became more difficult to find locations that were <br/>
&gt; &gt; suitable for a group our size, especially having a specific date to work with. <br/>
&gt; &gt; So once we went full circle with states hosting, we voted here at the Yahoo! <br/>
&gt; &gt; group about the possibility of changing the date.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There were a few different options, one to leave it on the Saturday after <br/>
&gt; &gt; Memorial Day, a few others that weren't very popular and then the option of <br/>
&gt; &gt; making it "host's choice" within the time frame of May - September, hoping a <br/>
&gt; &gt; flexible date would make it easier to secure a location and also reasoning that <br/>
&gt; &gt; moving the date around a bit would make it possible for people who had conflicts <br/>
&gt; &gt; with any set date to be able to come at least some of the time. The "host's <br/>
&gt; &gt; choice" option was by far the popular choice and last year was the first year <br/>
&gt; &gt; under the new date guideline, although I think it still ended up being the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Saturday after Memorial Day.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; While changing the date addressed some of the problems, it did open the door to <br/>
&gt; &gt; new ones... nothing is perfect I guess. I think it points out the importance <br/>
&gt; &gt; of lining up a host as early as possible, so that a location can be secured and <br/>
&gt; &gt; a date set early enough that conflicts will not be an issue. I have <br/>
&gt; &gt; traditionally waited until later summer or early fall to do this, but I think in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the future, it is something that should be done as soon after the current year <br/>
&gt; &gt; gathering as possible. My only hesitation with choosing a host too far out is <br/>
&gt; &gt; that people come and go and lose interest in the hobby, especially over the <br/>
&gt; &gt; winter, and I would hate for somebody to volunteer to host and then fizzle out <br/>
&gt; &gt; before the event came around.<br/>

&gt; &gt; just a little disappointed... when did it become hosts choice for the date? <br/>
&gt; &gt; Last I remember reading was that GLG was always the weekend after Memorial <br/>
&gt; &gt; Day... It doesn't affect us all that much because I'm due June 21 with twins so <br/>
&gt; &gt; if we even make it to June 1 we'll all be happy, so GLG was out of the question <br/>
&gt; &gt; for us this year. My disappointment comes for the future, is it hosts choice in <br/>
&gt; &gt; a certain month? or can it be anytime in the year? This sure makes things more <br/>
&gt; &gt; difficult to plan and count on so it WILL cause more conflicts. I'm sure when <br/>
&gt; &gt; Jabber planned the "Springtime in the Woods" event she was under the impression <br/>
&gt; &gt; that GLG would be the week before. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; It was not posted to a board on AQ, it is on the event info page on the event <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; calendar. I can only speculate that it was not announced here as there has not <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been any change from the original announced date.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is unfortunate that there are two events in the region that conflict this <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; year, but I think going forward as letterboxing continues to grow and events <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; become even more prolific, it is likely to happen from time to time. There was <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; no intentional overlap, but there are only so many weekends in that area of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;time <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and working around the schedules of those doing the planning and location <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; availability limits that even more. As we have learned, you are never going to <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be able to accommodate everyone -- even if it had been possible to change the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; date, it is likely there would be other folks negatively impacted by the new <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; date. It was agreed by the group to make the date of the GLG "host's choice." <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; While that offers the benefit/flexibility of acquiring a desirable location and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; moving the date around to make the event more accessible to folks who have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; personal conflicts with any set date there may be, it also opens up the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; possibility of other scheduling conflicts that are more likely to occur when <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; date does not remain constant from one year to the next.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; on this board. Sorry to hear that was the decision.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; As posted by papa on AtlasQuest: <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jan 3, 2011: rescheduling--NOT<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Due to popular opinion, the date for GLG will NOT be changed. June 10-11 it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are you going to do an official poll using the Yahoo Poll feature? If JUNE<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4 isn't good, what about JUNE 25? It would be a shame to have to decide<br/>
