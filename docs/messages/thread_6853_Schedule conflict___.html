No mistakes.  Sadly, the MI event is a good distance, and Mr. Beetle is not interested in driving that far.  So right now, I'm hoping to attend the event in Indiana and support the event in MI by sending some event boxes.  But I think the MI event theme will be FAB!  However, things could change if I can catch a ride on the yellow submarine and take a travel short cut across Lake Michigan... <br>

There was a vote on this last year.  I think there is a time frame of <br>
a couple months when it needs to be held, I can't remember about this <br>
for sure... it's definitely not any time in the year.  People voted <br>
for the date to be made flexible rather than on that specific weekend <br>
so that it would be easier to find hosts/parks.<br>

rotation plan and decided to stick with the weekend after Memorial Day so people <br>
could plan on a specific date.  This was the date for a few years thereafter, <br>
but it always caused conflicts for teachers as it was at the end of school. <br>
Also, as the gathering grew it became more difficult to find locations that were <br>
suitable for a group our size, especially having a specific date to work with. <br>
So once we went full circle with states hosting, we voted here at the Yahoo! <br>
group about the possibility of changing the date.<br>
<br>
There were a few different options, one to leave it on the Saturday after <br>
Memorial Day, a few others that weren't very popular and then the option of <br>
making it "host's choice" within the time frame of May - September, hoping a <br>
flexible date would make it easier to secure a location and also reasoning that <br>
moving the date around a bit would make it possible for people who had conflicts <br>
with any set date to be able to come at least some of the time.  The "host's <br>
choice" option was by far the popular choice and last year was the first year <br>
under the new date guideline, although I think it still ended up being the <br>
Saturday after Memorial Day.<br>
<br>
While changing the date addressed some of the problems, it did open the door to <br>
new ones...  nothing is perfect I guess.  I think it points out the importance <br>
of lining up a host as early as possible, so that a location can be secured and <br>
a date set early enough that conflicts will not be an issue.  I have <br>
traditionally waited until later summer or early fall to do this, but I think in <br>
the future, it is something that should be done as soon after the current year <br>
gathering as possible.  My only hesitation with choosing a host too far out is <br>
that people come and go and lose interest in the hobby, especially over the <br>
winter, and I would hate for somebody to volunteer to host and then fizzle out <br>
before the event came around.<br>

Last I remember reading was that GLG was always the weekend after Memorial <br>

if we even make it to June 1 we'll all be happy, so GLG was out of the question <br>

suitable for a group our size, especially having a specific date to work with. <br>
So once we went full circle with states hosting, we voted here at the Yahoo! <br>
group about the possibility of changing the date.<br>
<br>
There were a few different options, one to leave it on the Saturday after <br>
Memorial Day, a few others that weren't very popular and then the option of <br>
making it "host's choice" within the time frame of May - September, hoping a <br>
flexible date would make it easier to secure a location and also reasoning that <br>
moving the date around a bit would make it possible for people who had conflicts <br>
with any set date to be able to come at least some of the time. The "host's <br>
choice" option was by far the popular choice and last year was the first year <br>
under the new date guideline, although I think it still ended up being the <br>
Saturday after Memorial Day.<br>
<br>
While changing the date addressed some of the problems, it did open the door to <br>
new ones... nothing is perfect I guess. I think it points out the importance <br>
of lining up a host as early as possible, so that a location can be secured and <br>
a date set early enough that conflicts will not be an issue. I have <br>
traditionally waited until later summer or early fall to do this, but I think in <br>
the future, it is something that should be done as soon after the current year <br>
gathering as possible. My only hesitation with choosing a host too far out is <br>
that people come and go and lose interest in the hobby, especially over the <br>
winter, and I would hate for somebody to volunteer to host and then fizzle out <br>
before the event came around.<br>

Subject: Re: [LbGLK] Re: Schedule conflict!!!<br>
<br>
just a little disappointed... when did it become hosts choice for the date? <br>
Last I remember reading was that GLG was always the weekend after Memorial <br>
Day... It doesn't affect us all that much because I'm due June 21 with twins so <br>
if we even make it to June 1 we'll all be happy, so GLG was out of the question <br>
for us this year. My disappointment comes for the future, is it hosts choice in <br>
a certain month? or can it be anytime in the year? This sure makes things more <br>
difficult to plan and count on so it WILL cause more conflicts. I'm sure when <br>
Jabber planned the "Springtime in the Woods" event she was under the impression <br>
that GLG would be the week before. <br>

Do you know where in the park you will be stationed? Is it by the campground or on the other side?   <br>

> my apologies to anyone who is unable to attend GLG due to the scheduling conflict. i wasn't planning on hosting the event this year, but when the opportunity arose i picked up the ball and ran with it. i asked some friends, who had volunteered to help, about the date, and they expressed similar concerns about school days. i decided that the weekend of the 11th was the most appropriate, as i knew the event was usually held in early june. i was unaware of jabberjobob's event (my bad), and i offered to change the date, but she said it was unnecessary. for that reason and to accommodate the wishes of other boxers, i decided to keep it on the 10th-11th. i am disappointed to see negative reactions amongst my friends, but i'm afraid it was inevitable, as i knew i didn't have much time to make decisions and prepare for the event. we will miss seeing the terrorists, charlie'sdayout, and other friends we have met, but hopefully both groups will have a good time<br>
