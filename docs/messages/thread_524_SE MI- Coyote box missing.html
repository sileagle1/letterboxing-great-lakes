Well, it's official, Coyote is a Trickster is missing.  Gone.  Vanished.  Which is probably for the best, considering the ugly little social trial of hard packed earth and crushed vegetation that lead up to him.  I honestly hope the park caretaker followed the trail, found the box, and removed it.  So this is a hard-learned lesson about the implications of the hobby.  I planted the box last July, when the undergrowth was at its peak, and tried to find a spot that would have the least environmental impact.  I don't think I did a very good job.  <br>
<br>
So anyway, he's gone, which is the nature of Coyote I guess.  I haven't decided if he'll be replaced yet.<br>
