Congratulations to our one and only MobiusKlein!  We are so glad we had the opportunity to <br/>
letterbox with him and his lovely boxing assistant, Grandvilla, at the "Country Fair." Because <br/>
now we probably wouldn't be able to keep up with his pace due to his newly acquired well-<br/>
defined rectus abdominis!<br/>
On second thought, maybe we can keep up with him if indeed it wasn't the rectus abdominus <br/>
that he won, but a six-pack of Bud Light!<br/>

That voodoo doll is an equal opportunity bingo player and benefits all<br/>
collectively. There is only one rule: You must visualize the voodoo<br/>
gods in your head and chant this three times while dancing around in a<br/>
thong with a rubber chicken: "Sprinchick will call my word<br/>
today...Springchick will call my word today...Springchick will call my<br/>
word today" Now, if you do all that, it will work. Alas, our poor<br/>
friend, Tiptoe, didn't get this memo in time, and forgot to dance<br/>
around WITH the rubber chicken. All along, Tonto thought he was in<br/>
heaven! So,,,with a name like bird woman (that should cover the<br/>
chicken part) and waltzing pig (covers the dancing), you should be<br/>
okay. A word of caution though: DO NOT DANCE AROUND IN FRONT OF THE<br/>
WINDOW with the lights on at night and the blinds open. It scares the<br/>
neighbors! Let us all know how this goes for you. :)<br/>

IT DIDN'T WORK--I'm now at Day 24 without a BINGO word.  I did just <br/>
as you said.  I got my flip-flop thong sandals out of the swim bag <br/>
and put those on.  Then I went to the frig and got the tupperware <br/>
container with the leftover chicken from a dinner out.  And I twirled <br/>
around the house holding the tupperware and chanting the magic <br/>
words.  I can't believe I did such a bad job picking general terms--<br/>
