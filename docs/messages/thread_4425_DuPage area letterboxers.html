Message: <br/>
The FPDDC is beginning a letterbox program and I have placed two boxes<br/>
 to get things started.  I recently placed the clues on the<br/>
 letterboxing.org website, but would appreciate some assistance.  We<br/>
are trying to<br/>
 catalog all of the current letterboxes on our property and have their<br/>
 owners apply for approval.  We are doing this to help ensure they are<br/>
 following all of our rules and regulations, while not disturbing any<br/>
 sensitive natural areas.  Towards that I was hoping to get our official<br/>
 Letterboxing Rules and Regulations information posted on letterboxing.org<br/>
 and contact all owners who have placed boxes in DuPage County, IL to<br/>
 ensure compliance.  Please let me know if you can help me with either<br/>
of these matters.  I hope that we can continue to help letterboxing<br/>
grow in DuPage County and give people another way to enjoy visiting<br/>
our beautiful forest preserves.  Thanks for your time and<br/>
consideration, it is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

===================================================<br/>
<br/>
LbNA will include a link to the rules and regulations but there is a<br/>
connection here for Great Lakes area boxers, too.<br/>
While placers who have boxes in these areas cannot be compelled by<br/>
LbNA to contact the DuPage officials, fostering good relationships<br/>
will benefit all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping,<br/>

They'd do better just to concentrate on the geocachers anyway.  There are<br/>
probably 50 geocaches in an area for every 1 letterbox.<br/>
