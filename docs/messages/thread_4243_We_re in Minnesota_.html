                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're spending the week in the northwest region of WI, but will spend <br/>
the next 1 1/2 days in Minnesota.  We'll place 2 boxes tomorrow in NE <br/>
MN, then head down to the Lindstrom/Scandia area.  If anyone would like <br/>
to get together Friday night or Saturday, let us know. We could <br/>
probably get down to Minneapolis if that is the best place to meet up. <br/>
Since this is sort of last minute, here's a cell phone number you could <br/>
call if you want to meet up with us:  262-384-1502.<br/>
