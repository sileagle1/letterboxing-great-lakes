There will be a change jar at the gathering.  Make a donation...as many coins (or bills...or even checks!) as you'd like, and I will turn over the donations to the brand new (due to be dedicated this month) Fisher House at Hines VA Medical Center for use in purchasing items on their wish list.

As you know, I kind of have started my own personal tradition of organizing a service project at some of the major gatherings (collecting drink packets, pajama pants, batteries, childrens books, etc.). This year I'd like to continue the tradition at the GLG with "Change for the Better".<br>

<br>
I attended the official dedication of Fisher House #44 at Hines on Friday (I even shook hands with Ken Fisher himself!).  What an awesome job that organization does!  In fact, I'm so wrapped up in the spirit of Memorial Day and the work done by the Fisher House, that I'm making a challenge for all of you attending the gathering:  I will match your donations dollar for dollar up to $100.  <br>
<br>
I know Pitties already told me she had a jar of coins she was going to use as a door prize, but is donating it instead...thanks, Pitties!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Before I crashed out last night, I managed to count the change collected for the Fisher House.  We had about $72 (plus a few odd Canadian pennies and 2 eurocents!) in the jar, which means with my doubling of the amount (see the clues if you don't know what I'm talking about), we'll be making a $150 donation!  I'll be sure to put it in GLK's name, and will post a copy of the acknowledgment letter when they send it.<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone for your support of our Veterans and their families.<br>
