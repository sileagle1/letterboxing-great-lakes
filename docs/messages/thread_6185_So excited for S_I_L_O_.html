Having never been to one of these how do we prep the boxes?  Can we go wild like a table top or will they be hidden?<br>
<br>
Also is it going to be posted on AQ or do we register some other way?<br>

Confirmation:  Sandy, the manager and owner of the Silo Restaurant, has officially penciled in our group for Sunday, February 21, 2010, 12 noon till 5 pm. for  SILO #4 Comic Relief!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
I'm not going to put any restrictions on this group or attempt to limit the 'comic relief.'  Anything that seems wild, crazy, outrageous, fun, silly, or zany....go for it!   Boxes can be placed on tabletops, high and low, in rest rooms, in ketchup bottles, oh...just about anywhere a letterbox might be hidden.  Clues can be posted on AQ when we get the event listed....maybe I should just go ahead and do that now.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Lock (Scott) is sure to have a great event stamp for all of us.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Grey and gloomy.  Cold and drizzly.  I need some SILO #4 Comic Relief --- NOW!  <br>
