Awesome!  I went and read the clue, and it's a wonderful story. I wish I lived nearby so I could go see the "village turkey".  How fun.<br>
<br>
As far as whether it's Jeff or not, here's my story.  I live on a lake with wetlands outside my back door.  We get one pair of nesting swans every year.  The first year we named them, and for a few years, we could tell it was the same pair.  Eventually they moved on, and we named the second pair.  Unfortunately, since then we haven't been able to tell the rest of the pairs apart, so now they all have the same name!<br>

That reminds me of my grandparent's dogs.  They lived on a farm and their dogs generally didn't have a long life span--farm vehicles and a busy road being the cause.  They always bought the same breed and always called it "Blackie".  We'd go up for our week on the farm and try to figure out if the current "Blackie" was new or not.<br>

We have no idea why a turkey has returned or why the first turkey came to our village last year.  We have never had turkeys in this area.  But there are big smiles on the faces of many Lake Bluff residents today.  Despite the police department's 'evil' efforts last year, a wild turkey has returned to that very same corner.  We watched as Jeff was chased with a net, forced into the street, and hit by a car.  He lost some feathers, but he survived.  Strong bird.  He was caged and taken away.  And now, a turkey has returned.   A local resident and a local artist created a book called The Town Turkey.  Unlike what really happened, the storybook had a happy ending; the town turkey returned with his friends, "thousands of gleeful gooblers."  So one might say....dreams come true.  Gobble Gobble Gobble. <br>

Awesome! I went and read the clue, and it's a wonderful story. I wish I lived nearby so I could go see the "village turkey". How fun.<br>
<br>
As far as whether it's Jeff or not, here's my story. I live on a lake with wetlands outside my back door. We get one pair of nesting swans every year. The first year we named them, and for a few years, we could tell it was the same pair. Eventually they moved on, and we named the second pair. Unfortunately, since then we haven't been able to tell the rest of the pairs apart, so now they all have the same name!<br>
