Dear Angela,<br/>
<br/>
I have three letterboxes that I think are yours. You can come in to <br/>
our office (open Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM until 5:00 PM) to <br/>
pick them up. In the future if you wish to letterbox or geocache, you <br/>
need to register and pay a $10 fee for each calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Evelyn<br/>

<br/>
So, if anyone else has "lost" a box in the Winnebago County forest <br/>
preserves and wants to go with to see if they have them at the <br/>
office, let me know very soon. I hope to go sometime next week to <br/>
pick them up. :)<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking (I don't know if I posted this before or not) about <br/>
adding a "clue" to the LBNA website under Winnebago County with a <br/>
warning about placing boxes that aren't registered. I would feel bad <br/>
if someone new (or who doesn't read this message board) comes along <br/>
and decides to place a box in the county only to have it picked up.  <br/>
I would put a link to the website and the file where the rules and <br/>
forms are located. Does that sound like a good idea...or should I <br/>
ask...one I won't get flamed for? I don't count my places using the <br/>
numbers on the site, so I suppose that won't be a problem.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Angi - thanks for this update.  My Oak Ridge #1 letterbox has disappeared<br/>
recently, would you please check for it when you go to the FP headquarters?<br/>
Also - although I haven't been able to check on it, I fear my Deer Run #1<br/>
might have suffered the same fate.  Please look for it also when you go.<br/>
Those are the only two boxes of mine that were on FP property.<br/>
<br/>
Contact me at eirene16@hotmail.com please with your findings.<br/>
<br/>
And I would STILL like to know why my tax dollars are being spent browsing<br/>
the letterboxing site and confiscating letterboxes, when there are so many<br/>
other more important things!!!!! <snarl><br/>

Thanks,<br/>

Sounds like a good idea. We have the same thing in DuPage county. <br/>
Although the permit system is a year old, there have only been three <br/>
permit applications for letterboxes. <br/>
I met with the Ranger who approves the DuPage Forest Preserve <br/>
locations this past Monday to receive and affix my long <br/>
awaited "Official DuPage Forest Preserve Geocache" permit stickers to <br/>
my boxes. She (the Ranger) said they were starting to contact geocache <br/>
placers to have them fill out permit applications or remove their <br/>
caches. She said they will work on letterboxes later as there are so <br/>
many fewer of them.<br/>
I don't know about Winnebago but the guy in charge in DuPage is a <br/>
geocacher so "knowing" the boxes is natural for him. Really, I haven't <br/>
met a dud in the whole process so the permit system should be nice and <br/>
easy, and its free!<br/>
CMoon<br/>
<br/>
p.s. - I did relate my dissapointment to the Ranger that the permit <br/>
sticker said "geocache"!<br/>
