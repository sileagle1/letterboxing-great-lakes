                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had an interesting experience yesterday which made me think of our <br/>
recent discussions about new players in the letterbox game. I was out <br/>
doing a bit of maintenance and checking on some of my boxes.<br/>
The first thing I noticed was that several (okay, only four out of <br/>
six) were not re-hidden well at all.  That happens, right? But the <br/>
other common thread was that two of them were signed-in within the <br/>
pasts three days by self-described new letterboxers, one group <br/>
without stamps yet. Logbooks were not returned to plastic bags in <br/>
several cases.<br/>
I was reminded of a comment on another list that we should endeavor <br/>
to treat all boxes as though they were our own, both to protect their <br/>
future and to show the best example to new letterboxers. <br/>
I'm encouraged to read the enthusiasm of some new members here.<br/>
