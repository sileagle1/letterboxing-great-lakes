                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from Bristol (Friday, 7:30pm) having checked up on the<br/>
boxes there and to place new ones.<br/>
<br/>
I replaced the missing shoes and striped tights and placed them in<br/>
better hiding locations.  I also checked on all the other boxes and<br/>
they are doing just fine.<br/>
<br/>
At the request of the faire, I have also made a series of boxes for<br/>
patrons to try.  The clues to these boxes will not only be up on my<br/>
webpage, but Bristol will also be printing and providing them to the<br/>
patrons.  (Only the clues to the three new boxes, not the ones there<br/>
before.)  The handout will have info about letterboxing (what to do,<br/>
what not to do) and the clues and a place to stamp the box stamp, and<br/>
me for an email contact.<br/>
<br/>
The three new boxes are themed "Here Be Dragons" and feature stamps of<br/>
the three dragons on the Bristol map.  They are regular letterboxes<br/>
with a stamp pad inside for the patrons to use.  I don't know how long<br/>
they will last, so get 'em while they are there!<br/>

weekend.  I was hoping to have time to update the clues Monday night<br/>
before leaving for Door Cty but that won't happen.  I will be bringing<br/>
my laptop and working on them at night.  I'll upload them here and/or<br/>
on my website when I can, so check for updates.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, Bristol is VERY excited about the letterboxes being<br/>
there again - I believe to the point of me being able to leave all the<br/>
boxes there for more than one weekend.  Therefore I am planning to<br/>
leave  all the boxes in place until further notice, maybe for the rest<br/>
of the season.  So those of you who cannot make it this weekend,<br/>
here's your chance to plan another weekend.<br/>

I also got the following from Barefoot Ankh:<br/>
<br/>
"I just signed my company up for the Bristol<br/>
Renaissance Faire Premium Partners Ticket Program.<br/>
While I was signing us up I asked if an account could<br/>
be set up for groups (i.e. letterboxers) or only<br/>
companies.  They said that one could be set up for<br/>
letterboxers!  It would mean LbIL or LbGLK could have<br/>
a discount code for buying tickets online at the<br/>
faire's website.  The prices would be $12 adult/$7.50<br/>
child instead of $18.95/$9.50.  The code would be good<br/>
for the rest of this season and should also be good<br/>
for future seasons."<br/>
<br/>
I've asked him for more info, but there may be a good deal in the<br/>
future for us!<br/>

I was wondering if all the boxes will still be in place during Labor <br/>
Day weekend. Also, have your heard any more about the letterboxer's <br/>
discount at all? We are thinking about heading over there again for <br/>
the last weekend. We had such a great time that we want to do it all <br/>
again!! <br/>
Thanks much.<br/>
