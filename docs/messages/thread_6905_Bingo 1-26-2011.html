Well, today's words didn't help at all.  So far, I have 14 BOS and 6 Bingo.  I'm two away from a 6-pack or a straight-line--IF Mr Fo6 would start pulling from B and I. (hint, hint--what's your address again!)<br>

I'm at 14 for 50BOSC.  Still, not so good compared to most.  Maybe I'll have better luck next year.  <br>
