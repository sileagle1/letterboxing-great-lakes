Subject: [moderatorcentral] New Email Issues with Yahoo! Groups.<br>
<br>
As some of you have already noticed, there are currently two problems with email <br>
that have emerged in the last two hours.<br>
<br>
- Some users that have unsubscribed from groups have begun receiving emails <br>
again.<br>
<br>
- Users that have changed their email settings have begun to receive messages in <br>
their old setting (e.g. digest users getting individual again).<br>
<br>
The problem is only affecting groups with more than 500 members and our <br>
engineers have identified the issue and hope to have a fix in place shortly. We <br>
apologize for the inconvenience<br>
