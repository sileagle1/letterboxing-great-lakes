Hey, I checked the statistics and the GENERAL terms have had more than their share of calls already! 90% of them have been called, compared to only 70%, 73% and 80% of the other categories. Time for the G.T. to take a back seat for a while....  :-D<br>

My story is very similar to coffee beans, only I don't need a map to <br>
drive-by for that exchange. So if the certain trio no longer exists, <br>
can you still win a bingo with them? Hmmm..very interesting. <br>

LOL I see how it is around here!  Get a little close to calling <br>
bingo, and the truth comes out!  Nice!<br>
<br>
Believe me, I've checked the database about 6 times looking for my <br>
map!  Oddly enough, it's the same word I was waiting on for the 4 <br>
corners oh so long ago.... I've looked at it so much, I've convinced <br>
myself that it had to have been called by now.  So, I keep checking <br>
to make sure I didn't really  miss it! <br>

Reading all of this chatter, I am beginning to worry that one day I will say the magic word and 18 people will all call BINGO at the same time!<br>

  Ok, I'm feeling pretty guilty here about what I said about Bali & PPE. I can't take back my words of earlier back, however, I do have another confession to make; SpringChick *does* have a price, and I paid it. <br>
<br>
  What did I pay her off to do? Well, way back before this game began I paid her to put in a faux word or two into the mix of words to pick from.<br>
<br>
  For all of you waiting for a "map", well . . . uh . . . hmm . . . its never going to be called :-)<br>

  I was just looking in the files, because I couldn't remember who had <br>
  won the perimeter. No one has Bingo'ed on the perimeter. So those dos <br>
  UNO players will score a double victory--unless they call all my words <br>
  first! :~)<br>
