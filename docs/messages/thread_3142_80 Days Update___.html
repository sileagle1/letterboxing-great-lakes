the 80 Days series.  A couple of notes:<br/>
<br/>
- If you are hoping to complete the entire series and have not yet <br/>
done Box #9, you will want to get there ASAP because this park <br/>
closes for the season at the end of September!<br/>
<br/>
- Box #1 was verified as missing and has been replaced. New clues <br/>
can be found on the status page:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/projects/80days_status.asp<br/>
<br/>
- As far as we are aware all boxes are currently in place. As of the <br/>
end of September, we will no longer replace boxes that go missing. <br/>
At the end of October, we will be picking up the boxes. We had <br/>
originally thought to leave them in place indefinitely and possibly <br/>
even post the clues for general availability but after consideration <br/>
decided against this for two reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1) In fairness to the teams who worked the series from the passport, <br/>
we have decided not to make the boxes publicly available.<br/>
2) This was a very special series for us personally and we would <br/>
like to keep the boxes and logbooks rather than just allow them to <br/>
slowly disappear.<br/>
<br/>
So, in short...  we are no longer sending out new passports. If you <br/>
have a passport and still want to complete the series, you have <br/>
until the end of October, although if a box goes missing between now <br/>
and then, it will not be replaced. We will attempt to keep the <br/>
status page updated through the end of October to avoid unnecessary <br/>
trips to boxes that may be known as missing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you have already completed the series... and I have heard <br/>
a rumor that another postcard is on the way to the travel office as <br/>
we speak... the bonus boxes are still making the rounds via US Mail. <br/>
You can check the World Travellers Page to see where they currently <br/>
are (and thus how long before they get to you):<br/>

Thanks to everyone who spent the time and energy (and gas money) to <br/>
give this series a whirl. We really enjoyed this adventure and all <br/>
of the positive comments we received from those who participated!<br/>
