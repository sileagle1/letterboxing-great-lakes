What an amazing job she did on her Amazing Race style 'One Flew Over the Letterbox' event today!!!  It was a great idea and a great event.  Congrats to the Black Team for winning and the Green Team for taking 2nd.  Congrats to all the teams for their efforts and hardwork in today's event.  The Red Team wishes to extend our heartfelt thank you for all the work and effort Aurora put forth for the benefit of all of us!
