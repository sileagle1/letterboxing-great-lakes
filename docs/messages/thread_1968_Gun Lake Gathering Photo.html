                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just saw the photo taken by tj-mich team.  We all sure look happy.  I <br/>
guess that's cause it was a really great event.  Team Wonder Broads had <br/>
a great time and I can hardly wait for the next gathering.  <br/>
Carving a traveling stamp sounds like a great idea but since I carved <br/>
my first ever two stamps for the recent gathering, I better pass until <br/>
another time, but I have to admit, I'm hooked on carving!! <br/>
