try to keep up with reading the digests.  Between tax season and <br>
wedding planning - I haven't had much time for letterboxing :(  <br>
<br>
So when I went and saw the pictures from the SILO event, I was really <br>
wishing I could have made it.  I saw a lot of faces I recognized and <br>
it looked like a great time.  So now I am just dying for the June <br>
gathering to get here.  It is going to be a little mini-honeymoon for <br>
Jason and I (considering it is two weeks after our wedding).  <br>
<br>
And I will let you all know now that we will have some kind of box <br>
related to our wedding at the June gathering.  Might be a WOM box, <br>
might be a PT, might be a cootie . . . . nobody knows???<br>
More details to follow . . .<br>
<br>
And I also want to say THANKS to those of you who thought of my Adult <br>
Swim boxes during the Boston incident.  I thought that was great - <br>
they're famous now! And don't worry WI Hiker - those boxes are there <br>
to stay :)<br>
<br>
Take care all!<br>
