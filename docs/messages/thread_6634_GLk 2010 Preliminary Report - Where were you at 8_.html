What kind of friend schedule's his wedding opposite the gathering!?}<br/>
<br/>
Well, it sounds like we managed to miss any of the other 'adventures' <br/>
that the weekend had to offer. (I was curious why Hartx6 was calling me <br/>
at midnight on Saturday.)<br/>
<br/>
We had a great time at the get together on Friday night (Thanks to <br/>
HowDGirls, Lampwick, FungusWoman, Diana Dolphin) at the <br/>
pre-event..event.  It was a great way to build our excitement level <br/>
(wow, those sites looked great...we were sad, at the time, that we'd <br/>
weren't camping this year).<br/>
<br/>
And Saturday, although a bit damp, did not fall short of our <br/>
expectations.  It was great to see all our friends and do a bit of <br/>
boxing.  The hosts did a WONDERFUL job at choosing a site and putting <br/>
everything together.  I really liked the handy-dandy clue booklet with <br/>
the map...very professional!  And the stamps, by our hosts and others, <br/>
were phenomenal. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for the great time!  (and good to her FW is alright).<br/>
<br/>
So....when are we getting together again?<br/>
