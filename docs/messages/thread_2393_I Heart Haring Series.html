We were out boxing today, more on that later.  When we got home to log <br>
our finds, we discovered that we had an email from someone who had <br>
been out to Tyler Creek to look for the 3 boxes that we have planted <br>
there.<br>

Stick a Fork in Me is still there!!  <br>
<br>
I Heart Haring, however, has suffered a differnt fate.  It sounds like <br>
a control burn was done and that only the metal ring from our logbook <br>
remains.  We'll have to get out there to see if anything is salvagable <br>
from that series.  We will replace them if they are gone and update <br>
our clues.  Bummer!<br>
