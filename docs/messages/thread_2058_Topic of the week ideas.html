                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are some really great ideas here!  I've tried to steer clear <br/>
of the "favorite box/clue" topics, as far as commenting on other <br/>
people's boxes (i.e. finds) because it is so subjective (we all like <br/>
different things about letterboxes for different reasons) and it <br/>
could potentially be discouraging for people, cause hurt feelings or <br/>
unintentionally give spoilers.<br/>
<br/>
But certainly commenting on your favorite box planted and the other <br/>
topics listed offer a wide variety of discussion opportunities.<br/>

Thanks for posting this!<br/>
