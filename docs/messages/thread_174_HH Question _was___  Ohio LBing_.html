                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is a matter of preference.  Some folks just like to put the HH <br>
out there and let it be found without any announcement.  Some people <br>
like to hear when their HH is found, others don't.  Generally <br>
speaking if you find a HH and the person has left a note in the log <br>
requesting to be notified of the find, it is courteous to do so.  <br>
But ultimately whether you post to the list about any of these <br>
things is up to you.<br>
<br>
If you do choose to post, there are a few options.  There is [yet <br>
another] Yahoo group where a lot of people post HH info -- plants, <br>
finds, retires, etc.<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox_travellers/<br>
<br>
This group was formed because some of the people at the big list who <br>
had placed HH did not want to hear about their travels.  So it was <br>
decided to create a separate group for talk about HH.<br>
<br>
That being said, there are people who report HH finds, plants, etc. <br>
on the big list and on the regional lists (such as this) and as far <br>
as I know, none of them has been tarred and feathered for doing so.<br>
<br>
Last of all, Pete and Wanda keep a comprehensive list of HH and <br>
their travels.  They monitor the various Yahoo lists for posts about <br>
HH and you can also e-mail them directly to add a new HH or report a <br>
find.  Their site is at:<br>

Hope that helps!<br>
