I am planting nearby some boxes with personal stories and one of my best images yet.  Two of the hikes might be rugged enough and long enough even for Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man!  Now to write the clues before I lose my notes...<br/>

the Porcupine Mountains boxes 2 years ago and I am hoping to get the Lake <br/>

aspects of the park.  And when I asked for the box in the Visitors Center, I had <br/>
