weather is cooperative.  Is anyone else planning on going this <br>
weekend?  We would love to meet up for an exchange . . . just let us <br>
know when & where to meet.  <br>
<br>
We are really looking forward to this trip . . . originally we weren't <br>
going to go to the Faire this year since we are saving for our wedding <br>
next May.  However I couldn't pass up the chance to get the new Faire <br>
letterboxes . . . I know I know . . . I'm such a sucker for boxing :)<br>
<br>
Hope to see some of you there on Sunday!!<br>

Barefoot Ankh and I will be there on Sunday unless we sneak out to <br>
Irish Fest in Milwaukee or to do some LB-ing ourselves.  Neither of us <br>
will be in our respective shops, but instead wandering about with our <br>
treat baskets. But I will be near Royal Exchange around 12:45 for the <br>
daily parade and around 2:00 before our Wench Walk.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you there, and have fun wandering the Faire!<br>

We SO need to get back up there to the Faire - had alot of fun last <br>
time!!!<br>
<br>
Will Aim for Sunday - we also have some Boxing to do - theres a few <br>
in Lindenhurst just calling my name. We also did a little <br>
geocaching - is fun, but so far lacks that final 'reward' of getting <br>
that hand carved stamp. Made me appreciate how much I enjoy seeing <br>
them, and saving them!!!!<br>
<br>
Its more like, find it, sign in and.. now what. Still fun when Im <br>
too far from new boxes, but I wish there was just a little more.<br>
