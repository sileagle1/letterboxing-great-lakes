You're  never too old to go letterboxing.  Today, I was trying to explain to my  <br>
mother-in-law that I was going to look for some letterboxes after my  morning <br>
visit with her.  She asked me to explain about this hobby of  finding boxes.  <br>
She is 92 years old. She has  Alzheimer's Disease.  She is confined to a wheel <br>
chair. And she is legally deaf.  She can  still read, so I explain letterboxing <br>
to her using a dry erase marker  board.  After 50 minutes, she smiled and asked <br>
me - "How can I find some  of these letterboxes?" I may have to create and plant <br>
a special box for  her to find.  The look on her face was priceless when she <br>
said, "Oh,  it's just for FUN!"   She gets it!  <br>

This is also proof that humans have a 'fun gene'.  Some have it, some don't.  Letterboxers have a very healthy 'fun gene.'  I think I need to create and hide a special letterbox for my 92 year old mother-in-law to find.  When she finds it, I'll take a photo of her first find.  <br>

You're never too old to go letterboxing. Today, I was trying to explain to my <br>
mother-in-law that I was going to look for some letterboxes after my morning <br>
visit with her. She asked me to explain about this hobby of finding boxes. <br>
She is 92 years old. She has Alzheimer's Disease. She is confined to a wheel <br>
chair. And she is legally deaf. She can still read, so I explain letterboxing <br>
to her using a dry erase marker board. After 50 minutes, she smiled and asked <br>
me - "How can I find some of these letterboxes?" I may have to create and plant <br>
a special box for her to find. The look on her face was priceless when she <br>
said, "Oh, it's just for FUN!" She gets it! <br>
