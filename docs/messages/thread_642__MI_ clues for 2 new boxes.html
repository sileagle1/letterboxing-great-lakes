                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally getting around to writing and posting the clues to some of <br>
the boxes we've placed in the last month or so.<br>
<br>
Our first ever, micro-box is The Serene Swan letterbox, located in <br>
Montague. There is a companion box (the Savage Swan)<br>
<br>
Savage Swan was carved in tribute to "Sharon's" ordeal and her <br>
patience. After her watercraft became disabled, she attempted to <br>
steer for shore to do maintenance, when a male swan rushed at her. <br>
He bit her hard enough to bruise her entire hand. Once she was <br>
safely ashore, he kept swimming "en guard" for almost an hour, <br>
keeping Sharon trapped on shore.  Her patience outlasted his, and <br>
she was able to bring her repaired watercraft back to the marina. <br>
The Savage Swan letterbox it currently resides on private property, <br>
with permission. It has been requested that I not post the clues. <br>
However, the guidelines I was given allow me to give out the clues <br>
to anyone who finds the Serene Swan and emails a request for the <br>
Savage Swan clues.<br>
<br>
The Wood and Water Nymph letterbox had strictly straight forward <br>
already written and ready to publish, when I discovered that my <br>
delay in getting them posted could potentially interfere with <br>
another letterbox. (Well, of course they didn't know I had a box <br>
there before they placed theirs ... I dilly-dallied and didn't get <br>
them posted, so how could they?) So, I took the challenge <br>
SpringChick had offered along the lines of expanding ourselves, to <br>
create a mystery-box or to come up with creative clues and changed <br>
the straightforward clues into quite a little puzzle. <br>
<br>
I'm interested in hearing from anyone who finds the Wood and Water <br>
Nymph box (or at least attempts to solve the clues) for some <br>
feedback on what I've come up with. I'm hoping this might be <br>
something, for those of you wanted more than straightforward clues, <br>
to sink your teeth into.<br>
<br>
Now, if I can get the rest of the clues sorted out, I can go place <br>
some of these other boxes I've been creating. (grin)<br>
<br>
Clues for both can be found either on at letterboxing.org or at our <br>
Yahoogroup groups.yahoo.com/group/Letterboxing_Bindlestiff/ in the <br>
files area.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
