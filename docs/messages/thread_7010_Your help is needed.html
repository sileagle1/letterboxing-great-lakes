                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know there are many dog lovers in the world of letter boxing.  We adopted our sweet dog from Illinois Doberman Rescue Plus.  Well now there is a dog that is in desperate need of help.  A sweet 11 year old dog went missing after a car accident.  Please just read about it and forward to any one you think could help.  Thanks for your help trying to find Katie.  http://www.kevinportraits.com/katie.html<br>
