follow the "big list" and kinda keep to themselves and are thus hard <br/>
to reach and inform them about this group and the upcoming event, <br/>
etc, etc, I propose that in any new letterboxes placed in the April <br/>
and May that you include an information sheet(s) about THIS group <br/>
and the upcoming gathering.  That way we might be able to spread the <br/>
word a little better with those letterboxers as they hunt out the <br/>
new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Just a simple "flyer" they can take or copy down.  I'll put an <br/>
example in the "files" section when I get a chance.<br/>
