I'm pretty sure that if I had listed that box, I would have also listed the other Monty Python box we hid, The Boat to Castle Aaarrrgh (which is NOT listed on AtlasQuest, and which, btw, we hope to check on in the next few weeks per the box status report Dragon posted earlier this summer).  <br/>

Doodle beat me to it.<br/>
<br/>
I should be finishing up putting all the MPHG boxes on AQ this<br/>
morning.  Those who planted boxes should have access to the AQ<br/>
listings as well as me.<br/>
<br/>
If you planted a box, the only change you might want to make is to the<br/>
attributes for the box.  I've only been putting "kid friendly" and<br/>
"compass needed" as a default.  Planters know more, so please update<br/>
the attributes as you see fit.<br/>
<br/>
I am also indicating on AQ the latest info I have as to the box<br/>
status, including whether a box needs to be adopted as "first aid". <br/>
Planters and myself should be able to change this information as<br/>
information comes in making it much more efficient.<br/>
<br/>
No one should never change the location of the clues (my website) or<br/>
the restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
The listings on LbNA are changing over to being linked to the AQ<br/>
listing.  I will be looking to transfer ownership of the LbNA listings<br/>
down the road, if that is even possible.<br/>
<br/>
This is part of a massive overhaul of my listings at both sites if you<br/>
haven't noticed, as well as a major update to my webpages.  More on<br/>
that later.<br/>
