                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was just in Eastern Massachusetts for vacation.  I couldn't walk a<br/>
mile in any direction from my parent's home without tripping over a<br/>
letterbox.  And here's the thing -- they were *active*.  People were<br/>
letterboxing in the dead of winter, logging in, moving hitchhikers<br/>
around the area and around the country at Hitchhiker Hostels...the<br/>
place was (figuratively) packed.<br/>
<br/>
Makes me realize how quiet Milwaukee is.  We post finds on our boxes<br/>
maybe three times per summer or so.  There aren't THAT many of us...I<br/>
recognize that Massachusetts has a far greater population density, and<br/>
that contributes to it...<br/>
<br/>
Should we quietly, cryptically, teach more people about our sport?<br/>
<br/>
Or are we just inviting box monsters? (those who destroy after finding?)<br/>
<br/>
I have an idea, but I wanted to get some public feedback first.<br/>
