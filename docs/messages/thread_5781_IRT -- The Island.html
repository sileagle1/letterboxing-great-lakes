The box is right between the sapling and the large rock, under the large rock. I've placed a pretty red stone that was laying nearby on the spot to make things a bit easier.<br>

I did notice, that because the river flows in the direction of the hidding nook, when the water level is high, lots of sticks and leaves filled in the nook . . . making it very hard to identify as a hiding spot.<br>

So someone other than us couldn't find it?  A respected boxing duo - who are they?  We know we were the pathetic boxers that were climbing all over those chunks of concrete along the Mississippi River bank looking for the elusive box....(Shorty and Investigator Bacon can attest to our ability to miss recent boxes as well!)  At least with this box we can't use the excuse that camo-clothed adolescents were shooting at us with paintball guns like at the one of Shorty's that we missed!<br>
We are just disappointed that you didn't place a neon, blinking arrow for us when we return!...We will expect you to be standing there to lift the red stone for us...and maybe even stamp in for us too...after all, Tonto is the "Slackstamper"!<br>
Not all is lost..we were 18 out of 21 this past Sunday.  Pretty good for us!  At our age, our brain only works on a part-time basis.<br>

So, the two of us with 4 little ones in toe, walked along the side of the  <br>

insisted we double back as we could be shot!<br>

Becki and the kids headed back to the car . . . I exclaimed that I really  <br>
