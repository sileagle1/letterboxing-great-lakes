<br>
YES! - I found the elusive Mad Cow LB with a little help from my LbGlk friends, especially ArcheoFrog - Thanks!<br>
<br>
WAHOO! - I reached F500!  It was Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - a very good carving and cool bark-bound logbook by Verona Bird Patrol!<br>
<br>
YIPPEE! - I FOUND TIPTOE'S GLASSES!  I looked inside the Venus box thinking someone may have found them nearby and put them in the box.  No glasses.  I retraced her steps from there to Frankenstein.  No glasses.  Sometimes listening to that inner voice that says take another look works out - I went in to look near Frank, ducking under that final bush/tree, when I noticed a dark-tipped metallic "stick" - it was Tiptoe's glasses.  The rest of the glasses were under leaves and such just to the right of where we all probably stood when we looked for the glasses before.  <br>
<br>
What's next - I'm thinking of a bonus box for Frank (with permission) or a mini-series - Lost and Found in Minooka.<br>

No! No!  This was OUR BEST day!<br>
We have been up in Michigan away from our computers since Friday at noon...we attended the West Michigan Event today and walked into the shelter and mentioned to a small group that Tiptoe had lost her glasses at Frankenstein two weeks ago...she was interrupted with a chorus of "No!  They were found!  Didn't you see the post?"<br>
Needless to say, we were speechless and thrilled!<br>
Sunnysideup gets the prize for the BEST finder in our midst! Thank you to the 10th power!<br>
<br>
#2 Beautiful Day in Jennison allowed a long time friend to finally join us on the trail - she seemed to enjoy meeting several of our MI letterboxing pals and she even found two stamps on her own - one even without clues!  She had a natural knack!  Pretty good for her first stamp and first event!<br>
<br>
#3 As the years go by, it becomes even more enjoyable to have the opportunities to reconnect with familiar faces of longtime letterboxers, and still the joy in meeting a new boxer.  Today's event was a good reminder of past stamps and past fun times (aka Around the World in 80 Days and the like)  Thanks again to all the West MI event planners!  You did it again!<br>
<br>
#4  On the way home, Sherman's ice cream in South Haven was still open for us to get our last of the season "Chocolate Malt Supreme" waffle cone!  Doesn't get much better than that!<br>
<br>
#5  Many of you have had to listen to us sing the praises of the Hocking Hills area in Ohio as a "letterboxing destination." Spartan Fans finally took us up on it - and thanked us for telling them about one of the best areas here in the midwest that they've ever seen - made us proud!<br>
<br>
#6  Possibly the best news of the day...PURDUE BEAT OHIO STATE - YaHOOOOOOO!<br>
A very happy Tiptoe...and Tonto<br>
