1. Word of Mouth [WoM] are clues that are told or handed to another letterboxer. Not located on any webpage or database. These are immensely popular in England.<br>
<br>
2] Traveling event stamps, like legerdemaine's "K-Martha," have a mysterious method of finding their way to a gathering and then move on to the next gathering. These are usually not found anywhere but at gatherings.<br>
<br>
3]A HH Hostel is a location, either with a clue to find or just on a table in a basket or other container, where all HH brought to an event are put instead of just laying them out on a table. The rules generally are that anyone may stamp the HH but you may only take one with you if you leave one - leave 2; take 2, etc. The letterboxing purists feel that if the hostel has clues, then it's ok to count the HH as finds. If left in a container out somewhere in sight, they don't feel that they are legitimate finds.<br>
<br>
Never heard of "Show your stuff" tables! Are you sure they are legal?<br>
<br>
;-)<br>
<br>
Have fun and just get out there & box!!! [And show your stuff!]<br>
