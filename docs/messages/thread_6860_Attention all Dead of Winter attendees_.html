I'll be carving my event stamp tonight too - or at least getting a start. <br>
It sometimes takes me a week to do just one stamp, I'm so slow!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like to carve stamps in one sitting when possible and will stay up late into <br>
the night to finish up, but some are just too large/complex to complete at <br>
once.  I do however take little breaks as I work because my neck and shoulders <br>
get sore -- I've tried different positions, table heights, etc. and the ideal <br>
carving position is unfortunately not ideal posture for me.<br>
<br>
I usually carve at the dining room table because there is a lot of room, the <br>
table height is good and it allows me to be in the same vicinity as the living <br>
room where OldShoe is generally watching television or on his laptop. I often <br>
carve listening to music on headphones though -- so I guess it doesn't really <br>
matter if I am in the same place as him or not ;-)<br>
