Well, I haven't posted in a long time, don't know if any of you <br/>
remember me but.......we had just gotten into letterboxing near the <br/>
end of last summer and found about a half dozen when the weather <br/>
started to get cold.  We decided to wimp out and wait for better <br/>
conditions in the spring.  Its not spring yet but letterboxing fever <br/>
is starting to take over!  We are really interested in attending the <br/>
Gathering in June but don't have any homemade stamps to share or <br/>
boxes to bring and hid.  We would like to plant one or two closer to <br/>
home first to see how it goes.  It sounds like all of you are way <br/>
ahead of us in knowing about letterboxing.  Now, having said that, <br/>
maybe by June, we will have planted our first box and will feel more <br/>
comfortable bringing a box to the gathering or a new homemade stamp <br/>
to show off.  However, if none of this happens, can we still attend, <br/>
meet all you folks, learn ideas, and ask lots of dumb <br/>
questions??????   We promise to bring food and chocolate.<br/>

I know that Linda and I have not been active members really in this <br/>
club... we have had a lot of small piddly things that keep coming <br/>
up.. but like most people...we too started this great hobby last <br/>
summer.. we went out almost every weekend and vowed that when we <br/>
finally moved (to which we did) ... we would find a spot to plant or <br/>
first box...<br/>
<br/>
We would really enjoy attending the gathering that is planned for <br/>
the spring or early summer... <br/>
<br/>
Please let us know what we can do to help..<br/>

Have patience....I sent an email saying that we are coming to the gathering...and I haven't heard back yet either....I have however heard from Team Rabbit regarding the event box I'm contributing (which is AWESOME, if I do say so myself).<br/>
I always figure that other people don't camp out in front of the computer like I do, drinking in all things letterboxing!  : ))<br/>
The good news is ~ the Doglvrs will be at the gathering, so the wulfes can sit with us!  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting you,<br/>
Mrs. Doglvrs<br/>

Sorry, I don't have time to respond to every email that comes in <br/>
about the gathering, nor continually update the website.  Please <br/>
assume that I have gotten your email and just keep checking the <br/>

past month.  It's really not that difficult.  Besides, there are no pesky<br/>
bugs nor as many scratchy plants to claw at you.  It is actually a lot<br/>
easier to get to some hiding spots.  If you're worried about tracks in the<br/>
snow, you can just wait to publish your clues until we get more snow or<br/>
there is some melting.  A lot of places have enough deer tracks, dog tracks<br/>
or people tracks to not make it too obvious what route you took to plant the<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
We have no idea if we'll make it to the Gathering this year.  Timing/date<br/>
seems OK, but distance, traffic and lodging considerations will definitely<br/>
impact our decision.<br/>
<br/>
What I've seen on a "show your stuff" table are some stamps or boxes that<br/>
people created and that are somewhat unique or special for some reason,<br/>
interesting methods of recording your finds and plants (some have created<br/>
very impressive scrapbooks), photos of interesting letterboxing locations,<br/>
etc, etc.  Basically anything related to letterboxing that you think someone<br/>
else might be interested in looking at.<br/>
