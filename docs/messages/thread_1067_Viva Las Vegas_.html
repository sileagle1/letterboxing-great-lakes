Hi All,<br/>
Hope you can help.  I seem to recall that someone was just in Vegas recently.  <br/>
My hubby and I are going in a few weeks and wanted to get in a couple <br/>
letterboxes.  I saw on the site there's one by the Sigfried and Roy Theater and <br/>
by the neon graveyard.  Has anyone been to either of these or know of some <br/>
that are near the strip?   We've decided against a rental car so we're looking <br/>
for local stuff.  I've never been there, so i don't really have a sense of my <br/>
bearings.  Any suggestions would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Hi Grapevine Girl,<br/>
<br/>
I was in Vegas over Valentine's weekend, and I hunted down what is <br/>
reported to be the only surviving box on the strip - Feeling Lucky <br/>
(Reprise).  It's right on the strip, which makes it nearly impossible <br/>
to hunt undetected - my cousin started tap-dancing to create a <br/>
diversion to draw attention away from me when I replaced it.  It's a <br/>
really cute stamp, and worth the hunt.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn't get to search for any other boxes in Vegas (like the Neon <br/>
Boneyard), so I can't report on those.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip!<br/>
<br/>
