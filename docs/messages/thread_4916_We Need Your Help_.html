                    <div class="plaintext-content">Every year, more that half a million babies are born too soon. More <br/>
than 120,000 are born with serious birth defects, like our Joseph was.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't have to be that way. You can do something about it.<br/>
<br/>
We (Steve, Christa &amp; Emily) are walking in the March For Babies with <br/>
the March of Dimes. We are walking in Joseph's memory and we need <br/>
your help. We have a goal to raise as much money as we can to help <br/>
babies have a better chance at survival.<br/>
<br/>
We aren't asking for much, whatever you can afford to give would be <br/>
greatly appreciated, even if it's only $1.00--just give something. <br/>
You can make a donation using a credit card by visiting our blog <br/>
www.pinknbluemaketwo.blogspot.com (there are 2 links for donations in <br/>
the sidebar) or you can contact us through AQ to find out where to <br/>
mail a check. If your company has an employee donation match program, <br/>
you can even double your contribution at no extra cost to you. All <br/>
donations are tax deductible.<br/>
<br/>
We want to thank everyone who donated to our team last year. You all <br/>
helped us to raise over $1700 to help babies and we're hoping that <br/>
maybe, just maybe, we can get close to that amount again this year. <br/>
Who knows, maybe we can beat it!!! Be assured that $.90 of each $1.00 <br/>
raised by the March of Dimes is used to carry out their mission.<br/>
<br/>
Every donation helps, no matter how big or small it is. Please donate.<br/>
<br/>
You'll be helping incredibly adorable, totally lovable, absolutely <br/>
wonderful little babies.<br/>
<br/>
One day, every baby will be born healthy. But we have to walk to get <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your time,<br/>
The Cottontails<br/>
