&gt; The entire LB community is going to have to be on its toes with <br/>
the release<br/>
&gt; of the new Letterboxing and Geocaching Interest Project Patch by <br/>
GSUSA.  &gt;  <br/>
<br/>
When I clicked on a link about this in another message on this site, <br/>
it seemed like this project was geared more for high school age <br/>
scouts.  Is there a similar badge for younger scouts--I can't find <br/>
it or don't know where to look?  My daugher's troop is 4th through <br/>
6th graders.   I had told the leader I would help with camping and <br/>
could also help with a badge if she needed it.  If I help with a <br/>
badge, I would love for it to be letterboxing (if such a thing <br/>
exists), since my daughter and I both love letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows more about this, could they send me the info of the <br/>
link.<br/>

younger scouts. You can always teach them about letterboxing as a <br/>
patch activity instead. Just as much fun. You can get them the LBNA <br/>
patch (if you can order less than bulk).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know if you can order the LBNA patch by the piece?<br/>
