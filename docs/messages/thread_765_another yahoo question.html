I've started a yahoo group for boxers who belong to our GS<br>

<br>
Also, nobody necessarily sees the same ads when they visit the same pages <br>
on Yahoo. The ads change frequently, and are dynamically delivered, so I <br>
wouldn't imagine that too many people in your group would even see a <br>
particular ad.<br>
<br>
That said, I would be surprised if Yahoo! *didn't* targets ads to groups <br>
where they get the most response -- so maybe it's that GS leaders click <br>
most often on that type of ad!<br>
