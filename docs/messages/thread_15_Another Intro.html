Township, Michigan, and share the trail name TJ_Mich.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We first learned about letterboxing through a wire service article in<br/>
the Detroit News &amp; Free Press travel section on February 1, 2003.   We<br/>
carved our signature stamp that week (you can imagine the surprise on my<br/>
wife's face when *I* asked *her* if we could go to Michael's to buy the<br/>
supplies) and went searching for our first boxes the next weekend.   We<br/>
were 1-for-2 that first day, but our "success rate" has improved quite a<br/>
bit since then.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we started letterboxing, we were glad to see there were already<br/>
several boxes in our native U.P., and we've planted several more there<br/>
in the past year.   We also have a couple in Ann Arbor, and one each in<br/>
Ohio and Wisconsin.   Our goal in planting letterboxes is to lead people<br/>
unfamiliar with a particular area, to interesting places that they<br/>
probably wouldn't have known about or stopped at if they were simply<br/>
passing through.   We have very much enjoyed the off-the-beaten-trail<br/>
locations to which letterbox hunts have led us.  Some great examples of<br/>
this are the Seul Choix Point lighthouse near Manistique, Michigan;<br/>
Crisp Point Lighthouse along Lake Superior; Alum Rock Park near San<br/>
Jose, California, and the Eternal Flame south of Buffalo, New York.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our website has clues for all 18 boxes that we've planted, as well as a<br/>
list of our "finds" and our "attempts."  It's at<br/>

<br/>
Look forward to meeting many of you - either on the trail, or perhaps at<br/>
the next Great Lakes Gathering??  The first one was fantastic!<br/>
