                    <div class="plaintext-content">Does anyone know how to reach Baby Bird's Dad a/k/a Little Bird's<br>
Dad?  I tried the contact the placer link as well as the e-mail<br>
address in his clue without success.  <br>
<br>
We suspect that The Flower is missing.  There's a fence that looked<br>
new, which blocks a trail into the woods.  However, the sign didn't<br>
prohibit hikers - just certain animals.  Being determined and<br>
adventurous, we continued to follow the clues.  They seemed clear,<br>
but we didn't find the box anywhere near the tree. <br>
<br>
We hoped that Baby Bird's Dad might have an opportunity to check on<br>
The Flower.  If its still in place and we just missed it, wed like<br>
to look for it on our next trip to the area.<br>
<br>
We enjoyed our trip to Independence Grove and found Pleasant Valley<br>
in good shape.<br>

Thanks,<br>

You know, we had the same problem you did with contacting this guy.  <br>
One of his boxes was soaked, and we tried to let him know, but no <br>
luck....<br>

PS  Cute story about that particular find....  We were beaten to the <br>
hiding place by a large family who appeared to be taking their <br>
little guy on his first letterboxing quest.  When they saw us coming <br>
around the bend with our pack, stamp journal, and muddy hiking <br>
boots, one of them said "Wow! Real letterboxers!"    <br>

I was also unable to find Pleasant Valley, but am new and therefore <br>
maybe not looking in the "right" places.<br>

Do you remember the date you found Pleasant Valley?<br>
