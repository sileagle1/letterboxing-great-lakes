<br/>
We suspect that The Flower is missing.  There's a fence that looked<br/>
new, which blocks a trail into the woods.  However, the sign didn't<br/>
prohibit hikers - just certain animals.  Being determined and<br/>
adventurous, we continued to follow the clues.  They seemed clear,<br/>
but we didn't find the box anywhere near the tree. <br/>
<br/>
We hoped that Baby Bird's Dad might have an opportunity to check on<br/>
The Flower.  If its still in place and we just missed it, wed like<br/>
to look for it on our next trip to the area.<br/>

We enjoyed our trip to Independence Grove and found Pleasant Valley<br/>

You know, we had the same problem you did with contacting this guy.  <br/>
One of his boxes was soaked, and we tried to let him know, but no <br/>
luck....<br/>

PS  Cute story about that particular find....  We were beaten to the <br/>
hiding place by a large family who appeared to be taking their <br/>
little guy on his first letterboxing quest.  When they saw us coming <br/>
around the bend with our pack, stamp journal, and muddy hiking <br/>
boots, one of them said "Wow! Real letterboxers!"    <br/>

I was also unable to find Pleasant Valley, but am new and therefore <br/>
