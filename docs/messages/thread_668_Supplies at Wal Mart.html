Somone posted about being able to buy supplies online at dickblick.com.  misterart.com is another site you can check out, depending on what you're looking for.  That's where I bought our speedball carving set from, because the Michael's didn't start stocking it until 3 weeks _after_ I bought the set online *grumble*grumble*grumble*shipping fees could have been avoided*<br>

In the mean time I visited one of those "Dollar castles" and with the "back to school" offers I've got 5 white  erasers (aprox 1 by 2 inches, maybe just bigger) for 1 dollar...<br>

they carve like butter, not crumby at all and 1/4 inch thich...<br>
 <br>
I am using them to practice and because some stamps look OK maybe I'll save them for a box.<br>
 <br>
so I would say I could alternative media and do fine to start... but the cut tool... Y find it very handy! does not replace the old Xacto, but does some unique work though.<br>
 <br>
Images for carving?<br>
well, I like animals and plants, so I used outdoor magazines that ussually inlude logos with sketches of fish, deer, birds, etc. They don't have much details but are nice silhouetes. They are quite standard, but to preactice they are just fine...<br>
