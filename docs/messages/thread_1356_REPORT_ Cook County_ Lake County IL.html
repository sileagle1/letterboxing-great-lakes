both at River Trail Nature Center, in Northbrook.<br>
<br>
Had a wonderful Sunday morning hike going after both these boxes.  Both<br>
boxes found in good order.  Employees or volunteers seemed to have worked at<br>
keeping the nature center nicely rustic.  Chipmunk Heaven.  Chipmunks just<br>
simply all over the place.<br>
<br>
When we went looking for the Little Red Fox, we were sitting on a bench by<br>
the pond quietly talking and heard a commotion on the trail further down.<br>
Even tho dogs aren't allowed, along came a gentleman with both a Doberman<br>
and a Greyhound.  At least he had them both on lead.  He was practically<br>
dragging both dogs along however.  Both wanted to keep going back in the<br>
direction they had come.<br>
<br>
So we looked down the trail behind them and we did a double-take at what was<br>
coming along behind the three of them.  A White-Tailed doe.  We couldn't<br>
believe it.  The doe was about 20 feet behind the man and the two dogs and<br>
actually following them.  He'd stop to get better control of the dogs, she'd<br>
stop.  He'd get the dogs moving forward again, she'd move forward with them.<br>
<br>
Then Ancient and I made a mistake.  We moved.  That caught her eye.  She<br>
started over to us.  We rose and began walking down the trail in the<br>
opposite direction from the man and dogs.  We stopped.  She stopped.  We<br>
walked.  She walked.  I'm well used to Holsteins doing this, but<br>
White-Tailed deer???  She stopped at the edge of the woods tho, she didn't<br>
follow us out into the parking lot.  Which was good because it's one thing<br>
to try to explain how a dog followed me home but.........<br>
<br>
3.  Virgo, placed by Flying J at Ryerson Woods Conservation Area in the<br>
Deerfield area.<br>
<br>
We drove up Milwaukee Ave from Northbrook.  Passed a lady walking a<br>
three-legged Groen down Riverwoods Rd when we got close to Ryerson.  Being<br>
owned by two four-legged Groens, I was going to stop and say hi, since Groen<br>
folk often do that, but if I'd tried, the car behind us would have ended up<br>
in the bed of my truck.  The day was going too nicely at that point, so we<br>
didn't do that.  We waved enthusiastically, the lady probably thought we<br>
were totally nuts, and we kept going.<br>
<br>
Being totally, 100% directionally-challenged, one look at the Ryerson map<br>
told us we were going to get lost.  This place has quite a few trails.  But<br>
it also told us that if we did get lost, there was a ton of stuff out there<br>
to explore.<br>
<br>
Another mature woods Chipmunk Heaven.  We explored the dam and the Ryerson<br>
cabin, we explored the Smith River Cabin, and down the trail north of the<br>
Smith cabin we ran across a tree with the largest burls we've ever seen in<br>
our lives, we explored up and down the Des Plaines River where there was a<br>
lovely batch of brilliant yellow iris.  We walked over to explore the roots<br>
of a huuuuge uprooted tree and ran smack-dab into a grey squirrel<br>
convention.  We promptly and loudly got told off by said squirrels.  We<br>
promised to come bearing gifts of sunflower seeds on our next visit, but the<br>
squirrels weren't about to be appeased by a promise of future gifts.  So we<br>
quietly took our leave of their convention.<br>
<br>
And yes, we even found the bridges we needed to find to locate the box.<br>
<br>
By 2pm, it had started to rain while we were playing around by the dam and<br>
watching a blue heron on the other side of the river.  The walk back to the<br>
parking lot was great.  Even with the rain coming down fairly good, the<br>
canopy was thick enough that we were barely getting wet.  We did, however,<br>
need to make a run for it from the edge of the woods to the truck.<br>
<br>
And what topped the day off was that Ryerson Woods even had beautiful flush<br>
toilet bathrooms attached to the Visitor Center.  One for boys.  One for<br>
girls.  Yes!<br>
