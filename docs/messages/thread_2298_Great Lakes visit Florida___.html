Have any of you other Great Lakers hidden boxes in Florida?  We hope <br/>
to find at least a few while we are down there...<br/>

  I have 3 boxes I need to plant down in the Sarasota area where my parents are retired, but I haven't gotten down to visit in a while!  I'm SOOOOO looking forward to a visit soon   :-)<br/>
