  Anyone else have periodic "fights" with a box you haven't found but have tried and tried to find? I had even "hidden" the clues to this one in my files, so as not to accidentally see the dreaded sheets upon sheets that have gone into our attempts on this box.<br>
<br>
  It just so happens that tomorrow I expect to be hiking near where the pain-my-patootie MathMan's Rainbow Powder LB is. What can it hurt to look AGAIN, since I'll be so close? The phrase "a good walk spoiled" comes to mind. I'm not sure if I'm exhibiting perseverance or stubborness on this one.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, there was one box. Don't know how many times we looked for it. I think we took a shot every time we visited that particular park. For some reason, I wouldn't give up. Finally found it and what a rush! Especially since it hadn't been found in a very long time ;o)<br>

If ANYONE can find this box, it is going to be you!  Call it perseverance, stubborness or a good dose of bloodhound in you...Remember you are the Queen of finding hidden/lost eyeglasses, phones, etc,...so why not elusive boxes!  We have complete confidence in you!<br>

These clues are the trickiest ones I have ever come across. After each attempt on this box (at least four!), I emailed Dragon with a progress report. He kindly offered feedback along the way.<br>
<br>
My thanks to Dragon for his guidance and patience as I worked on finding this box!  The stamp is beautiful!  As you might expect from a "sunny", I like the colors of the rainbow.  :)<br>
