Just joined this group and wanted to say "hi".<br>
We are a letterboxing family of 5 and live in SW Pennsylvania. We'll <br>
probably not be getting too active in your area, but would like to <br>
check out some boxes in Ohio. And if there ever was a gathering in <br>
Ohio.... ;)<br>
By the way, does anyone know where to get a map of the counties in <br>
the Great Lakes area states?<br>

Here's another electronic "Hi!".  Will we see you at the SILO <br>
gathering next Saturday?  You'll be able to get a face-to-face "Hi!" <br>
from a bunch of fanatics, not to mention do some exchanges and meet <br>
some very nice people!<br>

Hello again, I didn't know if I should rub it in, I mean mention to <br>
everyone in the cold areas, that I just got back from spending five <br>
wonderfully warm day in Florida while visting my Mom.  It was fun to <br>
Letterbox in Florida with my Mom and now she is hooked.  I sent her <br>
and her boyfriend to check up on the wild pigs, I'll hear from them <br>
soon to see if they found it.    <br>

Hope that our "Wild Pigs Run Amuck" is not MIA and that your mom and <br>

Sorry for the bad news, my Mom whent yesterday to find the wild pigs <br>
and they came up empty handed.  It sounds like they looked pretty <br>
good.  I guess we will have to wait until you visit in April.<br>
