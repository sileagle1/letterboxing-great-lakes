confirm or correct this.)<br>
<br>
The info about the HH is listed prominently on the Grail site, before any of<br>
the clues.  As it states, you should now post to this group the name of the<br>
grail box you placed the HH in and send Dragon an email message so he can<br>
update the Grail site with the current location.<br>
