Subject: Any Illini out there?<br/>
<br/>
Hi All! You all seem so connected, but you also seem close to each<br/>
other as well, Ohio mostly correct? Are there any people from<br/>
Illinois (suburbs of Chicago) out there? It would be fun to have<br/>
some local connections as well. Fear not my midwestern friends,<br/>
I've got on board with this letterboxing and am willing to go all<br/>
over the country to do it!!! :)<br/>
