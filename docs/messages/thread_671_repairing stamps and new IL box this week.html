to just run back to exchange it, so I'm using it mostly for indoors boxes,<br>
thinking the less climactic changes they have to go through, the better<br>
they'll hold up.  Which reminds me...I've got another one going out<br>
tomorrow!  Just getting final approval on the clues from the hosting site.<br>

I think that it would repel ink too much, but I have never tried it.<br>
I always use master carve or speedy stamp that does'nt crumble easy.<br>
Also if you dont get an even coat on the stamp it will effect the way<br>
the stamp looks after it is stamped.<br>
