  Now that it's getting warmer in the Great Lakes area, I think it would be a good idea for everyone, even beginners, to design and plant a new letterbox. That would mean more boxes for everyone to find. A win win for everyone! April 1 (April Fools Day) might be a good day go outside and 'fool around' and plant new boxes, but April 1 falls in the middle of the week. Maybe we could try to plant new boxes the first week in April. What does everyone think? Is anyone else still awake? I'm a night owl. <br/>

It was a long, cold, snowy, icy winter.  The snow came early and there was so much of it that we all found ourselves stuck indoors.  I too am a carving addict.  I find it relaxing to doodle a design and then carve it into a stamp.  But finding a place to hide all those stamps can be difficult.  So, some of them will become rather nice hitchhikers instead.  Whatever you do, don't go cold turkey.  Have fun placing 27 boxes.  That will be a challenge.  <br/>
