                    <div class="plaintext-content">Several weeks ago my beloved wife, Becki, and I decided to go to <br>
Rockford for our 9th anniversary (April 10) and spend the night, <br>
leaving our 4 ones with Grammy & Granddad.<br>
<br>
Little did we know that Rockford was in the eye of the storm and was <br>
to be pummeled by rain!!<br>
<br>
We decided to go through with the trip, rain or no rain, letterbox or <br>
no letterbox . . . after all this was our anniversary and all that <br>
mattered was spending time together ~ without the children.<br>
<br>
Driving up the wipers on high, water on the road, can't really <br>
see . . . can't our wipers go any faster??<br>
<br>
We brought with us 2 huge umbrellas, we were going to try <br>
letterboxing in the rain (something I *never* thought I'd do... too <br>
worried my logbook would get wet).<br>
<br>
By the time we got to "Irish Penny" the rain had subsided some and we <br>
were able to grab it and log in in a little shelter house there. <br>
Everything was going just fine, perhaps we could do this after all.<br>
<br>
We next went to "Swooop" the rain picked up, but we couldn't miss <br>
this chance to pick up one of the Illinois Road Trip boxes. Was it <br>
worth it!! A wonderful hand carved stamp by Krait ~ A Blue Diamond on <br>
Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
"Grab" on the other hand seemed to be a walk, and the wind and rain <br>
picked up considerably. We were being blown around a lot and the path <br>
next to the river was washed out, but we found an alternative and got <br>
the box. Another Awesome stamp by Krait made this well worth the <br>
soaking to get it.<br>
<br>
Becki would stand over me as I stamped in trying to keep the rain <br>
away. I kept my umbrella over my back to try to save my backpack and <br>
its contents . . . by the time we got back my front was 100% soaked <br>
through.<br>
<br>
Next we drove into town and found "Rockford Peaches" a wonderful box <br>
with a great overlook of the ball park where they played, thanks to <br>
Nature Nerd.<br>
<br>
We then attempted "Ode to a Rose" and now the rain was pelting us. <br>
Soaked and freezing we walked on and found both of the "Den Grimme <br>
Aelling" boxes and stamped in under the little shelter there.<br>
<br>
As we were walking to the second "Den Grimme Aelling" box Becki says <br>
to me, "Matt, I love you, but no stamp is worth this." <br>
<br>
Though I beg to differ I couldn't complain, I promised after this we <br>
would go and get a bite to eat and dry off some and perhaps our day <br>
of boxing was over.<br>
<br>
After eating at one of my favorite places ever (Cajun Chicken from <br>
Popeyes -- we need a Popeyes in the QCA!!) we both felt better and to <br>
my surprise Becki picked up the map and clues and looked to see what <br>
box we could get next -- have I told you yet of how much I love my <br>
wife?<br>
<br>
Off to "Jake's Third Birthday" and what a nice surprise to see River <br>
Rat's log in that said, "This is my first letterbox ever!" talk about <br>
a historical box LOL.<br>
<br>
After that we drove to the "Goose Barn" a much appreciated indoor box <br>
where we exchanged with the owner Dumpster Diva. <br>
<br>
We then decided to find "Fish Tank: Castle" after arriving we saw the <br>
tree it was hidden near about 300 yards out down a paved bike path. <br>
It was still raining good and I told Becki, "300 yards never looked <br>
so far" we both looked at the "No Motorized Vehicles" sign and she <br>
glanced at me and said, "I wont tell if you don't."<br>
<br>
We looked back and forth and it *was* a quite road we were on. So I <br>
did what any weary, wet, tired guy would do . . . I put the car in <br>
drive and down the path we went. I ran to the tree as Becki got our <br>
stampin' gear out so that we could hurry up and log in before the <br>
cops showed up. We logged in in record time and I through the car in <br>
reverse... ahh, just what we needed a shot of adrenalin.<br>
<br>
We then drove to "Know You're Place" by Shutterfly, as we neared the <br>
park I commented to Becki, "Well, we must be getting close, the rain <br>
is coming down harder." once there and wandering around a bit in the <br>
wrong direction we figured out our error and found the box, with only <br>
a little help from Trail Rider who had me on the phone figuring out <br>
our meeting that night.<br>
<br>
Becki & I had figured on going over to Boone County and finding the <br>
couple boxes over there before the sun went down. But I relented and <br>
made the alternate suggestion of going to the hotel, checking in and <br>
drying off!! <br>
<br>
Trail Rider and her husband NamVet showed up a little alter and we <br>
chatted about an hour. I was honored to have gotten to know TR better <br>
and meeting Russ for the first time. We had a great time chatting for <br>
about an hour or so.<br>
<br>
After they left we hopped in the van to go to dinner -- at something <br>
past 8:00 pm.<br>
<br>
After the day was over I looked through the logbook and counting the <br>
couple of mystery boxes we managed 12 boxes and 2 exchanges in the <br>
pouring rain no less!<br>
<br>
Today we had some high hopes again, and started with "Fish Bowl: <br>
Bowl" that is listed as "missing" with no finds since 2006. We found <br>
the "hard to find" park and couldn't believe our luck, the sun was <br>
out!<br>
<br>
We followed the clues and there was the box!! Right out in the open!! <br>
it was replaced by Camp Redwing Flyers on August 10, 2007 and no one <br>
has logged it as found since late 2006! CRF made this stamp with some <br>
foam cut and glued in the shape of a fish bowl... a little small but <br>
manageable. A Very nice surprise - and a great way to start the day!<br>
<br>
Off to Boone County for the 3rd and last installment of the "Fish <br>
Bowl" series -- the fish! And we found that Camp Redwing Flyers had <br>
replaced this box as well... only with a store bought stamp.<br>
<br>
Then one of the boxes I really wanted to find [side note: last Sept. <br>
we found a box that had Cookoo Clues inside that told us to take the <br>
clues if we planned on finding this box . . . so I did!] finally, now <br>
time to find the box! We found "Darting Dragons" just as the rain <br>
started to fall again :-(   Will it ever end?<br>
<br>
We decided to head back and try "Ode to a Rose" and "A River Runs <br>
through it" again. Having troubles with "Ode to a Rose" for the <br>
second day in a row (and knowing it was just found a couple weeks <br>
ago) I called Trail Rider for some help, she asked where we were and <br>
said, "Don't move, we'll be there in 2 minutes."<br>
<br>
before we knew it she and Pastors Wife showed up! Taking a walk over <br>
their lunch break. We chatted as we went to the *other* side of the <br>
park to the box . . . something's not right! I took out my compass <br>
and with Trail Rider, Pastor's Wife and Becki as witnesses it was <br>
pointing DUE EAST instead of due north!! What!?!? Its a wonder I've <br>
found any boxes at all with a bum compass.<br>
<br>
We walked down the trail to a "River Runs through it" I consider this <br>
the "event stamp" of our weekend as Rockford, Illinois is carved in <br>
it and it has water in the stamp.<br>
<br>
Then for the thrill of the trip, we followed Trail Rider to her place <br>
of employment where we had the wonderful opportunity to meet the <br>
master carver himself . . . Krait!!<br>
<br>
We chatted, showed off our stamp work and talked techniques. I've <br>
found so many of his stamps and they are all such works of art, this <br>
was a definite highlight -- helped in part that it took place <br>
indoors -- Krait is a wonderful gentleman whose stamps are all worth <br>
the hunt!!<br>
<br>
Afterwards we had a bite to eat before heading out for our next <br>
box . . . we followed the clues up until the point the path we were <br>
walking on was submerged with water!! The wind picked up so fast we <br>
thought a hurricane was coming, we could hardly walk back to the van. <br>
<br>
This whole area seemed a flood plane and we decided to forgo our next <br>
attempt at a series of 5 boxes. There is always next time right?<br>
<br>
We did add another 5 finds today for a total of 17!<br>
<br>
My wonderful wife was just that, wonderful!! Thank you Becki for <br>
putting up with me . . . even in the rain and mud, wind and all!!<br>
<br>
Of course, I had to promise for our next anniversary we were doing to <br>
the Container Store and Old Navy!!<br>

We're on the trail of a few more IL Road Trip boxes this weekend.  Left work promptly today and managed to find the Pitties "Up, Up and Away" (The Hidden Gem) box before it was dark.  This was our 2,800th find!  We're now in Bloomingdale/Normal and had a tasty pizza dinner at a place that has been in business for 70+ years.<br>
<br>
The temperature is nippy and the wind rather fierce, but we're hoping to find several more Road Trip boxes this weekend, in addition to eating one of those famous Maid Rite sandwiches for lunch tomorrow!<br>

  Subject: [LbGLK] Rockford in the Rain (long post)<br>
<br>
<br>
  Several weeks ago my beloved wife, Becki, and I decided to go to <br>
  Rockford for our 9th anniversary (April 10) and spend the night, <br>
  leaving our 4 ones with Grammy & Granddad.<br>
<br>
  Little did we know that Rockford was in the eye of the storm and was <br>
  to be pummeled by rain!!<br>
<br>
  We decided to go through with the trip, rain or no rain, letterbox or <br>
  no letterbox . . . after all this was our anniversary and all that <br>
  mattered was spending time together ~ without the children.<br>
<br>
  Driving up the wipers on high, water on the road, can't really <br>
  see . . . can't our wipers go any faster??<br>
<br>
  We brought with us 2 huge umbrellas, we were going to try <br>
  letterboxing in the rain (something I *never* thought I'd do... too <br>
  worried my logbook would get wet).<br>
<br>
  By the time we got to "Irish Penny" the rain had subsided some and we <br>
  were able to grab it and log in in a little shelter house there. <br>
  Everything was going just fine, perhaps we could do this after all.<br>
<br>
  We next went to "Swooop" the rain picked up, but we couldn't miss <br>
  this chance to pick up one of the Illinois Road Trip boxes. Was it <br>
  worth it!! A wonderful hand carved stamp by Krait ~ A Blue Diamond on <br>
  Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
  "Grab" on the other hand seemed to be a walk, and the wind and rain <br>
  picked up considerably. We were being blown around a lot and the path <br>
  next to the river was washed out, but we found an alternative and got <br>
  the box. Another Awesome stamp by Krait made this well worth the <br>
  soaking to get it.<br>
<br>
  Becki would stand over me as I stamped in trying to keep the rain <br>
  away. I kept my umbrella over my back to try to save my backpack and <br>
  its contents . . . by the time we got back my front was 100% soaked <br>
  through.<br>
<br>
  Next we drove into town and found "Rockford Peaches" a wonderful box <br>
  with a great overlook of the ball park where they played, thanks to <br>
  Nature Nerd.<br>
<br>
  We then attempted "Ode to a Rose" and now the rain was pelting us. <br>
  Soaked and freezing we walked on and found both of the "Den Grimme <br>
  Aelling" boxes and stamped in under the little shelter there.<br>
<br>
  As we were walking to the second "Den Grimme Aelling" box Becki says <br>
  to me, "Matt, I love you, but no stamp is worth this." <br>
<br>
  Though I beg to differ I couldn't complain, I promised after this we <br>
  would go and get a bite to eat and dry off some and perhaps our day <br>
  of boxing was over.<br>
<br>
  After eating at one of my favorite places ever (Cajun Chicken from <br>
  Popeyes -- we need a Popeyes in the QCA!!) we both felt better and to <br>
  my surprise Becki picked up the map and clues and looked to see what <br>
  box we could get next -- have I told you yet of how much I love my <br>
  wife?<br>
<br>
  Off to "Jake's Third Birthday" and what a nice surprise to see River <br>
  Rat's log in that said, "This is my first letterbox ever!" talk about <br>
  a historical box LOL.<br>
<br>
  After that we drove to the "Goose Barn" a much appreciated indoor box <br>
  where we exchanged with the owner Dumpster Diva. <br>
<br>
  We then decided to find "Fish Tank: Castle" after arriving we saw the <br>
  tree it was hidden near about 300 yards out down a paved bike path. <br>
  It was still raining good and I told Becki, "300 yards never looked <br>
  so far" we both looked at the "No Motorized Vehicles" sign and she <br>
  glanced at me and said, "I wont tell if you don't."<br>
<br>
  We looked back and forth and it *was* a quite road we were on. So I <br>
  did what any weary, wet, tired guy would do . . . I put the car in <br>
  drive and down the path we went. I ran to the tree as Becki got our <br>
  stampin' gear out so that we could hurry up and log in before the <br>
  cops showed up. We logged in in record time and I through the car in <br>
  reverse... ahh, just what we needed a shot of adrenalin.<br>
<br>
  We then drove to "Know You're Place" by Shutterfly, as we neared the <br>
  park I commented to Becki, "Well, we must be getting close, the rain <br>
  is coming down harder." once there and wandering around a bit in the <br>
  wrong direction we figured out our error and found the box, with only <br>
  a little help from Trail Rider who had me on the phone figuring out <br>
  our meeting that night.<br>
<br>
  Becki & I had figured on going over to Boone County and finding the <br>
  couple boxes over there before the sun went down. But I relented and <br>
  made the alternate suggestion of going to the hotel, checking in and <br>
  drying off!! <br>
<br>
  Trail Rider and her husband NamVet showed up a little alter and we <br>
  chatted about an hour. I was honored to have gotten to know TR better <br>
  and meeting Russ for the first time. We had a great time chatting for <br>
  about an hour or so.<br>
<br>
  After they left we hopped in the van to go to dinner -- at something <br>
  past 8:00 pm.<br>
<br>
  After the day was over I looked through the logbook and counting the <br>
  couple of mystery boxes we managed 12 boxes and 2 exchanges in the <br>
  pouring rain no less!<br>
<br>
  Today we had some high hopes again, and started with "Fish Bowl: <br>
  Bowl" that is listed as "missing" with no finds since 2006. We found <br>
  the "hard to find" park and couldn't believe our luck, the sun was <br>
  out!<br>
<br>
  We followed the clues and there was the box!! Right out in the open!! <br>
  it was replaced by Camp Redwing Flyers on August 10, 2007 and no one <br>
  has logged it as found since late 2006! CRF made this stamp with some <br>
  foam cut and glued in the shape of a fish bowl... a little small but <br>
  manageable. A Very nice surprise - and a great way to start the day!<br>
<br>
  Off to Boone County for the 3rd and last installment of the "Fish <br>
  Bowl" series -- the fish! And we found that Camp Redwing Flyers had <br>
  replaced this box as well... only with a store bought stamp.<br>
<br>
  Then one of the boxes I really wanted to find [side note: last Sept. <br>
  we found a box that had Cookoo Clues inside that told us to take the <br>
  clues if we planned on finding this box . . . so I did!] finally, now <br>
  time to find the box! We found "Darting Dragons" just as the rain <br>
  started to fall again :-( Will it ever end?<br>
<br>
  We decided to head back and try "Ode to a Rose" and "A River Runs <br>
  through it" again. Having troubles with "Ode to a Rose" for the <br>
  second day in a row (and knowing it was just found a couple weeks <br>
  ago) I called Trail Rider for some help, she asked where we were and <br>
  said, "Don't move, we'll be there in 2 minutes."<br>
<br>
  before we knew it she and Pastors Wife showed up! Taking a walk over <br>
  their lunch break. We chatted as we went to the *other* side of the <br>
  park to the box . . . something's not right! I took out my compass <br>
  and with Trail Rider, Pastor's Wife and Becki as witnesses it was <br>
  pointing DUE EAST instead of due north!! What!?!? Its a wonder I've <br>
  found any boxes at all with a bum compass.<br>
<br>
  We walked down the trail to a "River Runs through it" I consider this <br>
  the "event stamp" of our weekend as Rockford, Illinois is carved in <br>
  it and it has water in the stamp.<br>
<br>
  Then for the thrill of the trip, we followed Trail Rider to her place <br>
  of employment where we had the wonderful opportunity to meet the <br>
  master carver himself . . . Krait!!<br>
<br>
  We chatted, showed off our stamp work and talked techniques. I've <br>
  found so many of his stamps and they are all such works of art, this <br>
  was a definite highlight -- helped in part that it took place <br>
  indoors -- Krait is a wonderful gentleman whose stamps are all worth <br>
  the hunt!!<br>
<br>
  Afterwards we had a bite to eat before heading out for our next <br>
  box . . . we followed the clues up until the point the path we were <br>
  walking on was submerged with water!! The wind picked up so fast we <br>
  thought a hurricane was coming, we could hardly walk back to the van. <br>
<br>
  This whole area seemed a flood plane and we decided to forgo our next <br>
  attempt at a series of 5 boxes. There is always next time right?<br>
<br>
  We did add another 5 finds today for a total of 17!<br>
<br>
  My wonderful wife was just that, wonderful!! Thank you Becki for <br>
  putting up with me . . . even in the rain and mud, wind and all!!<br>
<br>
  Of course, I had to promise for our next anniversary we were doing to <br>
  the Container Store and Old Navy!!<br>

I commented back that the river in the Quad Cities runs "east to west" so I  <br>
never even took into account which way the river was flowing --  and if I  had <br>
I would've automatically assumed it was east/west as well, throwing me off  <br>
even more.<br>
