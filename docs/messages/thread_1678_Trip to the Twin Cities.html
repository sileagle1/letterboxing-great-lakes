                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past weekend was my Mom's 90th in the Twin Cities, so we <br>
included ( of course) a bit of LBing.  Here's what we found (and <br>
didn't):<br>
 *Elk Mound - neat spot and the box is still in fine shape.<br>
 *Fish Out of Water 8 - Merlin grew exploring the Bass Ponds and it <br>
was great to be back, but MUCH changed.  The box is fine, but don't <br>
leave it there if there are heavy snows this winter: the spring flood <br>
WILL carry it off.<br>
 *Mountain Top Cache - good shape.<br>
 *Grand Excusion - Needed to avoid "Ribfest", but the box is fine.<br>
 *Minnesota History - A fun series.  Boxes 2 and 3 are interchanged.<br>
 *45th Parallel  -  STILL in good shape... even with a hole in the <br>
box.<br>
 *The Crystal of MIC  -  Neat place and in good shape.<br>
 *Suburban Wildlife  -  All in good shape.<br>
 *Little Brown Dog's Delight  -  The breeze off the lake was <br>
delightful.  Box #2 is perilously close to a vast and healthy stand <br>
of Poison Ivy.<br>
 *Little Brown Dog Goes to School  -  Thanks to a heads up from <br>
Wisconsin Hiker we were first finders and the first finders "prizes" <br>
are a great idea... we'll probably use it, too.<br>
 *Catty - Stumped!!  :-(    "7"???  "Garden Gateway"???  Maybe next <br>
trip.<br>
 *Mazomani Trail -  Another great spot, but the "Overlook Sign" seems <br>
to be missing, so we had a bit of a hike before we backtracked.<br>
 *Woman Bathing Among Reeds - We wonder who was watching us?<br>
 * Goldie Gopher -  Merlin enjoyed being back on campus again... and <br>
the river flats where, a goodly time ago, he used to park his car.<br>
 *Karl Oskar House - A very interesting spot.  Wish it had been the <br>
weekend so the house had been open.  Oh, and a surprise first find.<br>
 *Lumbering Along - We couldn't find it.  Pretty sure we had the <br>
right place, too.  :-(<br>
 *Chippewa Valley Choo-Choo  - Neat spot... wish the train had been <br>
running.<br>
 *JakerJaz Series - A day behind Dragon.  The big tree has been wind-<br>
thrown: the box is fine.<br>
 *Rocky Arbor - Amazing place! The box is fine.<br>
<br>
  A couple of things we noticed:  Many of the boxes were very near <br>
Poison Ivy, something we make an effort to avoid when looking for a <br>
hiding place.  Knowing what it looks like in all seasons helps, and <br>
is probably a worthwhile bit of knowledge for all LBers.  Another <br>
thing we noticed was that a fair number of the LBs were in very <br>
public and/or hiding places that didn't protect the  LBs from the <br>
elements or chance discovery very well.  But,  it was GREAT to see to <br>
see so many LBs in Minnesota... an up and coming LB area.  We're <br>
looking forward to our next trip.<br>
