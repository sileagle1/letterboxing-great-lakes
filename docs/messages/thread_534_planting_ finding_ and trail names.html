When I was planting boxes at my old Girl Scout camp this weekend,<br>

<br>
Hey!  Another Boxing Girl Scout!  What council are you...where's your camp?<br>
My GS friend Pippin and I are working on establishing a bunch of private<br>
boxes at Whispering Oaks (Brookfield, IL) camp, River Trails, near Sheridan,<br>
IL.  I've got about 10 boxes out there so far.  I'm working on clue books to<br>
place at the various campsites.  Just this night I carved a three part<br>
homage to "Three Chartreuse Buzzards" which came out pretty cute (for<br>
buzzards!...hey, now there's a trail name!)<br>
<br>
Speaking of those boxes...kind of a cute story.  Last month Pippin velcroed<br>
a centrifuge box inside a large railroad bell at camp (used to be used as an<br>
emergency "alarm" to call the caretaker in my pre-cellphone days as a girl).<br>
Lo and behold, not an hour later a group of little Brownies decides to play<br>
some ring-around-the-rosy style game around same bell (which stands about 5<br>
feet off the ground on a concrete pillar-thingie).  Papillon and I are<br>
sitting not an arm's length away, when we notice the circle stopped moving,<br>
and one by one the little girls (I guess we weren't calculating their range<br>
of vision when I helped her place it) start pointing up into the bell.<br>
Drat!  "Mommy, Mommy!" one girl called "what's that?"  The tired, worn out<br>
mom (it was a mother-daughter weekend, and said mother had just about had<br>
enough hiking to last the rest of her life) just blew the kid off..."oh,<br>
that's just there to keep people from ringing the bell."  Phew!!!<br>
<br>
Sorry guys...got off on a tangent there...<br>
<br>
Okay, Delirium...how DARE you say fungi are not cute and fluffy!?!<br>
Obviously you have a very clean refrigerator, or you'd be more familiar with<br>
the beauty of the members of the Kingdom Fungi!!!    (-:<br>

As a military brat, I belonged to several councils<br>
over the years including Commonweath Virginia, SE<br>
Louisiana, and most recently Tribal Trails (central<br>
IN) council as an adult. I have not kept my membership<br>
up because of my own personal war with Tribal Trails,<br>
WHO SOLD OUR CAMP. Thankfully, our camp, Kokiwanee,<br>
was bought by a land trust, who has made into a<br>
wonderful nature preserve. The council didn't give a<br>
rip about what current and former scouts wanted, as<br>
the overwhelming majority wanted the camp to stay<br>
open. Politics. Ug. I've been considering becoming a<br>
leader in the Singing Sands council, where I live<br>
now...when and if my job becomes less demanding.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I dedicated a series to Kokiwanee and named<br>
each stamp after a former unit. I also made a<br>
hitchhiker called "the Princess Pat" after my all-time<br>
favorite camp song. What's everyone's favorite camp<br>
song?<br>

"I'm bringing home my baby bumblebee.  Won't my mommy be so proud of me?  I'm bringing home my baby bumblebee...ouch!  It stung me!"<br>
 <br>
And it only gets better from there, esp. when you start licking up your smashed baby bumblebee :)<br>
 <br>
One of my friends who I was in Girl Scouts with preferred the "Oh I Wish I Were" song.  "Oh I wish I were a little bar of soap.  Oh I wish I were a little bar of soap.  I'd go slidey slidey slidey over everybody's hidey.  Oh I wish I were a little bar of soap."  That's just one of the versus.  Can of pop, juicey orange...those were some of the others.  <br>
 <br>
Hmmm...you really have to wonder about the songs they'd have us sing as Girl Scouts....<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
