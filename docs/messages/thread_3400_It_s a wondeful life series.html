  I just wanted to thank everyone involved in making this gathering so <br>
  much fun. The stamps made for the gathering were amazing! The temp <br>
  might have been frigid but everyone was so warm and friendly that we <br>
  hardly noticed the cold. Well, okay, that's a lie. I definitely noticed <br>
  the cold especially when we were supposed to leave at around 3:30 and <br>
  then Hawkeye, my husband, decided we HAD to look for the "It's a <br>
  WOnderful Life" series. We found a few of them and some bonus boxes but <br>
  at 4:15 with fingers frozen, I threw in the towel. Anyways, thanks, <br>
  Dragon, for organizing it. Happy Holidays to everyone!<br>
