Some things that I would like to see in this policy are:<br>
*  Recognition of letterboxing.<br>
*  License the _person_ not the _container_.<br>
*  License should allow five boxes, rather than three.<br>
*  License should apply to all Parks & Rec land, rather than a single<br>
park.  Each park manager would get a copy of the license.<br>
*  A box should be able to stay in place for one year, conditional on<br>
the formation of use trails.<br>
*  Eliminate the text about virtual caches. They are not geocaches and<br>
the policy does not apply to them.<br>
