exchange.  I'll let you know costs by email went they are shipped.  <br>
Sorry for the delay.<br>

I'll be going down to Moraine Hills SP to pick up the gathering <br>
boxes tomorrow (Friday).  If anyone wants to meet me in northern IL <br>
tomorrow, I can do that too.<br>
<br>
If I'm sending a box back to you I can send the T-shirt with as well.<br>
