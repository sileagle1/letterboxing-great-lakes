I apologize for posting to the whole list, but someone emailed me about <br/>
a possible missing box, and I can't find the email.  I think maybe it <br/>
was 100 Acre Woods group that emailed?  Anyway, they were asking about <br/>
the third box in my Wandering in the Wetlands series at West Bloomfield <br/>
Nature Preserve.  I finally got to check, and everything is safe and <br/>
sound as it should be.  If whoever was trying to find it will contact <br/>
me offlist, I might be able to provide some guidance. <br/>
