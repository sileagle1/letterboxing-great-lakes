                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been stuck inside for the last three days...(heaven forbid!)  Tonto had to work in the city today.  Our son (a non-letterboxer) had the day off and it was a beautiful day....hmmm wonder if I could talk him into taking Kemosabe (our letterboxing golden retriever) out for a run and nab a quick LB with me.  He was so bored that he agreed.<br>
<br>
The box was off a bike trail in a Cook County Forest Preserve that is close to my work.  Couldn't be that hard.  I figured the bike trail would keep Kemosabe somewhat dry...The clues soon led us off trail along a creek.  We had no problem finding the box - quick and simple...and a first finders prize to boot.  Only my second box without Tonto...I missed him.<br>
<br>
We decided to keep following the creek as the dog was already a muddy mess, and take a gander to see if any morels had popped up.  Heck, it was an absolutely gorgeous day..why not? (In hind sight...maybe getting back on the bike path would've been a better option????)<br>
<br>
We hiked a good mile following the creek following a rough old dirt trail- no morels - but I did score a good top of a skull and partial jaw bone...we decided to cut back through a prairie that the creek encircled that eventually would lead back to the car.  We were in the middle of the prairie when all of a sudden a blood-curdling shriek came about 30 yards to our left.  We stopped dead in our tracks to see a coyote starring at us.  We decided to just keep going, although at a little quicker pace.  Thankfully, we were obeying the "dog on leash" rule ...not allowing Kemosabe to run over to see if he wanted to play!  It was obvious this coyote was NOT happy that a muddy dog and his people were cutting through his prairie.<br>
Within minutes, we heard a sound I NEVER want to hear at that close range again!  Our coyote was not alone!  We hardly had time to go ten steps when we could see about eight coyote all howling, screeching, pacing, agitated and advancing closer toward us.  "Mom," lets get the "____" out of here! My son shouted, as he went into a full sprint in the direction of the car. <br>
"RUN, Mom, RUN!!!" he yelled over his shoulder.  The fear in his voice instantly sprung open the adrenaline valve in my own body.<br>
My little feet have never moved through soaking wet prairie ruts so fast...all the while with a crazy dog pulling my arm sockets out and my letterboxing bag flying all about!  It was a good two blocks to our car.  As soon as we were in sight of the car the howling stopped and the coyotes backed off from their frenzy, but my heart is still pounding!  ...But, the adventure did cure the boredom our son was experiencing...<br>
<br>
In all my years of hiking, I've heard coyote and certainly have seen several off in the distance, but never this close, or this many in the middle of the day making this kind of racket.  All I can figure is that they must have a den of new pups...it is that time of year.  So be aware of the critters out there parenting their young'ins this spring - especially those of you that letterbox with dogs!<br>
Tonto came home and asked how our day went...and why the dog was panting so hard.  I told him that I don't believe our son will go out boxing with us for a while...it was the scariest letterboxing moment I've had...and Tonto missed it!<br>
Tiptoe...who is still panting...but grateful not to have ended up in a dog fight!<br>

You just lived through one of my biggest fears!!! I am fearful of dogs and the thought of running into coyotes scares me to death! My sister lives in the country and if I visit her at night, I make her escort me from my car & into the house. Scary! I'm glad it all turned out ok for you, your son & pup.<br>

Funny you should mention the photo op...Tonto didn't perceive our encounter quite the way we did...he actually asked us why we didn't stop to take pictures!  I don't think he got the "picture" that we were running like crazy to get the dog out of the area...I was more concerned for him than for us. But, I wasn't going to stick around to find out...I don't want to  EVER be that close to a pack of coyote screaming like that...now, I'll be up all night not only trying to figure out the "Secret of Illinois" clues...but try to get that sound out of my head!<br>

Subject: [LbGLK] Howlin' BAD time...<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
  <br>
<br>
I have been stuck inside for the last three days...(heaven forbid!) Tonto<br>
had to work in the city today. Our son (a non-letterboxer) had the day off<br>
and it was a beautiful day....hmmm wonder if I could talk him into taking<br>
Kemosabe (our letterboxing golden retriever) out for a run and nab a quick<br>
LB with me. He was so bored that he agreed.<br>
<br>
The box was off a bike trail in a Cook County Forest Preserve that is close<br>
to my work. Couldn't be that hard. I figured the bike trail would keep<br>
Kemosabe somewhat dry...The clues soon led us off trail along a creek. We<br>
had no problem finding the box - quick and simple...and a first finders<br>
prize to boot. Only my second box without Tonto...I missed him.<br>
<br>
We decided to keep following the creek as the dog was already a muddy mess,<br>
and take a gander to see if any morels had popped up. Heck, it was an<br>
absolutely gorgeous day..why not? (In hind sight...maybe getting back on the<br>
bike path would've been a better option????)<br>
<br>
We hiked a good mile following the creek following a rough old dirt trail-<br>
no morels - but I did score a good top of a skull and partial jaw bone...we<br>
decided to cut back through a prairie that the creek encircled that<br>
eventually would lead back to the car. We were in the middle of the prairie<br>
when all of a sudden a blood-curdling shriek came about 30 yards to our<br>
left. We stopped dead in our tracks to see a coyote starring at us. We<br>
decided to just keep going, although at a little quicker pace. Thankfully,<br>
we were obeying the "dog on leash" rule ...not allowing Kemosabe to run over<br>
to see if he wanted to play! It was obvious this coyote was NOT happy that a<br>
muddy dog and his people were cutting through his prairie.<br>
Within minutes, we heard a sound I NEVER want to hear at that close range<br>
again! Our coyote was not alone! We hardly had time to go ten steps when we<br>
could see about eight coyote all howling, screeching, pacing, agitated and<br>
advancing closer toward us. "Mom," lets get the "____" out of here! My son<br>
shouted, as he went into a full sprint in the direction of the car. <br>
"RUN, Mom, RUN!!!" he yelled over his shoulder. The fear in his voice<br>
instantly sprung open the adrenaline valve in my own body.<br>
My little feet have never moved through soaking wet prairie ruts so<br>
fast...all the while with a crazy dog pulling my arm sockets out and my<br>
letterboxing bag flying all about! It was a good two blocks to our car. As<br>
soon as we were in sight of the car the howling stopped and the coyotes<br>
backed off from their frenzy, but my heart is still pounding! ...But, the<br>
adventure did cure the boredom our son was experiencing...<br>
<br>
In all my years of hiking, I've heard coyote and certainly have seen several<br>
off in the distance, but never this close, or this many in the middle of the<br>
day making this kind of racket. All I can figure is that they must have a<br>
den of new pups...it is that time of year. So be aware of the critters out<br>
there parenting their young'ins this spring - especially those of you that<br>
letterbox with dogs!<br>
Tonto came home and asked how our day went...and why the dog was panting so<br>
hard. I told him that I don't believe our son will go out boxing with us for<br>
a while...it was the scariest letterboxing moment I've had...and Tonto<br>
missed it!<br>
Tiptoe...who is still panting...but grateful not to have ended up in a dog<br>
fight!<br>

All I can say is that I'm still shook up regarding my encounter on Monday...I have to admit that I actually thought that carrying a concealed weapon would have made me feel a bit more in control.  As it was, all I was armed with was a sheet of letterboxing clues!  Like the Texas Gov, I knew that these animals weren't so much after me as they were my Golden Retriever!  That was an image so horrible to even think of watching!  But, before I start "packin' some heat" I'd better think this through!  As anyone who has ever boxed with Tiptoe & Tonto know, we can get in our fair share of "heated discussions"...Tonto would never survive!<br>
Speaking of Tonto, Tiptoe made a great point of ridiculing him for his late date entry for the end of Bingo...thank heavens for Pastors Wife being a few days earlier or he might have won that too and she would've had to eat her words of scorn!<br>
Tiptoe .....& Tonto<br>

Tiptoe - <br>
<br>
Before you go arming yourself with a weapon that would end up pointed at Tonto, you might try my solution:  I have a small LOUD hiking safety whistle and a can of pepper spray in my pack.  If the whistle doesn't scare them off, the pepper spray would!  I carry them mostly for human predators, or summoning help if I need to, but they're also supposed to ward off most other predators.  Except maybe Tonto.<br>

Sorry for the late response ... we just walked in the door from the hospital where Mark (Steering Lives) has been residing the last few days with heart problems!<br>

  Wow! All I can say is that I'm still shook up regarding my encounter on Monday...I have to admit that I actually thought that carrying a concealed weapon would have made me feel a bit more in control. As it was, all I was armed with was a sheet of letterboxing clues! Like the Texas Gov, I knew that these animals weren't so much after me as they were my Golden Retriever!

  Speaking of Tonto, Tiptoe made a great point of ridiculing him for his late date entry for the end of Bingo...thank heavens for Pastors Wife being a few days earlier or he might have won that too and she would've had to eat her words of scorn!<br>
