I guess I haven't looked at your (Dragon) antiquity page recently or<br/>
haven't looked at it close enough.  I always wondered what happened to<br/>
the Castle Rock box since we didn't have a chance to find it.  We were<br/>
"up north" over Memorial Day Weekend and found both Elk Mound and Bell<br/>
Mound.  It was fun to read the entries in the Bell Mound logbook since<br/>
they went all the way back to 2002.  2002 doesn't seem all that long<br/>
ago, but I think that was one of the oldest boxes we had found to date.<br/>
Dragon's entry mentioned the MPs at Castle Rock and I thought he was<br/>
kidding!  I think that experience might have scared us away from the<br/>
letterboxing game altogether!  Wow!<br/>

Last fall, a box popped up for Warner Park in the Madison area.  It<br/>
was called something along the lines of "Home of the Mallards".<br/>
We (M Clan) tried to find it shortly after it popped up and found the<br/>
spot, searched trees everywhere, almost bumped into a homeless man<br/>
sleeping in the woods, but never found the box. A copule days later<br/>
the placer's said the box was missing. Dragon, are there any plans to<br/>
resurrect the box as part of the WI Letterboxes of Antiquity. I'm not<br/>
sure anyone ever found the box and I'm not sure who the placers were,<br/>
but we'd be willing to help relocate the box within Warner Park if<br/>
the clues are out there still.<br/>
