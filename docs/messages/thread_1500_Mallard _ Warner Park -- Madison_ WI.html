I guess I haven't looked at your (Dragon) antiquity page recently or<br>
haven't looked at it close enough.  I always wondered what happened to<br>
the Castle Rock box since we didn't have a chance to find it.  We were<br>
"up north" over Memorial Day Weekend and found both Elk Mound and Bell<br>
Mound.  It was fun to read the entries in the Bell Mound logbook since<br>
they went all the way back to 2002.  2002 doesn't seem all that long<br>
ago, but I think that was one of the oldest boxes we had found to date.<br>
Dragon's entry mentioned the MPs at Castle Rock and I thought he was<br>
kidding!  I think that experience might have scared us away from the<br>
letterboxing game altogether!  Wow!<br>
