Hmm, snow on Easter?  Reminds me of last year on Easter weekend (which <br/>
was a week or two into April) when Atom and I went to find the last <br/>
couple of grail boxes we needed in OH.  We did a weird driving loop and <br/>
were driving north after finding "Camelot: it's only a Model" near <br/>
Dayton.  Things were fine (mostly clear skies, lower 30s probably) until <br/>
all of a sudden we reached Cleveland and it was a blizzard!!  Of course <br/>
we still went to the park and found the "The Old Man" under all of the <br/>
day's fresh snow just as it got dark.  It was the very last box we <br/>
needed to finish the quest too.  Ahhh, good memories! :)  I posted an <br/>
album with some pictures from that fateful day in the photos section -- <br/>
enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
Here it's been snowing all day too -- big, wet flakes.  Luckily it's not <br/>
accumulating too much though.  But I think it was a good idea for us to <br/>
postpone our weekend in Milwaukee until next weekend...<br/>
