It has even got my husband laughing, no small feat. I have to say I <br/>
never thought of pretending to eat my stamp! But really if you think <br/>
about the sport it is really kind of silly (from an outsider looking <br/>
in). A bunch of adults roaming around the forest with a baggie full <br/>
of ink pads, mumbling to themselves "it should be right here, why <br/>
isn't it here?" looking for tupperware. I can't believe THAT doesn't <br/>
scare people away. I love the whole secretive aspect of the sport, <br/>
the chalange NOT to get cought. This sport lets me go anywhere with <br/>
my imagination, something we rarely get to do as adults, and <br/>
chalanges me to come up with new inventive ways to add to the fun of <br/>
the game. I think it helps me connect with nature, my childhood, and <br/>
the artistic side of myself. I don't think I'll ever stop:)<br/>

&gt; Yeh, what she said...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree that there is no reason to outright lie, particularly if <br/>
you are <br/>
&gt; with kids as it does set a bad example, as you say.  But I think <br/>
that most <br/>
&gt; people really don't want to hear the whole spiel anyway.  It's like <br/>
when <br/>
&gt; somebody says, "how have you been" and they really don't want to <br/>
hear the <br/>
&gt; details of what's been happening in your life for the last year.  <br/>
Add to <br/>
&gt; that it is a little *different* and most people aren't going to <br/>
*get it* and <br/>
&gt; it just seems easier to skirt the issue rather than go through the <br/>
&gt; explanation.  It is possible to not lie without telling the whole <br/>
truth. <br/>
&gt; The scavenger hunt explanation does seem to work better as most <br/>
people can <br/>
&gt; relate to that (although it doesn't explain the rubber stamping <br/>
part if <br/>
&gt; you've already begun the stamping process). If somebody stopped and <br/>
asked <br/>
&gt; and genuinely seemed interested in what I was doing, I might tell <br/>
them, <br/>
&gt; guess I'd play it by ear -- but that has never happened to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  While providing an explanation *may* be an opportunity to <br/>
introduce <br/>
&gt; somebody to letterboxing, that is not generally the case and to be <br/>
honest, I <br/>
&gt; am not out looking for converts.  If somebody finds the game <br/>
through an <br/>
&gt; online site, or another participant or even a publicity piece and <br/>
they are <br/>
&gt; intrigued enough to research a little and then follow through with <br/>
it, <br/>
&gt; that's great and welcome to the game, but I don't go out of my way <br/>
to add <br/>
&gt; sheep to the flock.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would have to agree that the *secretive* aspect of the game adds <br/>
to it for <br/>
&gt; me.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I think we strech the truth a bit because it is just easier than<br/>
&gt; &gt; going through the whole "LB" spiel. I don't know what your<br/>
&gt; &gt; experiences have been like tring to tell someone about LBing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; most people look at me like I'm nuts! I love it when you say "you<br/>
&gt; &gt; find the box and stamp their stamp in your log book and vise <br/>
versa."<br/>
&gt; &gt; and they say "and then what, do you get some prize or something"<br/>
&gt; &gt; then you say "no that's it" and they say "ahh, ok... hmmmm... good<br/>
&gt; &gt; luck with that". I guess I'm just a secretive kinda gal, it adds <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the romance of the game for me. Like being part of a secret club.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;  I've never been "caught in the act" by anyone, but if<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; someone asked me I wouldn't lie to them. I'd tell them<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; exactly what I was doing and even show them some of my<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; stamps. Lying is just plain wrong. I wouldn't however<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; let them watch me re-hide the box, of find it, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; once everything is out in the open and I'm ready to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; stamp in it seems childish to try pretend you're doing<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; something else. What is everyone afraid of ? No one is<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; going to call the cops on you for writing in a logbook<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and stamping. If the person you've shared the<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; aforementioned info with decides to take the box or<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; works for the park service or something, OH WELL.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; That's part of the risk of hiding a box, isn't it ? It<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; might last 2 weeks, it might last 10 years, who knows.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to pass judgement on any of you so<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; please don't take this post the wrong way, but<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; seriously, we're all adults here. DON'T LIE, ABOUT<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; ANYTHING! What if your children are with ? Would you<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; lie then ? What would that teach them ?<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; We got caught yesterday on our first trek.  Some<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thought I was having car trouble.  I just told them<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; we were on a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scavenger hunt and would be out of there in a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of minutes.  A<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; friend went today and the box was still there, so it<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; worked!<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Why "lie" about it anyway?  You might get someone<br/>
