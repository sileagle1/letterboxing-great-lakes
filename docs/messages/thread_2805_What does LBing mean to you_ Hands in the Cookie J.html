It has even got my husband laughing, no small feat. I have to say I <br>
never thought of pretending to eat my stamp! But really if you think <br>
about the sport it is really kind of silly (from an outsider looking <br>
in). A bunch of adults roaming around the forest with a baggie full <br>
of ink pads, mumbling to themselves "it should be right here, why <br>
isn't it here?" looking for tupperware. I can't believe THAT doesn't <br>
scare people away. I love the whole secretive aspect of the sport, <br>
the chalange NOT to get cought. This sport lets me go anywhere with <br>
my imagination, something we rarely get to do as adults, and <br>
chalanges me to come up with new inventive ways to add to the fun of <br>
the game. I think it helps me connect with nature, my childhood, and <br>
the artistic side of myself. I don't think I'll ever stop:)<br>
