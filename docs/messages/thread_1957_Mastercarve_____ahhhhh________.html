I'd call myself a very casual letterboxer...I don't count my finds, <br/>
haven't  ever gotten all my found stamp images together in one place, <br/>
and I've only placed a handful of boxes myself. I started out carving  <br/>
dollar store erasers with an exacto knife, and eventually moved up to <br/>
PZcut and actual carving tools. Well...I was at the local Joann's last <br/>
week, and, on impulse, purchased a block of Mastercarve.<br/>
Finally got around to carving it yesterday, and all I can say is, WOW! <br/>
It does 'carve like butter'. I'm sure there are some drawbacks,but it <br/>
sure was nice to try the good stuff!!<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd share<br/>
