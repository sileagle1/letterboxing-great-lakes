                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a similar experience.  An open lands association  found a box without the email address of the placer and contacted LbNA.  LbNA contacted LbGLK, and I was notified since the box was in the area where I live and place many of my boxes.  Likewise, their maintenance crew found the box.  It was not my box, but when I was asked to pick up the box from their offices, I was able to determine the identity of the placer from their trail name and stamp on the first page of the logbook.  It's important to label our boxes so we can be contacted.  It reassuring to know that people respect our hobby and go out of their way to return a box to us.   <br>
<br>
People who accidentally find our boxes on their public access lands are generally nice if the boxes aren't being placed in sensitive planting areas.  <br>
<br>
This weekend, I was informed that someone has placed a letterbox in the area of Skokie, Illinois in a sensitive planting area and the caretakers are truly upset.  They have the box at their office and would like to return it, but they aren't sure how to do that.  Again, it's important for us to label our boxes so the boxes don't disappear and we blame others. <br>
<br>
I still believe in the honesty of most people, but when several letterboxes disappear within a few months, it's truly heart breaking.  But sometimes there are other reasons why that happens.  I'm willing to accept the fact that two boxes I placed over the summer may have disappeared because they had been placed in an area that was later determined to be in an open area with possibly too much pedestrian traffic and watching eyes.  I've learned to make the clues a bit more difficult (to deter kids and non-letterboxing group leaders just looking for something free and fun to do) and to be more cautious about placing urban boxes.  <br>

  Subject: [LbGLK] Our recent box loss<br>
<br>
<br>
  We too have recently lost multiple boxes, one even due to what <br>
  appears to be malicious human intervention, and it was really tough <br>
  for us to swallow. However, we recently had a really nice experience that has turned us back around and I thought would be nice to share... <br>
<br>
  Then a few weeks back, I received an email from one of the staff <br>
  members at the nature center. She said that the maintenance crew <br>
  has been doing some grounds cleanup and the spot where our box had <br>
  been hiding was removed and no longer exists. The maintenance crew <br>
  brought the box to the office staff, who then got my email address <br>
  from the logbook. She said that she was holding the box for me <br>
  until I could pick it up and gave me her phone number. <br>
<br>
  Overall it was a really <br>
  nice experience and wonderful to have new people so excited about <br>
  boxing and to have been lucky enough to have had our box discovered <br>
  by such kind people that went out of their way to keep our box <br>
  intact. <br>
