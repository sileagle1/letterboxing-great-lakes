The idea to bring cans of chili to add to the homemade is a great idea too - just be sure they are flip-top cans or other contains that don't require can openers, unless you want to bring one of those too!<br/>

Don't forget to bring a sit-upon!  Those picnic benches are gonna get mighty chilly themselves!<br/>

suggestion!<br/>
<br/>
For those of you not familiar to the area of the gathering, there are two<br/>
shopping centers very near the park.  Each has a grocery store, so if anyone<br/>
runs out of water or wants some particular item, you'll only be 1-2 miles<br/>
from a store.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A 36 cup electric perk for water would be ideal!  I'm canceling the stove idea, but I will still bring some hot cups, tea, sugar, and spoons.  I'm still wondering about the water availability at the shelter, so I will keep reading emails and maybe someone has volunteered to bring water or knows if water will be available.  <br/>

See you early on Saturday.  The fun begins when "Team Dutch Elm" arrives.    <br/>
