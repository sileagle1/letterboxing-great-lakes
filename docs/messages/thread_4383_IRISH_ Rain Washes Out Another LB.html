LOL  Part of the instruction is to show how to start a fire without a fire starter...using just tinder, kindling, fuel logs and a match.  And, the challenge is to start the fire and keep it going for at least 5 minutes using only 1 match!!! Then, you receive the One Match Award.  <br/>

GGG?  Is that at GS of C term?  I've been registered with GSICC, but now that I'm a life member, I don't have to re-up, so to speak.  However, come Oct. 1, we'll be council sisters....I think.  <br/>

  Now dear, you KNOW how to do this. It's called 'firestarters.' Didn't <br/>
  you learn all about those in GGG? :)<br/>
<br/>
  Just double (or quad) the amount you'd normally toss in and build out <br/>
  with a box fire. The wood will dry in no time, as long as it isn't <br/>
  actually storming.<br/>
<br/>
  It's almost time to go LEAPing about!<br/>

long enough to boil a quart of water, fastest time wins!  We had <br/>
another one that involved one match and a bucket of water on a board <br/>
tied to a string but it would involve diagrams to explain...<br/>
