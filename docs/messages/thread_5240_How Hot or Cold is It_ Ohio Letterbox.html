It was all there when I checked it from my box listing (on <br/>
letterboxing.org), and I tried to update the clue several times, but <br/>
for some reason it won't show when you access the clue the regular way.<br/>
I have now fixed it by linking the clue to atlasquest instead.<br/>

<br/>
Your browser probably cached the "old" page with the clues unchanged<br/>
and only shows that page when you go back.  If you don't see the<br/>
changes you expected, refresh the page by clicking your browsers<br/>
refresh button, then you'll probably see the changes.<br/>
<br/>
I've recently had a report that my Bristol 2007 clues were still the<br/>
only ones available from my website.  Once the person refreshed the<br/>
page however, they got the new clues.  They had been looking at a page<br/>
from 6 months or so ago because that was the last time they visited. <br/>
Browsers do strange things sometimes.<br/>
