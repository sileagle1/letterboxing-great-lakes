                    <div class="plaintext-content">Headed out bright and early this morning to snag the four boxes in Will<br>
County.  But it just wasn't meant to be.<br>
<br>
1.  A Puppus Among Us -- planted by Wormy Wanderers near Romeoville.  This<br>
was the first one, got there early in the morning, beautiful morning there.<br>
The woods are rather dense and close-in but the trees aren't totally in full<br>
leaf yet so the early morning light was quite pretty streaming in. Saw a ton<br>
of birds, several of the little mammals (squirrels, chipmunks, etc.) and<br>
some of the slightly larger mammals (couldn't tell if we saw three different<br>
coyotes or saw one coyote three times).  Saw absolutely no other humans.<br>
<br>
Found the box in good shape.  Quite a nifty hiding spot.<br>
<br>
2.  Route 66 Series -- Gemini Giant -- planted by Leapin' Lizards near<br>
Wilmington.  Absolutely could not find this box.  Found the Giant easily,<br>
very interesting giant, seems like a remnant from the '50s maybe? Found the<br>
preserve easily, weren't sure which trail to take because the clues say to<br>
"head downhill to the trail" and both trails kind of seemed to head<br>
downhill.  So we took the trail that went downhill the *most*. :-) Found the<br>
"short loop", found the "red hand", and found what could easily have been<br>
the "log on your left" -- actually found a couple of possibilities -- but no<br>
box.  Spent two hours trying out different possibilities and reading the<br>
clues different ways -- but no box.<br>
<br>
3.  Then we headed on down Route 6 to look for Illinois River -- planted by<br>
Matt the Rat near Channahon.  We found the box, but not exactly in the way<br>
we had expected.<br>
<br>
There was a large group of Boy Scouts camping out near the horseshoe pits so<br>
we worked our way around them to the trail and headed on down it.  By this<br>
time, the two humans and the two dawgz making this hike were kind of pooped<br>
out from looking for the Gemini Giant box, and were pretty much just<br>
strolling along.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the dawgz got excited and bounced on up to some litter sitting in<br>
the middle of the trail.  It was a grungy torn baggie and it looked like<br>
someone might have accidentally dropped their lunch.  "Woof! Woof!<br>
Snacktime!" I told the dogs "leave it!" and pushed it to the side of the<br>
trail with my foot.  I made a mental note to stop on the way back out and<br>
pick it up to toss it in a trash container.<br>
<br>
The clues were great, followed them with no problem, very nice glacial type<br>
(up & down & up & down) hike until the very end.  No box.  Not again! we<br>
thought.  Not finding 2 out of 3?  Not good.  Poopersville!  We've looked<br>
for 54 boxes so far and have found all but Johnson's Mound.  We searched all<br>
over.  We split up and quietly checked out what seemed like every single<br>
"bare half-fallen tree" in that entire woods.  No luck.  So after another<br>
hour or hour and a half, we decided to call it quits.<br>
<br>
On the hike back, the dawgz again got excited about the sandwich bag that I<br>
had pushed to the side of the trail.  I stopped to pick it up to carry it<br>
with us out to the trash.  Lo and behold, it was Matt the Rat's letterbox!<br>
Aarrrgggghhhhh!!!!!!<br>
<br>
The poor thing was not in good shape.  Surprisingly, I'm figuring that<br>
something probably happened to it fairly recently because the logbook was<br>
slightly damp but otherwise in good condition.  All the baggies were in bad<br>
shape, so we double-bagged the logbook with new bags, single-bagged the<br>
stamp and pen with new bags.  The rubbermaid sandwich tub had a chunk broken<br>
out of it, however, so there was no way it was going to be waterproof.  I<br>
don't carry extra rubbermaid containers (guess I'd better start), so I dried<br>
out the rubbermaid container, and then took a gallon size ziplock bag and<br>
put the rubbermaid container inside of it.<br>
<br>
Then we hid the box in the place where we *think*, according to the clues,<br>
it was supposed to be.<br>
<br>
So if anyone is going out to search for it in the near future, maybe<br>
consider bringing along an extra container to replace the broken sandwich<br>
tub?<br>
<br>
Lesson to be Learned from Today:  The Dawgz Always Know Best.  Listen To Our<br>
Dawgz.<br>
<br>
There was a fourth box we wanted to get to in the Lockport area along the I<br>
& M Canal.  It'll have to wait until tomorrow morning.  We were just too<br>
pooped.  And the dawgz were just too disappointed there didn't end up being<br>
a sandwich in the works for them. So we stopped at McD's and got them each a<br>
burger. We told them that they're now officially search & rescue dawgz. As<br>
to *what* they rescue -- we'll just keep that to ourselves.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<br>
Mosey, thank you for the update on the Gemini<br>
Giant...hopefully the box is still there, although we<br>
have received a couple of reports now that it cannot<br>
be found.  :(  If there is anyone in that area who had<br>
found the Gemini Giant, could you check to comfirm<br>
it's missing?  Email us off list if this is possible. <br>
We are a bit further away here in Wisconsin, so a<br>
drive down is not possible at the moment.  We are also<br>
concerned about carving another stamp just to find out<br>
that it is actually there...(somewhere)....So it'd be<br>
great if someone closer to the Wilmington area could<br>
confirm it for us and then we can get another box made<br>
up and planted in the future.  Thanks!<br>
<br>
Leapin' Lizards<br>

We should have some more placed in Will County in the near future in <br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
