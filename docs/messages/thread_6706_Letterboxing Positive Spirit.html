We've been letterboxing with our two boys for two years now, but I just recently discovered this letterboxing yahoo group.  I've enjoyed reading all the posts.  The supportive, positive nature of many of the posts are extrodinary.  (I've also enjoyed those YouTube posts!)  So to you all, thanks for lifting my spirits this Tuesday evening.<br>
<br>
And we're excited for our visit to the Renaissance Faire on Saturday, August 28th.  Anyone else going to be there that day and want to exchange stamps?<br>

<br>
Happily, we were up in Door County for a long weekend.  Letterboxing was at a minimum as we had people and places to see that didn't have a letterboxing component!  A good analogy would be in the playing of the game "Password" where you were under a timed limit and had to pass on words (or in our cases letterboxes) that gave us any hick-up.  As a result, due to awaiting ferries, rain, scheduled dinners, sore hips or sleeping friends in cars, we had to give up sooner than we'd like on some boxes which proved to be a little frustrating.  However, over all, the time in Door County was wonderful!  We can thank Dragon, Leapin Lizards, Verona Bird Patrol, Merlin & Ardea, and Beetle to name a few for the 26 boxes that we did manage to find and enjoy.    <br>
<br>
We hid a box in Door County 3 years ago, but forgot the clues...(must be a Wisconsin thing!)  Fortunately, we found "her" and incorporated her into a new series that we placed for all of you Wisconsinites to find.  It is newly listed on LBNA as "Tortoise and the Silly Hare".  We didn't have time to retrace our clues..so we're hoping someone will be able to give them a test run soon and let us know how we did at writing clues from our scrawled notes!<br>

Some of them were a little tricky to find, but well worth the look. The stamps are fabulous and we think we got another family, with an 8 yr old girl, interested in the hobby because the little girl not only helped us find the stamp since they were sitting exactly right where we needed (we tried to be sneaky, but they saw us looking around and at the paper in my hand), but was also really interested in the stamps themselves.  We also saw that a couple other boxers were there, judging by the dated stamps in the logbooks!<br>
