                    <div class="plaintext-content">People please stop and remember why you letterbox.  This activity is <br/>
supposed to be FUN!  My mom kept the copy of the Argus to show me <br/>
since she knows that I'm crazy about letterboxing.  Little did she <br/>
know that the stamp pictured in the article and the directions to <br/>
the Trout Lake LB were mine!  It was the first stamp I attempted to <br/>
carve after getting hooked.  Yes, I'd be disappointed if that stamp <br/>
went "missing"  yes, I would hope that any newbies would read up on <br/>
LBing before going out to hunt.  Yes, it is important not to <br/>
announce our presence in the woods when letterboxing, but PLEASE <br/>
don't let these articles raise your blood pressure.  I found out <br/>
about letterboxing from an article in TIME magazine.  It talked <br/>
about a park in Connecticut that I had just visited a week previous, <br/>
I was bummed because I live in Michigan and may never get back to <br/>
that park.  But my point is, without that article I may never have <br/>
found out about letterboxing at all.  I personally think that if a <br/>
stamp I carved and a hike that I love brings enjoyment to any <br/>
weekend thrill seekers then I'm cool with that.  I think the photo <br/>
of the kids with the stamp is worth the effort it took to carve.   <br/>
Don't make the Mankoff family out to be villians, I think they are <br/>
just having fun with their kids and I'm thrilled that it was my <br/>
stamp and box that they enjoyed finding!  I wish that the clues <br/>
hadn't been printed like they were, but hopefully that won't be a <br/>
problem.  The article mentions 9 letterboxes in Livingston County.  <br/>
I've planted 7 of them and hope they will be safe, but I accept that <br/>
as part of the hobby.  TO ANYONE THINKING OF PULLING MY BOXES FOR <br/>
SAFE KEEPING - STOP!  I accept the risk involved and will recarve <br/>
them if need be, but I took the time to plant them for ALL to enjoy, <br/>
not just seasoned letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely <br/>

  By the way, you Huckaby's have beaten me as first finder to every box that Penny Penny has planted!  You folks are good!      <br/>
