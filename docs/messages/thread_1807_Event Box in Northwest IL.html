<br/>
I lurk on this list, but I wanted to post a quick note to let you<br/>
know that an event box has been placed in Kane County Illinios. It's<br/>
called Celtic Knot and has been placed in conjunction with St. <br/>
Catherine's Irish Fest. The box is only available this weekend. You <br/>
don't have to attend Irish Fest to get the stamp but it's a fun time if <br/>
you like Irish music and merriment. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you like it. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to those who braved St. Catherine's Irish Fest to get the <br/>
Celtic Knot letterbox. We realize that some may have stayed away <br/>
because of the crowds so we decided to keep the box in place for the <br/>
rest of the month. It's in the same location but check the LBNA <br/>
website for a couple of updates to the clues. (Just as an FYI... the <br/>
box is on private property --church grounds-- with permission.) <br/>
<br/>
If you come during regular church office hours (M-F 8:30-4:30) and <br/>
you want to do an exchange, go into the church office (enter through <br/>
the double doors next to the sign that lists Mass times) and ask the <br/>
secretary if you can sign up for letterboxing classes. She'll let you <br/>
know if Skywatcher and/or SingularGirl are around for an exchange. <br/>
