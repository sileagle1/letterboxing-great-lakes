I also want to point out that isn't actually the address for Prentice...  Prentice is located in between Chicago Ave and Superior Ave, just west of Fairbanks -- actual address is 230 E. Superior.  The easiest place to park for Prentice is in the parking garage across the street on Superior (between St. Clair and Fairbanks), and you can get parking validation at Prentice for that lot.  The main entrance to Prentice is right across the street from that garage too.  I delivered both girls at Prentice, and it's a really nice hospital. :)<br>
