Okay, this is not one of those 'singles' or dating services posts, but<br/>
you can still choose a spot on the calendar for the Side-Wagers game.<br/>
Currently reserved dates range from February to June. Yes, that's<br/>
right. Some of our Great Lakes colleagues think the BINGO game will<br/>
end in February and some think it'll end in June.<br/>
What do *you* think?<br/>
There *are* dates between those already chosen.<br/>
It's easy to play.<br/>
Check out the files section for particulars in the Side-Wagers game.<br/>
