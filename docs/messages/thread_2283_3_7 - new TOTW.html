When I googled Azobox, all I got was letterboxing links.  Then I <br>
tried googling Azo and discovered it could  be a chemical compound <br>
used for dyes, except that they are a little unstable and could <br>
explode (I don't personally know Azobox, but hope THAT doesn't <br>
apply!).  Therefore, my cryptic clue is "Colorful, Combustible Cube"<br>

I never thought the game would go this long, which is why our Bingo <br>
prize was cold-weather related.  The winner may have to save it till <br>
next year!<br>

the event were carved by GLK's own Waltzing Pigs!  Also, several of <br>
the Bosch Circus boxes were hidden just for the event.  We had to <br>
