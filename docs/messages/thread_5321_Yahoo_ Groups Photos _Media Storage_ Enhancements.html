Subject: [moderatorcentral] Yahoo! Groups Photos (Media Storage) Enhancements<br/>
<br/>
As promised in a recent post on the Groups blog entitled What's in <br/>
store for Yahoo! Groups, we're excited to share more details around <br/>
the enhancements that you'll start seeing within the Photos section <br/>
of your Yahoo! Groups over the next several weeks. <br/>
<br/>
While the enhancements at first glance may appear to be modest, we <br/>
have in fact made several significant changes, including:<br/>
<br/>
- Increased storage limit for photos, from 100MB to 100GB<br/>
- Unique image locations (in other words, a URL that will link <br/>
directly to a photo within your Group)<br/>
- The original photo uploaded will now be stored in your group <br/>
(which means that anyone can click to see the original size of the <br/>
image when it was uploaded) <br/>
- The ability to upload new image formats, including GIFs, BMPs, and <br/>
PNGs <br/>
- The ability to upload up to five photos that add up to 100MB (from <br/>
5MB)<br/>
<br/>
We've begun slowly rolling these enhancements out to a handful of <br/>
Groups and will continue with this process over the next several <br/>
weeks so we can ensure a smooth rollout. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
Jami <br/>
Groups Community Manager<br/>
