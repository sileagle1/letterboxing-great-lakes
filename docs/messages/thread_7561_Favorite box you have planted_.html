But, to answer, I think it would have to be Big Red, a letterbox I planted in October of 2011. The walk to find the box is picturesque, the view from the box is spectacular, especially at sunset, and the carve is representative of a West Michigan favorite. It's also in a bit of a "best kept secret" location.<br/>

"All Fool's Day" because I used the image to play a joke on some co-workers (stamped the image on a post-it note and covered the bottom of a computer mouse, so the mouse couldn't "see".

<br/>
"Wisconsin Zombie Alert!" because it reminds of us of the great gathering we attended out east, the images are funny and I like the amusing clues Martini Man wrote for our boxes.<br/>
<br/>
"Horse Sense" and "Eggopolis - John &amp; Yolko" because I was able to do a good job on some tiny lettering and I liked the humor of the images.<br/>
<br/>
"Sawtooth Lake" because it was a GORGEOUS mountain hike and I created an image that fit the location.<br/>

He had 4 different homes around the area featuring different aspects for different seasons. (A water park, a cider mill, a great place for spring flower viewing, a place with a toboggan run and skiing trails). It was the same main gnome stamp, but for each season he had different accessory stamps that went with the season. He went missing in his fourth home. So he did make the full round at least. I carved a smaller version of it and made it a hitchhiker. So there is still a nomadic gnome around somewhere presumably. <br/>

clue or artwork (which is sad considering all the great clues and carves <br/>
we've found).  And, sadly, many of the favorite hikes come from some <br/>
'misunderstanding' or horrendous miscalculation or reading of the <br/>
clues...but then finally managing to find the box anyways.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a box we found last year by 'Guess Who' that involved <br/>
fording a stream with our stroller, getting lost as our compass started <br/>
to point S vs N, and then realizing the disconnect between how the trail <br/>
looked on that particular day vs when the clues were written.  We only <br/>
walked the trail probably 4 times...and while it ended up being a crazy <br/>
hike, we found the box (FF to boot!) and managed to find our way home.  <br/>
A great day on the trail!<br/>

Oh, and to actually respond to the question of this tread (misread the <br/>
subject! oops).<br/>
<br/>
I think our favorite boxes that we've planted (if I had to pick one) <br/>
would be our 'Hunt for the Hidden Hollow'.  Here we planted three <br/>
individual boxes that where double sided.  On the back where pieces of a <br/>
map.  When pieced together, it was a treasure map to find a Bonus Box <br/>
for the series.   Sadly, the final box ended up being in an area that <br/>
flooded more than we expected, and we had to remove the boxes as the <br/>
clues became almost impossible to follow.<br/>
<br/>
I also like our 'City Views' and 'Powers of Observation' as they take <br/>
you around the city, and I'm rather proud of those clues.<br/>

I think my favorite boxes stem more from the hike than any particular <br/>
clue or artwork (which is sad considering all the great clues and carves <br/>
we've found). And, sadly, many of the favorite hikes come from some <br/>
'misunderstanding' or horrendous miscalculation or reading of the <br/>

It's not a great carve, but it is an interesting location.  And it was fun to discover that other people liked hearing the stories as well.  <br/>

(I actually had to look through my AQ logbook...I'd forgotten many of my plants over the years.)<br/>
<br/>
"Little Falls Native Son" I think wins the title for me.  It has a lot of personal history for me.  My first carve of a "real live dead person" (and his signature, both of which came out quite well, if I do say so myself).  It was sent to the GLG my Dad and I wanted to go to in Minnesota (but alas he did not live to see).  The title comes from the inscription on a refrigerator magnet I found amongst his things, which he bought himself on a trip to Minnesota.  The fact that Lindbergh landed on an airstrip which is now a road I drive every day leaving work was always really cool to me.  Last, I think it's just a really cool hiding place (which I think more of you need to experience &lt;*wink*&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wait...there's one other thing about this box that makes it special...some of you may remember when I posted a few years ago about little 7 year old Devon who sent me a message via LbNA saying he found my letterbox and took it home, asking me what he should do with it.  I emailed and then called his mom, assured her it was nothing dangerous, thanked her for the very mature thing her son did by contacting me, and asked her to return it to the hiding place, which she did.<br/>
<br/>
Whew...that's a lot of story for one box!<br/>
