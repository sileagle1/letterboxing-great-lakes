haven't been out that way to find most of them, so I can't give you <br>
too much in the way of specifics though.<br>
<br>
I believe there are several in the Hudson Mills Metro Park north of <br>
94 in the Dexter Area (exit 167)<br>
<br>
There are several brand new "literary" boxes in the Rolling Hills <br>
County Park, south of 94 in the Ypsi area (exit 183).  Great set of <br>
boxes.  I believe the clues are on AQ.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
