"Hi all...speaking of poison ivy...we just got back from a great <br/>
vacation in FL where my in-laws have 5 acres of Lychee trees.  They <br/>
also have lots and lots of mango trees.  Seems my daughter who is <br/>
highly allergic to poison ivy decided to eat lots and lots of <br/>
mangos.  After an incredible breakout of rash on her face and a trip <br/>
to the doctors office we learned that mango skin and poison ivy are <br/>
in the same family.  The oils from the mango skin, not the meat, made <br/>
her face look like she was some sort of pirate.  Just thought you all <br/>
should know in case you too have an allergy."<br/>
<br/>
So, be careful about eating mango's while tiptoeing through the <br/>
poison ivy or we will have no idea which thing caused the rash!!  Yikes!<br/>

In theory it sounds logical, but I cannot get past the nightmares of blisters lining my stomach and esophagus, not to mention my mouth and lips.  So for now I will continue to immediately shower and wash everything thoroughly after each trip in the woods.  The article does give some good info about using Jewelweed to counteract the effects of poison ivy if you are not already familiar with that.  Also, having tried many, many over-the-counter remedies, washes and scrubs to treat, I swear by Technu scrub -- but it is a bit difficult to find and everywhere you go to look for it, they will try to sell you other stuff that "works just as good."  Don't buy it...  keep looking for Technu.  Some Walgreens carry it, but not all.  The best bet is to get it online so you're not running all over creation looking for it when you need it.  They carry it at drugstore.com.<br/>

  Never say never!  That's what I thought too, GG...I swore I was immune to the stuff.  I ended up on oral steroids after exposure to it in Texas last spring.  Not fun.  I keep my distance from the Demon Weed now!  (Speaking of which...I don't think anyone has found the letterbox I've placed by that name since it has been relocated..........)<br/>
  Sorry about the confusion over Room Service, Hx6...with all your hospitalizations and all, I didn't want to burden you with that as well.  When I saw that the Cottontails were going to be attending, I sent it to them instead, and forgot to tell you of the change in plans.<br/>
  Those of you who got that one last year, it's the same stamp and log.  If all goes according to plan when they hear back from the hotel management...the idea is that the Lb will be at the hotel's front desk.  You ask the clerk if they have Room Service to obtain it.  But again...the actual plan may change...so wait to hear the word from Cottontails for official directions.<br/>

  I am poison ivy free. That doesn't mean anything<br/>
  though for 2 reasons. One, I am immune to poison ivy,<br/>
  just lucky I guess. Two, I never even bother to look<br/>
  for poison ivy when I'm out because of reason number<br/>
  one. So I can't answer your question.  : )<br/>

I'm one of those who never used to be bothered by poison ivy whatsoever.<br/>
Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac -- I used to be able to wander at<br/>
will with no worries.<br/>
<br/>
Now however............some poison ivy definitely has gotten bad.  I know<br/>
it's not ME that's changed because some patches I can wander into and still<br/>
not have a problem, but other patches of it do me in.  It's only been in the<br/>
past year or year and a half that this has started happening.<br/>
<br/>
I just saw a newspiece on the "new &amp; improved" poison ivy and the possible<br/>
effects of carbon dioxide making it happen.  It made sense to me.  Now I've<br/>
gotta watch out -- I don't feel like Superwoman anymore.  :-)<br/>

Then there is this interesting article (http://www.wwmag.net/pivy.htm) about<br/>
immunizing yourself by ingesting poison ivy leaves.  In theory it sounds<br/>
logical, but I cannot get past the nightmares of blisters lining my stomach<br/>
and esophagus, not to mention my mouth and lips.  So for now I will continue<br/>
to immediately shower and wash everything thoroughly after each trip in the<br/>
woods.  The article does give some good info about using Jewelweed to<br/>
counteract the effects of poison ivy if you are not already familiar with<br/>
that.  Also, having tried many, many over-the-counter remedies, washes and<br/>
scrubs to treat, I swear by Technu scrub -- but it is a bit difficult to<br/>
find and everywhere you go to look for it, they will try to sell you other<br/>
stuff that "works just as good."  Don't buy it...  keep looking for Technu.<br/>
Some Walgreens carry it, but not all.  The best bet is to get it online so<br/>
you're not running all over creation looking for it when you need it.  They<br/>
carry it at drugstore.com.<br/>

&gt; As a general rule, people with fairer complexions<br/>
&gt; are more susceptible to poison ivy and those with<br/>
&gt; ruddier complexions have a better resistance.  But<br/>
&gt; with each subsequent exposure to poison ivy, you<br/>
&gt; become less resistant to the stuff, and it is not<br/>
&gt; uncommon for people who have for years been exposed<br/>
&gt; without incident to all of a sudden develop<br/>
&gt; reactions.  I can certainly attest to the validity<br/>
&gt; of that statement.  There was a time that reaching<br/>
&gt; into a patch of poison ivy was of little concern to<br/>
&gt; me and would leave me with a little red bump or two.<br/>
&gt;  After several incidents over that past 3-4 years, I<br/>
&gt; now break out in blistering welts covering much of<br/>
&gt; my body just from being in the general vicinity of<br/>
&gt; the stuff.  Each outbreak seems to get worse and<br/>
&gt; linger longer.  Last year I had a run-in with poison<br/>
&gt; ivy over Memorial Day weekend and was still treating<br/>
&gt; it well into July.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've also read recently that the toxins in poison<br/>
&gt; ivy and other urishiol producing plants (i.e. poison<br/>
&gt; oak) are getting stronger, supposedly due to an<br/>
&gt; increase in greenhouse gasses.  Apparently the more<br/>
&gt; carbon dioxide they have, the stronger, more potent<br/>
&gt; and more prolific they grow.  This will also cause<br/>
&gt; harder outbreaks and reactions in people who have<br/>
&gt; not previously been bothered.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Never say never!  That's what I thought too,<br/>
&gt; GG...I swore I was immune to the stuff.  I ended up<br/>
&gt; on oral steroids after exposure to it in Texas last<br/>
&gt; spring.  Not fun.  I keep my distance from the Demon<br/>
&gt; Weed now!  (Speaking of which...I don't think anyone<br/>
&gt; has found the letterbox I've placed by that name<br/>
&gt; since it has been relocated..........)<br/>
&gt;   Sorry about the confusion over Room Service,<br/>
&gt; Hx6...with all your hospitalizations and all, I<br/>
&gt; didn't want to burden you with that as well.  When I<br/>
&gt; saw that the Cottontails were going to be attending,<br/>
&gt; I sent it to them instead, and forgot to tell you of<br/>
&gt; the change in plans.<br/>
&gt;   Those of you who got that one last year, it's the<br/>
&gt; same stamp and log.  If all goes according to plan<br/>
&gt; when they hear back from the hotel management...the<br/>
&gt; idea is that the Lb will be at the hotel's front<br/>
&gt; desk.  You ask the clerk if they have Room Service<br/>
&gt; to obtain it.  But again...the actual plan may<br/>
&gt; change...so wait to hear the word from Cottontails<br/>
&gt; for official directions.<br/>

&gt;   I am poison ivy free. That doesn't mean anything<br/>
&gt;   though for 2 reasons. One, I am immune to poison<br/>
&gt; ivy,<br/>
&gt;   just lucky I guess. Two, I never even bother to<br/>
&gt; look<br/>
&gt;   for poison ivy when I'm out because of reason<br/>
&gt; number<br/>
&gt;   one. So I can't answer your question.  : )<br/>

My Grandmother (who was terribly abused by her father) was made to eat <br/>
Poison Ivy as a child and she told me about it, She had Poison Ivy so <br/>
bad in her mouth and throat it was amazing she did not die from <br/>
starvation from not being able to eat for a very long time, however <br/>
she never got Poison Ivy again for the rest of her life. I don't <br/>
remember any specifics since I was quite young when she passed away <br/>
but I do remember it was bad but it worked.<br/>
