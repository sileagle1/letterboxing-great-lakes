                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another productive day!  I have discovered the joy of carving on pink pearl erasers and <br/>
white speedy cut!  I am in love.  <br/>
<br/>
On the pink pearls I carved 1) Pickle Chiffon Pie and 2) my first attempt at lettering -- ARE <br/>
WE THERE YET?<br/>
<br/>
On the larger speedy cut, I carved a limited time stamp for the Tom Otterness in <br/>
Indianapolis art expo.  Have to find a good spot for that one.<br/>
<br/>
Haven't decided what to do with the pink pearls ....<br/>
<br/>
Dragon, would you like to have the Pickle Chiffon Pie?  It's not a wedge and doesn't have <br/>
any PI notation on it (yet).  If you don't want it, I will place it near a pie shop in Randolph <br/>
County, IN -- for those of you who remember -- Mrs. Wick's makes the best Sugar Cream <br/>
Pie!  MMMMMM, good.  They have other pies, too, and a restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
ARE WE THERE YET?  What to do with this little stamp?  I am thinking it might make an <br/>
interesting travelling event box.  What do you think?  I am going to the 5/21 Joy in the <br/>
Journey gathering in Plymouth, IN.  Perhaps it could make its debut there, and then, maybe <br/>
Armadillo Jo or someone else could carry it to the Great Lakes Gathering in June, then <br/>
someone could take it to the next gathering, and so on.  I would provide a large logbook <br/>
for exchanges.  I didn't want to make it a hitchhiker since I have 4 in the wilderness now.<br/>
Please provide feedback.<br/>
<br/>
On another note --Grandvilla-- your GL Exchange box has a First Finder!<br/>
