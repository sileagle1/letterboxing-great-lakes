<br/>
Police have arrested five suspects in connection with a robbery and assault at a Richland Township motel.<br/>
The attack happened early Thursday morning at the Super 8 Motel.<br/>
Two men staying at the motel were severely beaten with a sawed-off shotgun.<br/>
Police said the victims met two women at a bar and invited them back to their motel room.  One of the women let four men into the room.  They beat the two victims so badly that room was covered in blood.<br/>
The attackers stole $200, a credit card, and a cell phone.<br/>
Five suspects were arraigned overnight Thursday.  They were Daphne Parker, Jessica Maines, Grover Christopher Mitchell, Angel Rivera and Jason Carrasquillo.<br/>
Police are still looking for one suspect, Tyler Rager.  Police said he is considered dangerous and could have access to weapons.  Anyone with information is asked to contact Richland Township police at 814-266-8333.<br/>
One police officer said this one of the most violent attacks he'd ever seen.<br/>
"This type of crime, this type of violence is going to happen.  I don't care if it's a residence or a hotel.  The police in a united effort, just like in this case, we're going to come and find you and we're going to put you in jail," said Richland Township police Detective Tom Keirn.<br/>
