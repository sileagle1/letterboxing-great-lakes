Where are you thinking of doing your event?  And when you said to use Easter eggs for the basket, did you mean to use the eggs for the container that would hold the stamp and mini log book?<br>

I think it sounds like an awesome idea and a lot of fun.  You could do it as an event, or as a seasonal series that sets out for a few weeks.  Although I think it may be a bit too late in the game for this year if you want other letterboxers to contribute stamps to the series.<br>

      What a fun idea.  I think I'll do that with my son.  He's getting older but still loves to hunt Easter eggs, so this way it can be a letterboxing adventure!  Thanks so much for the idea.<br>
