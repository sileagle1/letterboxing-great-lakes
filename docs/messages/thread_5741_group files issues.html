Over the past three weeks we know that some of you have experienced a<br>
few hiccups while using Yahoo! Groups. For this, we're sorryÂ– we're in<br>
the process of moving to new data centers, a move which should enable us<br>
to deliver faster page loads, a more stable system, and an all-around<br>
better user experience.<br>
<br>
Currently, about 75% of Yahoo! Groups have been moved over to the new<br>
data centers and the remaining 25% of groups will be moved over in<br>
phases between now and March 31st.<br>
<br>
As is the case with any move, however, issues sometimes arise, which in<br>
this case have resulted in temporary delays or bugs. As a result of<br>
this, some of you may be experiencing a temporary issue accessing your<br>
files and we're working to resolve that now. We're sorry about any<br>
inconvenience caused by these problems; and we appreciate your patience,<br>
as we work through these issues in an effort to improve your experience<br>
on Yahoo! Groups.<br>
<br>
Melissa Daniels<br>
Yahoo! Community Manager<br>
