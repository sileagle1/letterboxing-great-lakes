You have a five-Pack already, seriously?  I just sent an email to F06 <br>
speculating that maybe every one was having a fairly bad start this <br>
year.  Guess I was wrong!<br>

I have two for 19 of the words, and of course, they are in no helpful <br>

I think we have been frozen in our tracks on the BINGO board due to the <br>
subzero weather.  Now that it is warming up a bit, maybe the words will <br>
start flowing a little better????  I'm guessing more than one person <br>
might have had today's word.<br>

I don't think that the group itself has a facebook page, but several <br>
members have individual pages.  If you want to add me as a friend, my <br>
name is Beth Liddle.  Just add a note in the friend request with your <br>
trail name so I know who you are. =)<br>

The K is just part of "lakes", I believe.  "Letterboxing Great Lakes"<br>

The other reason is because I didn't want the regional letterboxing chatter to shift from the Yahoo group to Facebook because I know there are a lot of folks who participate and enjoy the Yahoo list who do not use Facebook and would just as soon not add another social/group site to their collection of web places.  That being said, there is a lively bunch of letterboxers from the GL region who hang out on Facebook...  just watch out for that Mr. Family of 6 guy...  he'll try to bend your ear about his Bingo woes... <br>

Actually, it is a skewed 4-pack at the moment.  When I mentioned I was <br>
going for a 6-pack to my DS, he lifted his shirt and pointed to his abs <br>
and said "Like this". LOL<br>
