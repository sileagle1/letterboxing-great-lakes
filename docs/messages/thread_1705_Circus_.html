I have been informed by my colleague Phineas Boch that his famous <br/>
circus has recently completed a successful engagement in New York and <br/>
will soon be making their way to the great state of Maine.  <br/>
<br/>
After their performances in the Northeast, Phineas will allow me to <br/>
step into the ring to manage a second Midwest appearance for a select <br/>
group of performers. This time the traveling troupe will make their <br/>
way to the wilds of Wisconsin. We are hoping that no wild bears will <br/>
auditon for us!   <br/>
<br/>
Our opening performance will be on October 1 at Menomonee Park and we <br/>
expect to remain in the area for two full weeks.  A program outlining <br/>
the various venues and stages that you will need to search out to <br/>
witness these amazing artists will be available at the local <br/>
Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to the day when I join the performers and also <br/>
the day when I will meet you, our esteemed audience!<br/>
