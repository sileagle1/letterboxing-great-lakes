We feel like we just gave birth or something!  My best friend, Becky Jo <br/>
(Dumpster Diva) and I have placed our first box.  We're so excited, we can't stand <br/>
it.  If this puppy goes MIA we will have to kill someone.  We tried to act <br/>
like professional letterboxers and carved our own stamp.  If you find it and <br/>
don't think it's that good...DON'T tell us!  We like living in a fantasy land, <br/>
where our letterbox never goes missing and someday someone writes to us telling <br/>
us that out carving was simply wonderful.<br/>
Anyone, Anyone?<br/>
Did you all feel as euphoric as we do right now?  Yep, I thought so.  Since <br/>
we couldn't attend the gathering we just had to get our feet wet.  I am <br/>
supposed to be here attending a wedding and all the trimmings...... so where am I?  <br/>
Traipsing through bug infested grasses and being eaten alive by alien critters <br/>
that are manifesting themselves as mosquitoes! Dang! <br/>
Those bites look good in a spagetti strap dress!  People get married every <br/>
day, but you can't place your first letterbox with your best friend, who lives <br/>
out of town....actually, I'm the one who lives out of town! <br/>
       Does anyone know of a 12 step program for this hobby?  If you do,<br/>
don't tell us.....:)  we're in denial~!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail!<br/>
Lipstick Chick and Dumpster Diva (I'm here too!)<br/>
