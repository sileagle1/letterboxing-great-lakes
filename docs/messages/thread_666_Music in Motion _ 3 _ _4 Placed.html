Just a head's up that I've added two more boxes to the Music in <br>
Motion series (Muskegon).  If you've previously downloaded these <br>
clues, I've changed the clues a little from what I originally <br>
posted.  And if you've found boxes 1 and 2 (I believe this only <br>
applies to Bindle Babe & Bum), I moved box #2 from its initial hiding <br>
spot to a new location and put box #2 in its place.  If you decide to <br>
find #2 again to see its new hiding spot, leave me a little note (or <br>
a smiley face in the logbook).  <br>
<br>
Peace, <br>
Keltic Kara<br>
