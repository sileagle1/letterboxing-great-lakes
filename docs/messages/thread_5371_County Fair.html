                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Springchick and Oldshoe for a fun day.  We found 5 boxes on <br/>
Saturday and went back on Sunday and found 11 new plus redid the <br/>
games.  We only intended to do the games and rides but picked up a <br/>
hitch hiker in the last box and so we had to do another one and then <br/>
the hitch hiker wouldn't fit so we had to keep going, and found another <br/>
hitch hiker, I didn't think we would make it out before dark.  Good job <br/>
to everyone who carved stamps, they were all great.  My kids left <br/>
wanting to really get french fries and cotton candy.<br/>
