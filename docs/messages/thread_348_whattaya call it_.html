we drove through the parking area she said, "Hey, there's 'Lucky <br/>

We should vote on a name for repeat meetings like that.  And also, we <br/>
should determine if there is some ritual that should take place <br/>
instead of an exchange...<br/>
<br/>
And then we saw there was a new box (2?) in Ada...  Something about <br/>
birds escaping from the zoo...  What could that mean?  <br/>
<br/>
Celtic Series was great fun.  And the Sphinx and Serpentine- <br/>
excellent stamps...  Worth a day trip!<br/>
