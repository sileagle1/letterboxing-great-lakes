already done an exchange........whattaya call it?<br>
<br>
A nice opportunity to renew the acquaintance, I guess. <br>
<br>
Artistamp and I were setting out to hunt the new Celtic series at <br>
Grand River Park in the Jenison, MI area (awesome stamps, BTW!). As <br>
we drove through the parking area she said, "Hey, there's 'Lucky <br>
Charms' -- back up the car".<br>
Sure enough, it was the Charms sitting at a picnic table mapping <br>
strategies for their next hunt. We had a nice visit. They had just <br>
finished the Celtic series and were about to begin the Sphinx and <br>
Serpentine box hikes.<br>
Since our previous exchange was during the busy time of the McHenry <br>
Gathering, it was nice to have a chance to chat a bit (and they <br>
didn't have the added responsibility of young neices and nephews this <br>
time).<br>

Keep your eyes open.<br>

We should vote on a name for repeat meetings like that.  And also, we <br>
should determine if there is some ritual that should take place <br>
instead of an exchange...<br>
<br>
And then we saw there was a new box (2?) in Ada...  Something about <br>
birds escaping from the zoo...  What could that mean?  <br>
<br>
Celtic Series was great fun.  And the Sphinx and Serpentine- <br>
excellent stamps...  Worth a day trip!<br>
