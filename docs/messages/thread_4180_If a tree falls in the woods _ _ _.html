home or so.<br>
<br>
Two of the boxes were together in the clues, placed by the same <br>
people just 15 feet from eachother.<br>
<br>
We found BOTH boxes, only problem is that the first box did not have <br>
a stamp in it! It had a logbook, that we logged into, and information <br>
sheets in it but no stamp (it did have a stamp at one point, as it <br>
was stamped onto the logbook). The other box was fine with stamp and <br>
all.<br>
<br>
Question, if you find a box with no stamp in it, do you log it as <br>
a "Find"?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Oh, as a "P.S." and a side note (so I don't clutter your in-boxes) do <br>
you "tidy up" your stamps? I did this in my log book the other night <br>
with one of my own stamps . . . where you get some white spots in the <br>
image. I took a sharpie to it and now it looks great -- tried it with <br>
another "mis-print" and it looks so much better. Anyone else do this?<br>
<br>
Also, the opposite of "filling in" a stamp does anyone clean up <br>
the "clutter" from around the stamped image? This is something I was <br>
against doing, it adds character to the image when you can see <br>
some "clutter" around it -- also prooving it to be a handmade stamp.<br>
<br>
But there are one or two where the clutter is so heavy it takes away <br>
from the image of the stamp. I don't want to use white out in my <br>
book . . . any recomendations?<br>
<br>
Sorry for the lengthy Email . . . figured it would be better than <br>
getting two . . . three . . . or more Emails from me in one night :-)<br>

Finding a box without a stamp has only happened once to us.  It <br>
happened to be a geocache--letterbox combo so I assume that a <br>
geocacher took the stamp at some point (which is the reason why we <br>
don't look for these combos--don't want to get burned again).  We <br>
were bound and determined to get some sort of "stamp" from it--so we <br>
inked up the bottom of the container (it was a microbox) and stamped <br>
that "image" in.  As far as counting yours as a FIND--I'm sure there <br>
would be a variety of answers to that.  I'd say--it is your PFX <br>
count, so do what you like with it.  It's not like the letterboxing <br>
police are going to confiscate your logbook ;~)<br>
<br>
I like your idea about tidying up your images with your markers.  I <br>
have some stamp images with those whited-out areas, so I may have to <br>
give that a try.<br>
