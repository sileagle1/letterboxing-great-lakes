We now have a several old stamps we had removed for one reason or <br/>

With the theme this year being along the lines of going green, would it <br/>

I'd love some old used stamps. I enjoy planting and keeping up with my boxes but really have a rough time finding time to carve. <br/>

<br/>
At the end of last school year I did a questing/letterboxing event for the 1st &amp; 2nd graders which had them following clues to find stamps. This year we did a passport program in the library and I created passports for the kids and then carved stamps relating to each country we learned about. <br/>
<br/>
While my carving skill have certainly improved I do not have the time or skills to complete the number of stamps I would like for next years projects. As a team building event for church and school families I would really like to have another larger questingevent at the beginning of the year. The kids absolutely love the stamps and are always amazed that someone carved them. <br/>

take as many as you want.  They will either be out in a box marked <br/>
'Recycled Stamps', or you can come ask us and we'll direct you to them.  <br/>
We ask, however, that you don't just sit and stamp them!  If you want <br/>
them, please just take them.  You can give us credit if you use them <br/>
later, but please feel no pressure to do so.  We will just be happy that <br/>
they have found a second home!<br/>
