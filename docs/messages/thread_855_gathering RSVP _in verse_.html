Since Saturday night I've got tickets for Barrage!<br>

Wish I could be there, it sounds really great,<br>
Alas the show's far from home, so I'll be out quite late.<br>
<br>
At least my PLB will act as my proxy.<br>
I hope you aren't insulted  by my moxie.  (guess I'd better quit while I<br>
can....)<br>

It's not fair,<br>
Can't be there!<br>
Son's got a boat show<br>
and Mom's gotta go.<br>
It's a Cub Scout thing and I know he would be disappointed if I<br>
wasn't there cheering him on, but I sure would like to have made it<br>
to the gathering! Have a great time everyone!<br>

Holy Smokes, did the rest of you see the advertisement that pops up <br>
on some of our messages advertising a poetry writing contest?  Talk <br>
about targeted marketing!  They've seen our stuff and they're after <br>
our talent!<br>
