                    <div class="plaintext-content">An exciting day! The morning was mostly rainy which meant slow boxing w/muddy trails and umbrellas, ponchos, etc. Then we were all pleased to see the clouds clear and the sun appear!!  Lunch &amp; group photo w/sunny skies.  Afternoon changed to overcast again, but not much rain at all.  Boxers however were still dealing w/VERY muddy, slippery trails.  Lots of mud covered boots, legs, arms, packs, and even eyeglasses from the numerous falls (photos coming soon).  Unfortunately Joe Boxer sustained a sprained ankle (at least) and was out of commission.  <br/>
<br/>
However that was only the beginning...  later in the evening the clouds formed into tornados and the rain came belting down.  Most (probably ALL) of the campers abandoned the campsites and either headed home or to hotels.  And FungusWoman suffered enough worrisome symptoms to warrant emergency vehicles and a trip or two to the hospital (she called later in the evening to say she was doing OK and was at a hotel w/the HowD Girls).  Probably dehydration or heat exhaustion... I'm sure she will provide more details later.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, these were GREAT LAKES LETTERBOXERS, so nothing deterred many of them from meeting at Buffalo Wild Wings at 9:30 pm to exchange stamps &amp; stories.  Roly-Polies even managed to carve up a tornado event stamp that got passed along the tables at the restaurant!!<br/>
<br/>
At 11:20 pm there were still 30+ boxers at the restaurant when we said our good-byes (so we could hit the muddy trails again tomorrow).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Hartx6, Pitties and Shorty for organizing an event with so many wonderful carvings and so many "adventures"!  Luckily everyone kept up their good spirits and I'm sure this event will be a very memorable one for all who attended.<br/>

go home OK.<br/>
<br/>
The weather we drove through was terrifying! I had planned to drive south<br/>
through Springfield to avoid the worse stuff coming from the SW, but as we<br/>
were heading east for Peoria to get to 155, the news was saying that the<br/>
worst was IN east Peoria and there were tons of cars heading in the<br/>
opposite direction. So I turned around and went back to the campground,<br/>
but headed for the Quail shelter we used today, thinking it was the<br/>
closest (but it wasn't) and we stayed in the bathroom for while. Then we<br/>
left again, heard on the radio that there was still 5 more minutes of<br/>
warning near us, stopped at the closest campground loop and spent some<br/>
time in their bathroom.  Then we got on the road before the next wave go<br/>
to the highway, but drove through some really dicey stuff even though<br/>
supposedly we weren't in the tornado area anymore. Once I pulled off the<br/>
highway and then under an overpass to wait it out and tornado sirens were<br/>
going off. I thought of pulling under a bridge a few other times when the<br/>
rain was so heavy but there were already cars under the bridges and no<br/>
room for me.  After a while we were coming up on an edge of the storm and<br/>
there was so much lightning that we were getting closer and closer to that<br/>
I was pretty freaked out but also was having trouble seeing. I pulled to<br/>
the side under a bridge and then doubted myself for a bit because no one<br/>
else was stopping and it was not raining at all. Then my decision was<br/>
affirmed as it started POURING and blowing horizontally from the opposite<br/>
direction (from the north) and ALL cars stopped, whether they were under a<br/>
bridge or not. For 5-10 terrifying minutes I sat there praying that our<br/>
van would not be blown into the ditch (but at least that's probably as far<br/>
as it would go). I even told my daughter to lay down on the seat because I<br/>
was afraid the back window might blow in or something. The van was shaking<br/>
and then finally the wind backed off. I waited until the wind was<br/>
definitely better, then took off into surprisingly still heavy rain.<br/>
Fortunately, it lessened after 10 or 15 minutes and then by Springfield it<br/>
wasn't raining at all anymore.  Then I just had to get us home with my<br/>
exhausted nerves!<br/>
<br/>
I wish now that we had found a hotel in Peoria because today should be<br/>
beautiful and we didn't get much yesterday (due to my daughter's lack of<br/>
enthusiasm) and I planned to do a lot today. But I wasn't sure what to do,<br/>
didn't know where the hotels were, and it sounded like we would just be in<br/>
the basement of a hotel much of the night. But it sound like things were<br/>
OK after 8pm, so I'm glad you all didn't have to go through that again.<br/>
Maybe I can convince my family to do a little letterboxing around here<br/>
this afternoon to make up for it (after we dry out the tent and everything<br/>
we tossed in the car!).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a wonderful gathering, we really had fun during the day!<br/>

Lighthouse keeper had a great time and managed to survive the storm. Our tent held up and stayed totally dry! Too bad we didnt have time to box today because the weather was beautiful this morning! But alas, we had to head home. We finally made it to minneapolis and are very excited for the comforts of a real bed" bathroom" and kitchen! <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone else made it home safe and had a very successful day of boxing for those who were able to stay and box today.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and lk and i found a path tags in the shelter at the park...if someone has lost theirs we would be happy to mail it. It was so wonderful to see our lbing friends looking forward to the next occasion.<br/>
<br/>
With love<br/>
olj and lk<br/>

beautiful and we didn't get much yesterday (due to my daughter's lack of<br/>
enthusiasm) and I planned to do a lot today. But I wasn't sure what to do,<br/>
didn't know where the hotels were, and it sounded like we would just be in<br/>
the basement of a hotel much of the night. But it sound like things were<br/>
OK after 8pm, so I'm glad you all didn't have to go through that again.<br/>
Maybe I can convince my family to do a little letterboxing around here<br/>
this afternoon to make up for it (after we dry out the tent and everything<br/>
we tossed in the car!).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a wonderful gathering, we really had fun during the day!<br/>

<br/>
Well, that was an event! We andThe Dragonended up taking our tents down shortly after the tornadoes were reported. The insides were getting wet and we were going to have to leave early in the morning to get back anyhow. So we left town at 11:30 after hanging out with everyone at Buffalo Wild Wings. Had to have The Dragon slap me around a bit to keep me awake in the Rockford/Beloit area and arrived home at 3:30. Very tired, but home. Then I found a tick on my face! UGH...4:00am tick removal...not fun! Thank you to everyone who made this gathering possible! Wish we could have stayed another day for more boxes, but looking forward to next year!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought my drive home was tough, but yours was way worse! Since I had lost my tent to Friday evening's storm, I decided to head home at 5:30 Saturday.  I outran the storm n Peoria, but it caught up to me on I-94 in Michigan.  I drove 3-4 hours in blinding thunderstorms, with a tornado behind me, headed my direction at 45-60 MPH, so I didn't want to stop.  Other than white knuckles,  there was no harm done - sorry to hear about Joe Boxer's ankle and FungusWoman's hospitalization!  <br/>
<br/>
The organizers did a great job, in spite of needing to learn a new weather dance.  There were a ton of boxes, and it must have taken a long time to plant them all over the park.  The clues were all right on, so the mud was the only impediment to finding boxes.  The clue book really brought the theme together.  Everything seemed to run smoothly (at least when we were in the shelter areas).  It was great fun, and the weather just added to the adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to HowD Girls and crew for hosting the pre-gathering party - and for being such great campsite neighbors.<br/>

&gt; Cheesapalooza and I got home safely at 1:30 a.m. I hope that everyone else<br/>
&gt; go home OK.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The weather we drove through was terrifying! I had planned to drive south<br/>
&gt; through Springfield to avoid the worse stuff coming from the SW, but as we<br/>
&gt; were heading east for Peoria to get to 155, the news was saying that the<br/>
&gt; worst was IN east Peoria and there were tons of cars heading in the<br/>
&gt; opposite direction. So I turned around and went back to the campground,<br/>
&gt; but headed for the Quail shelter we used today, thinking it was the<br/>
&gt; closest (but it wasn't) and we stayed in the bathroom for while. Then we<br/>
&gt; left again, heard on the radio that there was still 5 more minutes of<br/>
&gt; warning near us, stopped at the closest campground loop and spent some<br/>
&gt; time in their bathroom.  Then we got on the road before the next wave go<br/>
&gt; to the highway, but drove through some really dicey stuff even though<br/>
&gt; supposedly we weren't in the tornado area anymore. Once I pulled off the<br/>
&gt; highway and then under an overpass to wait it out and tornado sirens were<br/>
&gt; going off. I thought of pulling under a bridge a few other times when the<br/>
&gt; rain was so heavy but there were already cars under the bridges and no<br/>
&gt; room for me.  After a while we were coming up on an edge of the storm and<br/>
&gt; there was so much lightning that we were getting closer and closer to that<br/>
&gt; I was pretty freaked out but also was having trouble seeing. I pulled to<br/>
&gt; the side under a bridge and then doubted myself for a bit because no one<br/>
&gt; else was stopping and it was not raining at all. Then my decision was<br/>
&gt; affirmed as it started POURING and blowing horizontally from the opposite<br/>
&gt; direction (from the north) and ALL cars stopped, whether they were under a<br/>
&gt; bridge or not. For 5-10 terrifying minutes I sat there praying that our<br/>
&gt; van would not be blown into the ditch (but at least that's probably as far<br/>
&gt; as it would go). I even told my daughter to lay down on the seat because I<br/>
&gt; was afraid the back window might blow in or something. The van was shaking<br/>
&gt; and then finally the wind backed off. I waited until the wind was<br/>
&gt; definitely better, then took off into surprisingly still heavy rain.<br/>
&gt; Fortunately, it lessened after 10 or 15 minutes and then by Springfield it<br/>
&gt; wasn't raining at all anymore.  Then I just had to get us home with my<br/>
&gt; exhausted nerves!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Peabody and I confess to being in the last #$%^&amp;# group to make it back to the shelter.  Luckily we were uphill going for one last box (KWIM?) when the torrents let loose.  &lt;br&gt;

Those of you who are reading - don't let the dramas/truamas distract you - we had a FREAKIN' AWESOME TIME!  I saw about 70 carves - THANKS TO ALL WHO CONTRIBUTED CARVES!  THANK YOU TO THE ORGANIZERS AND THEIR HELPERS!&lt;br&gt;

There is another chapter in the Peabody-Hartx6-Jaxom-Raccoon Story - I'll let Hx6 tell the first chapter.  Sunday morning, Raccoon was spotted trying to get across the Fox Den area back to the Quail Meadow Shelter, we assume.  At that shelter, I kid you not, there was a COON FAMILY REUNION going on today.&lt;br&gt;

unforgettable event!  Despite the weather, I had a great time, from the<br/>
campfire Friday night through to boxing in the twilight with Ish and<br/>
chatting in the toilet (the only real structure in the campground) with MOU<br/>
UR4ME and Cheesapalooza.  Right up until I decided that the lure of more<br/>
boxes on Sunday was not as great as my lack of enthusiasm for sleeping in a<br/>
tent during nasty thunderstorms and potential tornadoes.  The dogs and I<br/>
made it back to Urbana safely, racing the second storm through Peoria and<br/>
emerging victorious to have a relatively calm ride for the remainder of the<br/>
trip.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, my tent poles, which withstood two weeks of crazy wind in New<br/>
Mexico in May and the first nasty storm of last night, snapped today when a<br/>
gentle breeze puffed through Flying Dragon and Kimono Momma's backyard where<br/>
it was drying.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the event was pretty exciting for every one, as every time I looked<br/>
up today, Liam, FD, KM, and KM's mom (who didn't even go to the event) and<br/>
all 4 dogs were sleeping!  Of course, I didn't get to look up too much,<br/>
being pretty tired myself ;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got home tonight around 11 pm safe &amp; sound.  Due to all the weather<br/>
excitement, we invited Hartx6 to use the sleeper sofa in our hotel suite<br/>
last night (we hated to think of him out in his car!).  We slept in a bit<br/>
this morning since we didn't want to disturb him too early.  I'm sure he was<br/>
exhausted, so we finally snuck past him down to breakfast where we chatted<br/>
with several other boxers.  Those that were at the hotel last night were<br/>
apparently asked to congregate in some "safe" areas and the TJMich parents<br/>
told their boys that everyone was having a cookie party so they didn't get<br/>
too worried about the storm (our hotel always had cookies available in the<br/>
lobby).  We heard that the LBers at the hotel took the opportunity to do a<br/>
few exchanges at this time (Great Lake boxers are always  prepared!).  I'm<br/>
curious how the hotel contacted people. Since we were out to dinner w/Tiptoe<br/>
&amp; Tonto at the time, we weren't part of the hotel corridor/laundry room<br/>
party.  (By the way, at Buffalo Wild Wings, someone who works there did tell<br/>
us the best place to go in case of a tornado was the restaurant cooler room.<br/>
This was probably the same thing as the Steak &amp; Shake freezer, except we<br/>
didn't actually need to go into it!  Instead we stood around and watched the<br/>
storm reports on the large screen TVs, then sat down to eat &amp; socialize.  I<br/>
heard the people that ate earlier at the Jubilee Cafe went into the basement<br/>
for safety, but they also got free pie while there!) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hartx6 eventually became conscience by 9:30 am, and Martini Man &amp; I were<br/>
heading back to the park by 10 am.  Sunny skies, great temperatures, but<br/>
trails were still quite muddy and had lots of water in some areas.  Our<br/>
first sign of a LBer was a note posted by Dartmoor Dreamer on a trailhead<br/>
sign warning people about 16" of water on a trail and a map suggesting an<br/>
alternate route.  A bit later we saw SunnySideUp &amp; Peabody , but then it was<br/>
a LONG time before we saw anyone else.  Today we did the Australian, etc.<br/>
loop and the European loop.  We were impressed to discover that all the<br/>
boxes were totally dry inside, even after the torrential downpours<br/>
yesterday.  Due to water on the trails, we found a route across the corn<br/>
field at one point (rather than the trail), only to discover that the next<br/>
trail we wanted was quite flooded.  This meant taking an alternate route<br/>
around, then coming backwards along the KME trail.  But we were able to do<br/>
this ONLY after we acquired a few logs to build ourselves a little bridge<br/>
across a creek.  Late afternoon we ran into Pitties, Shorty, Hartx6 and<br/>
Tiptoe and Tonto.  They were nearing the end of doing our Coin-Operated<br/>
series.  Unfortunately they had failed to find box #4 and we had heard that<br/>
several others had problems with this box.  However we do know that Leapin'<br/>
Lizards &amp; The Dragon did somehow manage to find it yesterday, so perhaps<br/>
they can post some hints or clarifications if the clues need some help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After finishing up the two loops, we had time to do the first box in the<br/>
clue packet (carved by FungusWoman and possibly illustrating "I'd Rather be<br/>
Fishing"'s suggestion for how she could find some letterboxes).  Hooray!! We<br/>
managed to find all the boxes listed in the clue packet (of course we didn't<br/>
need to do our own long series, so that made it a bit easier).  We left the<br/>
park at 6:45 pm and headed back home to Wisconsin.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Hartx6, Pitties and Shorty for hosting the event this year!<br/>
The path tags were very nice, there were a ton of excellent carvings, and we<br/>
appreciated the longer hiking trails.  Thanks also to everyone that carved<br/>
the stamps - there were many interesting images. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was great fun to see so many people that we have gotten to know over the<br/>
past 7 years and to also meet a few new people.  We were very happy to see<br/>
so many WI boxers at the event and also happy to see more from MN were able<br/>
to make it this year.  A bonus was to have some MO people attend. (However<br/>
we were sorry to see that Azobox did not make it this year.  He was the ONLY<br/>
person that had made it to ALL of the previous GLk events).  Hopefully we'll<br/>
see some of you at other events later this year.<br/>

Wow, what a whirlwind weekend, literally! I am glad all of you came to GLG this year and I am even happier that everyone made it home in one piece (we can't say the same for the tents, canopies...)! This is an awesome group of positive, persistent, patient people. Weather aside, I really enjoyed getting to visit with so many of you over the weekend. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few public thank yous go out to all our attendees, our carvers, planters (special thanks to Nitrocat), Wisconsin Hiker for planning guidance, Pugnasties for the GLG 2010 website, HowDGirls/Lampwick/Diana Dolphin/Fungus Woman for the S'mores pre-gathering, TJ Mich for taking the scrapbook &amp; banner to pass on to next year's host, and last but not least - our families for all their help! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most boxes are available until June 25th, 2010. The clue packet has been uploaded to the files section of this group under: Gatherings/Great Lakes 2010. If anyone would like to help retrieve boxes for us after 6/25, please contact one of us. Thanks!!<br/>

An exciting day! The morning was mostly rainy which meant slow boxing w/muddy trails and umbrellas, ponchos, etc. Then we were all pleased to see the clouds clear and the sun appear!! Lunch &amp; group photo w/sunny skies. Afternoon changed to overcast again, but not much rain at all. Boxers however were still dealing w/VERY muddy, slippery trails. Lots of mud covered boots, legs, arms, packs, and even eyeglasses from the numerous falls (photos coming soon). Unfortunately Joe Boxer sustained a sprained ankle (at least) and was out of commission. <br/>
<br/>
However that was only the beginning... later in the evening the clouds formed into tornados and the rain came belting down. Most (probably ALL) of the campers abandoned the campsites and either headed home or to hotels. And FungusWoman suffered enough worrisome symptoms to warrant emergency vehicles and a trip or two to the hospital (she called later in the evening to say she was doing OK and was at a hotel w/the HowD Girls). Probably dehydration or heat exhaustion... I'm sure she will provide more details later.<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, these were GREAT LAKES LETTERBOXERS, so nothing deterred many of them from meeting at Buffalo Wild Wings at 9:30 pm to exchange stamps &amp; stories. Roly-Polies even managed to carve up a tornado event stamp that got passed along the tables at the restaurant!!<br/>
<br/>
At 11:20 pm there were still 30+ boxers at the restaurant when we said our good-byes (so we could hit the muddy trails again tomorrow).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Hartx6, Pitties and Shorty for organizing an event with so many wonderful carvings and so many "adventures"! Luckily everyone kept up their good spirits and I'm sure this event will be a very memorable one for all who attended.<br/>
<br/>
More later...<br/>

Those that were at the hotel last night were<br/>
apparently asked to congregate in some "safe" areas and the TJMich parents<br/>
told their boys that everyone was having a cookie party so they didn't get<br/>
too worried about the storm (our hotel always had cookies available in the<br/>
lobby). We heard that the LBers at the hotel took the opportunity to do a<br/>
few exchanges at this time (Great Lake boxers are always prepared!). I'm<br/>
curious how the hotel contacted people. Since we were out to dinner w/Tiptoe<br/>
&amp; Tonto at the time, we weren't part of the hotel corridor/laundry room<br/>
party. (By the way, at Buffalo Wild Wings, someone who works there did tell<br/>
us the best place to go in case of a tornado was the restaurant cooler room.<br/>
This was probably the same thing as the Steak &amp; Shake freezer, except we<br/>
didn't actually need to go into it! Instead we stood around and watched the<br/>
storm reports on the large screen TVs, then sat down to eat &amp; socialize. I<br/>
heard the people that ate earlier at the Jubilee Cafe went into the basement<br/>
for safety, but they also got free pie while there!) <br/>

So glad you made it home safe and sound!  We so enjoyed hiking on the<br/>
trails with you!  I can't imagine driving all that way after hiking the<br/>
quarters loop!!  You are a true letterboxer!!  We headed back to the<br/>
hotel for a long long shower!!  <g>.<br/>

&gt; I thought my drive home was tough, but yours was way worse! Since I<br/>
had lost my tent to Friday evening's storm, I decided to head home at<br/>
5:30 Saturday. I outran the storm n Peoria, but it caught up to me on<br/>
I-94 in Michigan. I drove 3-4 hours in blinding thunderstorms, with a<br/>
tornado behind me, headed my direction at 45-60 MPH, so I didn't want to<br/>
stop. Other than white knuckles, there was no harm done - sorry to hear<br/>
about Joe Boxer's ankle and FungusWoman's hospitalization!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The organizers did a great job, in spite of needing to learn a new<br/>
weather dance. There were a ton of boxes, and it must have taken a long<br/>
time to plant them all over the park. The clues were all right on, so<br/>
the mud was the only impediment to finding boxes. The clue book really<br/>
brought the theme together. Everything seemed to run smoothly (at least<br/>
when we were in the shelter areas). It was great fun, and the weather<br/>
just added to the adventure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks also to HowD Girls and crew for hosting the pre-gathering party<br/>
- and for being such great campsite neighbors.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Cheesapalooza and I got home safely at 1:30 a.m. I hope that<br/>
everyone else<br/>
&gt; &gt; go home OK.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The weather we drove through was terrifying! I had planned to drive<br/>
south<br/>
&gt; &gt; through Springfield to avoid the worse stuff coming from the SW, but<br/>
as we<br/>
&gt; &gt; were heading east for Peoria to get to 155, the news was saying that<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; worst was IN east Peoria and there were tons of cars heading in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; opposite direction. So I turned around and went back to the<br/>
campground,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but headed for the Quail shelter we used today, thinking it was the<br/>
&gt; &gt; closest (but it wasn't) and we stayed in the bathroom for while.<br/>
Then we<br/>
&gt; &gt; left again, heard on the radio that there was still 5 more minutes<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; warning near us, stopped at the closest campground loop and spent<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; &gt; time in their bathroom. Then we got on the road before the next wave<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the highway, but drove through some really dicey stuff even<br/>
though<br/>
&gt; &gt; supposedly we weren't in the tornado area anymore. Once I pulled off<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; highway and then under an overpass to wait it out and tornado sirens<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; &gt; going off. I thought of pulling under a bridge a few other times<br/>
when the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rain was so heavy but there were already cars under the bridges and<br/>
no<br/>
&gt; &gt; room for me. After a while we were coming up on an edge of the storm<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; there was so much lightning that we were getting closer and closer<br/>
to that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was pretty freaked out but also was having trouble seeing. I<br/>
pulled to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the side under a bridge and then doubted myself for a bit because no<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt; else was stopping and it was not raining at all. Then my decision<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; affirmed as it started POURING and blowing horizontally from the<br/>
opposite<br/>
&gt; &gt; direction (from the north) and ALL cars stopped, whether they were<br/>
under a<br/>
&gt; &gt; bridge or not. For 5-10 terrifying minutes I sat there praying that<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; &gt; van would not be blown into the ditch (but at least that's probably<br/>
as far<br/>
&gt; &gt; as it would go). I even told my daughter to lay down on the seat<br/>
because I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was afraid the back window might blow in or something. The van was<br/>
shaking<br/>
&gt; &gt; and then finally the wind backed off. I waited until the wind was<br/>
&gt; &gt; definitely better, then took off into surprisingly still heavy rain.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Fortunately, it lessened after 10 or 15 minutes and then by<br/>
Springfield it<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn't raining at all anymore. Then I just had to get us home with<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; exhausted nerves!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wish now that we had found a hotel in Peoria because today should<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; beautiful and we didn't get much yesterday (due to my daughter's<br/>
lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; enthusiasm) and I planned to do a lot today. But I wasn't sure what<br/>
to do,<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't know where the hotels were, and it sounded like we would just<br/>
be in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the basement of a hotel much of the night. But it sound like things<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; &gt; OK after 8pm, so I'm glad you all didn't have to go through that<br/>
again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe I can convince my family to do a little letterboxing around<br/>
here<br/>
&gt; &gt; this afternoon to make up for it (after we dry out the tent and<br/>
everything<br/>
&gt; &gt; we tossed in the car!).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for a wonderful gathering, we really had fun during the day!<br/>

Thanks to Nitrocat for warning us all ahead of time about the possibility of "Boot Sucking Mud"...little did she know we would be saying that phrase over and over to our dismay!

Most of us looked like mud wrestlers...that is, all except Wisconsin Hiker who some how managed to look pristine the entire weekend - white shoes and all!<br/>
Through it all, what we loved the most is that it really was an adventure!  For many of us the thrill of letterboxing is the anticipation of what lies ahead.  We experienced it all this weekend.  Rain, sun, wind, humidity, gentle breezes....tornado, a chance to get wet and muddy, raccoons in action..or asleep in trees, great boxes, "umbrella boxing", nettles, stream crossings, wonderful friends to share in our adventures, yummy potluck, exchanges and great pie at the Jubilee Cafe, antique shops, shelter in an outhouse, slips and slides, cornfield hiking, boot sucking mud (BSM), lots of laughs.  <br/>
We had a less dramatic tornado experience.  Although, it was swirling all around and apparently was sighted just outside our window, Wisconsin Hiker and Tiptoe were contentedly sipping adult beverages in a booth while everyone else in the restaurant (including Tonto and Martini Man) were "checking out" the black cloud and sirens outside the window.  It was said "it" (the tornado) was at the intersection of the mall where we were happily reliving the day of wet boxing!  Don't think for a minute that a tornado was going to disrupt our day!<br/>
When we moved our party next door to Buffalo Wild Wings and the big screen weather watches were showing just how nasty this thing was, only then did we realize this was nothing to mess with!  We were gratefully relieved when the campers started filing into the restaurant one by one to announce they had survived the tornado.  To top it off Roly-Poly carved a little tornado stamp right there on the spot!  Gotta love the letterboxing spirit!<br/>
Shorty, Pitties, and Hartx6 did a great job...and we are still laughing at the post about them "planning" the shameful plug for their Wizard of Oz" series by "creating" a real tornado to get us all to go to OZ!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And rouse them at the name of Jubilee........<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Tiptoe" ...and Tonto did indeed come out of the weekend standing, albeit on very muddy tiptoes!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to Nitrocat for warning us all ahead of time about the possibility of "Boot Sucking Mud"...little did she know we would be saying that phrase over and over to our dismay!  Also, we want to thank her for suggesting "an extra pair of clothes" of which we had already gone through by Friday afternoon...long before the real event even started!  We are grateful for hotel washing machines which we used on Friday AND Saturday night..not to mention Sunday's load we brought home!  Most of us looked like mud wrestlers...that is, all except Wisconsin Hiker who some how managed to look pristine the entire weekend - white shoes and all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Through it all, what we loved the most is that it really was an adventure!  For many of us the thrill of letterboxing is the anticipation of what lies ahead.  We experienced it all this weekend.  Rain, sun, wind, humidity, gentle breezes....tornado, a chance to get wet and muddy, raccoons in action..or asleep in trees, great boxes, "umbrella boxing", nettles, stream crossings, wonderful friends to share in our adventures, yummy potluck, exchanges and great pie at the Jubilee Cafe, antique shops, shelter in an outhouse, slips and slides, cornfield hiking, boot sucking mud (BSM), lots of laughs.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We had a less dramatic tornado experience.  Although, it was swirling all around and apparently was sighted just outside our window, Wisconsin Hiker and Tiptoe were contentedly sipping adult beverages in a booth while everyone else in the restaurant (including Tonto and Martini Man) were "checking out" the black cloud and sirens outside the window.  It was said "it" (the tornado) was at the intersection of the mall where we were happily reliving the day of wet boxing!  Don't think for a minute that a tornado was going to disrupt our day!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When we moved our party next door to Buffalo Wild Wings and the big screen weather watches were showing just how nasty this thing was, only then did we realize this was nothing to mess with!  We were gratefully relieved when the campers started filing into the restaurant one by one to announce they had survived the tornado.  To top it off Roly-Poly carved a little tornado stamp right there on the spot!  Gotta love the letterboxing spirit!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shorty, Pitties, and Hartx6 did a great job...and we are still laughing at the post about them "planning" the shameful plug for their Wizard of Oz" series by "creating" a real tornado to get us all to go to OZ!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tiptoe &amp; Tonto<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS...Dear Agnes and Becky...we owe you BIG time!  A big part of the delay was our fault...along with terrible trail conditions and #4!!!  Don't blame Mom...or Matt!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure what else to add that hasn't already been said... but I couldn't let the opportunity pass to again thank our hosts, Hart, Shorty, and Pitties, for all their work in organizing a great weekend. In addition, thanks to their entire families who supported them through all the months and weekends of planning, planting, and preparing. <br/>
<br/>
Since the majority of our family is under three-foot-six, we opted not to brave the slippery trails except for a few short walks after lunch. Instead, wehad a lot of fun exchanging with other groups, stamping some of the tabletop boxes, andplaying with the frisbees, soccer balls, and other kids. <br/>
<br/>
One thing that was particularly nice for we non-campers was having a block of rooms reserved at a single hotel. At other events, people have stayed at a variety of hotels, but the reservation block helped us all to be at the same place -- with a nice price discount too.It was neat heading down to breakfast and knowing you'd see some familiar faces! We also took advantage of the tornados passing to catch up on a few more exchanges with Roly-Polies and Picklea Pickle, and hear about the afternoonadventures of Beetle, Shorty, SunnySideUp, and others.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home, Jillremarked howthis year's experiencewas quite different from the 1st Great Lakes Gathering wherethe two of us,along with our dogMaya,were able to find every box out on the trails... but just give us a few more years and we'll try to repeat that feat as a family!<br/>

What a story. I'm sorry I was in the same boat as you -- I didn't know what <br/>
 to do either.<br/>
<br/>
I thought after the fact that I should have been a bit more convincing as  <br/>
far as getting a hotel room. As I mentioned to you, there were more than <br/>
enough  boxers in hotels and given the circumstances I'm sure many would've <br/>
opened up  their rooms for you &amp; cheeseapalooza.<br/>

Sorry for letting you go . . . and the ordeal you went through. Glad you  <br/>
did made it home safely though.<br/>

"There is another chapter in the Peabody-Hartx6-Jaxom-Raccoon Story - I'll  <br/>
let Hx6 tell the first chapter. Sunday morning, Raccoon was spotted trying <br/>
to  get across the Fox Den area back to the Quail Meadow Shelter, we assume. <br/>
At that  shelter, I kid you not, there was a COON FAMILY REUNION going on <br/>
today."<br/>
<br/>
So, with that intro, at one point on Saturday Peabody came to me and told  <br/>
me there was a racoon stuck in one of the garbage cans at the main event  <br/>
shelter.<br/>
<br/>
The can was a 50 gallon barrel with a typical garbage can lid.... only the  <br/>
flap only opened in and couldn't swing back out towards you.<br/>
<br/>
I believed Peabody until the point he said, "yeah, there is . . . look."  <br/>
The way he was walking toward the can made me say, "There is not." for a <br/>
minute  I thought he was joking and some spring loaded snakes would jump out at  <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
He assured me he wasn't joking. So, I poked the lid in quickly to see an  <br/>
adolescent racoon stuck at the bottom of the can looking up at us.<br/>
<br/>
The planning commenced on how to get this thing out of there.<br/>
<br/>
That's when Jaxom came over and decided the two of us would lift the lid  <br/>
off and tilt the can away from us.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow we messed up the "tilting the can" part and just lifted the lid  <br/>
off...... within a split second this racoon jumps up to the top of the can and <br/>
 leaps out towards us!!! <br/>
<br/>
I think I managed to conceal my little girl scream, however, I took a giant <br/>
 step backwards and stepped right in ankle deep mud!!<br/>
<br/>
The racoon ran off across the parking lot and across the street away from  <br/>
us.<br/>

 to see Leo the Lion Cootie still out and about. I was FF on that cootie <br/>
<br/>
over 3  years ago -- Joyful Explorer carved him (and a whole circus of <br/>
<br/>
sidekicks) in  honor of our family!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was thrilled he was the only cootie I managed the whole weekend!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday morning, I went to top off the rental car with gas and what do  <br/>
<br/>
you suppose I found when I opened the fuel lid???????<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DANG!<br/>
