                    <div class="plaintext-content">After going through the turmoil of carving a new signature stamp,  it <br>
got me to thinking back to my first letterboxing trip and how <br>
everything was kind of thrown together.    A commercially made stamp, a <br>
name I wasn't really happy with, and a very vague idea on how to <br>
letterbox.  <br>
<br>
It came time for me to do a new signature stamp, so I have decided to <br>
revamp my trail name that better suits me as well.    For those of you <br>
in the Chicago area, you may have seen my mugshot on ABC 7 during the <br>
morning weather watchers segment, so starting today I have dropped <br>
the  "silboxer"  name and will be using "storms over seven".<br>
<br>
<br>
Can't wait to see everyone on Sunday here in Streator for the Majestic <br>
Meet. <br>
