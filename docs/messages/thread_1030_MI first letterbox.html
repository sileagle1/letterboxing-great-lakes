Bill and I were under the impression that Michigans first letterbox <br/>
was "April Fools" placed by Marty on September 5, 1999 and adopted <br/>
by Silent Doug. We would be dismayed if this were not true, as it <br/>
was one of our first letterboxes and took much time to find as the <br/>
main clue had been removed. :(<br/>

&gt; Hello everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry if we kept you waiting...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our scouting is done - the weekend weather certainly helped! <br/>
Please <br/>
&gt; come one and all to the 2005 Great Lakes Gathering: Mo' Boxin' In <br/>
&gt; Motown on June 18, at Hudson Mills Metropark.  A $4 entrance fee <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; required, but we promise lots of fun and treasures to find (and, <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; an added bonus - MI's VERY FIRST letterbox!).  The park is easily <br/>
&gt; accessable from both US-23 and I-94...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Visit this link for a map (left side of the page).  Our shelter is <br/>
&gt; #5, the secluded "Pine View".<br/>
