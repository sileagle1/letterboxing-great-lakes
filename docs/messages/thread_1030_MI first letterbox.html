Bill and I were under the impression that Michigans first letterbox <br>
was "April Fools" placed by Marty on September 5, 1999 and adopted <br>
by Silent Doug. We would be dismayed if this were not true, as it <br>
was one of our first letterboxes and took much time to find as the <br>
main clue had been removed. :(<br>

  As a P.S. to this; "April Fools" was planted and found at Hudson <br>
Mills park, where the 2005 Gathering is to take place.<br>
