I got an e-mail from one person a few days ago who had not received a box and am following up on that one.  If there is anyone else who sent their box out but did not receive one, please e-mail me offlist and I will follow up.<br>
<br>
Somebody asked about the progress with list compilation, etc. of exchange boxes.  I have not received info back from everyone who participated yet.  As the date to have boxes planted is June 1st, I am not going to begin pestering anyone about it until then.  If you have sent / received / planted but have not returned the info form, please do so as soon as possible so I can get this pulled together.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

  I've temporarily placed my box from the exchange.  I'm not terribly happy with the location, but I didn't see me getting another chance to place this box until late June and that's just to long to sit on it.  So, for now it is hidden and the clues are up.  <br>
