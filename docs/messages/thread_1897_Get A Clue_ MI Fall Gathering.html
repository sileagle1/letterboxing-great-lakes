                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, it's less than a week now until the MI Fall Gathering  -- <br>
Saturday, 10/22 at Yankee Springs Rec Area near Middleville.  I'm <br>
really looking forward to seeing everyone!  I was out at the park <br>
this weekend and it is gorgeous there -- the color is really <br>
beginning to pop and the lake is beautiful.<br>
<br>
I've received a lot of the Clue game stamps in the mail and have <br>
received word from several others that they are one the way.  We <br>
should have plenty of stamps for extra players and the game promises <br>
to be a lot of fun!<br>
<br>
I've also received a couple of boxes for planting and am aware of <br>
other folks who have planted boxes themselves.  Remember, if you <br>
planted boxes yourself -- bring clues to the gathering to pass out <br>
to the other attendees.  I am only planning to bring clues for the <br>
boxes that I've planted (and probably the Election Series since I'm <br>
not sure if Lucky Charms is around or not).  If you are coming and <br>
would still like to plant a box, there are a lot of wooded areas <br>
right around the shelter.  You should easily be able to find a spot <br>
in the general vicinity once you get there without heading out onto <br>
the hiking trails.  <br>
<br>
After much debate (and many good suggestions) for the workshop <br>
topic, we have finally decided.  Since we have a mix of new <br>
letterboxers and those who have been to previous gatherings, we <br>
didn't want to repeat the stamp carving or logbook workshops.  So <br>
we've decided to try something a little different.  Instead of doing <br>
a workshop, we will be hosting a forum.  We're calling it "Building <br>
a Better Letterbox."  The forum will cover topics like:<br>
<br>
- Ideas/themes for your letterbox<br>
- What to include in your letterbox<br>
- Containers that work well (and those that don't)<br>
- Camoflauge ideas<br>
- Choosing a location<br>
- Hiding techniques<br>
- Clues<br>
<br>
The idea of a forum is a group discussion and sharing of ideas <br>
rather than one person dishing out all the information.  So, come <br>
prepared with questions and ideas and be ready to participate in the <br>
discussion.  Let's all use our experiences and help each other place <br>
letterboxes that are lots of fun for folks to find and stand a <br>
better chance of survival.<br>
<br>
So, where do you go when you get there? (if you've looked at the <br>
map, Yankee Springs is a big place!)  If you are coming off U.S. 131 <br>
(either north or south) take exit 61 and follow M-179 east about 7 <br>
miles, following signs to the Gun Lake Unit of Yankee Springs.  Once <br>
past the little toll booth (you will need either an annual or daily <br>
MI State Parks sticker - I believe a daily pass is $5.00), the road <br>
splits - campground is to the right; you want to follow signs for <br>
the beach, boat launch and shelters to the LEFT.  Pass a long wooden <br>
bridge/boardwalk on your right, the fishing pier on your right, the <br>
beach house on your right, and then the shelter will be on your <br>
left.  There are two picnic shelters in the park - both are out on <br>
the peninsula that ends at Murphy's Point - one is partway down and <br>
the other near the tip.  We are in Shelter #1, which is the one that <br>
is partway down the peninsula.  We will be there around 7:00 a.m., <br>
but the gathering doesn't officially get underway until about 8:00 <br>
a.m.  The shelter has electricity, but the water has already been <br>
shut off for the season.  There is a grill there and we are planning <br>
to grill hotdogs for the group, but you could easily throw on <br>
something else if you'd like.<br>
<br>
One last thing...  there are areas of Yankee Springs Rec Area that <br>
allow hunting and it is hunting season.  Although hunting is not <br>
allowed in the hiking areas, the trails are posted as pass-through <br>
hunting areas and some of them run adjacent to game area land -- you <br>
will hear gunshots in the area and it might not be a bad idea to <br>
wear bright colors on the trails.  Also, I saw quite a lot of poison <br>
ivy, so be watchful and if you are especially susceptible, take <br>
necessary precautions.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail either <br>
myself or Azobox.  See you Saturday!<br>
