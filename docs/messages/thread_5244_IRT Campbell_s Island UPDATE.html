in June, the ground was STILL saturated.<br>
 <br>
Finally today, the Mississippi was down enough for me to bushwhack my way  to <br>
the boxes location . . . and it was still there!! With only a few drops of  <br>
water!!! <br>
 <br>
THANKS LocknLocks!!!<br>
 <br>
I did, however, move the box, not necessarily to higher ground per say (it  <br>
is on a flat island after all). The new spot will allow me to check on it more  <br>
quickly and allows you to find it easier when the water does make its way up  <br>
again.<br>
 <br>
I will post new clues this evening. <br>
 <br>
My IRT Welcome to Illinois is still there and in good shape, this after a  <br>
report of an attempt. The original stamp is still there and waiting for the  <br>
Road Trip to come out this way.<br>
 <br>
I want to thank all who found Campbells Island . . . esp. Garfan (last  <br>
finder Nov. 2007) for piling on the rocks so that this box (my 3rd placed box)  <br>
didn't end up in New Oreleans.<br>
