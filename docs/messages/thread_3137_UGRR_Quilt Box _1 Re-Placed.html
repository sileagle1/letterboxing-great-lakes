updated.  The kids and I went out this afternoon to scout out the same <br/>
general area.  Saw a tree that looked like it would be great--took a <br/>
look inside and saw a brown-painted can.  A geocache.  We took a look <br/>
inside the can.  The kids weren't too impressed with all those little <br/>
trinkets.  Nothing can compare with those nice hand-carved stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
Our little stamp is back--in almost the exact same spot.  Instead of <br/>
being at the roots of a leaning tree, it now rests under the sawn logs <br/>
of that same tree. <br/>
