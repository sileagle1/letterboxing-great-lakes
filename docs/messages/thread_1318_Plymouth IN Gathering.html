Gathering May 21st in Plymouth, IN, Centennial Park. <br/>
Full of Heart and I have been busy carving and<br/>
planting boxes in Marshall <br/>
and northern Fulton Counties.  <br/>
<br/>
I will have printed clues sheets for all of our boxes<br/>
as well as those of Armadillo Jo's and the Weaver<br/>
family.  There will be a set of the clues for each<br/>
group that has said they are coming.  Driving tips are<br/>
included on these clue pages to help you to find the<br/>
best routes to take and the boxes on those routes so<br/>
you can make the best use of your time. (We want you<br/>
to visist all our boxes!)  These clues will be<br/>
available at the Neidlinger shelter at 9:00 am for<br/>
anyone who wishes to get an early start.  If you would<br/>
like them earlier than that let me know and<br/>
arrangements can be made. There will be at least 45<br/>
boxes in the area, 14 of which will be available for<br/>
event day only.<br/>
<br/>
When you arrive in Plymouth you will want to stop at<br/>
the park shelter and pick up your clue book and the a<br/>
bag of goodies for each person in your group. <br/>
(Another reason why we want to know how many to<br/>
expect.)  Full of Hear and I have been busy bees<br/>
making these special for you.  At this time we have 22<br/>
people who have said that they will be coming.  <br/>
<br/>
We would like everyone to meet back at the Neidlinger<br/>
shelter between 11:30 and 12:00 for stamp exchange and<br/>
lunch.  Each should bring their own picnic lunch or<br/>
purchase lunch at one of the fast food restaurants<br/>
near the entrance of the park.  If you would like to<br/>
bring finger foods to share you may do that.  We will<br/>
have door prize <br/>
drawings at this time also.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on the 21st<br/>
Flagbearer and Full of Heart   <br/>
The Sisters Act<br/>
