<br>
It has been a while since my last telegram to you and I thought you<br>
would like to hear of our progress [stop.] The circo has left the<br>
wonderful district of Virginia and the able leadership of Phineas Boch<br>
[stop.] They have performed to sold out crowds and have been the envy<br>
of our competition [stop.] Boch's Circo is now in transit to my<br>
American home in Kensingtonia, where the reunion will be most joyous<br>
[stop.] I am only a temporary ringmaster while we travel our way to<br>
Michigonia but will do all in my power to ensure that we are rested<br>
and ready to perform in the true circo tradition [stop.]<br>
<br>
We are looking forward to seeing you all and performing at the Hudson<br>
Mills grounds where we will be setting up our big top for our<br>
exclusive one day only performance on 18 June 2005 [stop.]<br>
<br>
Until later . . . <br>

Apparently many of the stamps will be making an appearance at the Great <br>

There were many amusing posts on the Mid-Atlantic board prior to their <br>
gathering, similar to the one that was posted on the LbGLK board to <br>
announce the upcoming attraction.<br>

As has been reported elsewhere, the Circo has dazzled audiences far to<br>

The prospect of actually seeing the assembled acts has me on the edge<br>
