                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is cause for worry when any hobby gets mass publicity like the <br/>
Time article about Letterboxing.  It makes me think of the vacation <br/>
destinations listed in Outside magazine.  I'm sure the locals hate it <br/>
when their favorite hang-outs get publicized to that extent and the <br/>
masses swarm in.  <br/>
<br/>
I've read with interest all the points of view posted here (after my <br/>
own case of freaking out when I read the article) and found some <br/>
comfort in yooperann's comments about not keeping to yourself <br/>
something others might enjoy.  My life would be a lot less <br/>
interesting if I didn't have Letterboxing in it.  I also saw some <br/>
truth in azobox's comments about the article drawing in some amateurs <br/>
that run out and mess up boxes (and the environment) in their quest <br/>
for the quick, easy finds.  It helps to keep in mind that this <br/>
pastime requires a LOT of thought, planning and energy to keep on top <br/>
of things.  If you aren't truly in love with it, interest will taper <br/>
off.  Like most things, it's not for everyone.  Like azobox, I've <br/>
told every friend and relative I have about my passion and after a <br/>
few questions (mostly about my sanity), they lose interest.  I'm <br/>
hoping that the article will generate some serious boxers that will <br/>
place some awesome boxes and the flash-in-the-pans will fade away <br/>
quickly without doing too much damage.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was looking through my "Cooking Light" magazine and noticed a great <br/>
letter to the editor from a lady in Noblesville, IN.  She was <br/>

discovering interesting sites that make for fun hikes, not needing a <br/>
GPS.  She mentioned the letterboxing.org Web site.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this article/letter reminded me of how our family got <br/>
introduced to letterboxing.  Our kids get Ranger Rick nature <br/>
magazine.  Last summer, they had an article about letterboxing.  In <br/>
the ongoing cartoon at the back of the magazine, they even had Ranger <br/>
Rick and his friends searching for a letterbox.  That piqued our <br/>
interest.  Even though the first box we went looking for was missing, <br/>
we tried again and now we are hooked!<br/>
