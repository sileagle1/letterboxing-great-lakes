been wearing reading glassses to carve, but last Christmas Martini Man <br>
got me a large lens with a circular light around the lens that lights <br>
below the lens.  The whole contraption mounts on a desk edge and has <br>
extendible arms so the lens can easily be repositioned to wherever you <br>
want.  It is wonderful!  (I believe he bought it at an art store)<br>
<br>
For some reason, when I started using the lens, I also quit using the <br>
Speedball carving tools (I had primarily used #1 and to a lesser extent <br>
#4) and went to using only an xacto blade. I use the blade for tiny <br>
areas and for large.  Somehow I just seemed to figure out how to <br>
control the blade at the same time.  <br>

I became an x-acto convert several months ago when I was working on a<br>
series of stamps with more detail than I often attempt. Now I use the<br>
no. 11 knife in most all but big areas that need "clearing" of lots of<br>
material. I do have a very small veiner blade that I occasionally use<br>
for very fine lines.<br>
But to your question of MAGNIFICATION......<br>
<br>
I use super-powerful reading glasses (from the drugstore) and<br>
occasionally use them in conjunction with my regular glasses for<br>
carving. Lots of other carvers use stationary magnifiers that sit on<br>
stands or ones that hang around their neck. I actually have a<br>
jeweler's loupe that attaches to my glasses' frame for super-duper<br>
close-up views.<br>
As others will likely attest, wearing the magnifiers can make you<br>
dizzy if you look away from your work or try to get up and walk around<br>
the room.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I purchased reading glasses from the $$ store that are about 3.0 strength and I wear these while I am carving.  They work great and don't get in my way, although they make me very nauseous if I forget to take them off before get up and walk around.  There are also some very nifty magnifying stands with and without lights that people use -- although I'm sure they are not from the $$ store.<br>
<br>
As far carving with an Exacto knife...  that's just how I learned to do it.  I hold it in my hand like a pencil, at about a 45 degree angle to the carving material.  First I carve along the line and then I come back about 1/8" away for the return cut, thus forming a "V" shaped piece of material that comes out.  In this respect it is a lot like the "V" tool, except I can much more easily cary the angle with the knife.  The main difference is that I feel I have much more control in varying the depth depending on the detail of what I am carving.  Also I find it easier to get a sharp, clean, tight corner using the Exacto knife.  I have a couple of specialty Exacto-type knives that have very small blades -- one even uses a needle type end.  A set of these were sent to me by Legerdemaine, a truly awesome carver.  The others I have found at craft and hardware stores.<br>
<br>
But it really is just what you get used to.  I have seen some of ScoutDogs carvings and they are amazing, and she carves almost exclusively with the tools (and modified versions of them).  It is more a steady hand and patience than the tools you are using, although if you are having trouble with one method, it is certainly worth it to try another.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you are going to squeze the #1 so that you get a finer blade, it is best to put something in the middle and then squeeze.  For example, one carver I know heats the cutter over a flame and then inserts a thin knife into the slot of the #1 and uses pliars to squeeze the edges up against the blade.  This makes a cutter for finer cuts.<br>
 <br>
I've also heard that magnifying is a good idea also.  It helps with the detail and keeps you from cutting too deep, as even small depths look like canyons.<br>
