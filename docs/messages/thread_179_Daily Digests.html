In response to the Daily Digetst problem...  In the past I have <br/>
heard of this happening on other Yahoo groups.  It will generally <br/>
fix itself after a while (not sure how long that would be).  In the <br/>
meanwhile, try changing your setting off of digest, save it and <br/>
completely log off and exit Yahoo.  Then log back onto Yahoo and <br/>
change your setting back to digest mode.<br/>
