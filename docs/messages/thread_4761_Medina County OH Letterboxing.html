                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, all! Unfortunately, we are still receiving complaints about <br>
Medina County letterbox placements. If you plan on placing boxes in <br>
county parks, please take the time to familiarize yourself with the <br>
policies of the people who are dedicated to maintaining your local <br>
parks. <br>
<br>
Thank you very much, <br>

Hello,<br>
I have contacted your organization before about a problem we have had <br>
with people placing letterboxes in our parks without permission. <br>
Unfortunately, I have not gotten a response from the placers, <br>
although I have contacted them numerous times through your site. Your <br>
terms of use states clearly that the placer must have permission <br>
before placing letterboxes. Our park district requires that a permit <br>
be applied for and approved for letterbox/ geocache placement.<br>
The following letterboxes have not been approved:<br>
Medina Mystery Box<br>
Princess Ledges Pinecone Bough<br>
Allardale Wildflower<br>
(all placed by traveln turtle)<br>
Kelmark Boxes 1, 3, 5, 6, 6.5, 8 & 11 (placed by Kellie)<br>
Can you please remove these clues from your website and let the <br>
placer know that they must contact the Medina County Park District in <br>
the future for permission to hide letterboxes. Thank you.<br>
<br>

So being curious, I visited the Medina Parks website<br>
just now and found their GEOCACHE rules & regulations<br>
and their GEOCACHE permit & application, but didn't<br>
see the phrase "letterbox" anywhere on those forms. <br>
So how is a letterboxer supposed to know that those<br>
same rules apply to them, too?  *bats eyes innocently*<br>
<br>
BTW, some of those boxes, like the Kelmark boxes, have<br>
been there since 2004 - and they're just now making a<br>
fuss?  I don't even think they had a geocache policy<br>
back when some of these boxes were planted.<br>

Okay, so maybe I needed to relax a little before getting cranky. I <br>
called the lady at the park services and she directed me to that form. <br>
She was very pro-letterbox (didn't sound that way in her letter) and <br>
said they would love for them to stay, just be permited. Seems good. <br>
<br>
The form though says that I have to yank it every year, May 1st and <br>
get re-permited. AND I have to check on it every month. Are they <br>
serious? Should I just yank them, or expect the guidelines to be <br>
lenient? <br>
<br>
Thanks for listening to my tirade yesterday. A calmer turtle prevailed.<br>

Can you check with another letterboxer who has planted a box in the <br>
parks to see if they truly are strict about the every month check or <br>
not?  A few years ago, here in IL, DuPage County parks required that <br>
monthly check; however, I was told by another boxer that it wasn't <br>
enforced.  I just placed a box in DuPage county this fall, and that <br>
isn't even a requirement anymore--perhaps they realized that it <br>
wasn't necessary. <br>
<br>
Can you ask them why they require a monthly check?  Perhaps that <br>
requirement is geared more for geocaches that accumulate junk.<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>
