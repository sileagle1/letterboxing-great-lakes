                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I haven't heard from Team Taco for quite a while, I need help<br>
with two items they are involved with in the Grail series.<br>
<br>
First, they have the Camelot (just a model) box that I made.  I will<br>
be making a new one, and wish to send it to Ohio for someone to plant.<br>
 If there is an Ohio volunteer (other than Doodle and Deedle who've<br>
done some already) please email me.<br>
<br>
Second, TT created the "God" box which seems to have disappeared in<br>
Laughing Coyote's move (still waiting for word from LC for sure).  Is<br>
there a volunteer willing to create a "God" box replacement?  I<br>
already have a placer who needs it ASAP.  Email me if you're<br>
interested in carving "God".  (I'll refrain from many obvious puns on<br>
this box's status.)<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
