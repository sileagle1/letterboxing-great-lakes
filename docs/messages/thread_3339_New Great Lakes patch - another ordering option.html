(As you can tell, I really want to get SASE because it saves me a lot of time and because I haven't factored that expense into the cost of the patches).<br/>
I noticed that Dragon recently updated the gathering page and this "informal" event he is planning will probably have 50+ people attending, including some newer boxers in our area!<br/>
If you want more info about the event click here:  http://www.geocities.com/the_lb_dragon/WI_Gathering_fall06.htm<br/>
We're looking forward to seeing many of you at the event!<br/>
