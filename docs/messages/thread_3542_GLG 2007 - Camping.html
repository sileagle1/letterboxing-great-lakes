&gt; &gt; night the weekend of the gathering.  There's a number<br/>
&gt; &gt; you can call to reserve a campsite, or you can reserve<br/>
&gt; &gt; your site online, but note, "Reservation must include<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 nights minimum if you reserve Friday or Saturday." <br/>
&gt; &gt; So hey, stay Friday night, too, and be the first one<br/>
&gt; &gt; at the gathering Saturday morning.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Here's an idea, for those camping (like Deedle &amp; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; will be), if we all book our camp sites now we'll have<br/>
&gt; &gt; first choice and can stake out an entire area for<br/>
&gt; &gt; ourselves and make it a weekend-long party ;)  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There are actually 2 camping areas, separated by a<br/>
&gt; &gt; main road.  Here's a map, for those interested:<br/>

&gt; specific sites if you do it online.  And yes, we reserved M11.<br/>

I do I suspect the same is true of them too), but you shouldn't have<br/>
to worry too much about hearing our "hounds" unless you're walking<br/>
into our campsite.  We don't like to be woken by baying hounds either!<br/>
 And ours are pretty quiet to begin with anyway...every time we've<br/>
gone camping with them the raccoons have made WAY more racket<br/>
scrounging the campsite for leftovers.<br/>
<br/>
Aina and Tatsu are both white German Shepherds.  This year they'll<br/>
both have matching orange backpacks, though we will put different<br/>
colored bandanas on them for easy reference.  Those of you who were at<br/>
last year's gathering may remember them (although maybe not, since you<br/>
would have had to meet them either during the photo or out on the<br/>
trail).  Tatsu was only 6 months old then...he's now bigger than Aina!<br/>
 Aina has trust issues with strangers.  She will mingle happily in a<br/>
room full of strangers, just so long as none of them seem to notice<br/>
her.  As soon as she realizes someone is paying attention to her, she<br/>
gets very shy (she'll follow a random stranger down the street, then<br/>
turn and run if s/he notices and tries to say hi).  Tatsu is more<br/>
outgoing, although he's getting a little more shy as he matures.  He<br/>
still enjoys pets (although not on his head...he's more of a<br/>
butt/belly/side scratch kind of guy) and attention from strangers once<br/>
he's been introduced.  <br/>

think I've ever seen him seek them out.  All of the letterboxing dogs<br/>
we've met so far have been at least reasonably well trained (some of<br/>
them exceptionally well trained) and generally well behaved.  And I<br/>
have yet to meet a nasty letterboxer at a gathering, so I'm sure that<br/>
other dog owners in the group wouldn't be offended if you asked them<br/>
to keep your distance. <br/>
