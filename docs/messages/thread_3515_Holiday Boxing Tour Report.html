                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, today we were back to "real life", but we had a great 6-<br/>
day "Holiday Boxing Tour" from DEC 27 thru JAN 1.  I was joking when <br/>
I said we were "heading south" to describe our trip to Illinois, but <br/>
in reality the weather on 2 days DID make us feel like we had headed <br/>
much further.  It actually got up to 60 degrees on DEC 29 &amp; 30 and it <br/>
was so nice to be outside in weather like this!  <br/>
<br/>
We started out with a gorgeous sunrise over Lake Michigan as we left <br/>
home on Wednesday DEC 27.  We started our boxing as soon as we <br/>
crossed the state line with a bunch of Cinemaboxer boxes. We had <br/>
found some of their creations before, so we were looking forward to <br/>
adding more to our logbook.  We had also heard good things about <br/>
the "Trip Across America" series and were excited to have a chance to <br/>
start our journey.  Temperatures were in the 30s but a nippy wind <br/>
made it feel colder.  However with no snow and no rain to deter us, <br/>
we were able to attempt all 3 available 5-state sets.  However the <br/>
recent rains had caused extensive flooding of the Des Plaines river <br/>
and that prevented us from being able to access Maine &amp; Missouri.  We <br/>
didn't go any further than that since we decided to postpone Set #2 <br/>
until the waters receded.  We loved the images Cherokee Rose 2 <br/>
selected for the states we did find and are looking forward to <br/>
continuing our trip later this year.<br/>
<br/>
The next day was bright &amp; sunny with temperatures near 50, and a <br/>
perfect day to spend in the Kickapoo State Park.  Since it was the <br/>
site of the 2005 "Mining for Boxes" gathering, we had a wide variety <br/>
of boxes to look for.  This was a very pretty park with lots of  <br/>
hills, water, and hawks screeching overhead.  The park also has an <br/>
interesting history and it was amazing to see how well nature could <br/>
recover an area used for coal mining.<br/>
<br/>
The next 2 days were quite warm and we were down to only a light <br/>
jacket (or no jacket) and enjoyed a picnic lunch outdoors.  Not a <br/>
normal December day for us!  We bopped around one day finding a <br/>
variety of boxes scattered about.  Since it gets dark so DARNED <br/>
early, we had a chance to use our new Christmas presents from Martini <br/>
Man's brother &amp; sister-in-law:  headlamps!  They worked great, <br/>
allowing us to have our hands free for logging and stamping, yet <br/>
still gave us the ability to focus the light where we needed it.  <br/>
These will definitely be staying in our packs and were a great gift!<br/>
<br/>
Our favorite day was Saturday when we did the Lance's Fish Tank <br/>
series by Kimono Girl.  As many of you know, we like to hike, and <br/>
this series allowed us to be out hiking for 4 hours with nice water <br/>
views and trails (and stamps).  This was much better than being in <br/>
the house or car on a nice day, and given the time of year, we had <br/>
the whole area to ourselves - PERFECT!  Later that day we saw a <br/>
bluebird flitting through the woods, something we don't think we've <br/>
seen before.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the last 2 days were quite rainy, so our boxing was <br/>
limited.  However we did manage to get to the Boar's Head Festival <br/>
series before it gets pulled this weekend.  Luckily the weather dried <br/>
up late in the afternoon as we were heading home.  This allowed us to <br/>
reach a major milestone on the Hunt for Pink Panther series - we <br/>
found our 2,000th box!  A nice way to celebrate the start of the new <br/>
year.  We hope the rest of you all had a nice holiday and wish <br/>
everyone a happy &amp; healthy 2007!<br/>
