                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, today we were back to "real life", but we had a great 6-<br>
day "Holiday Boxing Tour" from DEC 27 thru JAN 1.  I was joking when <br>
I said we were "heading south" to describe our trip to Illinois, but <br>
in reality the weather on 2 days DID make us feel like we had headed <br>
much further.  It actually got up to 60 degrees on DEC 29 & 30 and it <br>
was so nice to be outside in weather like this!  <br>
<br>
We started out with a gorgeous sunrise over Lake Michigan as we left <br>
home on Wednesday DEC 27.  We started our boxing as soon as we <br>
crossed the state line with a bunch of Cinemaboxer boxes. We had <br>
found some of their creations before, so we were looking forward to <br>
adding more to our logbook.  We had also heard good things about <br>
the "Trip Across America" series and were excited to have a chance to <br>
start our journey.  Temperatures were in the 30s but a nippy wind <br>
made it feel colder.  However with no snow and no rain to deter us, <br>
we were able to attempt all 3 available 5-state sets.  However the <br>
recent rains had caused extensive flooding of the Des Plaines river <br>
and that prevented us from being able to access Maine & Missouri.  We <br>
didn't go any further than that since we decided to postpone Set #2 <br>
until the waters receded.  We loved the images Cherokee Rose 2 <br>
selected for the states we did find and are looking forward to <br>
continuing our trip later this year.<br>
<br>
The next day was bright & sunny with temperatures near 50, and a <br>
perfect day to spend in the Kickapoo State Park.  Since it was the <br>
site of the 2005 "Mining for Boxes" gathering, we had a wide variety <br>
of boxes to look for.  This was a very pretty park with lots of  <br>
hills, water, and hawks screeching overhead.  The park also has an <br>
interesting history and it was amazing to see how well nature could <br>
recover an area used for coal mining.<br>
<br>
The next 2 days were quite warm and we were down to only a light <br>
jacket (or no jacket) and enjoyed a picnic lunch outdoors.  Not a <br>
normal December day for us!  We bopped around one day finding a <br>
variety of boxes scattered about.  Since it gets dark so DARNED <br>
early, we had a chance to use our new Christmas presents from Martini <br>
Man's brother & sister-in-law:  headlamps!  They worked great, <br>
allowing us to have our hands free for logging and stamping, yet <br>
still gave us the ability to focus the light where we needed it.  <br>
These will definitely be staying in our packs and were a great gift!<br>
<br>
Our favorite day was Saturday when we did the Lance's Fish Tank <br>
series by Kimono Girl.  As many of you know, we like to hike, and <br>
this series allowed us to be out hiking for 4 hours with nice water <br>
views and trails (and stamps).  This was much better than being in <br>
the house or car on a nice day, and given the time of year, we had <br>
the whole area to ourselves - PERFECT!  Later that day we saw a <br>
bluebird flitting through the woods, something we don't think we've <br>
seen before.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the last 2 days were quite rainy, so our boxing was <br>
limited.  However we did manage to get to the Boar's Head Festival <br>
series before it gets pulled this weekend.  Luckily the weather dried <br>
up late in the afternoon as we were heading home.  This allowed us to <br>
reach a major milestone on the Hunt for Pink Panther series - we <br>
found our 2,000th box!  A nice way to celebrate the start of the new <br>
year.  We hope the rest of you all had a nice holiday and wish <br>
everyone a happy & healthy 2007!<br>
