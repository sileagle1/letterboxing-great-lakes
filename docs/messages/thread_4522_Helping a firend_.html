<br/>
This doesn't make me uncomfortable as a planter at all. <br/>
<br/>
In fact as finders with 4 young children we often read the clues backwards  <br/>
to see if we can't figure out a shorter way to the box so that the twins (not  <br/>
yet 2 y/o) could come with us.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if you can find a way to a box that you can make more  <br/>
accessible to your friend in a wheel chair by all means do so. I plant boxes for  <br/>
people to find, not just the able bodied ones either.<br/>

Yes we are in SE Michigan, Ann Arbor area. She has also gone boxing in <br/>
Dexter where I have not yet so I don't know what ones they have found. <br/>

He can walk very short distances, but I would think no hills and the <br/>

I also love to carve I just don't have any good carving blocks (I have <br/>

$5/box and I informed my husband I was taking $20 out of my pay this <br/>
week to order some. We have the money its just my husband spends it <br/>
first. I'm tired of whining I don't have the money when I know we <br/>
should.<br/>

&gt;  South east? <br/>
&gt; South <br/>
&gt; &gt; west? Mid-Mich?  I'm hoping to plant a few boxes<br/>
&gt; in south eastern <br/>
&gt; &gt; Michigan which may be wheelchair accessible.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Do they need the box to be accessible or is it<br/>
&gt; close enough to be <br/>
&gt; able <br/>
&gt; &gt; to see the box location from the trail and have<br/>
&gt; someone else <br/>
&gt; retrieve <br/>
&gt; &gt; it?  I know there are a few in Ann Arbor / Dexter<br/>
&gt; that are <br/>
&gt; accessible in <br/>
&gt; &gt; this way.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
