<br>
This doesn't make me uncomfortable as a planter at all. <br>
 <br>
In fact as finders with 4 young children we often read the clues backwards  <br>
to see if we can't figure out a shorter way to the box so that the twins (not  <br>
yet 2 y/o) could come with us.<br>
 <br>
I think that if you can find a way to a box that you can make more  <br>
accessible to your friend in a wheel chair by all means do so. I plant boxes for  <br>
people to find, not just the able bodied ones either.<br>

Yes we are in SE Michigan, Ann Arbor area. She has also gone boxing in <br>
Dexter where I have not yet so I don't know what ones they have found. <br>
<br>
He can walk very short distances, but I would think no hills and the <br>
wheelchair is for distances. <br>

If anyone knows of any accesable boxes in this area I'm sure they <br>
would like to know.<br>

I also love to carve I just don't have any good carving blocks (I have <br>
the speedy-cut junk) but I worked it out it should cost me about <br>
$5/box and I informed my husband I was taking $20 out of my pay this <br>
week to order some. We have the money its just my husband spends it <br>
first. I'm tired of whining I don't have the money when I know we <br>
should.<br>
