delinquency in getting these packaged and in the mail.  Work has been <br/>
just crazy hectic for me and many days the past few weeks are nothing <br/>
more than work, eat, sleep.  I will try to make work of this very <br/>
soon.  Thanks for your patience!<br/>

Thank you to everyone for all the neat prizes.  We also got lots of <br/>
great stuff for planting: lock n' locks, erasers, markers, camo <br/>
tape, a journal, a gas card (great timing on that one, at <br/>
$3.50/gallon and rising), and a cool bottle holder that clamps onto <br/>
a backpack. Plus, my husband will get a new pair of handmade wool <br/>
socks from Flying Dragon, soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Spring Chick for arranging the Bingo game, boxing up all the <br/>
prizes, keeping track of the databases, etc. That's such a huge <br/>
job.  Someone else mentioned this not too long ago, but I also have <br/>
to say that I looked forward to finding out what the word of the day <br/>
was each day, and couldn't wait to get home to check the message <br/>
board to see if I had another square to check off. Even if we didn't <br/>
win, it was a lot of fun and a great wintertime diversion. Winning <br/>
of course, made it more fun. We feel like we won the lotto or <br/>
something with all of the great stuff. Thanks again everyone!<br/>

<br/>
The Waltzing Pigs also say "thank you, thank you" for the many great <br/>
items we received in our Bingo prize box--lots of things for making <br/>
or stamping into boxes, for driving to boxes, keeping warm and clean <br/>
while boxing, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids and I just got back from Lansing (and our Odyssey of the <br/>
Mind finals) and it was a treat to find the box of goodies waiting!  <br/>
We had a busy time at Lansing.  Unfortunately, the time we had free <br/>
(where we could have done some of the great things suggested) was <br/>
also the time of torrential rains  :~(    Oh well.  I did have a <br/>
chance to plant a box on campus  ("OMER")--clues to be posted soon.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks to SpringChick for putting BINGO together and thanks <br/>
for everyone who contributed such nice prizes.  Only 7 months and 3 <br/>
days until Bingo starts again (I hope).<br/>

I'm sorry somebody was so critical - clearly, they don't know you.  I can't imagine you keeping Bingo Booty.  (Really folks, it's nice booty and all, but it's just game prizes.  This isn't the winning lottery ticket.)  <br/>
<br/>
I for one have really enjoyed playing Bingo, these last few winters.  I appreciate all the effort you put into keeping us entertained while we fend off cabin fever.  I wish there were something I could do to help from here!<br/>

I, too, am so sorry about the hurtful note.  I know you have to put up with all of our banter during the BINGO game, but that's all meant to be in good fun ... and we know that you know that, too!  But this is totally uncalled for ... and that person should be banned from playing again, if there is not an immediate and meaningful apology.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dearest Spring Chickie..it pains us to think of anyone accusing you (or any of us for that matter) of not being honest.  It is very sad.  By nature, letterboxing sucks us in to the point that maybe we loose sight that it is after all just a game!  And the BINGO component that you have selflessly offered for OUR enjoyment certainly is a game!  We all have real lives and all of us should understand that more often than not letterboxing gets pushed to a back burner!  We figure that if it takes months to play BINGO, you likewise should be afforded the grace to take at least the same amount of time to distribute prizes.  And even if you go beyond that ...so what?  Christmas in July?  Bingo Booty in September?  We're just thrilled that you take the time to put this together for us each year!<br/>

Speaking from afar, I'm just not surprised that your fellow local boxers<br/>
have rallied to your side on this - every year I live vicariously through<br/>
your Bingo game and I love the spirit it brings out in y'all's talk list.<br/>
And you do it year after year for the entertainment of the whole group -<br/>
what a generous act that in itself is.<br/>
<br/>
Having been around the various talk lists with you for lo these several<br/>
years, I feel as though I know you.  You are always a voice of fresh air and<br/>
courtesy and I would like to take a moment to thank you publicly for<br/>
speaking the spirit of the game as you do.<br/>
<br/>
