Just got a message from a geocacher...unbeknownst to him at the time, he placed a cache in the same location as my Fish Out of Water 2 letterbox on IL 71 outside Norway.   So if you happen to be in that neck of the woods, bear in mind that the container you find may not be mine.  His is a green-capped centrifuge tube (mine is not!).
