I want to report that your message below came to my inbox, and Deedle's did not.  I went <br/>
to the group page to find out if I missed any other messages.  I have "receive all mail" as <br/>
my setting, but they don't all come in sequence.  I might change my settings to digest, but <br/>
I don't know if that will solve the problem.<br/>

&gt; Great TOTW!  My 2006 LB goals are three-fold...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First... to be more organized and keep better tabs on the boxes I <br/>
&gt; have planted, and possibly retire a few to make way for new ones.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Second, as far as new boxes...  to plant as many of these complete <br/>
&gt; and finished boxes I have sitting here as I can, BEFORE starting on <br/>
&gt; new projects.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Third...  to make at least one LB trip to the east side of the state <br/>
&gt; this year.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know we're all busy with the holidays so quickly<br/>
&gt; &gt; approaching and compiling our Bingo cards in time, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; since I don't believe we have a current topic of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; week going, speedsquare's comment made me think,<br/>
&gt; &gt; "Hmmm, I wonder, does anyone else have any<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox-related new year resolutions to share?"  Or<br/>
&gt; &gt; not so much resolutions, as plans for the new year<br/>
&gt; &gt; concerning letterboxing?<br/>
