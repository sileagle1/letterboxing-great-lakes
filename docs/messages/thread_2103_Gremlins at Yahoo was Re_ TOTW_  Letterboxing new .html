I want to report that your message below came to my inbox, and Deedle's did not.  I went <br>
to the group page to find out if I missed any other messages.  I have "receive all mail" as <br>
my setting, but they don't all come in sequence.  I might change my settings to digest, but <br>
I don't know if that will solve the problem.<br>
