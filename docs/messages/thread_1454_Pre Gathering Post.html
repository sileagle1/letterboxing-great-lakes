<br>
Someone in an earlier message said that this was their first gathering <br>
and they were kind of concerned about not knowing what is going onThis <br>
will be our's first as well.. but from all the posts I have read I <br>
think all the veterans will hold the hands of all the newbies.and just <br>
remember.. there is a gathering in the fall.. where we will not be the <br>
newbies anymore<br>
<br>
Anyways, I know that Linda, Stormy and I so look forward to the <br>
gathering. Will be fun to chat and get to know people we only know by <br>
screen names<br>
<br>
We are going to be getting there around 7:30 am.. so hope to see <br>
everyone there<br>
