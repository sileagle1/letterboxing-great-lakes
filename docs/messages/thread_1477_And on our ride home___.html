                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just thought I'd share a quick recap of the box<br>
hunting we did on our ride back to Cleveland on<br>
Sunday.  After we found a few more boxes at Hudson<br>
Mills, we grabbed lunch and went to Hidden Lake Garden<br>
to find the Big Rooster.  And per the Letterboxer's<br>
Law, when we got to the parking lot, there was another<br>
van there (they didn't look like fellow letterboxers,<br>
though).  We pulled out the camera and went over to<br>
the tree to take some photos in that "really neat<br>
looking tree" while we waited for them to leave.  <br>
<br>
Then we travelled to find the Lake Erie Creature. <br>
Reading the clues on the way there, I saw the line<br>
"Pass the turtle crossing sign.  Pass the snake<br>
crossing sign."  I looked at Deedle.  "Snake crossing?<br>
 Do they mean a Slippery When Wet sign?"  Nope, they<br>
meant a snake crossing sign, and I'm like, completely<br>
paranoid of snakes, esp. reading warnings about the<br>
Michigan Massasauga Rattlesnake all weekend long.  And<br>
that morning, in Hudson Mills, I saw not a<br>
rattlesnake, but a garter snake or something like it<br>
(thin body, black with a green or yellow stripe) when<br>
I went to look where I heard rustling along the path<br>
as we walked.  I think I handled myself very well, I<br>
didn't scream, I didn't jump into Deedle's arms and<br>
make him carry me the rest of the way.  But he did get<br>
to retrive all the rest of the letterboxes that day.  <br>
<br>
But back to the Lake Erie Monster...looking over the<br>
clues, it was a short walk, on a paved path, no reason<br>
we should actually come across any snakes, right? <br>
Until we got to the part where the box was actually<br>
hidden, and we'd have to walk off the path.  Of course<br>
_I_ was not going.  So we studied the best path to<br>
take to the hiding place, and once the coast was<br>
clear, my brave Deedle, going all Army-Comando style,<br>
grabbed his walking stick in both hands, and ran to<br>
the hiding spot, causing a great russle in the<br>
foliage.  He figured that if he made enough movement<br>
and noise any snake would high tail it out of there. <br>
He checked the spot, grabbed the box, and then ran<br>
back to the path the same way.  Oh, the things he'll<br>
do for me!  He also had a snake-less return trip when<br>
he replaced the box to its hiding spot.  And thus<br>
ended our weekend as we headed back home to the<br>
promise of Chinese for dinner for his efforts :)<br>
<br>
Next weekend we're doing some letterboxing in the Port<br>
Clinton area.  I'm not entirely sure how many boxes we<br>
found this weekend that will be added to our F count<br>
(since we need to sort through which stamps were<br>
exchanges, which were from the circus), but I think we<br>
may just hit F 100 next weekend.  We shall see...<br>
