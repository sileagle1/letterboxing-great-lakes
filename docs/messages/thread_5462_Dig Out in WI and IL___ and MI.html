the holiday break a day early (not back until Jan. 5)!  We haven't<br>
even started digging out as it is still coming down heavy.  We've<br>
gotten several inches already, but fortunately the ice and thundersnow<br>
is staying south of us.  They say it should taper off by mid-afternoon.<br>

Hopefully the mailman will be able to make it to my door with those<br>
Bingo packages!<br>
