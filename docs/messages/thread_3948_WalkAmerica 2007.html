<br>
We hope that all of you and your families are doing well.  For those <br>
of you who celebrate, we hope that you had a very enjoyable Easter; <br>
for everyone, we hope that you are enjoying your Spring (if you can <br>
call it that with the weather we've been having) so far.<br>
<br>
We are writing this to bring your awareness to a very noble cause, <br>
The March of Dimes.  We are participating this year in the March of <br>
Dimes' WalkAmerica even on April 29, 2007.  This is a 3.1 mile walk <br>
that is taking place in Busse Woods, in Schaumburg, Illinois.  We <br>
have a goal to raise $500 as a team and are getting very close to <br>
reaching that goal, we would be ecstatic if we could even go beyond <br>
our goal.  Every dollar raised goes towards the well-being of <br>
babies.  THIS IS A WALK TO SAVE BABIES!!  The March of Dimes uses <br>
this money to fund research in the prevention of premature birth and <br>
the progression of treatment for babies born with birth defects, like <br>
our Joseph was.  We are doing our best to help raise money so that no <br>
family has to endure what we did.  If we can even help one family, <br>
this will all be worth it.  Please help us to achieve our goal, even <br>
if you can only donate $1.00, donate something.<br>
<br>
You can donate by visiting our blog and clicking on the link to our <br>
pledge page.  If you have a chance, look in our March archive for the <br>
blog entry about WalkAmerica for more info.<br>

<br>
Just reporting in about our WalkAmerica 2007 event that happened this <br>
past Sunday.  We had the most PERFECT day!  We couldn't have asked for <br>
better weather, and we all had a ton of fun.  We blew our goal of $500 <br>
out of the water by raising $1731.55.  Woo-Hoo!<br>
<br>
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to those of you who donated.  A couple <br>
of you have asked if we are still taking donations, and the answer is, <br>
yes.  It is not too late to make a donation if you are so inclined.<br>
<br>
There are more details of our day and TONS of pictures on our blog site.<br>
