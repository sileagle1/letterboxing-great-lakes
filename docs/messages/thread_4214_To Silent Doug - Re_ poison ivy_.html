I'm an outdoor education trainer for the Girl Scouts.  After viewing all those photos, (I must have a strong stomach), I've decided to print out some of those photos and use them as visual illustrations in my training binder.  Sometimes one photo is worth a 1000 words! <br>
<br>
This also has put an end to my days of hiking around in flip flops.  Yes, I admit it, I have been known to go hunting for a letterbox when the opportunity presents itself with a total disregard to proper foot wear.  I promise myself to stay on the trails, but I gamble when I tip toe off the trail to find that letterbox.  No more!  These photos have cured my curiosity to hike in flip flops.  <br>

Poison Ivy isn't just a little rash that you can put some lotion on to avoid scratching.  Some of these variations look down right gross!  Maybe life threatening if some of the sores open up and become inflected.  <br>

  I had the misfortune of getting a nasty case of poison ivy already <br>
  this year, last month.<br>
<br>
  Interestingly, the rash appeared just a few days after staying at <br>
  Poison Ivy's home on a letterboxing road trip.<br>
<br>
  Coincidence? I have to wonder.....<br>
