Gathering in Door County.  He's asking for others to help with the <br/>
various aspects of planning this very special gathering.  Since I will <br/>
be on vacation in Door County in a few weeks, I have offered to do some <br/>
investigating as far as camping areas, fish boils, or whatever else the <br/>
group might be intersted in doing together. So let me hear your <br/>
thoughts and questions. Be sure to check the group's database for new <br/>
information about the gathering. Dragon has just added some new <br/>
information.  See you in October!<br/>
