Still not sure if Team Bindlestiff will make the Gathering, but we <br>

Truly, truly horrible.  Those who brought mosquito nets (no joke) actually had a leg up on the rest of us.<br>
 <br>
The food was great (whoever made that cheesecake/Cinnamon thing, thanks a lot.  The sheer deliciousness of that earned me a big old hour run today), and the boxes!  It was like the Easter egg hunt I took my daughter on, so many you didn't know where to start!  (The Gathering, was, however, missing those psycho parents who insisted on bowling little children over so their kids could get ALL the eggs- but I'm just bitter).<br>
 <br>
Everyone was super friendly, and as this was my first event, it was so amusing to match faces up with trailnames and stamps in books.  Honestly, it was such a friendly group that complete strangers became comrades in a short space of time.<br>
 <br>
Two K-marthas were there, along with a Marilyn stamp, a LBNW stamp, and so many GREAT "Cooler by the Lake (drake)" boxes.  It was nearly overwhelming!<br>
 <br>
But now, off to go scratch my mosquito bites and start carving more boxes!<br>
Cheers,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations to Tim and all of the others who contributed to a <br>
successful gathering this past weekend.<br>
Like others, I so enjoyed putting faces with names -- that was <br>
probably the highlight for me. Having read your posts or exchanged <br>
email with so many other Great Lakes Area letterboxers, I was excited <br>
about finally meeting you. The great variety of shared stories and <br>
skills nearly overshadowed the hunt for boxes at this event.<br>
And there *were* boxes aplenty!<br>
Among the boxes we did not find was one we were sure had been carried <br>
away by the infamous McHenry Area Giant Mosquitos.<br>
For those attending the event, we were the ones with the full-head <br>
mosquito-netting hoods. For those who did not attend the event, you <br>
might have wanted one. Like most apparel at Saturday's Gathering, <br>
these were not fashion statments.<br>
At one point on Saturday afternoon someone approaching the shelter <br>
from a foray into the woods said that the strong aroma of "Off" was <br>
wafting into the wild and that we seemed to be fumigating an entire <br>
area of the park, but not very effectively.<br>
To all who creatively carved great stamps for this event, Thank you.<br>
To all who labored to hide the boxes, Thank you.<br>
To all who came and shared your wit, your stories, your "show-and-<br>
tell" items, Thank you.<br>
And for those who couldn't make it to this event......I hear that a <br>
date is on the calendar for next year. We missed you this time.<br>
<br>
I hope to see you on the trail,<br>

will post the event on the LbGLK calander. I will also post updates <br>
come early spring. I hope this will give some carvers something to do <br>
in the long months of winter. If any carvers are interested in <br>
contributing their art work (in accordance with the theme) please <br>
contact me! Also if She Who Plants could round up some carvers for the <br>
event I would greatly appreciate it!! Azobox I would love to see what <br>
you could do with your magic carving knives!!! This is my fist attempt <br>
at hosting, so if a veteran co-host would like to join in on the fun <br>
that would be great. But if no one wants to thats ok too. I have time <br>
on my side to figure out the details. If Springchick could post <br>
the "rules" of hosting an event again or tell me the reference number <br>
to it I would thank ye kindly. Looking forward to seeing you <br>
Southeasterners, and any others out there.<br>

A suggestion of a location:<br>
Cross Winds Marsh is a place that has a very cool (screened and roofed) <br>
shelter.  It is in Wayne County - what is very interesting is that this <br>
wetlands is less than 10 years and was built to remediate the lose of <br>
wetlands when the addition to Detroit Metro was made.  I found it <br>
looking for a letterbox  by Mirkwood <br>
(http://www.ruthannzaroff.com/letterboxing/).  What I love about the <br>
place is there is hiking, water, canoeing and EAGLES are nesting <br>
there.  When I was there last August I saw one adult and two very large <br>
babies! Just a suggestion, I'll actually go anywhere in SE MI  I'm <br>
easy! http://www.waynecounty.com/parks/cwinds_park.htm  <br>

Hey Double Dragon!! It's so good to see you on the message board! A <br>
gathering on our side of the state??? How cool! We just have to go to <br>
that one! <br>
By the way.....for anyone reading this.....Double Dragon's "Red <br>
Dragon's Lair" series is so cool!!! Team Rabbit highly recommends <br>
this very creative and unique group of boxes!! :-)<br>

Flying Dragon, the dogs, and I had a wonderful time!  We had to go back on Sunday, but we managed to find every single box listed in the clue packet.  This weekend's haul was 42 boxes (including postal boxes), 2 event stamps, 32 exchanges, and 4 personal travellers.  All of us were "dog tired" by the end of the day Sunday.  In fact, when we got out of the car to go for the last box the dogs gave us a look that clearly said "you have GOT to be kidding, I thought we were done!"  When we figured it up last night, we logged a total of 14 miles (9 on Sat and 5 on Sun)...and boy are we feeling it!  About four blocks from home, it dawned on us...oh no!  our house has stairs!  <br>

We are from SE Wisconsin.  Been around for a few years, went crazy for <br>
the first year or so and then dwindled down.  Since my wife started up <br>
we've been going more often.<br>
