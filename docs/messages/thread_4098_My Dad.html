<br/>
I talked to my Dad tonight on the phone for about half an hour. For <br/>
those of you around a few months ago may remember some discussion of <br/>
his being a Vietnam Vet and how when he came home from the war he was <br/>
spat upon. He wrote me a few years ago (after I sent him an Email <br/>
with about 50 questions all about his service) that before getting <br/>
back to the states he thought he was a hero and he soon learned that <br/>
he wasn't a hero at all.<br/>
<br/>
He was in the navy and never saw any combat, he worked on airplanes <br/>
and was in the service 4 years and 3 months during the war.<br/>
<br/>
In an off post Email I got from Trailtracker she wrote, "please thank <br/>
your dad for me for serving!!!! ESPECIALLY since he is a Vietnam Vet!"<br/>
<br/>
I cut and pasted that and Emailed it to my father. He told me over <br/>
the phone he wasn't sure what to make of the sentance and then <br/>
he "got it."<br/>
<br/>
He told me that I was only the second person (in over 30 years!!!) to <br/>
actually say "thank you" to him for serving. He told me that the <br/>
first person was in a recovery group he was in, I was the second and <br/>
Trailtracker you are the 3rd person ever to thank him.<br/>
<br/>
He told me that my mom never thanked him because she was so against <br/>
the war (they met while he was in the service).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Trailtracker for making my dad feel special.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to post this to the group to see if there was anything else <br/>
we could do to "Thank" those that served in Vietnam -- not just my <br/>
dad, but all Vietnam Vets.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Mr. Doglvrs and I have taken great pains to instill<br/>
pride and respect in our children for our country our<br/>
flag and especially our veterans.  We make sure they<br/>
show proper respect during the singing of our national<br/>
anthem, and they are always the first to pop up and<br/>
clap when our flag and our local veterans pass by in<br/>
any parade.  <br/>
<br/>
Recently, our local oldies radio station held a<br/>
collection for the Grand Rapids home for Veterans --<br/>
they were collecting personal items...things as simple<br/>
as toothpaste, hair brushes, and even underwear.  It<br/>
breaks my heart to think that men and women who have<br/>
served our country and given much of their own lives<br/>
so that we might live free as we do each day are in<br/>
need of the simplest of things.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I propose -- and Hx6 we can work together<br/>
on this if you like....since you folks are also<br/>
camping...why don't we hold our own collection drive? <br/>
(personal items, personal thank you cards)  The<br/>
reward?  Other than pride in giving back to those who<br/>
have given so much...a letterbox of course!<br/>

<br/>
I'm on my way out the door to finish up planting letterboxes for the <br/>
Columbus Cluez Great Lakes Event and had promised myself I was not going <br/>
to check email or any letterboxing website before I left---but I'm glad <br/>
I did--- seeing these two posts. <br/>
<br/>
Hartx6, my heart breaks too when I hear that so very few have thanked <br/>
your dad for serving.  When I was the GM of The Container Store in <br/>
Columbus, I had my entire staff alert me any time someone serving was in <br/>
our store so I could thank them---again, especially if it was someone <br/>
who had a hat or something on that said Vietnam. This is something I <br/>
have always done but when I saw that Vietnam Vets finally became brave <br/>
enough to wear something that identified themselves AS a Vietnam Vet, I <br/>
wanted to be extra sure to show my support and thank them for doing so. <br/>
This is because them doing that, provided me with that opportunity I <br/>
might not otherwise have.  It broke my heart during that war when our <br/>
soldiers got spat on and were treated with disrespect but when it <br/>
happened to my own son within hours of coming home from his first <br/>
deployment to Iraq, it kicked up more emotions than I thought possible <br/>
inside one body.  I thought we had learned our lesson back then and it <br/>
never occured to anyone would ever have to go through what these Vets <br/>
went through.<br/>
<br/>
I will say it again.  Thank you Hartx6's dad for serving our country.  <br/>
Thank you for doing so without concern to self and in spite of the <br/>
"apparent" lack of support.  I still believe there are FAR more who <br/>
supported our Vietnam Vets than those who spoke out without the least <br/>
bit of consideration who did not.  The firestorm that occured on The <br/>
View this week (not going to even NAME her NAME on this post) made me <br/>
physically sick, but I do try to remember that most who make comments <br/>
like that do not have anyone who has served.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Doglvrs, I think your idea is wonderful!!!  If it would help, I can <br/>
make sure we have a drop off box at the event!  (R-gang did the same <br/>
thing for me and my PT Postcards for the 82nd Airborne at Dr. Watson and <br/>
Van Man's recent schoolhouse event for Easter goodies to send to <br/>
Afghanistan.)  It was heartwarming to see how generous everyone was and <br/>
most importantly---the soldiers in my son's platoon couldn't have been <br/>
more appreciative!<br/>
<br/>
Hartx6, I'm so glad to hear that my thank you made a difference and I'm <br/>
glad your dad understood why I said it the way I did.  I'm very grateful <br/>
to know that.  Tell him to get ready though, because he may just become <br/>
overwhelmed with the thanks I have faith he will receive with Mrs. <br/>
Doglvrs idea!!!<br/>
<br/>
Later this weekend, I will email you off post.  I have a couple of other <br/>
ideas!<br/>
<br/>
Oh!!!  BTW...your dad is DEFINITELY a hero!!!  Just because your dad did <br/>
not see combat does NOT mean he is not a hero---the point is he was <br/>
willing.  Ask any soldier who is or was a combat soldier and they will <br/>
be the first to tell you that!  Please do not "misinterpret" the value <br/>
of your dad's contribution.  It takes a TON of support for these <br/>
soldiers to be able to be on the front line.  If anyone has ever read <br/>
comments from those who pack other soldiers' parachutes---you know what <br/>
I mean.  A good friend of mine, after 23 years of service in the Army <br/>
and being part of the first deployment to Iraq, went back recently as a <br/>
civilian contract laborer---to diffuse bombs?!  Not even 2 weeks later, <br/>
one of his buddies got killed right beside my friend as they got <br/>
ambushed on their way back from diffusing 32 bombs south of Baghdad in <br/>
one night.  Now my friend is going to be a mechanic over there making <br/>
sure the military vehicles don't break down.  The effort of everyone <br/>
counts--including those doing the laundry for our troops.  It counts <br/>
when someone takes time to write a letter or send a postcard too!<br/>
<br/>
Warm hugs and handshakes to all vets out there this weekend and always!<br/>

force base; my neighbors were mostly those in the air force who <br/>
lived off base.  There were rallies and protests in the park around <br/>
the corner...it was such a mess!<br/>
<br/>
I wore a POW bracelet in about the 5th/6th grades and remember <br/>
getting snide comments from older teenagers/adults about wearing a <br/>
bracelet and how it showed that I supported everything that is wrong <br/>
with our society but I also remember at that tender age having the <br/>
presence of mind to say that I thought it showed support for the <br/>
person whose name was on it and that I was sorry that anyone <br/>
anywhere at anytime had to be a prisoner of war or that war even <br/>
existed.<br/>
<br/>
Lt. Williams (my bracelet's name) was one of the lucky (I'm not sure <br/>
that's accurate) ones who returned home and actually wrote me a <br/>
letter (it was a form-type letter that went to all of those who wore <br/>
his bracelet) and I had no idea what to say to him in response.  I <br/>
sent him the bracelet and said that I was glad he made it back home <br/>
to his family.  I don't think I said thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I lost my first love/crush (I'll never really know) a few years <br/>
later when the war was allegedly over, he was sent as "support" <br/>
right after High School graduation (he was a few years older than <br/>
me), I never had a chance to thank him but I'll never forget his <br/>
smile.  good night sweet prince<br/>
<br/>
Please tell your father, I thank him!<br/>

Doglvrs &amp; Trailtracker,<br/>
<br/>
A couple things, I know my dad is a hero, I didn't mean to imply that due  to <br/>
the fact he didn't see active service that he wasn't. He did spend 10 days in <br/>
 Da Nang and he said it was the scariest 10 days of his life as he could hear <br/>
gun  fire and bombs going off. My wife has two uncles that served during the <br/>
war and  to this day they have never opened up and talked about it -- to <br/>
emotional I  guess.<br/>
<br/>
My grandfather served in WW2 and he doesn't consider himself a veteran, he  <br/>
was young and I asked him if he enlisted voluntarily and he said, "no, they <br/>
came  and got me." when he went into Boot camp the war was still going on and one <br/>
the  day (or week) he graduated boot camp the atom bomb was dropped and the <br/>
war was  over. They sent him to Japan to do "clean up work" and he was there <br/>
for about 9  months when his father had a stroke and the Red Cross brought him <br/>
home. Because  the war ended before he got out of boot camp he doesn't feel <br/>
like a veteran, I  begged to differ with him!!<br/>
<br/>
Doglvrs, you said that I was listed in the camp site? It can't be. We will  <br/>
be unable to make it to the gathering on June 2. I had contemplated it but with <br/>
 our drive out to Oregon on June 22 we just couldn't swing it time or money <br/>
wise.  I will send a care package to be donated, but alas we will not be there.<br/>
<br/>
My dad would appreciate any letters, post cards, etc. But he and my mom  both <br/>
have all the necessities they need. If we want to donate stuff to a  Veterans <br/>
Home in my Dad's name or in honor of him that would touch his  heart just as <br/>
much. Just an idea.<br/>

You're right -- sorry about that...I was thinking you<br/>

<br/>
Here then is what I propose -- I will create a<br/>
letterbox in your Dad's honor....&amp; honoring all<br/>
Vietnam Veterans.  Trail Tracker(I think), if you<br/>
could have a box available at the gathering and I will<br/>
have one available at the camp ground.  By donating<br/>
any personal items (ie:toothpaste, toothbrushes,<br/>
shampoo, bar soap, kleenex, deoderant, underwear,<br/>
socks) you may stamp into the letterbox.<br/>

I'm sure other VAMCs and CBOCs (Community Based Outpatient Centers) <br/>

(BTW, although the flyer I copied from specified men's clothing items, <br/>
we are of course seeing an ever-increasing number of female veterans of <br/>
all ages, so women's clothing and comfort items are also needed.)<br/>

This would be meaningful for me as well. My ggg-grandfather was a Civil War  <br/>
veteran and he lived and died in Grand Rapids. I had another  ggg-grandfather, <br/>
also a CW veteran who lived in the veterans homes in Milwaukee,  WI and <br/>
Knoxville, TN where he died. <br/>
<br/>
The Grand Rapids home would be fine by me.<br/>

<br/>
  I would love to have a copy of this stamp. My dad is also a Vietnam Vet and I grew up in a house where I learned at an early age not to even mention the war. To stand at the doorway of a room and yell in for him to wake up. NEVER to walk up to him and touch him while he was sleeping because you would get hit or end up with a hand around your throat. It wasn't until after I got married to an Army man. My dad is 100% Marine that he actually talked for even a minute about serving. 10 years later the moving wall went thru our town and I think he finally realized he wasn't the only man in our area living in his own personal he**.  It's now been another 4 years and he is finally in counseling and will even answer a few questions I have. <br/>
<br/>
  I personally can't help but tear up when I hear the National Anthem or Lee Greenwood's song because I think of all those that have served and the way so many of them have been treated. Every single person that serves in the military is vitally important. I thanked a man one time and ended up crying afterwards because I don't think beside myself my dad has heard it. Ok now you have me completely in tears lol <br/>
<br/>
  I still wonder if it wasn't for the Vietnam Vets coming out (as I remember it) during Desert Storm and publically saying that they will never allow any soldier to be treated as they were if that whole situation wouldn't have repeated itself again? <br/>
<br/>
  Well off in my own ramblings. Let me know about sending you the money.<br/>

<br/>
Hey Guys,<br/>
<br/>
I talked to my Dad tonight on the phone for about half an hour. For those of<br/>
you around a few months ago may remember some discussion of his being a<br/>
Vietnam Vet and how when he came home from the war he was spat upon. He<br/>
wrote me a few years ago (after I sent him an Email with about 50 questions<br/>
all about his service) that before getting back to the states he thought he<br/>
was a hero and he soon learned that he wasn't a hero at all.<br/>
<br/>
He was in the navy and never saw any combat, he worked on airplanes and was<br/>
in the service 4 years and 3 months during the war.<br/>
<br/>
In an off post Email I got from Trailtracker she wrote, "please thank your<br/>
dad for me for serving!!!! ESPECIALLY since he is a Vietnam Vet!"<br/>
<br/>
I cut and pasted that and Emailed it to my father. He told me over the phone<br/>
he wasn't sure what to make of the sentance and then he "got it."<br/>
<br/>
He told me that I was only the second person (in over 30 years!!!) to<br/>
actually say "thank you" to him for serving. He told me that the first<br/>
person was in a recovery group he was in, I was the second and Trailtracker<br/>
you are the 3rd person ever to thank him.<br/>
<br/>
He told me that my mom never thanked him because she was so against the war<br/>
(they met while he was in the service).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Trailtracker for making my dad feel special.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to post this to the group to see if there was anything else we<br/>
could do to "Thank" those that served in Vietnam -- not just my dad, but all<br/>
Vietnam Vets.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
