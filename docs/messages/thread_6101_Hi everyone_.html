I just wanted to introduce myself, I am new to this board but not so new to the letterboxing world :) I am the "mom" of the BootyBandits.  Our family loves to hunt treasures and we have been into this hobby for 2 years now, but we just officially carved and planted or first box last week.<br>
I learned about this group after attending Aurora's one flew over the letterbox event.  At that event I was able to meet some of you great people, and i enjoyed it soo much that I am dragging "Mr" and one of the little pirates to the west mi fall gathering, where I am very excited to meet lots more of you!!  I have seen a lot of talented work done while finding boxes (especially since about 80% of our boxes belong to the familyof6-wowsers i hope i can carve like that someday!), and can't wait to find many more!! <br>
Can't wait to finally put some more faces with names and meet you all....see ya on the trails :)<br>
