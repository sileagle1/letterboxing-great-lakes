                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was wondering if any one wanted to help with the<br>
carving for this event. I will need a total of 24<br>
stamps.<br>
If anyone feels like puting in some effort please let<br>
me know. I<br>
was at first not going to give out specifics about the<br>
game because I wanted it to be a surprise to all who<br>
plan on attending, but for the amount of boxes I need<br>
I think it would be best to spit it all out (but not every thing of <br>
course).<br>
<br>
Sense it is a fantasy theme I thought it would be<br>
interesting to make quests for letterboxing teams to<br>
complete. There will be 3 different quests with their<br>
own fantasy theme A, B, and C. Each quest will have a<br>
total of 8 boxes. Each quest (stamp carving) does not<br>
have to be completed by a single<br>
person if you guys would like to share a theme for a<br>
quest that would be great, so one person is not<br>
burdened with all 8 boxes. Theses are the stamps I<br>
require:<br>
<br>
Box 1)The Hereo<br>
     A)Wood Elf<br>
     B)Dwarf<br>
     C)Human Warior<br>
Box 2)A Wizard<br>
     A)good wizard<br>
     B)bad wizard<br>
     C)good wizard<br>
Box 3)Castle or King/Queen Figure<br>
     A)Human King/caslte good<br>
     B)Dwarf Kingdom/King good<br>
     C)Dark elf Kingdom/Queen evil<br>
Box 4)Magical object to be sought<br>
     A)Sward<br>
     B)Amulet<br>
     C)Bow and Arrow<br>
Box 5)Drgon's (see D&D books for different kinds)<br>
     A)Evil<br>
     B)Good<br>
     C)Evil<br>
Box 6)Evil Creatures<br>
     A)Chimera<br>
     B)Hydra<br>
     C)Demon type V (milti-armed female torso atop a<br>
       serpant body,<br>
       each arm holds a weapon.)<br>
Box 7)Good Creatures<br>
     A)Unicorn<br>
     B)Griffon<br>
     C)Sprite<br>
Box 8)Evil Places<br>
     A)Cave tunnel enterance<br>
     B)Labarynth<br>
     C)Dark foreboding forest<br>
<br>
Once I have all the characters to theses quests I can<br>
then put a story to the boxes. I hope you all got some<br>
carving blocks for x-mas. If you need any inspiration<br>
pick up a D&D book and check out the monster manuels!<br>
I am open to more sugestions if you have any. Please<br>
let me know if you would like to participate and what<br>
you would like to carve by FEB. 28th so I have enougth<br>
time to carve if no one wants to. I will repost (on this site) what<br>
is left on the list every time some one e-mails me<br>
what they want to carve. The stamps will be due by June 1st, please <br>
no later! As of know the Unicorn, and Sword are taken.<br>
<br>
Thanks <br>
