  Also on the group site, under Links, then Events & Gatherings, you can see information about several of the other gatherings in the area (past and future).<br>

  I thought there was a document somewhere that listed all past gatherings in one spot, but I can't seem to locate it just now.  Maybe someone else knows.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't know of anything that lists all past gatherings that have been held <br>
in the region.  If the host created a folder for info in the FILES section <br>
of the group or a link to a gathering web site in the LINKS (and left them <br>
there after their gathering), there is a record of past gatherings, but it <br>
is by no means a comprehensive collection.<br>
<br>
Other individuals may have a record of past gatherings on their personal web <br>
sites -- for instance, I list the gatherings I have previously attended and <br>
link to the gathering info (it is remains available) at my web site <br>
(http://www.stampinthebox.com/events.asp).  But again, that is limited to <br>
gatherings that I have personally planned/hosted or attended/planned to <br>
attend.<br>
<br>
I usually leave information on past gatherings that I have hosted available <br>
at my web site as a historical reference for anyone planning a future <br>
gathering, but I know a lot of others just delete the gathering web site <br>
once the event is passed.<br>
<br>
Gathering boxes are not always permanent, but those that are usually get <br>
listed at LbNA after the event so they are then available for anyone to <br>
find.<br>
