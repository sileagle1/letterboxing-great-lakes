Just to let you know, we now do have the facilities at my school from<br/>
NOON until 7 pm, so we have more daylight time that's not taken up by<br/>
the Packers game.  If you can't make it until later, that is not a<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
I also indicated on the webpage that there is a grocery store (Piggly<br/>
Wiggly) close to the school on the east side of Jackson on HWY 60 in<br/>
case you want to pick up something to bring for the pot luck, etc. on<br/>
the way.<br/>
<br/>
It has been suggested that I report what everyone is bringing for the<br/>
pot luck so we aren't "lucky" to have all desserts!  So, if you know<br/>
what you're bringing, drop me an email.  (I suppose the Christmas<br/>
Elves are bringing Christmas cookies again?  Or is it too early? :-) )<br/>
 We do have some chocolates coming that I know of...<br/>

  I noticed on the gathering webpage that Dragon mentioned our "Two<br/>
Forests" as a possible LB to look for prior the the gathering.  I<br/>
checked on it today and it's gone.  The old log it was in has been<br/>
torn asunder as well.  I don't think I could have replaced it in time<br/>
anyway.  Sorry.<br/>
