&gt;Great games, Spring Chick!  Thanks for running it for us!  And <br/>
&gt;thanks to azobox for the Re Ed is Swag game, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Although I complained much about it, this has been a lot of fun and <br/>
&gt;a great diversion for the winter months.  Hopefully, after the <br/>
&gt;mega-meet this June, I'll have a greater selection of words for next <br/>
&gt;years game if we play again.<br/>

I can't believe how "addicted" I got to checking on the word called <br/>
every morning. Even when I went to NC for 4 days, I still thought about <br/>
it every morning.  I also pushed harder on the gas peddle to get home to <br/>
see what had been called then!  I agree Doodle Bug---this was a great <br/>
winter diversion!  My thanks as well!<br/>
<br/>
So DB and Becky, my two words left were B (compass) and I (Dartmoor).  I <br/>
was able to use only 2 non-general terms so I thought I had a better <br/>
chance of getting one of the earlier wins, if any, and I actually did <br/>
not think I would come this close to the full card winner as I did--so <br/>
I'm a happy camper just the same! <br/>
<br/>
So?!  Were those the same words you had left also??  What about everyone <br/>
else??<br/>
