I can't believe how "addicted" I got to checking on the word called <br>
every morning. Even when I went to NC for 4 days, I still thought about <br>
it every morning.  I also pushed harder on the gas peddle to get home to <br>
see what had been called then!  I agree Doodle Bug---this was a great <br>
winter diversion!  My thanks as well!<br>
<br>
So DB and Becky, my two words left were B (compass) and I (Dartmoor).  I <br>
was able to use only 2 non-general terms so I thought I had a better <br>
chance of getting one of the earlier wins, if any, and I actually did <br>
not think I would come this close to the full card winner as I did--so <br>
I'm a happy camper just the same! <br>
<br>
So?!  Were those the same words you had left also??  What about everyone <br>
else??<br>

It was compass and Dartmoor for mine and Laney Bug's too! Too funny. <br>
It probably would have been a 20 way tie! :o) Got to meet more boxers <br>
this year and visit some far flung boxes.<br>
