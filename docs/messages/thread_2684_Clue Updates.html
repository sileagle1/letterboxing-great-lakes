replanted this morning. <br/>
<br/>
"A Puppus Among Us" has been replanted in a slightly different <br/>
location.  I have also updated the clues to include a short-cut from <br/>
one of my Adult Swim boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
"Adult Swim Series: Futurama" has also been replanted in an entirely <br/>
new location.  Still in Romeoville (IL), but in a different set of <br/>
woods.  All of my Adult Swim boxes are now active again so get on out <br/>
there and find 'em.  And don't forget there is a PLB for those who get <br/>
all 6 (see clues for details).  <br/>
<br/>
I was also planning on replanted the "Catapulted Cow" today, but the <br/>
weather didn't want to cooperate.  Hopefully I will be able to get it <br/>
planted next Sunday.  I'll keep ya posted!   <br/>
