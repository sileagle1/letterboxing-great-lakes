"secret" kind of thing.  However we don't want them to lie, so we have said<br>
that it is OK to say we are doing a scavenger hunt, which it is - clues to<br>
find something.  We often do not want to explain letterboxing for various<br>
reasons if we do not know the person.<br>
<br>
Like many of the rest of you, we have rarely actually been asked outright<br>
what we are doing.  However many people must be wondering just WHAT were<br>
those two middle-aged adults were doing with rubber stamps & markers in the<br>
middle of the park/woods/trail?!?!?  Although most people pretend to ignore<br>
us, we have gotten comments like "Looks like you're having fun! or Looks<br>
like quite a project!".  We simply answer "YES!"  We did once say we were<br>
"looking for a pen we dropped from the deck" when an official police type<br>
person appeared from nowhere on a trail in Florida.  However we didn't need<br>
to worry about setting a bad example because we were boxing with my mom<br>
instead of our nieces & nephews!<br>

I think we strech the truth a bit because it is just easier than<br>
going through the whole "LB" spiel. I don't know what your<br>
experiences have been like tring to tell someone about LBing, but<br>
most people look at me like I'm nuts! I love it when you say "you<br>
find the box and stamp their stamp in your log book and vise versa."<br>
and they say "and then what, do you get some prize or something"<br>
then you say "no that's it" and they say "ahh, ok... hmmmm... good<br>
luck with that". I guess I'm just a secretive kinda gal, it adds to<br>
the romance of the game for me. Like being part of a secret club.<br>
