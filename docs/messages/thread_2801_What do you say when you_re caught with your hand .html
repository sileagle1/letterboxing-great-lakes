"secret" kind of thing.  However we don't want them to lie, so we have said<br/>
that it is OK to say we are doing a scavenger hunt, which it is - clues to<br/>
find something.  We often do not want to explain letterboxing for various<br/>
reasons if we do not know the person.<br/>
<br/>
Like many of the rest of you, we have rarely actually been asked outright<br/>
what we are doing.  However many people must be wondering just WHAT were<br/>
those two middle-aged adults were doing with rubber stamps &amp; markers in the<br/>
middle of the park/woods/trail?!?!?  Although most people pretend to ignore<br/>
us, we have gotten comments like "Looks like you're having fun! or Looks<br/>
like quite a project!".  We simply answer "YES!"  We did once say we were<br/>
"looking for a pen we dropped from the deck" when an official police type<br/>
person appeared from nowhere on a trail in Florida.  However we didn't need<br/>
to worry about setting a bad example because we were boxing with my mom<br/>
instead of our nieces &amp; nephews!<br/>

I think we strech the truth a bit because it is just easier than<br/>
going through the whole "LB" spiel. I don't know what your<br/>
experiences have been like tring to tell someone about LBing, but<br/>
most people look at me like I'm nuts! I love it when you say "you<br/>
find the box and stamp their stamp in your log book and vise versa."<br/>
and they say "and then what, do you get some prize or something"<br/>
then you say "no that's it" and they say "ahh, ok... hmmmm... good<br/>
luck with that". I guess I'm just a secretive kinda gal, it adds to<br/>
the romance of the game for me. Like being part of a secret club.<br/>

&gt; I've never been "caught in the act" by anyone, but if<br/>
&gt; someone asked me I wouldn't lie to them. I'd tell them<br/>
&gt; exactly what I was doing and even show them some of my<br/>
&gt; stamps. Lying is just plain wrong. I wouldn't however<br/>
&gt; let them watch me re-hide the box, of find it, but<br/>
&gt; once everything is out in the open and I'm ready to<br/>
&gt; stamp in it seems childish to try pretend you're doing<br/>
&gt; something else. What is everyone afraid of ? No one is<br/>
&gt; going to call the cops on you for writing in a logbook<br/>
&gt; and stamping. If the person you've shared the<br/>
&gt; aforementioned info with decides to take the box or<br/>
&gt; works for the park service or something, OH WELL.<br/>
&gt; That's part of the risk of hiding a box, isn't it ? It<br/>
&gt; might last 2 weeks, it might last 10 years, who knows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm not trying to pass judgement on any of you so<br/>
&gt; please don't take this post the wrong way, but<br/>
&gt; seriously, we're all adults here. DON'T LIE, ABOUT<br/>
&gt; ANYTHING! What if your children are with ? Would you<br/>
&gt; lie then ? What would that teach them ?<br/>

&gt; &gt; We got caught yesterday on our first trek. Some<br/>
&gt; &gt; utility workers<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought I was having car trouble. I just told them<br/>
&gt; &gt; we were on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; scavenger hunt and would be out of there in a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; of minutes. A<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend went today and the box was still there, so it<br/>
&gt; &gt; worked!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Why "lie" about it anyway? You might get someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; else hooked if you<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell them what you're really doing.<br/>
