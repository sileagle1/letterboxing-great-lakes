think it just depends on what you're trying to do with it.  My first sig<br/>

Granted, I have used the SpeedyCut stuff mostly for either limited use<br/>
carvings or those which are going postal, so that they will endure less<br/>
weather-related stress.  I've had none go bad on me.  Whatever works for you<br/>
is the best stuff to use!<br/>

I use white Speedy Cut and I love it!  Admittedly the only other <br/>
<br/>
medium I have tried is MasterCarve... but I like Speedy Cut a lot <br/>
<br/>
better.  The infamous Speedy Cut "white stuff" is what they carry at <br/>
<br/>
my local hobby store.  I made my personal stamper (Mk II -- Mk I was <br/>
<br/>
made with MasterCarve and I later decided it wasn't "good enough" so I <br/>
<br/>
did it over) with it.  I was surprised to discover everyone hates <br/>
<br/>
Speedy Cut.  My suspicion is that I'm just not a good enough carver to <br/>
<br/>
know when I'm using bad media!<br/>
