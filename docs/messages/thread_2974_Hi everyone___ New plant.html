We planted a box today - its a very personal one, VERY near our <br>
home - and, our home is the 'theme' as well. We live in an old train <br>
station that has TONS of history - so.. we thought, what better idea <br>
than to plant a box where we can SEE people coming to it, and where <br>
they can learn a little something about the place we live! (Hint - <br>
check out our personal traveler hints before trying - in case we are <br>
home!!) Obviously, if we saw someone, we would pop out and say Hello!<br>
<br>
There are also other boxes in the area, so would make a <br>
nice 'social' find for someone coming up to do the others!<br>
<br>
I DID give it an F count to start... if Im sending people to my <br>
yard, I felt a little better about that! LOL If you don't use <br>
Atlasquest to log finds - just email me for the clues - I would be <br>
HAPPY to send them.<br>
<br>
BTW - I LOVE this stamp. VERY pleased.<br>

Hey, BTW - your clues mentioning the satellite view of the area<br>
brought something to mind.  Has anyone noticed Google has updated some<br>
of their satellite imagery (they are still showing my house with a car<br>
I haven't had in years and a huge tree that's been gone a while).  But<br>
the wierdest thing is that they "defoliated" the trees that line the<br>
streets!  The trees in backyards and such are lush and green (and I do<br>
know I am looking at deciduous trees in my backyard), but those lining<br>
the streets look as barren as midwinter.  Must be to better locate the<br>
streets.  I know some in my neighborhood would be obscured otherwise.<br>

pool - is the cover on? Was it stained yet? Was the sunroom on the <br>
house? LMAO We have the most recent ones nailed down to April or May <br>
of this year - and we know we weren't home when they were taken. <br>
<br>
Too funny - I always laugh because we have a neighbor who feels the <br>
need to burn lawn waste EVERY nice breezy day - that is, when the <br>
breeze is coming towards our windows. In one of the Satellite pics, <br>
you can see her smoke cloud wafting over to our windows... UGH. But at <br>
least if it ever gets ugly - Ive got proof! (See? Our tax dollars are <br>
doing something?!) <br>

I love the geocachers statement... Geocaching: Using billion dollar <br>
satellites to hunt tupperware.<br>
