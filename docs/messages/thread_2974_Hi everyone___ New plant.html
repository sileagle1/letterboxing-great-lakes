station that has TONS of history - so.. we thought, what better idea <br/>
than to plant a box where we can SEE people coming to it, and where <br/>
they can learn a little something about the place we live! (Hint - <br/>
check out our personal traveler hints before trying - in case we are <br/>
home!!) Obviously, if we saw someone, we would pop out and say Hello!<br/>
<br/>
There are also other boxes in the area, so would make a <br/>
nice 'social' find for someone coming up to do the others!<br/>
<br/>
I DID give it an F count to start... if Im sending people to my <br/>
yard, I felt a little better about that! LOL If you don't use <br/>
Atlasquest to log finds - just email me for the clues - I would be <br/>
HAPPY to send them.<br/>

BTW - I LOVE this stamp. VERY pleased.<br/>

Hey, BTW - your clues mentioning the satellite view of the area<br/>
brought something to mind.  Has anyone noticed Google has updated some<br/>
of their satellite imagery (they are still showing my house with a car<br/>
I haven't had in years and a huge tree that's been gone a while).  But<br/>
the wierdest thing is that they "defoliated" the trees that line the<br/>
streets!  The trees in backyards and such are lush and green (and I do<br/>
know I am looking at deciduous trees in my backyard), but those lining<br/>
the streets look as barren as midwinter.  Must be to better locate the<br/>
streets.  I know some in my neighborhood would be obscured otherwise.<br/>

pool - is the cover on? Was it stained yet? Was the sunroom on the <br/>
house? LMAO We have the most recent ones nailed down to April or May <br/>
of this year - and we know we weren't home when they were taken. <br/>
<br/>
Too funny - I always laugh because we have a neighbor who feels the <br/>
need to burn lawn waste EVERY nice breezy day - that is, when the <br/>
breeze is coming towards our windows. In one of the Satellite pics, <br/>
you can see her smoke cloud wafting over to our windows... UGH. But at <br/>
least if it ever gets ugly - Ive got proof! (See? Our tax dollars are <br/>
doing something?!) <br/>

I love the geocachers statement... Geocaching: Using billion dollar <br/>
