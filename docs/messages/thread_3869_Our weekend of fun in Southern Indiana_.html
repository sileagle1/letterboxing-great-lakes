I thought I would report in on our first real letterboxing trip.  CMB  (my <br>
hubby of 20+ years) and I had to take our daughter to Merom for a retreat  <br>
weekend anyway and our son was out of town  on a school activity so we  planned a <br>
weekend away too.  We decided to see how many of the Evansville,  IN boxes we <br>
could find in a short amount of time.  This was so much fun  that I think CMB <br>
is now hooked and says he may have to rethink the name I  assigned him and come <br>
up with a signature stamp design of his own now.<br>
 <br>
We found 13 boxes on Sat. 3/17 and just one today, Sun. 3/18 since we were  <br>
in a hurry to get back to pick our kid up on time.  All finds have been  logged <br>
already too.  There were so many cool carved stamps and great hiding  places <br>
too.  We barely got about half of those in the general area so  already know <br>
we need to plan another trip to the area to get the rest...maybe  daughter will <br>
go there for summer camp too...hmmm...<br>
 <br>
After this weekend we feel we almost know dream a dream since we found 10  of <br>
her boxes, 3 by Toadfrog and one by TouchTrek.  We learned a lot  more about <br>
where to hide them, what to hide them in and how to write the  clues.  The <br>
trip has inspired up to put on our thinking caps and see what  box ideas we can <br>
come up with on our own.<br>
 <br>
We also went to Hobby Lobby in Evansville and got some MasterCarve to try  <br>
carving on and some other types of carving tools and stamp pads too.  I had  <br>
call a Hobby Lobby here in Indy asking if they carried supplies to carve your  <br>
own stamp and was told they didn't carry anything like that so either they don't <br>
 or the person I got on the phone is clueless. But that store lost a big sale <br>
 because they didn't know what they had or didn't have it.<br>
 <br>
I think I also have my niece who is a young single parent of 2 twin boys  (8) <br>
and a girl (almost 12) excited about trying out letterboxing too as it could  <br>
be a very rewarding and inexpensive way for them to have some family <br>
bonding/fun  time together.<br>
 <br>
We noticed a variety of box types and log book sizes and styles too.   Our <br>
personal stamps were barely small enough at about 2" square to fit into some  of <br>
the smaller boxes.  So we are wondering if some boxers have different  sized <br>
personal sig stamps to take this log book size issue into account since we  <br>
saw some logged in that were much bigger than ours and others that were very  <br>
small.  Many of the stamps in the boxes we found we not mounted at all and  we <br>
wondered how long those last or if they tend to crack or curl.<br>
Many stamps were wrapped in paper towels, then inside zip top bags and we  <br>
thought that was a great idea.<br>
 <br>
Also we are currently using a very small log book to stamp our finds into  <br>
that is barely 4 inches square.  Is there a recommended size on log books  or <br>
will any plain paper notebook work?<br>
 <br>
I know I have lots of questions, but until this weekend we didn't know  <br>
enough to ask any so I am making up for it now.<br>
 <br>
Thanks for all the help this group has given us so far.  We have felt  very <br>
welcomed and enjoyed our short time here so far.<br>

Congratulations, FlyGirl409<br>
You had quite an adventure and more importantly, you learned a great<br>
deal in the best possible way -- by experience.<br>
Despite all of the best intentioned questions and answers you might<br>
pursue here on the list, you learned by getting out there and seeking<br>
a few boxes. Nothing teaches clue-writing better than following<br>
someone else's. You saw a variety of stamps, boxes, and logbooks --<br>
far more illustrative that reading descriptions.<br>
Good luck in your next steps. You've got a great foundation upon which<br>
to build.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the interesting report - it sounds like you had a great <br>
day and that you are becoming as addicted as the rest of us!  It's <br>
nice to hear that both you & your spouse enjoy it - that means you'll <br>
probably be able to get out fairly often.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there will be lots of people answering your questions, so <br>
you'll get lots of input.  Here's mine:<br>
<br>
We read a lot before we started letterboxing and therefore realized <br>
we should have fairly small signature stamps if we wanted to stamp in <br>
some of the smaller logbooks.  Ours are about 1.5" x 1.5" or so.  <br>
However I have seen other people with various sizes of the same <br>
image.  We don't want to carry a bunch of stamps (need the space in <br>
our pack for all those colored markers and ink pads!), so we just use <br>
our original small size stamp for everything.<br>
<br>
We prefer finding stamps that are unmounted since we can usually get <br>
a better image from them.  Many times we have encountered stamps with <br>
wood backings that have warped and we get a poor image.  We have <br>
learned that on wood backed stamps we may need to press from <br>
underneath the paper, and press the paper ONTO the stamp in order to <br>
get an impression.  However it still isn't as sharp as if you pressed <br>
down on the stamp from above on an unwarped surface (we tend to get <br>
some paper movement with this technique, causing some <br>
ghosting/shadowing, but it is still better than missing entire <br>
sections of a stamp because the wood has warped and pulled a section <br>
up).  This is especially a problem on larger stamps. We've also seen <br>
a variety of other mounting material, but truthfully we are happiest <br>
(have the best stamping results) if the stamp is not mounted at all. <br>
We've found over 2,000 boxes and I think we've only come across 2 or <br>
3 stamps that had cracked/broken for some reason.  <br>
<br>
I'd recommend at least a 5"x7" logbook, or perhaps a 6"x8", based on <br>
the size of some of the stamps we have found over the past 3.5 <br>
years.  It's best to have something with heavier smooth paper so the <br>
ink does not bleed through and you get a nice image.  We made the <br>
mistake initially of getting logbooks with textured paper.<br>
<br>
<br>
No boxing for us this weekend, but we've got big plans for NEXT <br>
weekend...<br>
