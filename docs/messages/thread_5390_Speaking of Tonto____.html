last month at the WI-10 gathering, I bought myself one of those <br/>
medallions they were selling at the park office.  (I'm polyurethaning <br/>
it today, and it's going to look great when I'm done.)  Anyway, I was <br/>
checking the website of the company that makes the medallions, but <br/>
unfortunately there aren't too many that would be appropriate for my <br/>
needs.  But I did find this one...<br/>

 Oh Fair Fungus One!...Don't think for a minute that T&amp;T haven't been to that wonderful spot!  <br/>
One of our favorite letterboxing haunts...We downloaded a few pics in the file section to <br/>
prove it...But, the sad part is that Tonto left his beloved "Tonto" hat up at Lake Geneva this <br/>
summer on his birthday!  We'll just have to high-tail it back out to AZ to get another <br/>
one...along with one of those cool medallions!<br/>

Oh, dear Family of Many...I will have to contradict..I have heard that there is a fine place in CA  <br/>
called Tip Toe Falls (also Tiptoe Falls) it is a tiny 5-8 foot cascade (though most sources say <br/>
5 or 6 feet)  Very fitting for the exact size of the REAL Tiptoe...and Tonto.  <br/>
<br/>
This falls is located in Portola Redwoods State Park, California.   They claim it is on either Fall <br/>
Creek or Mill Creek, however, no one knows for sure. (Again, the similarity is amazing as we <br/>
usually have no idea where we are either!)  Nevertheless, it is located on a tributary of <br/>
Pescadero Creek and can be reached by the Iverson Trail, which is accessed by the visitor <br/>
center.<br/>
<br/>
Also stated in the description is that, "There are banana slugs and wild turkeys on the trail."  <br/>
<br/>
With that description, no one can refute that the REAL Tiptoe &amp; Tonto are adequately <br/>
memorialized at this little known spot regarding their letterboxing trail behavior!<br/>

The Real Tiptoe<br/>
