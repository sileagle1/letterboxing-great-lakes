                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are "remedial letterboxers" - We've been letterboxing since April <br>
2003 and have only F63!  We joined this message group at the advise of <br>
Dragon after signing up to attend the LbGLK event in MI.  He told us <br>
that that there would be lots of "WOM's"  We know that means "word of <br>
mouth's" but, we have no idea how to get them..or what to do with them <br>
once we get them...like I said....remedial!<br>
Any help would be appreciated...<br>
