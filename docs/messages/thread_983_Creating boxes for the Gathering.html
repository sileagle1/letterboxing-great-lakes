                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you want to contribute a box for the Gathering, you can do one of two things:<br/>
1. create a box based on the theme, "Mo' boxes in Motown"<br/>
2. create a box based on anything else<br/>
3. create a box based on nothing, but I'm not quite sure what that would look like<br/>
<br/>
As for hiding, you also have choices (isn't this sport great?)<br/>
1. send it to the organizers with enough time for them to plant and create clues<br/>
2. hide it yourself, creating your own clues to pass out (or keep secret) at the Gathering<br/>
<br/>
But it'll be a regular LB, unless, of course, you don't want it to be.  At the one Gathering I got to go to before I was ripped away from kith and kin (so this, of course, makes me an expert), there were all sorts of boxes.  Traditional, word of mouth, super secret boxes you could only get the clues to by knowing a secret trigger word, nighttime boxes, boxes that actually defied the time/space continuum and existed only in sub-space wormholes, etc. etc. <br/>
Closer to the date, I'm sure Team Rabbit will tell you where to send them if you want them to hide it.  And even if they tell you to, don't send it to me.  *grin*  'Course we COULD use more boxes down here.  <br/>

Sorry Del, there was such a box. Too bad you missed the one I planted there <br/>
last summer. I call it by the obvious name of Subspace Wormhole LB because <br/>
all my creativity went into identifying where and when it would open here in  <br/>
Illinois.  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, it's a small wormhole with an opening on the other end south of <br/>
the Mason-Dixon line.  You just have to figure out where and when it opens <br/>
down south.  And I promise you will understand the concept of subspace once <br/>
you find the letterbox.<br/>

Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
We've seen some posts already about sending event boxes for the <br/>
gathering (isn't it exciting?), and would like to ask anyone <br/>
interested to contact us personally at the above address for more <br/>
information...  or for ANY information...<br/>

Wow Delirium!  Three boxes planted already?!  I think a field-trip to <br/>
Olive Branch is in order!<br/>

&gt; Actually, we WOULD like to send a box or two for the <br/>
&gt; gathering...maybe one of our new Life Lessons From the Jukenbox LBs <br/>
&gt; would fit (check here to see what we're talking about <br/>
&gt; http://www.geocities.com/dasprite222/boxclues.htm#jukebox). Could <br/>
&gt; someone contact us off list with an address to send them to?<br/>
