                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last week I participated in a LB program at the Highland Twp. Library.<br>
The librarian is a beginning letterboxer, so she asked me to show my <br>
stamps and logbooks.  She had the kids make logbooks, and they <br>
brought their own stamps.<br>
It was a neat way for the kids to learn about the library and have <br>
fun.  Some of the kids were so into it.<br>
<br>
I attached an email I just got from her.<br>
Looks like it was a big success and she is interested in possibly <br>
having an event there!<br>
<br>

I wanted to thank you again for your help with the Letterboxing <br>
program!  We had SO MUCH positive feedback from both the kids and the <br>
parents that I think we will need to do another program sometime.<br>
 <br>
You mentioned that there are letterboxing events.  I wonder if we <br>
could arrange something here that would have a family friendly <br>
focus.  We could then possibly invite any interested patrons.  I am <br>
just thinking out loud...I have not talked to my supervisor to see if <br>
she would even allow such a thing.  However, we do have a great <br>
community room where the letterboxers could meet to talk and exchange <br>
ideas, etc.  We also have a nice outdoor space.  <br>
 <br>
I know you are possibly starting a new job so you may not be up for <br>
anything more.  If you are available though I would love to ask for <br>
your help with any future programs.  It was very kind of you to drive <br>
all the way here and good of your husband to babysit while we had the <br>
class.  The kids really enjoyed seeing your logbook and stamps and <br>
the stories of your adventures inspired both parents and children to <br>
give letterboxing a try!<br>
