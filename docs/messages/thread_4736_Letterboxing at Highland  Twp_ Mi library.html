The librarian is a beginning letterboxer, so she asked me to show my <br/>
stamps and logbooks.  She had the kids make logbooks, and they <br/>
brought their own stamps.<br/>
It was a neat way for the kids to learn about the library and have <br/>
fun.  Some of the kids were so into it.<br/>
<br/>
I attached an email I just got from her.<br/>
Looks like it was a big success and she is interested in possibly <br/>
having an event there!<br/>

I wanted to thank you again for your help with the Letterboxing <br/>
program!  We had SO MUCH positive feedback from both the kids and the <br/>
parents that I think we will need to do another program sometime.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that there are letterboxing events.  I wonder if we <br/>
could arrange something here that would have a family friendly <br/>
focus.  We could then possibly invite any interested patrons.  I am <br/>
just thinking out loud...I have not talked to my supervisor to see if <br/>
she would even allow such a thing.  However, we do have a great <br/>
community room where the letterboxers could meet to talk and exchange <br/>
ideas, etc.  We also have a nice outdoor space.  <br/>
<br/>
I know you are possibly starting a new job so you may not be up for <br/>
anything more.  If you are available though I would love to ask for <br/>
your help with any future programs.  It was very kind of you to drive <br/>
all the way here and good of your husband to babysit while we had the <br/>
class.  The kids really enjoyed seeing your logbook and stamps and <br/>
the stories of your adventures inspired both parents and children to <br/>
give letterboxing a try!<br/>
