                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone!  I want to start off my introducing myself.  My <br/>
trail name is Jigsaw and I am 30 years old.  I live in Milwaukee, <br/>
Wisconsin.  I stumbled across geocaching in a blurb in a random post <br/>
on some website I don't even remember where, well, after going to <br/>
the site and pricing GPS devices, I was like, yeah, thats gonna have <br/>
to wait.... too expensive at this time.  <br/>
<br/>
But then, I noticed a link about letterboxing.  Eventually after <br/>
much searching and reading, I really thought that it was something <br/>
that I would like and could possibly do... Well guess what?  It is <br/>
and I do!!<br/>
<br/>
I have only placed one box so far (The Mysterious Woman) with a few <br/>
more in the works.  I have found 30 boxes.  I have met The Christmas <br/>
Elves and Sophie &amp; Me (two separate occasions) on the trail.  They <br/>
are awesome!  I rescued The Lucky Leprechaun when he wasn't so <br/>
lucky.  I will be attending the Haunted Harvest Gathering in <br/>
October.  I have also been doing some Postal Letterboxes too.  This <br/>
hobby is so versitile and so fun.  And its good exercising without <br/>
even realizing it.  <br/>
<br/>
Me (of Sophie &amp; Me) made the comment... "Put a gun to my head and <br/>
tell me to walk 5 miles, and I would say 'Yeah right', but Put a box <br/>
out and tell me its 5 miles, and I'd do it twice!!"  I found that so <br/>
true.  Although I don't think I'd do the entire Cambridge Park <br/>
Series in one fell swoop again anytime soon.  LOL.<br/>
<br/>
And Ive done all this in only 2 months.  This hobby/sport keeps <br/>
getting better each day.  I am thouroughly obsessed!<br/>
<br/>
If there is anything that is happening that I may be intrested in <br/>
(gatherings, series, anything at all) please do not hesitate to drop <br/>
me a line and let me know about them.  Most likely, I will be <br/>
interested.  <br/>
<br/>
Until then,<br/>

 That's hilarious. This is exactly how I describe my eagerness to letterbox <br/>
and my hatred of just walking to J. I call it "walking with a point" ;P<br/>

This paragraph reminds me of a box Deedle &amp; I found in<br/>
Southern Ohio back in April of this year.  The clues<br/>
said it was an easy find.  We found the "start" of the<br/>
trail that we were supposed to find and began walking.<br/>
 After an hour or so of going up hills and down hills<br/>
and squeezing through muddy narrow parts of the trail,<br/>
we just kind of looked at each other going, "This is<br/>
an EASY find??"  We finally got almost back to the<br/>
start of the 5 mile trail (since it looped around a<br/>
lake) and the agonzing reality set in - it's an easy<br/>
find if you started at the OTHER end of the trail,<br/>
which we never saw from where we parked.  <br/>
<br/>
But yes, at least we got our exercise that day!<br/>
