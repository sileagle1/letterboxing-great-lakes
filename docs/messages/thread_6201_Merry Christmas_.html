<br/>
Here's a little verse I created a few years ago:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing Night Before Christmas<br/>
<br/>
(with apologies to Clement Clarke Moore)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the park<br/>
Not a creature was stirring, not even a lark.<br/>
The boxes were hid by the shelter with care,<br/>
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.<br/>
<br/>
The boxers were nestled all snug in their coats,<br/>
While clues for new boxes appeared in their notes. <br/>
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my hat,  <br/>
Had just settled our butts for a long boxing chat. <br/>
<br/>
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br/>
I sprang from the bench to see what was the matter.<br/>
Away to the meadow I flew like a flash,<br/>
Tore through the thistles and got a good gash.<br/>
<br/>
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br/>
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br/>
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br/>
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.<br/>
<br/>
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br/>
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.<br/>
More rapid than cooties his coursers they came,<br/>
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!<br/>
<br/>
"Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<br/>
On, Marvey! On, Stampeaze! on, Donner and Blitzen! <br/>
To the top of the rocks! to the top of the wall! <br/>
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"<br/>
<br/>
As boxers that tackle the cryptic clues sigh, <br/>
When they meet with an obstacle, never say die!<br/>
So along the faint path the coursers they flew,<br/>
With the sleigh full of stamps, and St Nicholas too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And then, in a twinkling, I heard to the east,<br/>
The prancing and pawing of each little beast.<br/>
As I checked the compass, and was turning around,<br/>
Down the footpath St Nicholas came with a bound.<br/>
<br/>
He was dressed in camo, from his head to his feet,<br/>
And his clothes were all filthy with burrs, sticks and Deet.<br/>
A bundle of stamps he had flung on his back,<br/>
And he looked like a hiker, just opening his pack.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br/>
His cheeks were like inkpads, his nose like a cherry!<br/>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br/>
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.<br/>
<br/>
The end of a marker held tight in his teeth,<br/>
And the ink it encircled his palm like a wreath.<br/>
He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br/>
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!<br/>
<br/>
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br/>
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br/>
The good carving stuff and a twist of his blade,<br/>
Soon gave me to know he had come to our aid.<br/>
<br/>
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br/>
And filled all the boxes, then turned with a jerk.<br/>
Then after stamping his sig stamp into the book,<br/>
He went back down the trail, with a careful last look. <br/>
<br/>
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br/>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br/>
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,<br/>
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br/>
&gt; Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br/>
&gt; When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br/>
&gt; But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br/>
&gt; I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.<br/>
&gt; More rapid than cooties his coursers they came,<br/>
&gt; And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<br/>
&gt; On, Marvey! On, Stampeaze! on, Donner and Blitzen! <br/>
&gt; To the top of the rocks! to the top of the wall! <br/>
&gt; Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As boxers that tackle the cryptic clues sigh, <br/>
&gt; When they meet with an obstacle, never say die!<br/>
&gt; So along the faint path the coursers they flew,<br/>
&gt; With the sleigh full of stamps, and St Nicholas too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And then, in a twinkling, I heard to the east,<br/>
&gt; The prancing and pawing of each little beast.<br/>
&gt; As I checked the compass, and was turning around,<br/>
&gt; Down the footpath St Nicholas came with a bound.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He was dressed in camo, from his head to his feet,<br/>
&gt; And his clothes were all filthy with burrs, sticks and Deet.<br/>
&gt; A bundle of stamps he had flung on his back,<br/>
&gt; And he looked like a hiker, just opening his pack.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br/>
&gt; His cheeks were like inkpads, his nose like a cherry!<br/>
&gt; His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br/>
&gt; And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The end of a marker held tight in his teeth,<br/>
&gt; And the ink it encircled his palm like a wreath.<br/>
&gt; He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br/>
&gt; That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br/>
&gt; And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br/>
&gt; The good carving stuff and a twist of his blade,<br/>
&gt; Soon gave me to know he had come to our aid.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br/>
&gt; And filled all the boxes, then turned with a jerk.<br/>
&gt; Then after stamping his sig stamp into the book,<br/>
&gt; He went back down the trail, with a careful last look. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br/>
&gt; And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br/>
&gt; But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,<br/>
&gt; "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"<br/>

We've posted clues for another box if you are able to take advantage of this unseasonable "warm" and snow-free weather:<br/>

No worries if you don't get to it soon.  It is a permanent box, so you can do 'Christmas in July' if you like to celebrate with mosquitoes. <br/>
