<br>
Here's a little verse I created a few years ago:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Letterboxing Night Before Christmas<br>
<br>
(with apologies to Clement Clarke Moore)<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the park<br>
Not a creature was stirring, not even a lark.<br>
The boxes were hid by the shelter with care,<br>
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there.<br>
<br>
The boxers were nestled all snug in their coats,<br>
While clues for new boxes appeared in their notes. <br>
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my hat,  <br>
Had just settled our butts for a long boxing chat. <br>
<br>
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
I sprang from the bench to see what was the matter.<br>
Away to the meadow I flew like a flash,<br>
Tore through the thistles and got a good gash.<br>
<br>
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br>
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.<br>
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.<br>
<br>
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br>
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.<br>
More rapid than cooties his coursers they came,<br>
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!<br>
<br>
"Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<br>
On, Marvey! On, Stampeaze! on, Donner and Blitzen! <br>
To the top of the rocks! to the top of the wall! <br>
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"<br>
<br>
As boxers that tackle the cryptic clues sigh, <br>
When they meet with an obstacle, never say die!<br>
So along the faint path the coursers they flew,<br>
With the sleigh full of stamps, and St Nicholas too.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
And then, in a twinkling, I heard to the east,<br>
The prancing and pawing of each little beast.<br>
As I checked the compass, and was turning around,<br>
Down the footpath St Nicholas came with a bound.<br>
<br>
He was dressed in camo, from his head to his feet,<br>
And his clothes were all filthy with burrs, sticks and Deet.<br>
A bundle of stamps he had flung on his back,<br>
And he looked like a hiker, just opening his pack.<br>
<br>
His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br>
His cheeks were like inkpads, his nose like a cherry!<br>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br>
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.<br>
<br>
The end of a marker held tight in his teeth,<br>
And the ink it encircled his palm like a wreath.<br>
He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br>
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!<br>
<br>
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br>
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!<br>
The good carving stuff and a twist of his blade,<br>
Soon gave me to know he had come to our aid.<br>
<br>
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
And filled all the boxes, then turned with a jerk.<br>
Then after stamping his sig stamp into the book,<br>
He went back down the trail, with a careful last look. <br>
<br>
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br>
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,<br>
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"<br>

No worries if you don't get to it soon.  It is a permanent box, so you can do 'Christmas in July' if you like to celebrate with mosquitoes. <br>
