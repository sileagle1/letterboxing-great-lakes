You guys are killing me! Here I am thinking, "Hurray! We will get to <br>
go to a Letterboxing event after spending last summer/early fall on <br>
bedrest, then having the baby.<br>
<br>
Then, I see the date! Argh! We are having the little guy's first <br>
birthday party on that date and my dad/wife are coming up to meet him <br>
for the first time (let's not go into why it took a year). So, we will <br>
be thinking of you while I am feeding a houseful of people and eating <br>
cake/ice cream, lol!<br>

Baby G's birthday party is on that day and we look to have around 20 <br>
people at our house (praying for warm weather so all the older children <br>
can play outside, lol - and of course for the letterboxing event).  Oh <br>
well.  However, that said, Mr. CatHerders has some ideas for boxes to <br>
plant out here.  There is a dearth of boxes in Muskego and a plethora of <br>
themes and places to put them, just based on the local history!  So, I <br>
have to get him some carving material.  I would contemplate it, but me <br>
and sharp objects to not get on well - so he gets to carve, lol!<br>
