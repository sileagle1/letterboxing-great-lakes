                    <div class="plaintext-content">The problem with finding books is that they are meant to be picked <br/>
up, so unless you get out to find one right away, it may get picked <br/>
up before you get to it.  One of the taglines talks about making the <br/>
whole world a library!  <br/>
The website is at bookcrossing.com - membership is free and they are <br/>
good about privacy issues.  Any messages are totally blind, so your <br/>
email is never exposed to anyone.  If you join you get sign up to get <br/>
email alerts for any books that are released into the wild for the <br/>
towns that you chose from your local area.  Or there is a Go Hunting <br/>
link on the sidebar that lets you see where books have been <br/>
released.  There is also something called an OBCZ - Official Book <br/>
Crossing Zone.  These are usually places like coffee shops that have <br/>
a bookcrossing shelf set up, those are usually kept stocked with a <br/>
variety of books.  <br/>

This is the link to the world maps of OBCZs, you can click into to <br/>
your area to see if there are any locally.  Other than that, just <br/>
keep an eye out for books roaming free in the wild.  Usually they'll <br/>
have a post-it or some note on them saying that they are a <br/>
bookcrossing book.  I've had books from Milwaukee go to Iraq, New <br/>
Zealand, Sweden, England amongst other places.  It's my other big <br/>
obsession besides letterboxing!<br/>
