If you are like us, you may have some friends or relatives that think your letterboxing hobby is a bit peculiar. Well today is your day to celebrate!<br>

Merriam-Webster describes peculiar as "different from the usual or normal; special, particular, odd, curious, eccentric." But no matter how you define it, being a little wacky or different makes a person stand out in the crowd. Whether it's the way we dress or quirky traits we possess, today is the perfect opportunity to embrace those qualities."<br>
