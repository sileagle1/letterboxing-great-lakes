                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have learned to take ALL our supplies along when checking on our boxes as we have found several HH.  We stamp them in our logbook and then leave them for the next person to move along.  We want others to have the joy of finding it on our box to make that box all the more memorable.  Also we are not necessarily planning on doing our own letterboxing in the near future and we don't want to leave it on our bag for too long.<br>
