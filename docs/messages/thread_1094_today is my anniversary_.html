Papillon and I are going back to MN next week.  I hope to go back to<br>
re-stamp in with my new one (those of you who may have seen it, at the time<br>
I hadn't carved one, but was using that stamp of my picture when I was a<br>
little girl).  I also want to place a commemorative box in the area.  I'm<br>
such a sentimental romantic!  (-:  Be on the lookout for [tentative title]<br>
