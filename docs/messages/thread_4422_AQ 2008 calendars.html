region are featured in the 2008 AQ calendars!<br/>
<br/>
Atom had a photo selected for the "silly" calendar for May.  It's a <br/>
photo he took last year over labor day weekend when we were camping in <br/>
southern Illinois -- the photo was taken in Mattoon, Illinois actually, <br/>
right near CMoon's box "The Green Wave." :)<br/>
<br/>
The Waltzing Pigs also had a photo selected, although it doesn't <br/>
represent the midwest. ;)  It is a beautiful shot from their recent trip <br/>
to Alaska, selected for December in the "original" calendar.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a link to the post on AQ, which has links to the calendars:<br/>

I also noted that a former Great Lakes area<br/>
letterboxer, The Gamecock, who we got to meet just<br/>
before she left our region a few years ago, had her<br/>
Eiffel Tower photo chosen for the silly calendar,<br/>
also.  <br/>

Congratulations to everyone who had an entry chosen!<br/>

I must give credit where credit is due.  My DH took the picture of Mt. <br/>
McKinley (that is in the calendar) while we were in Denali on our <br/>
summer vacation.  That picture is one of my favorites from our <br/>
vacation, so I sent it in.<br/>
