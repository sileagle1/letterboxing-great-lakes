OK, here's my opinion:<br/>
<br/>
The park is nearly 300 acres, with lots of trails.  Even though there were<br/>
80-100 letterboxers there on Saturday and many returned again on Sunday, we<br/>
really didn't run into many people at the box locations.  The boxes are<br/>
fairly spread out, although a few ended up pretty close.  I therefore think<br/>
it would be fine to leave all, or most of them there.  Perhaps those that<br/>
are really close could be relocated a bit.<br/>
<br/>
"I'd Rather Be Fishing"  (aka "Mr. Funguswoman) asked about the origin of<br/>
the name of the park on Saturday.  Here's what I found out:  The park was<br/>
named "Minooka" by an 8-year old girl who won a "name the park" contest. The<br/>
name means "maple forest" or "good earth" depending on which Native American<br/>
dialect is used for translation.<br/>
<br/>
Here is some other interesting info:  The park land was previously portions<br/>
of various farms and the largest parcel was owned by the HART family!  Were<br/>
these some relatives of yours hartx6??<br/>
<br/>
By the way, did anyone find the "Shards of Honor" box?   It has eluded us so<br/>
far..<br/>

We plan on posting our clues, most likely with some sort of story or intro.  My thought was to re-post them as traditional boxes, and close the event box after giving people a couple of weeks to log their finds.  So we have the clue packet, and will work from that to write our own clues to repost on letterboxing.org and AQ.<br/>
