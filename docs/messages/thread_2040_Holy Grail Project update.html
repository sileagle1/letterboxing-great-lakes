<br/>
Anyway, I've gotten around to checking my email and all and here's<br/>
where we stand...<br/>
<br/>
1) I'm in need of a voluteer to carve "The Bridge of Death" as the<br/>
person that signed up for it can't do it anymore.  Please contact me<br/>
off list if you're interested.<br/>
<br/>
2) I'd do the "Bridge" but I'm just trying to get out the three I need<br/>
to get out yet.  Hopefully they'll be in the mail this weekend as I<br/>
FINALLY HAVE TIME AGAIN!!!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
ahem, anyway....<br/>
<br/>
3) There seems to be a number of pariticpants that either haven't<br/>
emailed me the clues to the boxes they hid -or- they haven't hid them<br/>
yet because others are behind in carving like me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you wonderful people could help tie up these loose ends to<br/>
this project, it would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Due to circumstances beyond our control - we weren't going to make the<br/>
deadline for getting the boxes to those that needed them. So,<br/>
wonderful and kind Mrs DogLvrs put together the  boxes and made sure<br/>
the boxes were mailed to those that needed them to meet the deadline.<br/>
<br/>
Of the 9 boxes, three were to be placed by us ... uh ... well, you see<br/>
... this is where the breakdown has occured.<br/>
<br/>
Bindle Babe was off work for a month on medical leave, then there was<br/>
snow and hunting season ... yadda, yadda ... etc<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I'll own up to the fact that I have 3 boxes that are 100% ready<br/>
to go but have yet to be placed.  My bad.<br/>
<br/>
I have to see patients EVERY day until next Tuesday ... so, depending<br/>
on the weather and if I can find my orange vest, I'll try to get these<br/>
three boxes place next week.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.<br/>

You are all forgiven.  Remember I am the greatest sinner (5 boxes not<br/>
placed and 3 not carved) of you all!  As penence, I think we should<br/>
all just do 10 finds, 2 HH, 5 plants, and - oh, heck, let's just get<br/>
out and box! :-)<br/>
