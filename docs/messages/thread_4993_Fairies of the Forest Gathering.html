I agree!  Lots of fun!  Milagro and I missed out on seeing a lot of <br/>
people because we were going to do a "couple quick" boxes when we got <br/>
to the park in the morning, before we went to the shelter.    Turns <br/>
out they weren't so quick after all!  We only found 1 of the 3 we <br/>
looked for at the park and got to the shelter around <br/>
2:30!  Oops!  Pretty nice park, though!  Had fun at the event!  It <br/>
was nice to meet some new faces and see some old friends!  Sorry we <br/>
missed out on meeting several people, though!  We should have gone to <br/>
the shelter first!<br/>
<br/>
Congrats to JustHappy2CYa and doglvrs on winning the <br/>
drawings!  Thanks to Familyof6 for organizing a great event and to <br/>
SpringChick for the fun drawings!  It did motivate me to go plant a <br/>
box that DaleEndFarm gave to me to plant back in November!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, If anyone happened to find a red cooler toward the end of the <br/>
day, let me know.  We left it at the shelter and it was gone when we <br/>
got back.  We think someone probably grabbed it up thinking it was <br/>
left by mistake.<br/>

Your comments are very insightful and I'm glad you had a great time. I<br/>
now realize that some of the boxes were difficult and perhaps they<br/>
needed a bit more direction. Please chalk that up to inexperience with<br/>
doing an event. These boxes will remain in place (with the exception<br/>
of The Dryad) and I revised a few clues online to make the boxes a bit<br/>
easier to find. One of the big goals was to get people out onto the<br/>
beautiful trails that Bertha Brock offered, meet some friends, and<br/>
have fun. I think that was accomplished. <br/>
<br/>
As for the event stamp. This was a killer to carve and I'm not sure if<br/>
I'll ever do one like it again. In fact, it was practically an "I Spy"<br/>
type of stamp, with over 20 characters. Wicked. I am now in repenteance.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone. You guys were great. Sorry that I was not feeling<br/>
well on Saturday. I would have liked to had more time for meet and<br/>
greet, but my illness kept me at bay.<br/>

&gt; We too would like to give a shout of thanks out to Family of 6 for<br/>
hosting the event.  The <br/>
&gt; park couldn't have been better for the theme!  The time and detail<br/>
you put into this <br/>
&gt; gathering was very evident...Thanks for a great day!  And the event<br/>
stamp was incredible!  <br/>
&gt; We will never carve again the standard is now too high!<br/>
