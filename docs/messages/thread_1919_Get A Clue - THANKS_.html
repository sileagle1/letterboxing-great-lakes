chance on the weather and came out to Yankee Springs for the Get A <br>
Clue! Gathering on Saturday. It was a bit chilly in the morning, but <br>
it didn't take long for the sun to peek through and the chill to burn <br>
off. It is such a pleasure for me to see the planning come together <br>
and everyone having a great time acquainting, exchanging and sharing <br>
stories.<br>
<br>
You guys were all so busy playing the Clue Exchange game that you <br>
probably didn't step back just to observe -- what a riot! Everyone <br>
frantically collecting clues from the other "detectives" and <br>
secreting scouring the area for hidden clues laying around the "scene <br>
of the crime." Congratulations to the Four Clovers (Munchkin Stamper, <br>
Stampin' Pam, Scooter Lady and One-Cent Stamper), who were the first <br>
to successfully solve the crime, and also to Pale Puppy Posse and the <br>
AW half of Doglvrs who were the 2nd and 3rd place sleuthing teams. <br>
And the food -- WOW! What a wonderful selection and I simply must get <br>
the recipe for those Rice Krispie things from TJ_Mich.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed meeting each and every one of you whom I had not previously <br>
met, and of course seeing old friends again! What a great bunch of <br>
letterboxers!  I didn't get a chance to head out onto the trail <br>
myself so I will be back down within the next month or so to look for <br>
the Amazing Series and Cranky Things (and hopefully the Lucky <br>
HorseShoe). I also have some pictures from the event -- I will try to <br>
get them uploaded this evening.<br>
<br>
Many thanks to Azobox for all of his help and input putting this <br>
thing together and also to my OldShoe for being my backbone and <br>
helping to keep things running smoothly throughout the day.  You guys <br>
are the best!<br>
<br>
Looking forward to the next gathering... spring?<br>
