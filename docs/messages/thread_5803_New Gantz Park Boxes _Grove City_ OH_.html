Note to Central Ohio 'boxers:<br>
<br>
It looks like the 3 Gantz Park & Gardens boxes just listed today on Atlas Quest are either not placed or got nabbed immediately by park officials.<br>
<br>
I went out this morning at 7:30 to try to get the First Find and they were all 'missing' -- I'm guessing the latter as there was some evidence of traffic and disturbed cover where they should have been.  So if you were planning on going out to get them today, might want to wait.<br>
<br>
I'll try to put a note on AQ.  If anyone beat the officials to the boxes, let me know!<br>
<br>
Hope y'all are fixin to have a Happy Easter!<br>

Got a note back from the planter -- the boxes haven't been planted.  They will be planted today, so someone else will likely beat me to them. :-)<br>
<br>
Happy hunting!<br>
