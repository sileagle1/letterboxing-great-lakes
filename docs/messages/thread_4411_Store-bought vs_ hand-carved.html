                    <div class="plaintext-content">Blue Sky, I'm with you there . . . however, I'm seeing a lot of store-bought teddy-bear or butterfly type sig stamps and trail names of "pookybear" etc. and assuming it's due to the influx of new boxers with young children, brought on by good old "Family Fun" magazine.  Sometimes no stamps at all - just hand-printed names & ages.  At least most of them only use one page for the whole family to stamp in.  I can live with that.  We were all newbies once :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm glad someone else noticed this too. I haven't planted yet but <br>
starting with my second box (the first I was to excited to remember to <br>
look through the logbook) that most the boxers had store bought <br>
stamps. I also felt this was a let down I really wanted to see others <br>
art as well, even if it wasn't my own book. <br>
I was originally looking to have my personal stamp custom made but <br>
decided to carve on my own cause I wanted to get out there and start <br>
faster and since that first one I'm hooked. I love to carve and I love <br>
to see others carvings, I have never been disapointed at a hand carved <br>
stamp no matter how "hacked up" some have been. I can't wait to get <br>
the money to start planting my own boxes, I'm just mostly worried <br>
about planting to many boxes so close to each other because I love to <br>
carve. (this will be a topic I bring up when I get closer to planting, <br>
probably this winter.)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">DUH!!! You need to consider the following:  most of us who get into this want to get out right away and find boxes.  People, newbies, are not familiar with the whole stamp carving deal, what it entails, where to get the stuff.  When you are in the know, you have to wait several days for materials to arrive etc. you just want to get out there and do it so people go to the craft store and get a stamp. Now of course, later, one should try and carve their signature stamp, but I, for example, could not possibly carve my signature stamp with its detail.  It also after all the boxes I have found really is a part of me and I don't really want to change it.  It is neat to see who came to your box but the real treasures are the stamps you put out and find.  Keep carving, there's really no excuse to not to be carving stamps!!<br>
