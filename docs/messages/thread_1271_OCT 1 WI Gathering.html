organized on a web site:  http://www.hauntedharvest.homestead.com<br>
<br>
It is still 5 months away, but thought I'd get some of the info<br>
posted <br>
to encourage early discussion about what people might want in terms<br>
of <br>
an agenda for the day.  Feel free to contact me with your questions <br>
and suggestions.  I'm excited that some of you might be coming from <br>
neighboring states!<br>
<br>
I know we have the JUNE gathering to concentrate on first and I'm <br>
looking forward to meeting many of you in ~ 7 weeks!  I'll have to <br>
start carving my stamp for that event soon.<br>
