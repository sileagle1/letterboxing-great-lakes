As for me, I am not an artist (and if no one believes me look at the <br>
Mee-Mee box).  So to come up with a stamp unique to me, I took one <br>
of the few pictures I've ever made that I like and made a stamp out <br>
of it.  One can see in the backgound of my home page my tesselating <br>
dragon picture.  I used this for my design.  I was going to call <br>
myself The Tesselation Dragon, but that was too long, and words are <br>
tough to carve, so I just stuck with The Dragon, which seems to have <br>
just become Dragon now.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">SpringChick has kind of a dual persona.  Every summer we go on a <br>
boat trip with some of OldShoe's buddies and their wives.  I am the <br>
newest of the bunch and the first year I went along the guys had a <br>
hard time remembering my name (yeh, I know -- DEB can be so <br>
confusing).  Anyway, I quickly became "Spring's Chick" in reference <br>
to OldShoe's last name.  It kind of stuck into the next year and was <br>
eventually shortened to just SpringChick.  I liked it, not because <br>
of the possessive nature of its origin, rather it reminded me <br>
of "Spring Chicken" and it was about the time I hit my 40th b-day.<br>
<br>
When I first was beginning letterboxing, I was at the stamp store <br>
with my daughter looking for a sig stamp for our upcoming trip to <br>
Chicago (pre-carving days).  I didn't really know for sure what I <br>
was going to use for my trail name, but had a few options in mind <br>
depending on what I found for a stamp.  SpringChick was not even one <br>
of the ideas, but my daughter found a stamp that actually said <br>
Spring Chick on it (actually it said "from one Spring Chick to <br>
another" but I sliced off the other words).  How unlikely is that? <br>
It seemed destined to be my trail name.<br>

*Big sigh*  This is where Tom and I reveal our lack of creativity.  <br>
When making a quick signature stamp in the rush to get started with <br>
this new hobby we had come across, Tom carved a neat rendition of <br>
the state of MI, and added our initials (T and J) to it.  Hence the <br>
TJ-Mich name. We really are more interesting people than our trail <br>
name might lead you to believe, honest :)!  But once we got started <br>
as TJ-Mich, it seemed somehow disloyal to come up with something <br>
more creative; it's amazing how quickly you can become attached to a <br>
name or stamp.  Of course now that our 'boxin doggie Maya has her <br>
own carved stamp, we figure that adds some fun to our sign-ins in <br>
the logbooks...<br>

stamp (plus the rest of the family) it is WONDERFUL.  And although I <br>
am not familiar with the cartoon of which she speaks, the artful <br>

It's an exchange in my logbook that always gets comments.<br>
Hint, hint....if they're at the gathering........<br>
