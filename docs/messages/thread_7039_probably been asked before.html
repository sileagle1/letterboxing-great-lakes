Skootching Dog and I are planning a summer of short road trips to go<br>
boxing.  I'm loving the planning of it all (really geeking out on it),<br>

boxing yet or 2: not paying attention).  It's a question of taste and<br>
manners.<br>
<br>
If you are from WAY out of town, do you seek out the newest (just<br>
posted) letterboxes to get the first finders, or do you let the home<br>
team fight it out first and pick it up on your way out of town?<br>
<br>
We've gotten to know many (most) of the Minneapolis/St. Paul<br>
letterboxers, and quite a lot of my entertainment is seeing who got to a<br>
new plant first.  It's been a while since I haven't recognized a name on<br>
the FF post, while it wouldn't offend me at all to not know the FF<br>
(locally), I like seeing who got it from among my friends.<br>

If indeed it is a fight to see who will be the first finder locally they will be <br>

While I wouldn't specifically look for new boxes that haven't been found  <br>

 <br>
Yes, I have a little evil laugh when I am FF on a box not in my typical  <br>
stomping grounds.<br>
 <br>
If it's out there and clues are posted, it's fair game.<br>
 <br>
Again, I wouldn't look exclusively to be FF and rule out any other boxes -- <br>
 if it's the FF prize you're after, you may be very disappointed. I don't <br>
usually  put in FF certificates or anything. I have found certificates, <br>
bookmarks,  trinket, LTC or even a Pathtag used as FF prizes . . . but the VAST <br>
majority of  the boxes I've been first to don't have anything.<br>

What I do have though are bragging rites :-)<br>

What?  There are First Finder Certificates in boxes?  <br>
We wouldn't know because Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man have beat us to every box in the nation!  Doesn't matter if we go to Arizona, Vermont, Timbuktu...they've been there before us!  The only time we got FF offerings was this winter when we went with THEM to do the latest Trip Around America series.....they let us have every other one!<br>
We say go for any FF out there...and if you can get one before them, we will be impressed!<br>

I thought that was relatively amusing. But then that made me wonder. I've only been first finder a handful of times and I wonder if I was mistaken about some of those! I've never seen a box with a prize or certificate in it, even when I was (hopefully) the first. <br>

I think that first-to-find is up for grabs! In my own plants, I'd love to see an out-of-towner (or newbie) sneak in ahead of the usual suspects. <br>
<br>
When, I'm W/ Her, The Guitarist and I were in Nashville, I got totally excited when I open a letterbox and the first finder prize was still inside. When I opened the logbook, I saw that I really wasn't the first ... the other boxer just didn't take the prize :( <br>
