As a matter of fact, Katy, I am planning on going down to Urbana in<br/>
October.  Since it is relavent, the reason I'm going is that I'm<br/>
heading down for a tournament at UIUC on October 1st.  As some of you<br/>
might realize, this coincides with the gathering in Menomonee Falls. <br/>
Unfortunately, this regional tournament has been planned for quite a<br/>
while (since before I even got into LBing), and people are planning on<br/>
me driving.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was planning on heading down to Urbana-Chapaign that<br/>
week/weekend, and was gonna hit up those boxes down there.  Keep it<br/>
posted here if you get those back out in time, or I'll just have to<br/>
skip em.  =(  <br/>

The Urbana Parks Series and the University of Illinois Series are a <br/>
lot of fun.  Unfortunately, we were not able to finish the whole <br/>
series as we were there for graduation day, and there were WAY too <br/>
many people about.<br/>
