gathering this year need to email me!  I think there were three of<br>
you, and I have only heard from one of you.  I want to order the<br>
supplies I need to make the collars all at once and I would like to<br>
send the collars out by the end of August.  So if you won a collar,<br>
please email me (ainawgsd@yahoo.com) by July 15 to claim your prize. <br>
Thanks!<br>
