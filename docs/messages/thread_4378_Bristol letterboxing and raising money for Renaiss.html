last Saturday, although my new outfit limits me from carrying my <br/>
stamp with me!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The Wenches Guild (including myself) are trying to raise money for <br/>
the RESCU foundation, a not-for-profit charity that focuses on <br/>
helping Renaissance Faire workers when they are injured or very ill. <br/>
More information at www.rescufoundation.com. We are competing with <br/>
other groups to raise the most money for RESCU in two weeks, which <br/>
ends on Saturday, August 25.<br/>
<br/>
I am asking all of my friends, family, and groups to help me raise <br/>
money for this terrific charity.  To sweeten the pot for my <br/>
fellow 'boxers, I will be creating a special stamp for everyone who <br/>
helps me by giving a donation. <br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to donate is by sending funds to my PayPal account <br/>
(kburrall [at] trcsolutions [dot] com. The account was empty when I <br/>
started this last week, so all funds will be withdrawn and given to <br/>
RESCU as a check. I do have a premier account, so it will take credit <br/>
cards.  :-)  I will send the stamp image to everyone who donates and <br/>
gives me a mailing address!<br/>
<br/>
If you will be at Faire on Saturday, Aug. 25, I will working at <br/>
Camelot Fans and will have the stamp with me there and accepting <br/>
donations all day!<br/>
<br/>
Every dollar helps out in so many ways. Please give a buck or two if <br/>
you can. Thanks!<br/>
