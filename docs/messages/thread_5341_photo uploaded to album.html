                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you!  I was going to ask if someone could post/send a copy of the<br/>
"Take 1" group since we only have a copy of the "The Late" group (which I<br/>
have now also posted.  Here's a direct link to the photo:<br/>
http://tiny.cc/Lokts ).<br/>
<br/>
We really enjoyed the event and the chance to see a bunch of you again.<br/>
However somehow there were a few people that I never even saw... Oh well,<br/>
the typical "problem" of a gathering - so many people to talk to, so many<br/>
boxes to find and so many tasty treats to eat!  Thanks to Dragon for<br/>
organizing the event to mark the 10th anniversary of the Cave Point box.<br/>
It's quite amazing that it is still in place with the original stamp and all<br/>
3 logbooks!  This box is so old it was mentioned WAY BACK in 1998 in the<br/>
11th post made to the "new" national letterboxing Yahoo group<br/>
<br/>
I'll post some more event photos here later this week.  This message board<br/>
does allow much better resolution photos to be posted than AQ and I can see<br/>
them in a larger format.  I'd encourage others to post some photos here so<br/>
we can get a good look at them.<br/>
