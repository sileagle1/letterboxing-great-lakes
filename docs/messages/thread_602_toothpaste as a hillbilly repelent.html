I have ever heard!  I could have named myself,  Toothpaste Chick.  I am one of <br>
those anal people who won't leave home  without my toothbrush and tooth <br>
paste.  Is it most likely then that floss  could kill a hillbilly if I raised it up <br>
over my head and aimed it towards  them?  I have a few family members who <br>
really  "git on my last nerve."<br>
