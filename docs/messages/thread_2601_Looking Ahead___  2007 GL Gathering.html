is time to look ahead to next year and determine a location for the <br/>
5th Annual Great Lakes Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Mark you calendars for Saturday, June 2, 2007.<br/>
<br/>
As for location...  OH, IN and MN are all states within the region <br/>
that have not yet hosted the event.  If there is anyone from one of <br/>
these states who would be interested in hosting the gathering on <br/>
6/2/07, please speak up -- either post to the list or e-mail me <br/>
privately.<br/>
<br/>
I will leave it open until the end of June and at that time we will <br/>
vote between the locations that have offered to host.  If nobody <br/>
from any of the above-mentioned states offers to host, then it will <br/>
be opened up to IL, MI and WI.<br/>
<br/>
If you are wondering what is involved in hosting a gathering, there <br/>
is a file in the FILES section of the list (in the gatherings <br/>
folder) that gives an overview.  Also feel free to e-mail myself or <br/>
any of the previous gathering hosts with specific questions.<br/>
