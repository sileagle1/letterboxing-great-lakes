the Bears game. Forgot about that. I made the mistake of driving<br>

college students equipped with snowballs. Halfway home, I realized I'd<br>

A careful check of my gear, boxing kit, and car seem to result in<br>
cootie-free success. Thanks, Andrew! I came home with the neatest set<br>

get carving again.  I met nearly 60 folk!  What a blast...<br>
