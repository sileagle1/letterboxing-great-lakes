                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
The clues have been updated for the Boar's Head Festival letterbox--available this weekend only at St. John Lutheran in Forest Park, IL.  The box will be available only at the performances (4pm on Saturday and Sunday).  Clues give more info on the box, as well as the performance.<br>
<br>
Now I just need to find that darn letterbox.  I could have sworn I saw it a few weeks ago in my letterboxing stuff.  After rearranging our belongings for the umpteenth time with this construction, I am not seeing it.  I may be doing a little carving tonight!  And as soon as I finish carving, I am sure that I will find the stamp!<br>

Well,  you got your wish for a new stamp image.  I just could not find the old image, so I quickly carved something tonight.  Not tremendously artistic, but heartfelt.<br>
