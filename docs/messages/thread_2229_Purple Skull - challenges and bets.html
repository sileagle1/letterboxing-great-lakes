Unlike Speedsquare though, my challenge is to dare PSG to AVOID my<br/>

&gt; My personal opinion is that some very clever boxers signed a pact to<br/>
be silent and create this urban legend.  If this is not the case, I<br/>
double-dog dare PSG to find my logbook in 2006!<br/>

neither of us recall seeing anything odd/unusual.  We got to the Mansfield<br/>
Monster Mash event late morning and hung out at the shelter all day, only<br/>
meandering off to get the 3-4 boxes that were very close and 1-day only.<br/>
Therefore we did get to chat &amp; exchange with MANY people.  Since we did want<br/>
to meet Pete &amp; Wanda, we asked people where they were so we could do an<br/>
exchange.  Based on this, I can definitely remember that they were both<br/>
wearing bright orange shirts that day.  (I just checked my list and we did<br/>
86 exchanges that day!  Also went through my logbook to double-check, but NO<br/>
sign of a purple skull stamp in my book...)<br/>

Hmmm, I see that the infamous Wanda and Pete are signed up for the GA<br/>
gathering.  Speedsquare, you must keep your eye on her -- trust me on<br/>
this...<br/>

the planted boxes.  I'll ask dh to watch too.  I'll be heading to Stone<br/>
Mountain on Easter Sunday.  Lots of boxes there.<br/>

PSG ... I think I saw a photo somewhere of a boxer in a dark cloak.  I<br/>
think I'll check the photos for the Monster Mash.<br/>
