       That list of potential letterbox hunts is exhausting to even read!  <br/>
Wow!  I hope you guys ate your Wheaties before leaving home.  How exciting to <br/>
have that much time and energy to tackle such a great long list of boxes!<br/>
Hope you find every one of them and have a blast!  Enjoy the wedding too!<br/>
or is that just an excuse to go letterboxing? hahahhahaha<br/>
<br/>
        It's exciting to see so many new boxers and read all the new boxes <br/>
placed.  This next year should be great for LBers!  BTW&lt; congrats on the first <br/>
find Renfield and to your 200 find WI Hiker.  Way to go!<br/>
