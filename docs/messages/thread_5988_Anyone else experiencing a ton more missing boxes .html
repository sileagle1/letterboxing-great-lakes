<br/>
We lost quite a few a couple of years ago, some of them like yours -- in<br/>
areas where muggles never would have been looking.  This was why Caveman<br/>
decided to go ahead and insist that he wants to replace them but list them<br/>
on atlasquest and use that system where a person has to have found a certain<br/>
number of boxes in order to see the clues.  I don't like that idea at all,<br/>
but he figures that forest perserve personnel won't bother going to that<br/>
work to see if there are clues to any boxes in their preserves there, and<br/>
other non-boxer people who might want to intentionally harm the boxes might<br/>
be too lazy to record their finds just to see if there are any clues.  I<br/>
dunno.  It might work.<br/>
<br/>
In this neck of the woods we have an absolute ton of geocaches.  Any chance<br/>
they were near geocaches?<br/>
<br/>
I've been kind of wondering about DuPage County boxes in the DuPage County<br/>
forest preserves.  They used to require a permit for caches and letterboxes.<br/>
Then they began hiding their own combo caches/boxes -- many of which have<br/>
gone missing quickly.  (To the point where, as soon as I see a box listed<br/>
now by one of their rangers, I go find it because I just know it's going to<br/>
go missing soon.)<br/>
<br/>
And this year, when I went to their site where they list the types of<br/>
permits folks need to have for various activities in the preserves, I can't<br/>
find anything listed for caches or boxes.  So I'm wondering if they still<br/>
have the permit program and if not, does that mean caches/boxes aren't<br/>
permitted at all now.  Not that I'd get a permit anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But it's kind of amazing what boxes manage to stay in place in the DuPage<br/>
preserves year after year without a permit and what boxes manage to<br/>
disappear even when quite well hidden.  I don't get it.<br/>
<br/>
We've also had a ton of rain this year.  Wettest spring since 1928 according<br/>
to what I read.  Any chance they might have gotten washed away even if the<br/>
boxes didn't *seem* to be placed where water might be a danger under<br/>
"normal" spring weather?<br/>
<br/>
I hope you find an answer that works for you!<br/>

Another of my missing boxes, I am sure, WAS washed away in the spring flood. <br/>
When I checked that box earlier this spring, I could tell from the looks of <br/>

I actually think my boxes are safer being on LBNA and will work on having<br/>

<br/>
If rangers are intent on removing boxes, I think they will certainly go to<br/>
AQ in addition to LBNA.  If they are taking all the time to go out and hike<br/>
for the boxes, it sure doesn't take a comparable amount of time to look at<br/>
AQ, log any random finds they'd care to and search out more to remove.<br/>

Mosey - no, only 2 were in a forest preserve, and the clue was worded in <br/>
such a way that at least a little effort had to be put forth to figure out <br/>
the location. I tend to agree with Caveman's idea about listing any <br/>
remaining boxes of mine on Atlasquest only, with a "found box count". I <br/>
realize this will cut down on the finds, but hopefully it will also offer a <br/>
little protection from malicious vandalism.<br/>
<br/>
Re geocaches - I actually have NO idea how to determine whether there is a <br/>
geocache anywhere near.<br/>
<br/>
Another of my missing boxes, I am sure, WAS washed away in the spring flood.<br/>
<br/>
When I checked that box earlier this spring, I could tell from the looks of <br/>
the area that the water had gotten that high. That box is a mystery box <br/>
with clues that require a bit of work.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Were all six in a forest preserve? Any chance that forest perserve<br/>
&gt; personnel might have been following the clues and confiscating them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We lost quite a few a couple of years ago, some of them like yours -- in<br/>
&gt; areas where muggles never would have been looking. This was why Caveman<br/>
&gt; decided to go ahead and insist that he wants to replace them but list them<br/>
&gt; on atlasquest and use that system where a person has to have found a <br/>
&gt; certain<br/>
&gt; number of boxes in order to see the clues. I don't like that idea at all,<br/>
&gt; but he figures that forest perserve personnel won't bother going to that<br/>
&gt; work to see if there are clues to any boxes in their preserves there, and<br/>
&gt; other non-boxer people who might want to intentionally harm the boxes <br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt; be too lazy to record their finds just to see if there are any clues. I<br/>
&gt; dunno. It might work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In this neck of the woods we have an absolute ton of geocaches. Any <br/>
&gt; chance<br/>
&gt; they were near geocaches?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I've been kind of wondering about DuPage County boxes in the DuPage County<br/>
&gt; forest preserves. They used to require a permit for caches and <br/>
&gt; letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; Then they began hiding their own combo caches/boxes -- many of which have<br/>
&gt; gone missing quickly. (To the point where, as soon as I see a box listed<br/>
&gt; now by one of their rangers, I go find it because I just know it's going <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; go missing soon.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And this year, when I went to their site where they list the types of<br/>
&gt; permits folks need to have for various activities in the preserves, I <br/>
&gt; can't<br/>
&gt; find anything listed for caches or boxes. So I'm wondering if they still<br/>
&gt; have the permit program and if not, does that mean caches/boxes aren't<br/>
&gt; permitted at all now. Not that I'd get a permit anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But it's kind of amazing what boxes manage to stay in place in the DuPage<br/>
&gt; preserves year after year without a permit and what boxes manage to<br/>
&gt; disappear even when quite well hidden. I don't get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We've also had a ton of rain this year. Wettest spring since 1928 <br/>
&gt; according<br/>
&gt; to what I read. Any chance they might have gotten washed away even if the<br/>
&gt; boxes didn't *seem* to be placed where water might be a danger under<br/>
&gt; "normal" spring weather?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope you find an answer that works for you!<br/>

boxers who don't read any of the groups than those who do read any of them.<br/>
I maybe read only 1/10th of the posts even tho I'm subscribed to the lists.<br/>
<br/>
I admit that I don't like logging my finds online either.  Never have liked<br/>
it.  Caveman actually went and began logging our finds on atlasquest and<br/>
just did a good number of our local finds, not finds where we found<br/>
out-of-town ones when we were away on business or anything, and I think he<br/>
gave up around 200.  Then he got bored.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The boxes being hidden from even veteran boxers if they don't log their<br/>
finds was a big reason I was so against it at first.  Another reason was<br/>
that I didn't like the fact that it was a commercial site.<br/>
<br/>
But the times, they are a'changin'.  After what we went thru a couple of<br/>
years ago with losing boxes, I really don't feel like even putting them out<br/>
there.  I wouldn't be "protecting them from newbies" per se.  I'd be<br/>
protecting them from whoever is disappearing them.  I still think that, for<br/>
my neck of the woods, it's the people who "control" the use of the land<br/>
we've planted on.  Yes, when we make a carve a stamp, make a box, hide it,<br/>
write clues..........we're giving up that box to the wild.........releasing<br/>
it so to speak.  On the other hand, I have severe carpal tunnel syndrome.<br/>
It takes a lot for me to even be able to carve a mediocre stamp.  We had<br/>
boxes out there from 2004 to 2007, no problems.  Shouldn't say that.  Sure<br/>
there were problems.  But I could point each time to the likely cause as<br/>
something that was non-human.  Then something happened in 2007 and they<br/>
began disappearing like crazy in cases where it had to be humans.<br/>
<br/>
So we figured, we're moving anyway, let's not bother putting them out there<br/>
for 2008.  But the real estate market went south and we probably won't be<br/>
moving until 2010 or 2011.<br/>
<br/>
And we, personally, hate to see boxes turned into mystery boxes because we<br/>
*are* so short of cash and don't really want to go chasing after boxes where<br/>
we think we've got the location right and end up not having it right.  Or<br/>
working out elaborate clues only to find out that we can't afford the gas to<br/>
go there anyway.  So I hesitate to make boxes that might cause other folks<br/>
like us to not go searching for boxes because *they're* short of money.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, there *is* a learning curve to finding boxes, so really difficult<br/>
clues or making mystery boxes *would* sort of be protecting them from<br/>
newbies.  I *do* like difficult clues tho.  I really don't mind if we know<br/>
we have the right area but we can't find the box because the clues stump us.<br/>
I'm cool with that.  I was cool with that as a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
With a found box count, if I understand it right, the found box count<br/>
required doesn't need to be a very high one.  Yes, malicious folks could go<br/>
in and easily log one or two boxes to qualify.  But Caveman thought maybe<br/>
folks like rangers and other landowners wouldn't bother going thru even that<br/>
little amount of work to see if there are any boxes they want to confiscate.<br/>
Then again, maybe they would take the time to bother.<br/>
<br/>
I dunno.  There's just no easy or perfect answer.<br/>

we had our email address on the box.  .  (Unlike a county park ranger in WI<br/>
who sent us a nice note, took a photo of the box in his office and then went<br/>

&gt; Were all six in a forest preserve? Any chance that forest perserve<br/>
&gt; personnel might have been following the clues and confiscating them?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We lost quite a few a couple of years ago, some of them like yours -- in<br/>
&gt; areas where muggles never would have been looking. This was why Caveman<br/>
&gt; decided to go ahead and insist that he wants to replace them but list them<br/>
&gt; on atlasquest and use that system where a person has to have found a<br/>
&gt; certain<br/>
&gt; number of boxes in order to see the clues. I don't like that idea at all,<br/>
&gt; but he figures that forest perserve personnel won't bother going to that<br/>
&gt; work to see if there are clues to any boxes in their preserves there, and<br/>
&gt; other non-boxer people who might want to intentionally harm the boxes<br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt; be too lazy to record their finds just to see if there are any clues. I<br/>
&gt; dunno. It might work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In this neck of the woods we have an absolute ton of geocaches. Any<br/>
&gt; chance<br/>
&gt; they were near geocaches?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I've been kind of wondering about DuPage County boxes in the DuPage County<br/>
&gt; forest preserves. They used to require a permit for caches and<br/>
&gt; letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; Then they began hiding their own combo caches/boxes -- many of which have<br/>
&gt; gone missing quickly. (To the point where, as soon as I see a box listed<br/>
&gt; now by one of their rangers, I go find it because I just know it's going<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; go missing soon.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And this year, when I went to their site where they list the types of<br/>
&gt; permits folks need to have for various activities in the preserves, I<br/>
&gt; can't<br/>
&gt; find anything listed for caches or boxes. So I'm wondering if they still<br/>
&gt; have the permit program and if not, does that mean caches/boxes aren't<br/>
&gt; permitted at all now. Not that I'd get a permit anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But it's kind of amazing what boxes manage to stay in place in the DuPage<br/>
&gt; preserves year after year without a permit and what boxes manage to<br/>
&gt; disappear even when quite well hidden. I don't get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We've also had a ton of rain this year. Wettest spring since 1928<br/>
&gt; according<br/>
&gt; to what I read. Any chance they might have gotten washed away even if the<br/>
&gt; boxes didn't *seem* to be placed where water might be a danger under<br/>
&gt; "normal" spring weather?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope you find an answer that works for you!<br/>
