close to our hearts, especially mine, since diabetes<br/>

Thank you for allowing this interruption, and we now<br/>

We did the Tour de Cure last year, in the western suburbs of <br/>
Chicago.  One of my son's good buddies was diagnosed with diabetes in <br/>
kindergarten.  We only did 15 miles though, although I think we could <br/>
have done more.  They did a great job of organizing, so I'm sure <br/>
you'll have a good time as well as support a good cause.<br/>
