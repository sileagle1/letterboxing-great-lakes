I am a new boxer, placed 1, found 4.  Anyway, while out walking with <br>
my kids on a bike trail that we've never gone down before, we found <br>
several places that just yelled "Hey, put a letterbox here!"  The <br>
thing is, they are in pretty close proximity to each other (probably <br>
about 100 yards up and down a path).  Plus, although the bike trail <br>
is nice, it isn't significant as far as being a forest preserve or <br>
something else like that.  <br>
<br>
I guess I just need to know whether this would be worthwhile for <br>
boxing, or not, and what the general rule of thumb for box proximity <br>
is.<br>

Rules?  What rules?  Bike paths are certainly fair game for placing boxes.  There is a series around here that is on (or rather just off) a bike trail that we found fairly enjoyable (even if we only found two out of four boxes and were plagued by mosquitoes and rabid woodchucks...it was still a very nice hike).  As for a rule of thumb for box proximity...there aren't really any.  I will however say that I have never seen boxes placed that close together.  Then again, I'm new to the hobby and haven't found a great deal of boxes yet.  If you really want to place some boxes (or a series) even if they are kinda close together...go for it.  Or, you could always narrow your choices down to one or two that are absolutely perfect for a box.  I come across good hiding places for boxes all the time, but upon closer inspection many of them are not as great as I originally thought.<br>

First of all, it's really great that you've already jumped in and <br>
placed boxes!  As far as the close proximity of your potential <br>
plants, how about making one of them a bonus box?  In other words, <br>
plant a box in one of the spots, publish the clues to it and then <br>
place the clues to a second box within the first box (but don't <br>
publish those).  The unsuspecting boxers search for your bike trail <br>
box, find it and... suprise!!  They get clues to another box that's <br>
located close by!  I'd love it!!<br>

That's a great idea!  You'd have to see the one spot.  My oldest dd <br>
say's "it looks like a magic glen.  I could come here every day and <br>
just feel the magic."  Now who wouldn't want to share that feeling?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the great idea!<br>

Sounds like inspiration for a stamp!  <br>

Some of my favorite boxes were in places that weren't particularly <br>
special--until I read the clues.  Take a look at the clues Birkiebob wrote <br>
for his "Boyhood Adventure" boxes in <br>
Milwaukee. <br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=2987&boxname=Boyhood_Adventures <br>
One of the boxes is in a nice enough park, on the lake, glad to be <br>
there.  The other one, though, the one that's missing, is really in a very <br>
ordinary playground with a drainage ditch and a little patch of <br>
woods.  Nothing special--but the clues make it clear how special it once <br>
was to a young boy.   Matt the Rat's Chicago Underground box, <br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=836&boxname=Chicago_Underground <br>
is another example of a spot no one would think to visit if they weren't <br>
tracking down a box.<br>
<br>
Lots of things other than a good location can make a box special--an log <br>
book or stamp made with extra care, mystery or bonus clues, or just a good <br>
story.  As an urban boxer who often must hide boxes in very public places, <br>
I have to avoid the top tourist spots simply because the boxes would never <br>
last there.   It's a lot more fun to find the places people wouldn't <br>
naturally visit and then make them glad they made the effort.<br>

  I had to check on Boyhood Adventures #2 as it was our first find.  <br>
I'm glad to report it's still there.  However, the land owner (I <br>
thought it was part of the park... and still do) has cleared a lot of <br>
the brush (Buckthorn) in the area for a better view, and the hiding <br>
spot is in plain view from the road and neighboring houses.  So <br>
caution is advised if you look for it.<br>
