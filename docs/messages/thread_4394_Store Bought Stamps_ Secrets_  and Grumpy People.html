I agree with you about the sniping, but I think the people sniping <br/>
are on the "main list", not this one.... so posting about it here <br/>
isn't going to help much in that regard.  It's pretty much a way of <br/>
life over there, so posting about it there probably wouldn't help, either!<br/>
<br/>
As far as the store bought stamps, I think the only way on LbNA to <br/>
tell if it was store bought or hand made would be if the planter <br/>
stated so in their clues.  I don't think I've ever seen anyone say <br/>
that in the clues, so it's not likely you'll find that info out ahead <br/>
of time.  If the clues are double posted on both sites, you'd be able <br/>
to check that way, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the no-stamp/record a secret box, where was that?  Since <br/>
we're "kind of" in the same area, it's conceivable I may run across <br/>
that box and I want to make sure I skip it!  What a waste of time.  I <br/>
greatly prefer a hand carved stamp, but I don't necessarily mind a <br/>
store bought stamp if it fits the box theme or location.  But, if I <br/>
found that box, I'd be really irritated.<br/>

As far as the store bought stamps, I think the only way on LbNA to<br/>
tell if it was store bought or hand made would be if the planter<br/>
stated so in their clues.  I don't think I've ever seen anyone say<br/>

<br/>
=========================================<br/>
<br/>
I always put it in my clues.  But my clues aren't on LbNA, they're on my own<br/>
website, so I guess that really doesn't count.  :-)  I wish folks would just<br/>
put a note at the bottom of their clues.  But, on the other hand, hey,<br/>
that's life.<br/>
<br/>
I've actually slowed down my boxing of late in this area because, of the<br/>
last 10 stamps I've found, 8 of them were store-bought.  I've kind of been<br/>
figuring on sticking to planters who I already know carve their own stamps.<br/>
To me, the most rudimentary of unique stamps is superior to a store-bought<br/>
stamp, but I know a lot of boxers don't care one way or the other which they<br/>
find.  I think possibly the more store-bought stamps that new boxers find,<br/>
the more likely they are to be encouraged to purchase store-bought stamps<br/>
rather than give it a go at carving their own.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe for a lot of families with children, the "excitement" is more in<br/>
putting a box out there and having people visit and thus getting to see the<br/>
stamps in their logbook, rather than in the art of it all?  I'd hate to see<br/>
art fall by the wayside and store-bought become the main, but that's just<br/>
me.<br/>

something to do with the box itself (now bad clues are an entirely different subject, <br/>
however).  I must admit, when we first placed our box it had a store bought stamp.  We <br/>
had only been letterboxing for about 6 months and had not gotten into the carving-<br/>
stamps bit yet.  Plus, I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to do only a semi-okay job <br/>
(it's still pretty amateur but at least decent).  In fact, buying the supplies and trying out <br/>
carving had been on my "to-do" list for quite some time when finally Trailtracker gave me <br/>
a bunch of carving goodies for Christmas one year.  If it hadn't been for her extra nudge <br/>
(perhaps push?? lol) who knows how long it would have taken me.<br/>
<br/>
As long as people pick interesting sites to plant their boxes and have clues that make <br/>
sense I'm fine with the store bought stamp.  I do love the idea of notating that the stamp <br/>
is store bought in the clues on the letterboxing.org site - but I certainly wouldn't let that <br/>
stop me from trying to find their box.  If I had done that I would have missed out on some <br/>
absolutely fabulous boxes in gorgeous locations otherwise.  Don't get me wrong, I really <br/>
love seeing all the beautiful stamps that people far more talented than myself carved.  <br/>
Many are truly works of art!  But give the rest break...they may just be getting into <br/>
letterboxing like we were and are testing the waters.  If letterboxing becomes a hobby that <br/>
is too difficult to participate in or people aren't welcoming then what's the point? There's <br/>
room for all of us.<br/>

I wasn't sure what I was doing, much less learn to carve. I keep that <br/>
box with the store bought stamp as a reminder of how far I have come <br/>
with my carving skills. Its more of a sentimental thing for me and <br/>
its the only box to NEVER go missing lol(go figure). Hell our <br/>
signature stamp has been a store bought stamp for the last 3 years, I <br/>
just now got around to carving a new sig. stamp because my husband <br/>
was embarassed when we went to gatherings lol. I think as long as the <br/>
store bought stamp makes sence to the story of the letterbox it isnt <br/>
to bad to find. I just dont like when they have nice clues that tell <br/>
a story and the stamp in the box is "Great Job!" that has nothing to <br/>
do with anything.<br/>
For me when I come across an image I would like to carve, the image <br/>
creates the clues for me. So if you cant carve or dont have the time <br/>
go to a scapbooking place where there is a larger veriaty of stamps <br/>
and pick out one that tells a story for you.<br/>

&gt; store-bought stamp for those of you who prefer to skip it. (I had <br/>
&gt; been noting this on Atlasquest, just not letterboxing.org.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You don't need to apologize for using store-bought stamps.  While many<br/>
letterboxers prefer hand-carved stamps, particularly those who are<br/>
focused on the art aspect of the hobby, there are many other<br/>
letterboxers who don't care, or at least not enough to avoid boxes<br/>
with purchased stamps if the box is at a nice location, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It is your letterbox, you are free to include the image you want,<br/>
hand-carved or store-bought, you are free to hide where you want and<br/>
clue how you want.  The important thing is that you need to be willing<br/>
to accept that because of the choices you make in this regard, there<br/>
may be people who pass by that box.  This is true in regards to the<br/>
type of location or hike, just as it is with the type of stamp you<br/>
include in the box.<br/>
<br/>
While it is considerate to include this information in your clues, it<br/>
is not a requirement.  There is a common misconception that the<br/>
planter owes it to finders to provide all kinds of information about<br/>
their letterbox so that a finder can decide if they want to go look<br/>
for it or not.  Everything about a letterbox is so subjective that for<br/>
a planter to try and please every potential finder is ridiculous.  For<br/>
everyone who wants the clues to specify how long the hike is, how<br/>
steep the terrain, what the stamp is like, etc. there is another<br/>
person who does not want this information provided, rather would like<br/>
to be surprised when they get there.  The thing about letterboxing is<br/>
that one should set out without an expectation, other than to *make*<br/>
their experience enjoyable -- whether that be because of the location<br/>
or the company or the box itself, that is up to the finder.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally I would rather have an interesting location and a good hike<br/>
with a store-bought stamp than a boring location or drive-by with a<br/>
hand-carved stamp.  Okay, that's not quite the truth -- actually, I<br/>
would prefer to have it all, but if I had to choose, a killer<br/>
hand-carved stamp would not be my top priority.<br/>
<br/>
So if you truly feel you cannot carve a stamp and using store-bought<br/>
stamps is the only way you are comfortable planting a letterbox right<br/>
now -- don't hesitate because of this.  There are plenty of<br/>
letterboxers who will look for the box regardless.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to say that while I definately have a strong preference for a hand carved stamp (I have to admit to being just a little disappointed when I find a store bought stamp, especially if I wasn't expecting it to be purchased) I don't really mind the store bought stamps too much.  If I were going out of town on a trip, a store bought stamp might deter me from looking for a box (unless it were a quick, short hike at a point in the drive where a good stretch was needed) and knowing that it's store bought rather than hand carved or commissioned will knock it down towards the bottom of my priority list.  But it wouldn't completely deter me from going after a box.  Looking through my first logbook, quite a few of my first finds were purchased stamps.  The images may not be unique and I may not like them as much as most of the hand carved images in my book, but they do hold some pretty fond (and funny) memories.  In fact, the only time I've ever really been upset about finding a<br/>
 store bought stamp was when we were in Ohio and we were looking for one of Scoutdogs' boxes.  Scoutdogs was the one who introduced me and Katy to letterboxing and we were really looking forward to this box because her stamps are AWESOME.  When we found the box, someone had replaced her stamp with a cheap store-bought foam stamp.  I was SO bummed!<br/>
