characters called Goofus and Gallant?<br>
<br>
My recent email brought those fellows to mind, and here's why:  <br>
<br>
email #1 -- Gallant says:  We did the Easter series this spring.  My<br>
daughter (7) still talks about "Bad Bill Bunny" when we talk about<br>
LBs.  For Christmas, the kids will be receiving LB supplies as we have<br>
several ideas for locations and stories, using your Easter series as<br>
an example.  We like those kinds.<br>
<br>
I can hardly express how much getting this email meant to me and how<br>
much I value their comments.<br>
<br>
email #2 re: some of my clues are at our yahoogroup and not on the<br>
LbNA site --- Goofus says:  All I want is clues to letterboxes.  Why<br>
do I have to "join" anything???  When I clicked on join, filled out<br>
all the info, and got to the user agreement, I found that yahoo could<br>
start sending me unwanted info.  And I don't need another email<br>
address.  I just want clues.  I'm not even sure if I was in the right<br>
spot for "joining your group".  If you have your own site that only<br>
"members" can access clues, then why do  you list your letterboxes on<br>
Letterboxing North America?  For those that are not computer-savy or<br>
web-site-savy, this is very confusing and even rude.  Looks like we<br>
won't be hunting up any of your letterboxes.<br>
<br>
Uhmm... where to begin on how I felt when I read this?  No, let's not<br>
even go there. However, Bindle Bum is always "accusing" me of being<br>
too optimistic and always finding something good to say no matter what<br>
the situation ... but the only 'positive' I can say about this email<br>
is that I think it's a GOOD thing that someone like this won't be<br>
looking for my boxes.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I guess the other good thing is that I truly believe there are<br>
far more "Gallant" people in the world than there are "Goofus" types.<br>
<br>
BTW -- anyone want to guess the theme of my next series of boxes, or<br>
who the two main character stamps are going to be? (grin)<br>

Enjoy!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I always loved Goofus and Gallant.  Highlights was a cool magazine -- <br>
the hidden picture puzzles were my favs.  I've been trying to think <br>
of a way to incoroporate that into a letterbox for some time...  <br>
Goofus and Gallant will make a great box duo.<br>
<br>
It's always nice to get heartwarming e-mails from finders where you <br>
feel like you've really given some enjoyment to somebody or an entire <br>
family.  It's neat that this series was so inspiring to these folks.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I would call the 2nd guy a Goofus though.  I think that <br>
being a tech-savvy kind of person it is very easy for us to <br>
assimilate that onto everyone else.  But the truth is that over 40% <br>
of the population are not regular computer users and many more are <br>
only familiar with e-mail -- their particular e-mail program (most <br>
often AOL).  With all of the negative publicity about internet fraud, <br>
identity theft and spyware/malware, it can be very intimidating for a <br>
non-computer person to have to "join" anything.  Like he said, he <br>
just wants clues, and he probably is not alone in that desire.<br>
<br>
While it is everybody's right to decide how they will make their <br>
clues available and I personally think the format you've chosen is a <br>
great tool for doing so as it allows you to easily organize <br>
everything (very easy to find stuff at your Yahoo! site), <br>
the "joining" requirement does turn some people away.  Doesn't make <br>
him unworthy of your boxes or a Goofus though.  It's all about <br>
accessibility.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents...<br>

I remember those days fondly.  Those were the days of a tiny two-bedroom<br>
