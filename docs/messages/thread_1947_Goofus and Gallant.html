do I have to "join" anything???  When I clicked on join, filled out<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I always loved Goofus and Gallant.  Highlights was a cool magazine -- <br/>
the hidden picture puzzles were my favs.  I've been trying to think <br/>
of a way to incoroporate that into a letterbox for some time...  <br/>
Goofus and Gallant will make a great box duo.<br/>
<br/>
It's always nice to get heartwarming e-mails from finders where you <br/>
feel like you've really given some enjoyment to somebody or an entire <br/>
family.  It's neat that this series was so inspiring to these folks.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure I would call the 2nd guy a Goofus though.  I think that <br/>
being a tech-savvy kind of person it is very easy for us to <br/>
assimilate that onto everyone else.  But the truth is that over 40% <br/>
of the population are not regular computer users and many more are <br/>
only familiar with e-mail -- their particular e-mail program (most <br/>
often AOL).  With all of the negative publicity about internet fraud, <br/>
identity theft and spyware/malware, it can be very intimidating for a <br/>
non-computer person to have to "join" anything.  Like he said, he <br/>
just wants clues, and he probably is not alone in that desire.<br/>
<br/>
While it is everybody's right to decide how they will make their <br/>
clues available and I personally think the format you've chosen is a <br/>
great tool for doing so as it allows you to easily organize <br/>
everything (very easy to find stuff at your Yahoo! site), <br/>
the "joining" requirement does turn some people away.  Doesn't make <br/>
him unworthy of your boxes or a Goofus though.  It's all about <br/>
accessibility.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents...<br/>
