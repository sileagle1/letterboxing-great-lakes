bought at Grumpy's after finding the "Come Grumpy Go Happy" box, and WI<br/>
Hiker and Martini Man's earlier report of the same, I had to go try some<br/>
myself.<br/>

I'm sorry, but it pales by comparison.  If you want REALLY good pumpkin ice<br/>
cream, go to Tate's in LaGrange.  It is located on Ashland, conveniently<br/>
around the corner from the Papery, home of "Rock Paper Scissors".  Grumpy's<br/>
really didn't have much flavor to me.  Tate's using more spices, so it tates<br/>
more like pumpkin pie.<br/>

(BTW, the clerk at Grumpy's was so excited about two people asking for it in<br/>
one day.)<br/>
