  Just a note to let Lansing-area letterboxers know that "Say Yes to <br>
  Michigan" has been replaced.  A new stamp was carved using the <br>
  original design and the location was moved to one that I hope will be <br>
  less susceptible to being disturbed by squirrels (which is what I <br>
  think may have happened to the old box).<br>
