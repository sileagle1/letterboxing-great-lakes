                    <div class="plaintext-content">I still have most of the boxes to either plant myself or send back to the owners.  Only one has been re-planted in LaCrosse but the clues are not up yet.  The others to be replanted will not be planted in Door Cty.  No boxes were allowed to be left planted in the park, but a number of boxes I never handled were planted outside the park and their clues are online.<br>

replanted by us (Wisconsin Hiker & Martini Man).   We still have 3 more to<br>

graciously volunteered to hide the other remaining box.<br>

None of these boxes are in Door County.  All of them are planted at a<br>
location that relates to the stamp image.<br>

Next month I'll be spending a week in Door County with my family (after a<br>
15-year hiatus from there - whoo hoo!), and I'm hoping to do plenty of<br>
boxing while there. I'm looking at clues on the LbNA site, and there are<br>
more than a few that were planted for the 10th anniversary gathering last<br>
fall and state they'll be planted permanently elsewhere, but either haven't<br>
been or the clues haven't been updated.<br>
<br>
So do any of the owners have updates? Were any of the boxes left in place?<br>
<br>
Thanks!!<br>
