<br/>
I've had a few emails recently about the patches, so I wanted to let people know that I DO have some in stock and will be bringing the patches to both the Sci-Fi gathering in Waukesha, WI on OCT 3 and the Harvest &amp; Haunts event in Cottage Grove, MN on OCT 10.  The patches are $2 each and you can see what they look like at this link:<br/>

<br/>
If you want a patch and won't be at either of these gatherings, just shoot me an email and I will set one aside for you until I receive your payment and SASE.<br/>
