  His all!  Been lurking just Kathi said.......so busy.,..trying to carve out <br>
a few hours on the day of the Gathering to attend...  I am bummed that my <br>
very first and second LB search turned up empty handed!  Both of them in the rain <br>
and mud, but it was an exciting adventure just the same.  Third time a charm? <br>
 May have to place my first LB and go find it myself!<br>
<br>
Where do I go to find the pictures of the gathering from last year?  <br>
<br>

<br>
Don't get discouraged!  Which boxes were you attempting?  Perhaps it <br>
wasn't you who was lost, but rather the box itself.  It happens.  <br>
Sometimes folks email me when they can't find my boxes and it serves <br>
as a "heads up" that a check-up is in order.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the group BeckyJo!  Glad you have joined the group and <br>
have come forth out of lurkdom!  As Melinda indicated, you shouldn't <br>
get too discouraged about the first couple of strike-outs because it <br>
may very well be that the boxes are missing.  Glad to hear it was an <br>
adventure anyway and hopefully the 3rd time will be the charm!<br>
<br>
You will find photos of last year's Great Lakes gathering, a the <br>
Photos section of this list (over there on the left side bar), in a <br>
folder called 2003 Gathering (or something like that).<br>
