We just wanted to thank you for the wonderful time we had Saturday.  <br>
You guys did a wonderful job organizing the gathering. The haunted <br>
trail was great!!!!!  We thought it was so kind of you to open up your <br>
beautiful property for everyone to enjoy.  It was great to see familiar <br>
faces and get the opportunity to meet some new ones.  The stamps that <br>
were carved for the event were awesome.  We look forward to see <br>
everyone again at the next event!!!! <br>
<br>
Thank you Again! <br>

  Applause to R-Gang for the great gathering on Saturday. I loved reading the stories of local lore, and then finding the stamps to illustrate them! And thanks to all the guest carvers. The stamps were fantastic.<br>
  A few regrets (on my part)...<br>
  I didn't get Rosmarinus' PT and the Patriot PLB when I had the chance (I thought I would see her again later in the day, but didn't)<br>
  I didn't exchange trail stamps with bunnyslippers and family when we were following them around on the trail.<br>
  I didn't get a chance to meet Dr Watson, Jabber & JoBob, and Hales Angels (I'm sure there were others, but I'm strung out on cold medicine right now.)<br>
  There were a few traveling event stamps that I didn't get to stamp into.<br>
  But the one thing I am happy about...<br>
  I escaped without any cooties!!!!!! (At least I haven't found any yet.)<br>
   <br>
  Thanks again for a great time!<br>
