We will have 3 fur-kids who will be attending and Dr. Watson says <br>
that we would love to have the bandannas for them.  We would also <br>
like to bid for 5 of the 10 patches that are left.  I'm assuming that <br>
these are the LbGLK patches.  Just let me know what I need to do to <br>
order and pay for them.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

I've had ever since 1992 seems to be a very popular one)<br>

The bandannas are a fun idea, but my guys will likely have their Dog Scout bandana's (& maybe their uniforms) on.  Those are red.  but if we do a photo, I'll happy to change the bandannas for the photo.<br>

They are chow hounds, so I'm sure they will find you and your treats :-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I LOVE this idea!  Mine will both be wearing bandanas, but they will  have to be different colored bandanas so that others can tell them apart since they're both white german shepherds and they will both be wearing orange backpacks.  Mine already have GLK patches sewn onto their packs, so the stamp and fabric paint idea would be great for us.  And green and blue wouldn't clash with their packs!<br>
<br>
My two also have their own personal stamps.  And by June, Aina will have her own personal "time" traveler.  I know what image I'm going to use, I just have to decide on the clue.<br>

I don't recall seeing any other postings or responses to this, it was <br>
dated 10 Feb.<br>
<br>
I did order 5 of the 10 remaining patches from WI and just received <br>
them today.  I ordered 3 for our fur-kids and would love to partake <br>
in the group photo.  Is there a specific color I should be looking <br>
for?  I'm thinking that for Griffy he'd like the blue, but Taffy 11.5 <br>
yrs and Zoe 1 yr are gals and don't think they'd like the green, more <br>
red or pink I would think.<br>
<br>
Thank-you,<br>

I'm glad you got your patches. <br>
<br>
Since this bandana thing is all just informal, I'd say go ahead and get <br>
whatever color you'd prefer.  I was thinking that having dogs in the <br>
park with these on, may deflect the fact that we are having a <br>
letterboxing event too.  It looks more like a dog convention??  :)   I <br>
have not brought my dog to an event before.  Maybe those who have, can <br>
shed more light on this??  (No pun intended.)  About the group photo of <br>
all of the fur-kids---I'm hoping we'll get lots of great pictures of <br>
them and the event!  :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great.....  I'll be stopping there later today (Hobby Lobby) <br>
hopefully and I'll pick them up.<br>
<br>
As for being at an event, Dr. Watson and I took our fur-kids to the <br>
SOHT this past Oct and they were okay for the most part, but we kept <br>
them shielded from most of the events.  They did come out from time <br>
to time, and they enjoyed the interaction, but had to limit it to <br>
short spans owing to getting overly excited and a bit out of hand.  <br>
Poor Griffy became a magnet for cooties!!!!!<br>
<br>
We also atempted the "pose" for a photo op with them.  That was a <br>
treat all unto it's self.  (NOT).....  Do you know how hard it is to <br>
get 3 dogs to sit and stare at a camera all at the same time without <br>
one wanting to jump up at the camera or the one who is trying to pose <br>
with them?  Loads of fun, I can't wait to see how we fare w/a dozen <br>
and a half of them at last count.<br>
