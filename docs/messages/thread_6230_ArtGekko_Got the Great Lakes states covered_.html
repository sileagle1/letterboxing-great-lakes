<br>
Rhinelander!  Oh, to dream....   I'd love to visit that area.  Is there a safer time to visit; when the Hodag is hibernating?<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
IL - Beetle was born in IL, and lives there now.  Probably always will too. <br>
<br>
IN - Great sand dunes and I frequently go to a Girl Scout camp near Valparaiso-Butternut Springs. <br>
<br>
WI - Because I live so close to the IL/WI border, I'm frequently driving around in WI.  I go to two Girl Scout camps in WI. -Happy Hollow and Juniper Knoll.  My family goes on vacation in Door County twice a year.  One of my closest friends lives there.  Just a great state!<br>
<br>
MN - My grandparents were farmers in the great state of MN.  I've visited St. Peter/St. Paul as a job related trip.<br>
<br>
MI - Last summer, I spent a week camping at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Park.  <br>
<br>
OH - Hmmm... I don't think I've even been to Ohio.  As a child, my family drove to New York so we drove through Ohio, but I don't recall the trip.  Maybe we need to plan a camping trip to Ohio.  Any recommendations?<br>

<br>
Ooh, this is a fun topic. <br>
<br>
WI - I grew up in Rhinelander. My mom still lives there so I visit often. We'd also spend two weeks every summer on Lily Bay in Door County. I was there for the first time in 15 years last July. I cried when we had to leave!<br>
<br>
MN - Where I live now and probably will for the rest of my life.<br>
<br>
MI - In high school I had a friend w/ a cabin in the UP, so we'd road trip up there in the summer. Also skied up there quite a bit. Have drive through the LB, but no real connection<br>
<br>
IA - My brother's in Iowa City. I love the Maquoketa Caves park<br>
<br>
IL - sisters in Libertyville and Elmhurst. Had the pleasure of boxing with Nitrocat once.<br>
<br>
IN - One sister used to live in Bloomington, and I visited once. Beautiful county - I loved the rolling hills. She took me to a lake that had geodes all over the shores, and a cute little artisan town (Nashville?).<br>
<br>
OH - Brother used to teach at OSU, so I've visited Columbus. He took me turkey watching in the hills. Very pretty. And my sister got married south of Cleveland about 20 years ago.<br>
<br>
I've only actually boxed in WI, MN and IL, though. Must remedy that....<br>

Ok so since everyone else is telling there stories, I suppose I will jump<br>
off the bridge too :)<br>
<br>
Wisconsin- Currently reside here, born and raised mostly in the Milwaukee<br>
area, but did live up in Madison for school for several years... yes VBP, I<br>
have conqured some of your boxes as well :) Favorite area in Wisconsin<br>
without a doubt is in Door County, my partner (OneLoveJourneying) and I<br>
spent a few days up there this last August and collected over 50 boxes from<br>
the area, including the first letterbox placed in Wisconsin, what a treasure<br>
and beauty that area is, I highly recommend it!<br>
<br>
IL- As most people have stated, traveled through frequently being that it's<br>
a bordering state, it was significant being that it was my first out of<br>
state letterbox as well. Boy was that a tough find, the location at least!<br>
But it's pretty cool because it is considered one of the most haunted places<br>
in America, It's called "Bachelors Cemetary" in Rubio Woods if anyone is<br>
interested! Looking forward to collecting more.<br>
<br>
OH- My best friend lived in the Dayton area for several years so I have been<br>
that way to visit her, I recommend checking out the airforce base, it houses<br>
many of the old Air Force 1's like Kennedy's plane. As for letterboxing,<br>
only have one box from there, it was a drive by on our way out to the East<br>
Coast called "The Love Box" but I'm sure we will gather more as time goes<br>
on.<br>
<br>
MI- What a beautiful state. I've traveled much of the coastal area as well<br>
as the UP. I must admit, their coast line is much more beautiful than the<br>
Wisconsin side of Lake Michigan...the sand dunes are amazing, and being that<br>
I am the Lighthouse Keeper, Michigan is one of the best places to go... have<br>
a handful of boxes from the UP and the coast, can't wait to go back and see<br>
more of the state.<br>
<br>
IN- Humm.... mostly a drive through state as well, can't really think of<br>
anything too significant as far as ties to the state but I do have a couple<br>
boxes from the area, again driving out East, most were off the freeway.<br>
<br>
MN- Soon to be my future home, transferring there quite soon, haven't really<br>
explored much of the state besides the Twin Cities/St Paul Area but hope to<br>
really soon.  I only have one box from MN which was in StillWater, cute lil<br>
town!<br>
<br>
Thanks for letting me reminisce!<br>
