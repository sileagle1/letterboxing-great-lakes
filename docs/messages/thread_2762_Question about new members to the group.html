any comments or indication of why they are interested in joining the <br/>

bots systematically joining the group.  I suspect the reason their <br/>
membership was denied was lack of comments on the membership <br/>

comment related to letterboxing.  Thanks!<br/>

Tiptoe &amp; Tonto are SOOOO glad that we didn't have to be nominated to <br/>
join this group...We'd surely still be hitting the send button on <br/>
our continually denied application! <br/>
<br/>
We've been out in the Falls Church, VA area for a quick visit with <br/>
family...Although we were only able to box two afternoons on the <br/>
Potomac, we (as usual) had some very wacky things happen! <br/>
<br/>
We went alone on the first day...in the rain!  Tonto packed the rain <br/>
ponchos - when Tiptoe put hers on she realized that it was NOT hers, <br/>
but one belonging to our 6' 2" son!  Thank heavens for the bungie <br/>
cord that was comandeered to serve as a belt!<br/>
<br/>
 We hiked for miles enjoying the nice views of the <br/>
river...thankfully no one else was on the trails!  We looked very <br/>
suspicious stamping in!  Tiptoe squatting down while Tonto covered <br/>
her with his poncho - we didn't realize how it might have looked if <br/>
someone had come upon us out in the woods!  They might not have <br/>
bought into the idea of... in this case... "function over form"!<br/>
<br/>
Our guess is that we were the only ones foolish enough to splat <br/>
around in the mud and rain.  We found all but the last box we were <br/>
looking for..that one (similar to the fate of the old "catapulted <br/>
cow") had the trail come to an abrupt end.  With all the rain <br/>
they've had on the east coast the "small creek" had turned into a <br/>
mighty rushing river and washed out any possible way to get <br/>
across....Tiptoe was determined to go up creek and find a good place <br/>
to ford...Unfortunately, the "No Trespassing" and "Private Keep Out" <br/>
signs made Tonto yell, "Enough is enough!"...and added that she had <br/>
to face the defeat with a little more dignity than loudly cursing in <br/>
the woods.  Besides, he reasoned that if she was caught...or <br/>
worse...drowned in the fast current, he wouldn't be able to explain <br/>
the bungie cord tied around her waist and a weighted "belly-pack" <br/>
filled with markers hidden underneath!<br/>
Being the good little wife that she is..she momentarily hesitated <br/>
before submitting to her good husband's wishes (Take note Doodle &amp; <br/>
Deedle/Leapin' Lizards - secrets to 25 plus years of marriage!)... <br/>
Tonto says this unusual show of respect is rare!<br/>
<br/>
She is still pouting, but safe and dry back in Illinois!<br/>
<br/>
On Day two we took an assortment of nieces, nephews and friends out <br/>
for another afternoon of letterboxing along the Potomac.  Beautiful <br/>
day and in search of some great boxes by well known carver, Scarab.  <br/>
We couldn't wait to get out on the trail.  After much lecturing on <br/>
the importance of keeping natural places unscathed, our 13 y/o <br/>
nephew had scurried down into a stream bed and was poking around <br/>
some rocks.  His 9 y/o sister in quick formation behind him.  He <br/>
screeched out, "Hey, I found a baby snake!"  Before Tiptoe or his <br/>
mother could get him to retreat, he had grabbed a stick and the poor <br/>
little snake had quickly wrapped itself around the stick and was <br/>
hissing. Tonto had gone on ahead with another neice and was nowhere <br/>
to be found to help with the disipline! <br/>
As Tiptoe was exhorting him to put the snake back, he turned <br/>
swinging the dangling thing less than three inches from his sister's <br/>
face.  "Stop!" Tiptoe yelled.<br/>
He raced up the bank begging to have his picture taken with his <br/>
prize...Tiptoe took one look at the cute little baby, gasped, <br/>
snapped a quick picture and calmly told him to put the snake down... <br/>
IMMEDIATELY!!<br/>
She was certain (and later the photo verified) that the cute little <br/>
baby snake was indeed a baby copperhead!<br/>
<br/>
Tiptoe has even more gray hair than before! <br/>
<br/>
One of the boxes had a clue to follow an unofficial trail.  A park <br/>
volunteer had just finished closing off the unofficial trail with a <br/>
huge pile of debris.  We returned later to try and skirt around the <br/>
pile.  Tonto decided to take the male children over the pile while <br/>
Tiptoe stayed back with the females (sounds a little sexist?????)The <br/>
clue states to "pass through/under the fence"..Tonto, wanting to be <br/>
different (or not reading the clues as usual) thought the clue <br/>
said "have the fence go through you!" ..that's exactly what he did!  <br/>
He was successful in finding the box and brought it back to the <br/>
female group to stamp in, but also came back with a nasty, bloody <br/>
gouge in his ankle from the fence.  Yes, we hear ya...the girls <br/>
should've gone to fetch the box!<br/>
<br/>
We cleaned it as best we could, put Neosporin on the "Flesh wound", <br/>
and covered it with the only bandaids we had ..."BARBIE" bandaids!<br/>
(These things have happened to him before and fortunately he was up <br/>
to date on his tetnus shot! By the next day the wound was so swollen <br/>
and infected that a doctor friend had to put him on antibiotics!)<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, we did find all three of Scarab's terrific stamps <br/>
at "NMAI: Anishinaabe Art" letterbox!<br/>
Now, if only we can get up to Michigan to finish that darn 80 Days <br/>
Series!<br/>
