I'd like to propose the next topic - How do you keep warm on long, winter hikes? <br>

Specifically, clothing that allows you do move and stay warm in the more northern states.  <br>
I am trying to provide "no excuses not to box" to my silent boxing partner.  This year I <br>
want to be prepared and not look like the Michelin Man.<br>

I need to have warmer socks (what should I look for ... ?), warmer outer wear, etc.  I don't <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wool socks are good, yet I find synthetic hiking socks just as warm <br>
and they keep their shape better; I usually add thin synthetic liner <br>
socks--wicks away perspiration and keeps blisters from forming (I <br>
wear these in summer too).<br>
<br>
My mother bought Golden Boy a heavy duty windbreaker and wind pants <br>
which I promptly appropriated.  I even wear them downhill skiing. <br>
<br>
Lots of layers underneath--depending on how cold it is, silk long <br>
johns and top (not at all bulky), hiking pants, turtleneck, fleece <br>
vest.  <br>
<br>
When I packed and camped overnight in northern Wisconsin last winter <br>
where temps were below -20 degrees in the morning, I also wore a <br>
wool sweater. A little bulky, but nice and toasty.<br>
<br>
When letterboxing, I wear wool gloves with the fingertips off; they <br>
have a pocked that flips over mitten-like for the hike between <br>
boxes.  $5 at REI. When it's really cold, I can add mittens over <br>
these.<br>

I swear by my flannel lined jeans from Eddie Bauer.  Seems that with <br>
regular jeans, the wind cuts right through and I can't stand the <br>
feeling of long underwear under my jeans -- makes me feel confined and <br>
bulky.  But the flannel lined jeans give warmth and break the wind <br>
without that "bundled up" feeling, and the flannel is nice and soft on <br>
dry winter skin.<br>

We really enjoyed going snowshoeboxing in CT last winter, so the snow <br>
and weather won't keep us from getting outside!<br>
<br>
Think layers -- it's better to have layers that you can remove as <br>
needed to keep yourself warm and dry. If it's snowy out, you need to <br>
keep yourself dry.<br>
<br>
Avoid cotton close to your skin, since it just absorbs moisture.<br>
<br>
Silk (or polypropolene) long underwear are good because they let your <br>
skin breath and aren't bulky.<br>
<br>
Waterproof (not just "water resistant") boots are a must in the snow. <br>
I have a pair of winter boots with liners, but my regular hiking <br>
boots would work fine for me in most conditions, I think, except for <br>
very deep or very wet snow. Wear a pair of sock liners and a pair of <br>
heavy wool or synthetic blend hiking socks to keep your feet warm. I <br>
have gaters that are great for keeping snow out of the top of my boots.<br>
<br>
We also have rain pants that work pretty well in the snow, going over <br>
pants and long underwear without being too bulky. You can really come <br>
to appreciate waterproof pants, since kneeling in the snow when you <br>
stamp into a box is often unavoidable.<br>
<br>
A winter parka can be fine, but make sure it's water and wind <br>
resistant if you'll be out in the snow. And if you're exerting <br>
yourself, a parka can trap heat inside and just make you sweat. I <br>
often just wear layers, topped off by a fleece and a shell, except if <br>
it's really *really* cold.<br>
<br>
A hat is important since you lose a lot of body heat through your <br>
head. Warm and water-resistant gloves are also key, and the problem <br>
often is that you're often taking them on and off to stamp into <br>
letterboxes, and digging in the snow which means a lot of melted snow <br>
on your gloves, so I don't know the best solution here. We both have <br>
glove liners, which are thin gloves that fit inside a warm pair, and <br>
these work pretty well -- I can often handle stamping in while <br>
wearing them (which I wouldn't be able to do in a heavy pair of <br>
gloves). Maybe a pair of big mittens, the kind that open up and let <br>
your fingers out, would be a good solution. I have some polar fleece <br>
gloves that I like, but they're not waterproof, so I take an extra <br>
pair with me. Even gloves that are waterproof can get waterlogged <br>
after digging around in the snow, so a good pair of gloves is really a must.<br>
<br>
We also take a small tarp with us, which is handy to spread out on <br>
the snow or ground to keep us from having to sit or kneel directly on <br>
the ground.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">1.  I agree:  layers, layers, layers!!!  My preferred brand is CuddleDuds, they carry several weights, light silk, heavier for winter, etc.  I wear them skiing too, or just sitting around the house.  I know JC Penney carries them, not sure who else.<br>
   <br>
  2.  Sock liners rule!  I have a bunch of "wicking" liners that keep my feet warm and dry.  Then I wear wool socks over them.<br>
   <br>
  3.  Pants - I don't even own jeans, they're way too cold in the winter.  I prefer the lined warm-up pants, the kind that have the nylon outside and a soft cotton/flannel type lining inside.  I've worn these skiing too if the weather is not TOO cold, of course you can always add that layer of long underpants underneath.<br>
   <br>
  4.  My Columbia ski jacket - great for cutting the wind.<br>
   <br>
  5.  I won't buy hiking boots anymore unless they are Gortex lined.  It is totally worth it to have shoes that will keep you feet completely dry while hiking through a shallow creek.  My boots are about 10 years old, and have duct tape around the top where my dog chewed them up when he was a puppy, but they are soooo comfortable I can't part with them!<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

We've usually gotten ours at a local REI store.  They're probably <br>
available at most outdoor or sports stores.  We've been using the <br>
CoolMax ones.  Here's a link to the REI website that shows you some <br>
