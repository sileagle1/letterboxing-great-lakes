Becki and I are heading up north THIS weekend. Spending the night in portage. Weather permiting we'll be hiking some of Devil's Lake (doubt we'll do the whole thing). Then we're planning on heading to Oshkosh the next next before the long drive home.<br>

So, this Email is basically asking for any dining spots you enjoy along the drive from Portage/Baraboo to Oshkosh . . . or eateries in any of those towns that you could recommend.<br>

Of course, you are free to suggest any "must have" boxes -- that would certainly narrow down my LONG list of boxes I have printed up.<br>

<br>
Our boxes in Oshkosh have fairly easy clues and a couple are driveby.  Of all our boxes in Oshkosh, South Park and Asylum Point would be the two longest ones in terms of time/walk.  But both are still less than a mile.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.  Have fun on your trip and enjoy Oshkosh.  Let me know if you have any other questions about Oshkosh.<br>

NorthStarr -- sorry we didn't meet up. It would've been nice to see you again.<br>

 <br>
We attempted Verona Bird Patrol's box, the Balanced Rock box & Wisconsin Hikers 3 older boxes (2005) -- we found all but the Balanced Rock.<br>
<br>
We parked at the north parking lot, hiked up the west bluff to the south shore, then up balanced rock trail and the east bluff trail back to our van.<br>
<br>
We had a cool day, that suited us fine for all the hiking we did. The fall colors were gorgeous! Becki & I had a wonderful time together (kid free)!<br>
<br>
Next time we will have to hit the lower trails for the rest of the boxes, though, it would be hard passing up the bluff trails -- the scenery is so much nicer up high.<br>
<br>
We spent the night in Portage.<br>
<br>
The next day we drove to Oshkosh and found nearly all of The Gamer Ruetten's boxes in town (minus one we didn't attempt). After picking up a stamp carved by Kirbert, we found the South Park box in Oshkosh -- that was our F1,500!! Then drove up to Asylum Point Lighthouse (we didn't attempt the second box in this series due to hunger). We cleaned Oshkosh out save for one box (now we regret not getting that one - oh well).<br>
<br>
Driving home it got dark early (boo), we did pick up pugnasties "Patriotic Pug" and estella_naparella's "James T. Lewis" boxes on our way home. Tried a couple of boxes in Madison, however, the darkness and the need to get home at a reasonable hour trumped and we gave up the hunt and headed home.<br>
<br>
Sunday, we went to first service at church then headed out to Oregon, Illinois to a youth center/retreat I used to go to as a high schooler. What wonderful memories came back to me. We attended the Olde English Faire at Stronghold and met up with BristolStitch and found a couple of her boxes at the Faire.<br>
<br>
A busy, yet extremely satisfying 3 days.<br>

You're welcome. That imagery was to good to keep to myself.<br>

Merlin & Ardea -- I attempted Balanced Rock box as well. I too was Leary of the placement - I would've labeled that as an extreme box. It even mentions in the clues that the rock climbers anchor their ropes there...... why then would you place a box there? I moved all the loose stones away to find nothing. I didn't stick my hand into that hole though.<br>
<br>
NorthStarr -- sorry we didn't meet up. It would've been nice to see you again.<br>
<br>
We attempted Verona Bird Patrol's box, the Balanced Rock box & Wisconsin Hikers 3 older boxes (2005) -- we found all but the Balanced Rock.<br>
<br>
We parked at the north parking lot, hiked up the west bluff to the south shore, then up balanced rock trail and the east bluff trail back to our van.<br>
<br>
We had a cool day, that suited us fine for all the hiking we did. The fall colors were gorgeous! Becki & I had a wonderful time together (kid free)!<br>
<br>
Next time we will have to hit the lower trails for the rest of the boxes, though, it would be hard passing up the bluff trails -- the scenery is so much nicer up high.<br>
<br>
We spent the night in Portage.<br>
<br>
The next day we drove to Oshkosh and found nearly all of The Gamer Ruetten's boxes in town (minus one we didn't attempt). After picking up a stamp carved by Kirbert, we found the South Park box in Oshkosh -- that was our F1,500!! Then drove up to Asylum Point Lighthouse (we didn't attempt the second box in this series due to hunger). We cleaned Oshkosh out save for one box (now we regret not getting that one - oh well).<br>
<br>
Driving home it got dark early (boo), we did pick up pugnasties "Patriotic Pug" and estella_naparella's "James T. Lewis" boxes on our way home. Tried a couple of boxes in Madison, however, the darkness and the need to get home at a reasonable hour trumped and we gave up the hunt and headed home.<br>
<br>
Sunday, we went to first service at church then headed out to Oregon, Illinois to a youth center/retreat I used to go to as a high schooler. What wonderful memories came back to me. We attended the Olde English Faire at Stronghold and met up with BristolStitch and found a couple of her boxes at the Faire.<br>
<br>
A busy, yet extremely satisfying 3 days.<br>

We just got back from Devil's Lake and tried for the "Balanced Rock" LB.  VERY IFY climb to get to it, and though I cleaned out the crack where it was supposed to be, no box.  It's a favorite spot for climbers so maybe that's what happened to it.<br>
