                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Silent Doug, GREAT review of Dartmoor, thank you. We hope to get <br/>
there within the next year or two and have been curious as to what it <br/>
entails.  Quick question, did you make the 100+ club yet? What all <br/>
does that require besides 100 boxes? I've read you need to present <br/>
picture confirmation of your finds? Can we do this as a couple or do <br/>
you need two sets of pictures? lol I've also read that boxes have <br/>
clues to other boxes? How funny the big debate about storebought <br/>
stamps vs handcarved and the birthplace of letterboxing has almost all <br/>
store bought!  Thank you again for sharing your experiences with us.<br/>
<br/>
