county,  but only 2 weeks after planting it I got an email from the <br/>
first finders!<br/>
<br/>
Other fun was the fact that both our 11 year old and 14 year old <br/>
nephew wanted to go out boxing with us today.  It was nice to chat <br/>
with the boys since we hadn't seen them in a while and they enjoyed <br/>
the "Is your mama a llama?" series as well as several other boxes <br/>
placed by Mama Llama.<br/>
<br/>
We've got lots of boxing planned for the next two weekends and we're <br/>
looking forward to meeting some of you at the Sock Hop on June 1 <br/>
(although we may be a bit late) and at the Cluez-In the following <br/>
day/evening.<br/>
