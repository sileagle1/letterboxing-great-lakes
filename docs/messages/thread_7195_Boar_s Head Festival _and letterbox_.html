                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our church is once again presenting the Boar's Head Festival (we do it every other year). Performances will be on Saturday, 12/10 and Sunday, 12/11 at 4pm.  There is pre-performance music so get there early, as parking can be challenging.  The address of the church is 305 Circle Ave in Forest Park, IL.  To order tickets, call 708-366-2593.  We came close to selling out 2 years ago.  As always, there will be a letterbox hidden somewhere on the premises.  Clues to follow later.   All four of the Waltzing Pigs are involved in the performance.<br>
==========================<br>
Here is the description of the Boar's Head Festival from our flyer:<br>
<br>
Christmas is a time of singing, dancing, music and pageantry, a time for family and friends to rejoice together and celebrate the coming of the Light of the world.  The Boar's Head Festival is just thata celebration of life, light, and hope. <br>
 <br>
What began as a pagan festival was endowed by the early Christians with symbolic religious meaning.  The boar, being the most ferocious beast in the forest, was considered the ultimate symbol of evil.  Its death came to symbolize Christ's victory over sin. <br>
<br>
Into the midst of medieval gallantry, elaborate costumes, yule log and King Wenceslas, appears the Christ Child, the angels, the shepherds, and the three kings. <br>
 <br>
How can this happen together? St. John Evangelical Lutheran Church in Forest Park will show you.  Come experience the pomp and pageantry, the entertainers and musicians of the royal manor house. Come and be a part of the birth of the Christ Child and let His light penetrate and rejuvenate your spirit during this festive time of year.<br>
============================<br>
Hope to see you there. <br>
