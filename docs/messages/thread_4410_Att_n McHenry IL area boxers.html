I would like it if you could add the McHenry County Conservation<br>
 District's website.  We require a permit for all geocaches and<br>
letterboxes.<br>
  The website is www.mccdistrict.org/re-geocache.htm  It is for<br>
 geocaching but most of it still applies to letterboxing as well. <br>
There are<br>
 several on our property.  I have been trying to contact the owners to get<br>
 them to make it right but so far have had no luck!  I thought maybe if<br>
 you could post our website and rules, that would help!<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
