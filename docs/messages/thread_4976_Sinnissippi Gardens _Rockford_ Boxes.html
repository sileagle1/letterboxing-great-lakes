A couple of changes have been made this morning:<br>
1) New directions (same location) for ODE TO A ROSE. We decided <br>
someone must have dumped a body with lead boots into the Rock River to <br>
pull compasses off!<br>
2) New directions ... new location. Following 3 floods, A RIVER RUNS <br>
THROUGH IT has been moved to higher ground.<br>
