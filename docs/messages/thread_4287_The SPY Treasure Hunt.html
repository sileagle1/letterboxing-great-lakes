&gt; Okay, everybody calm down.  Breathe.  While I personally have some <br/>
&gt; reservations about the treasure hunt concept (if they are using boxes <br/>

&gt; proportion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From everything I can see, this is a group of primarily adult <br/>
&gt; letterboxers out having a great time letterboxing.  While we may or <br/>
&gt; may not agree with the way they are going about enjoying the hobby, <br/>
&gt; let's take a step back, and perhaps get the facts, before roasting <br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all were new letterboxers at one time and we all unknowingly did <br/>
&gt; things against the ethics or unwritten rules of letterboxing.  Most <br/>
&gt; who have been around the hobby for some time would agree that stealth <br/>
&gt; is a large and rewarding part of the game, but most of us did not <br/>
&gt; *get it* from day one, and some still don't, or choose not to <br/>
&gt; consider that a crucial element of the game.  By nature stealth is <br/>
&gt; illusive and does not come with a written set of instructions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for respect -- for the environment, by practicing leave-no-trace <br/>
&gt; ethics, and for other people's boxes, by not sharing clues and being <br/>
&gt; certain to rehide boxes well -- these are things that seem obvious to <br/>
&gt; us, but are often a matter of education and experience with new <br/>
&gt; letterboxers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am certainly not saying we should ignore the situation, but I do <br/>
&gt; think it has become a bit dramatic and we haven't really given this <br/>
&gt; group a chance.  They may be very nice folks and once they understand <br/>
&gt; the hobby, could prove to be very enthusiastic letterboxers who plant <br/>
&gt; great boxes to contribute to *our* fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have written to the contact e-mail at the web link, expressing some <br/>
&gt; of our concerns and offering suggestions for learning more about the <br/>
&gt; hobby.  I would also like you to be aware that there may be members <br/>
&gt; of the group who have joined our list and we should welcome them to <br/>
&gt; the hobby and our group and help them learn and understand the things <br/>
&gt; we are saying here, rather than come out swinging.<br/>
