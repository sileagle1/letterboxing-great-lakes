I went through Toledo/Maumee last weekend, and picked up many <br>
letterboxes along the way.  There were a variety of styles and <br>
placements, but they were all fun.  A special thanks to LindaFay, who <br>
is especially creative.  Her Maumee Dogwalk series allows you to <br>
create your own picture, The British are Coming was a really fun <br>
puzzle to solve, and Aunt Phoebe's letterbox is unique (and a little <br>
spooky).  The one that my family liked hearing about the best was Is <br>
It Time For Tea? - it requires you to go in a small teahouse and ask <br>
for the box, and the two women working there were really tickled to <br>
see me.  One of them had no idea about letterboxing, so the other <br>
woman and I explained it to her, and then we all had a good chuckle <br>
about what would have happened if the novice had been behind the cash <br>
register when I got there.  <br>
<br>
Another standout was ateam's Farnsworth Metropark series.  Very <br>
interesting park, good clues, and well-hidden boxes.  And Roxxzilla's <br>
boxes were cute because of the puppy pictures in them. I got most of <br>
the boxes in the Toledo/Maumee/Waterville area, as well as some <br>
farther south in Bowling Green and McComb.  A great letterboxing <br>
trip, and I just want to thank all of the letterboxers in that area <br>
for their contributions!<br>
