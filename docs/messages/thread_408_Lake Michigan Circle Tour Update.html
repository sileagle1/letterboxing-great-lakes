off the ground.  Thanks!!! to those of you who did send me box <br>
information for the circle tour project, but I don't feel as though <br>
there are enough boxes along the route to go through with the <br>
project.  I've held out for a bit and did get a straggler, but it is <br>
still sparse -- not that any one of your boxes in itself is not <br>
worthy, just that the project really needed a better distribution of <br>
boxes to take off.<br>
<br>
But, all is not in vain -- obviously, your boxes stand on their own <br>
for Great Lakes letterbox seekers, and I have not given up on this <br>
entirely, just for this year.  I will try again next spring in hopes <br>
that most of these boxes will still be available and that there will <br>
be others to help make this a go.  I am leaving the information in <br>
the files section, although the dates are wrong...   <br>
<br>
So keep that in mind when winter comes around and you are sitting in <br>
front of a roaring fire adding to your pile of carvings with no home.<br>
<br>
Thanks again to everyone who responded!<br>
