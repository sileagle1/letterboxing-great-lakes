This afternoon, the sky ripped open and it POURED rain in my area.  The streets were full of standing water, and motorists were trying to drive through the standing water.  Some made it. some didn't.  Their cars were floating and twisting around in the water!  <br>
<br>
So I didn't make it back to Hobby Lobby for the new truck shipment today.  But tomorrow is a new day and I'll be looking for the pink stuff at 30% off.  Save some for me!<br>

  (handles, blades and the pink stuff!) are 30% off. No coupon <br>
  needed. I bought the last package of pink rubber. The stockroom <br>
  clerk told me there is a new truck shipment on Thursday. I'll be <br>
  there looking for more bargains. Thought you might like to know <br>
  about the sale. <br>

  just wasn't sure if they would carry that stuff. Their selection of <br>
  rubber stamps were kind of small. I think I'll be going out tomorrow <br>
  to Hobby Lobby and see what they have and get some stuff to get <br>
  started. Thank you again for all the places and info. I will <br>
  definitely check out the websites!!! (HUGS)<br>
