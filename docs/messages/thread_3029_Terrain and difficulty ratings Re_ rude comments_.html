&gt; I tend not to put ratings on our boxes such as "good<br/>
&gt; for kids" or "easy find" or "3 on a scale of 1 to 5"<br/>
&gt; because, well, honestly, I don't know how others will<br/>
&gt; react.  My easy may be someone else's hard, and since<br/>
&gt; we planted the box and knew exactly what we were<br/>
&gt; thinking when we wrote the clues of course we think<br/>
&gt; that all our plants are easy.  I hope that they'll<br/>
&gt; read over the clues and use their best judgement.  Of<br/>
&gt; course, if someone were to email me and ask about a<br/>
&gt; box's difficulty I'd try to help them determine if<br/>
&gt; it's right for them.<br/>
