Hudson Mills Metropark, site of the 2005 gathering.  I'm happy to <br>
report that Mo' Mustangs (Dragon's crazy assemble-your-own-car <br>
letterbox) was still all there and is now prepped for more visitors.  <br>
Also ready for a new season is "Tranquil Moment", the Doglvrs box <br>
we "adopted".  <br>
<br>
Further travels in the area also yielded these results:<br>
Dragon's "Go to Hell" - doing great (especially considering its age).<br>
"Kensington Haiku" and "So Long Michigan '75-'05" both planted by <br>
Delirium before she left the region are each thriving in their <br>
respective locations.  For all you bird freaks out there, there is a <br>
nesting white swan just off the trail betreen these two boxes (at the <br>
edge of the lake).<br>
<br>
That's all the news from the trail today!<br>
