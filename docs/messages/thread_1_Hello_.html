to use this group as a forum for discussion on all things <br/>
letterboxing, particularly as related to boxing in the Great Lakes <br/>

It is my hope that being a part of a smaller group as this will <br/>
encourage sharing of ideas and stories and provide a forum for us to <br/>
become better acquainted with other letterboxers around this region.<br/>
<br/>
Would love to hear your thoughts, ideas and hopes for this group!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for joining!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello, all!  I am a newbie, I just found out about letterboxing<br/>
earlier this week and I am so totally excited!  The day I found out<br/>
about it I went to Hobby Lobby and bought all the things necessary to<br/>
make our stamps.  Our family is myself (Danalee, aka Mom), James 18,<br/>
Jon 16, and Jacob 4.  James also has a girlfriend, Shawna 17, who I<br/>
think will be going along on our adventures.  So anyway, Jacob and I<br/>
sat down to make our stamps last night (which WERE NOT hard to do at<br/>
all like I had thought) and then James and Shawna did their stamp<br/>
together when they got home.  I am planning our first outing this<br/>
weekend, and we are so looking forward to it!<br/>
<br/>
Couple of questions:  first, why do we need a pen?  My understanding<br/>
is that we just trade stamps in books.  Second, how do you find the<br/>
clues that are WOM (word of mouth) only?  I looked on this site, and<br/>
just missed the gathering that I believe was in June.  Third, what do<br/>
you do with a hitchhiker?  Do you take it with you and place it in<br/>
another letterbox?  And how do you let the owner of the HH know about<br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for answering my questions - I hope I'm not a bother to anyone.<br/>
 If so, please forgive me.  I'm just so excited about this new adventure!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the crazy...I mean wonderful...world of letterboxing!  Don't worry about questions.  They're no bother at all, and we all had to start somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Pens are useful to have with you for signing into logbooks.  The only thing that's really required is trading stamps, but most people also at least write the date they were there and their trail name (unless you were clever enough to carve your trail name right into the stamp...a time saving bonus that not all signature stamps have).  A lot of people also jot down a quick message to the placer which could be anything from a comment about how much they liked the stamp, the weather or trail conditions that day, any problems they had with the clues or the trail, etc.<br/>
<br/>
WOM clues are disseminated a number of ways.  Some of them truly are strictly word of mouth and you have to find (or email) another letterboxer to get them.  Some are "WOM" only in the sense that they aren't listed on either of the two main sites (LbNA and Atlasquest) but can be found on private sites.  I believe there are some clues lurking around the files section of this group even.<br/>
<br/>
Hitchikers are also a fairly flexible subject.  Usually you take the HH with you and move it to another box, but you don't have to.  In fact, if you don't expect to find another box for quite a while (like a month or more) it is more polite to simply stamp into the HH log, stamp the HH into your log, and leave it there for the next finder.  And some HH's, like the Migrating Coconuts HH of the Holy Grail series have special rules...in this case, they must ONLY be moved to another box from the Grail series and you need to email Dragon so that their new location can be posted.  Often times the placer of a HH has left their email address in the logbook, but they are also tracked on a couple of websites (Wanda and Pete's HH Page (http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/travelers.html), LbNA, and Atlasquest are the big three).  Letterboxing.org and www.letterboxing.info both have articles that go a bit more into the specifics of hitchikers (as well as a wealth of other LB topics).<br/>
<br/>
As for gatherings, check out the archives on this group and the calendar on Atlasquest for others.  The big one is in June, but there are lots of local gatherings all year (and some of them aren't really so small).<br/>

Thanks for the reply!  Sorry it took me so long to reply back, but<br/>
I've been out letterboxing!  We've found 8 boxes in 2 days, which I<br/>
don't think is too bad for beginners.  We'll be going to the Southern<br/>
Ohio Haunted Trails this weekend coming up in Chillicothe, OH.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm really glad that I stumbled over that article talking about<br/>
letterboxing - it is way too cool!  <br/>
