So be warned - remove LBNA ribbons before going through car washes!<br>

Well, I have to relate this story....<br>
I had a student braid me an LBNA car attenna ribbon that I proudly flew from<br>
my car ever since our WI gathering in March.  I even have a few to give out<br>
as first finders prizes.  Anyway, I took my carin for a simple oil change,<br>
and when they gave me my complementary car wash, the ribbons got caught in<br>
the whirling brushes and it pulled out my car attenna!  They replaced it for<br>
free, but it took a while.<br>
So be warned - remove LBNA ribbons before going through car washes!<br>

<br>
Anyone can have the ribbons.  It was a fad on the "big" list about a <br>
month back.  I was lucky enough to have a student that know how to <br>
braid four/eight strands, so she's been making me a bunch to give <br>
out.  I might be able to bring some to the gathering, or you can <br>
make your own if you can't wait.  (Use orange, blue, red, and lime <br>
colored ribbon.)<br>
