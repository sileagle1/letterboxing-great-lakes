Manic Mechanic today to see what we would find. I spoke with the <br>
woman I had been emailing and she gave me three of my boxes back. I <br>
got the Spider, Japanese Beetle and Bee, which were all placed in <br>
Blackhawk Springs in Rockford. I was really happy to get the Bee back <br>
because it was my favorite stamp carved so far. When we asked about <br>
others they might have, she said that they were the only three. I <br>
guess the ones that were found before then were thrown away because <br>
the people who found them didn't know what a letterbox was. We are <br>
just too stealthy for our own good. ;) So, if you happen to have a <br>
box that was placed in a Winnebago County forest preserve go missing, <br>
it could be in the trash or gone missing by some other means.<br>
<br>
As for me, I'm going to take a break from placing boxes. Call me <br>
cheap, but right now I don't feel like spending the $10 to place a <br>
measly two letterboxes. I know I can find other places besides forest <br>
preserves (which I have), but it has put quite a damper on my <br>
letterboxing spirit. Hopefully I'll get a chance to attend the GL <br>
gathering this summer and it will put me back into the mood to be an <br>
avid letterboxer. :)<br>

you're one of the best that we've got in these here parts!<br>
