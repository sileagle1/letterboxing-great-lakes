                    <div class="plaintext-content">I heard about this via an email sent to all employees at the VAMC where I work, and I thought this might be a good project to tie in with our upcoming gathering:<br>
<br>
"Part of the mission of Operation Support Our Troops-Illinois isto support our wounded heroes.We have been contacted by personnel working in the hospitals in Iraq, Afghanistan, and at Landstulh Medical Center in Germany with a special request. Our injured troops come in and their clothing is usually cut off, just like a hospital emergency room here in the U.S. Instead of wearing hospital gowns, they would appreciate drawstring pajama type pants (sizes large and extra large are most in demand). Please Click Hereto navigate to our "How You Can Help" page which will have more information on this great project."<br>
<br>
"Besides collecting donated goods, we also welcome letters to the troops. Every care package includes at least one letter from a citizen, and these letters are highly prized by their recipients. Consider having your drive include the collection of letters to the troops. Since we send to every branch of the military, and not all military personnel are called soldiers, we prefer the more generic greeting of Dear military person in the letters. Please do not seal the letters. The letters do not require postage and if you would like the individual that receives your letter to possibly write back, include your name and address."<br>
"Also, please save the comics from your Sunday papers and/or comic books. The troops love to receive and read them!"<br>
<br>
So here's my idea:bring and donate a pair of pajama pantsto the gathering, and you can receive the image of a special "Project Pajama Pants"event stamp. If you bring in comics and/or a letter, I'll have my "Love Letters" event stamp available as your reward. (Even if you've already received that image...Snoopy holding a letter...I hope you'll still bring a letter!)<br>
<br>
Sound like a plan??L<br>
