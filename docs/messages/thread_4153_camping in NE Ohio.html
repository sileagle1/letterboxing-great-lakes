  I am planning to camp on this trip to my parents' house and was wondering <br/>
  if any one could recommend a good campground in NE Ohio, along I-90, that <br/>
  is dog-friendly. I am dying to get Squire's Castle letterbox. Every<br/>
  time I drive past there is some form of nasty weather - freezing rain,<br/>
  torrential downpour, snow, darkness... But this time, I'm gonna find<br/>
  that box. There's absolutely no reason for me to fixate on this<br/>
