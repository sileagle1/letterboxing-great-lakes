Repel (100% DEET) is my friend.  It's the strong stuff and some people might have a reaction to it.  So I avoid spraying it directly on my skin.   Just a little spray on my clothes around my neckline, sleeves, and my jeans keeps the mosquitoes away.    Beetle<br>

When I'm out letterboxing or camping for the weekend, I've been using Repel 100 insect repellent.  It's the really strong stuff because it's 100% DEET.  It comes in a 1 oz. liquid pump spray bottle which is small and thin enough to slip into my pocket.  I bought it at a camping/sporting goods store.  I do not see an expiration on this bottle either.  <br>
 <br>
Warning:  Once, I sprayed this product on my shirt and it etched into my plastic name tag.  I have plastic lense eye glasses, so I remove them when spraying as a precaution.   <br>
 <br>
Other factors which might attract mosquitoes:  scented products like perfumes and body sprays, scented deodrants, lotions and creams body wash and scented soap, even some scented sunblock. My camping experience and training has taught me that mosquitoes seem to be more active at sunrise and at sundown.  <br>
