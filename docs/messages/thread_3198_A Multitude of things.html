Do to many different reasons we have not been very active on this <br>
board, or on the trails recently.  I was able to comment on the <br>
Museum Boxes because that thread happened to be on the home page <br>
when I was able to find some "online" time.  Today at work, I found <br>
some more time (which is very rare) and was able to catch up on <br>
reading some digests.  If you will all indulge me for just a moment <br>
I have some comments to add to recent topics.<br>

Everyone is doing very well, our doctor is very happy and Mrs. <br>
Cottontails is very round (hee hee).  I don't remember if we let <br>
people know, but we now know the sex of both babies....A Boy AND A <br>
Girl!!  Our lives have become very hectic getting our very small <br>
house ready for two more people.  We have had to move everything out <br>
of our second bedroom, which meant finding a new home for the <br>
computer, and then the dinning room table, and then the couch, yada <br>
yada yada.  We also seem to spend all of our time between doctor <br>
visits and ultrasounds.  All of this was compounded two weeks ago <br>
when the doctor decided that Mrs. Cottontails needed to stop working <br>
and take it easy starting tomorrow (Friday) which meant making sure <br>
everything was ready in her classroom.<br>
Yes, the Domedreamers are my sister and brother-in-law, they were <br>
very happy/excited to meet you as they have heard us go on and on <br>
about your gatherings.  It is their fault we discovered this <br>
incredible hobby.<br>
<br>
On that note... I wish that was the way everyone was introduced to <br>
the hobby.  We had someone who took us around and showed us the <br>
right way to box.  The articles in magazines and newspapers and the <br>
Girl Scout badge, I am sure are good things that are also well <br>
intentioned.  However, I also feel that they fall short in really <br>
explaining things.  Many of you know about the problems that have <br>
befallen our boxes, we recently pulled Sternenacht after box 3 <br>
disappeared again.  Two bonus boxes (on different series) have gone <br>
missing recently.  We think that we will recarve box 3 again, but we <br>
are toying with the idea of just hiding those boxes in our yard and <br>
restricting access to the clues.  We are also toying with the idea <br>
of doing something similar to FungasWoman with our clues.  Only time <br>
will tell.<br>
<br>
To Cmoon and Kookaburra...<br>
<br>
<br>
I am very saddened to hear of the loss of your boxes, many of those <br>
were our first finds, and also our favorites.  Your boxes really <br>
helped get us addicted to this hobby.  History Tower was one of our <br>
favorite hiding places.  I hope that once our team is ready we will <br>
still have Cmoon and Kookaburra boxes to find.<br>
<br>
Last...<br>
<br>
I don't remember who, but someone was looking for a place to have <br>
their stamps remade for them.  If you contact me offlist I can help <br>
you with that, it is what I do (sort of).<br>
<br>
Also, if anyone has contacted me about boxes recently, I am sorry <br>
that I have not responded, I just haven't had the time.  I am going <br>
to try to catch up on my correspondence in the coming weeks.<br>

Thanks for listening and Keep boxing,<br>

Hello All,<br>
<br>
Do to many different reasons we have not been very active on this<br>
board, or on the trails recently.  ... . Today at work, I found<br>
some more time (which is very rare) and was able to catch up on<br>
reading some digests.<br>
.<br>
 =====================<br>
<br>
Hey Cottontails!  Thanks for the update, we've been wondering how you were<br>
all doing.  Glad to hear things are going fairly well.  Maybe Mrs..<br>
Cottontail will be more active on the board if she is stuck home on bedrest,<br>
or will she be busy reading all those "new parent" books?  We're bummed to<br>
hear about Sternenacht since we still only have 2 of the 3 layers!  We're<br>
starting to look at IL again for some "winter weekends" and had hoped to<br>
include the missing one in our hunting.<br>
<br>
Send us baby updates when you can!<br>

It was so good to hear an update from you guys!  Glad to hear that mom and the babies are doing fine -- I'm sure you must be so excited as you make preparations for the arrival of your two little bundles of love!<br>
