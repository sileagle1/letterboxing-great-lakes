What a wonderful surprise!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure the look on my face was priceless when I looked up (and up,<br/>
and up) and there stood Tonto!  Before I could screech "what are you<br/>
doing here?" Tiptoe came running over, big smile, arms flailing... <br/>
Hugs were exchanged all around and after catching up on where<br/>
everyone's life was at, T&amp;T set out in search of the letterboxes at<br/>
the musuem.  It was great fun watching them strategize, running to and<br/>
fro, from floor to floor, collecting clues and bits of information.  I<br/>
am happy to hear all 4 boxes were found!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to everyone else who made it out to the museum yesterday.<br/>
 We enjoyed meeting everyone and the laid-back atmosphere of the day<br/>
made conversations very easy.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes will be at the GR Public Museum through May 11, so if you<br/>
haven't been there yet, there is still time to make the drive for<br/>
these limited edition treasures.<br/>

&gt; "Hey Tonto, how do you feel about bribery?" Tiptoe asked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Huh? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Bribery, arm twisting...you know, providing a little influence for<br/>
our well being!  We're <br/>
&gt; from Chicago...we know how things are done!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "What on earth are you talking about?"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Spring Chick has sent out an invitation to visit her and Azobox at<br/>
the Grand Rapids Public <br/>
&gt; Museum today where they will be manning a letterbox information<br/>
table. I was thinking <br/>
&gt; maybe we could pay them a little visit and personally persuade<br/>
Spring Chick to pick our <br/>
&gt; remaining BINGO words....if ya know watt-a-mean!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Grand Rapids is two and a half hours away...and not to mention the<br/>
price of gas.."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "PLEASEEEEEEE.....After all, it is BINGO and we WANT those Doglvr socks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So went the conversation....until Tiptoe finally came out the victor!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We drove up and surprised the GLK letterboxing duo...(aka the King<br/>
and Queen as noted <br/>
&gt; by their little crowns after their names as "moderator"!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We spent the day at the museum, which by the way, is<br/>
wonderful...found four <br/>
&gt; letterboxes...had a great dinner at Charlie's Crab...stopped in<br/>
South Haven at our favorite <br/>
&gt; ice cream shop..Sherman's (double chocolate malt!!!!)....now open<br/>
for the season...(A <br/>
&gt; definite sign that the WARM weather is coming!)  A great<br/>
day...EXCEPT...Spring Chick <br/>
&gt; wouldn't agree to "fix" our call...If we happen to win those socks,<br/>
it will be wholly on our <br/>
&gt; own luck!  She was not to be bought, bribed or cajoled into any<br/>
under the table deals!  So <br/>
&gt; those of you reading and thinking of the same...forget it!  BUT, if<br/>
you can get up to the <br/>
&gt; museum to get those boxes...Go for it...they are so worth the trip!<br/>
&gt; Thanks to those fine carvers of stamps hidden at the museum...And as<br/>
usual, thanks to <br/>
&gt; Azobox and Spring Chick for making our day with your bright smiles!<br/>
 It warmed our cold <br/>
&gt; little hearts more than you know!<br/>

&gt; &gt; We will have a letterboxing info table set up at the Grand Rapids<br/>
&gt; &gt; Public Museum again tomorrow (Saturday, March 29) in conjunction with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Azobox and myself will be there between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. so<br/>
&gt; &gt; stop and see us while you are there.  We will have the Public<br/>
