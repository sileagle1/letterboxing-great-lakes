What a wonderful surprise!<br>
<br>
I'm sure the look on my face was priceless when I looked up (and up,<br>
and up) and there stood Tonto!  Before I could screech "what are you<br>
doing here?" Tiptoe came running over, big smile, arms flailing... <br>
Hugs were exchanged all around and after catching up on where<br>
everyone's life was at, T&T set out in search of the letterboxes at<br>
the musuem.  It was great fun watching them strategize, running to and<br>
fro, from floor to floor, collecting clues and bits of information.  I<br>
am happy to hear all 4 boxes were found!<br>
<br>
Thanks also to everyone else who made it out to the museum yesterday.<br>
 We enjoyed meeting everyone and the laid-back atmosphere of the day<br>
made conversations very easy.<br>
<br>
The boxes will be at the GR Public Museum through May 11, so if you<br>
haven't been there yet, there is still time to make the drive for<br>
these limited edition treasures.<br>
