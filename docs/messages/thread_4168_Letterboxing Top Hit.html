We are more associated with the Pink Panther when it comes to sleuthing!<br>
Often we have the tune of that top hit running circles in our heads as <br>
we are trying to figure out even the easiest of clues...Maybe we would <br>
have better luck if we had our son following us on the trail playing <br>
his guitar singing this version of the letterboxing anthem!<br>

Okay, question...how do you explain letterboxing to someone who observes you trying to plant a box?  I felt like a fool tonight as we were putting out our first boxes and were discovered!  We eventually got permission to put the box at the edge of the man's property, and I did know him, sort of, but...how hard to explain!  Any hints?  Thanks...The Newbie Huntin-Dogs<br>
