Girl Scouts may not raise or solicit money for other organizations.   This situation comes up every year.  But FW <br/>
is right on target when she explains that the girls can discuss and vote to donate part of the treasury to a cause.<br/>
Girl Scouts can collect items but not money.  <br/>

  Not to be a spoilsport, but remember Safety-Wise and GSUSA policy <br/>
  will not let you collect money for any other organization. Your <br/>
  troop can PROMOTE the fundraiser, but cannot actively collect money <br/>
  for it. They can choose to donate part of their treasury (cookie <br/>
  sale profits, etc.) to the cause however, and yes, they can wear the <br/>
  patches on the back of their vests. <br/>
<br/>
  (I know, it's stupid. My daughter wanted to do a collection for a <br/>
  local PD's K9 unit for her Gold Award and was shot down for this very <br/>
  reason.)<br/>
<br/>
  As to the details of getting the patches, I defer to Scoutdogs....<br/>

  &gt; I just talked to our service unit director (girl scouts) and she <br/>

  &gt; ok with Scoutdogs, that I can make up a flyer for my troop. If <br/>
  they want to<br/>
  &gt; help Amigo and send the $20 or more donation, they can put the <br/>

  &gt; think this is one they will LOVE! I will not be at the event so <br/>
  this would<br/>
  &gt; have to be through the mail. I could collect all the donations and <br/>
  send<br/>

  &gt; the patches to be sent to me to pass out to those who participate.<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Speaking of patches, have we got an offer for you!<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; You may recall that Scoutdogs is participating in a fundraiser with <br/>
  her Dog<br/>
  &gt; Scouts troop to raise money to purchase a bullet-proof police dog <br/>
  vest the<br/>
  &gt; same day. She has also graciously carved a special stamp which <br/>
  will be<br/>
  &gt; available at the S.I.L.O. if you make a donation (any size <br/>
  graciously and<br/>
  &gt; gratefully accepted) to the cause. However, anyone who makes a <br/>
  donation of<br/>
  &gt; $20 or more can receive a patch (I posted a copy of it in SD's <br/>
  photo album<br/>
  &gt; if you'd like to see it). I will not have the patches with me, but <br/>
  make<br/>
  &gt; sure you give me your address (unless you write a check and it's <br/>
  printed<br/>
  &gt; there). I will forward them to her (along with the donations) and <br/>
  she will<br/>
  &gt; mail them out. <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; A link to her website with a photo of Amigo, the recipient of the <br/>
  vest:<br/>
  &gt; www.DogScoutTroop107.com<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; SD, would you like to say anything more??<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; P.S. I forgot to mention that I will be bringing the last 10 <br/>
  remaining<br/>
  &gt; Great Lakes patches to the event in case anyone wants to purchase <br/>
  one ($1.50<br/>
  &gt; per patch)<br/>
