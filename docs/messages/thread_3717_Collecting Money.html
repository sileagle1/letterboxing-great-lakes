Girl Scouts may not raise or solicit money for other organizations.   This situation comes up every year.  But FW <br>
is right on target when she explains that the girls can discuss and vote to donate part of the treasury to a cause.<br>
Girl Scouts can collect items but not money.  <br>

  Not to be a spoilsport, but remember Safety-Wise and GSUSA policy <br>
  will not let you collect money for any other organization. Your <br>
  troop can PROMOTE the fundraiser, but cannot actively collect money <br>
  for it. They can choose to donate part of their treasury (cookie <br>
  sale profits, etc.) to the cause however, and yes, they can wear the <br>
  patches on the back of their vests. <br>
<br>
  (I know, it's stupid. My daughter wanted to do a collection for a <br>
  local PD's K9 unit for her Gold Award and was shot down for this very <br>
  reason.)<br>
<br>
  As to the details of getting the patches, I defer to Scoutdogs....<br>
