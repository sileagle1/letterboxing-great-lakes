WooHoo!  WTG You guys!  Glad to see someone doing well!  I had 3 in <br>
the N row.  That's the closest I was!<br>
<br>
Considering I have NO corners, only 2 in any diagonal type place, I <br>
won't be calling bingo any time soon.  I DO have 5 in the perimeter <br>
though.  That doesn't seem like a lot, but maybe it's a good <br>
start?  Not sure!<br>
<br>
Can I change my "side wagers" date from March 9 to something like <br>
July 9?  LOL  I think I was waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy off on that prediction!<br>
