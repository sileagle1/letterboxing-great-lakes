                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received a question about what is involved in hosting a gathering <br>
and I think it would be beneficial to post this reply to the list <br>
rather than individually respond since others may be wondering the <br>
same thing.<br>
<br>
Hosting a gathering requires a commitment and some work, but it is <br>
also very rewarding and can be a lot of fun if you just take things <br>
as they come and don't overplan or overstress.  It gives you a chance <br>
to meet a lot of people and to try out ideas that you have seen/heard <br>
of from other gatherings around the country.<br>
<br>
It would be best to have a couple of teams responsible for hosting -- <br>
it is a lot of work for just one person/team.  It helps if you have <br>
been to a gathering before, but it is not a necessity as sometimes <br>
going in without preconceived ideas and procedure can generate fresh <br>
ideas.  Also keep in mind that there are several people within this <br>
group who have hosted letterbox gatherings and are more than willing <br>
to answer questions and give feedback.<br>
<br>
That said...  what is involved?<br>
<br>
-  Scouting/choosing a specific park/location within the decided <br>
geographic locale (1)<br>
-  Making arrangements for a shelter at the chosen location (2)<br>
-  Deciding on a theme for the event -- this can either be chosen by <br>
the hosting group or suggestions put up for a vote at the list<br>
-  Publicizing the event -- posting to letterboxing Yahoo! lists, <br>
AtlasQuest, etc.  (get the word out)<br>
-  Soliciting letterboxers to carve and send letterboxes to be <br>
planted at the gathering location (participants, area boxers, boxers <br>
from afar, etc.)<br>
-  Planting letterboxes that are sent for the gathering and writing <br>
clues to distribute at the gathering<br>
-  Making arrangements for traveling event boxes if desired (this <br>
will be more easily faciliated as there is a new Yahoo! group <br>
specific to traveling event boxes)<br>
-  Returning letterboxes and traveling event boxes to appropriate <br>
people after the event (some boxes may be planted as permanent, <br>
others may want their box returned)<br>
-  Arranging for workshop(s), if desired -- you do not have to <br>
conduct these yourself, but would need to coordinate topics/leaders<br>
-  Arranging for any other activities as desired (i.e. kid's <br>
activities, games, special guests/speakers, presentations/displays, <br>
overnight activities -- be creative!)<br>
-  Carving or making arrangements for somebody else to carve the <br>
official "event stamp"<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTES:<br>
<br>
(1) Some things to consider about the location:<br>
<br>
-  Does this location have a specific policy on letterboxing? (i.e. <br>
would not meet at a National Park)<br>
-  Does this location have a reservable shelter capable of handling <br>
50-60 people?<br>
-  Does this location have a large enough trail system to handle <br>
planting letterboxes that are sent from participants?<br>
-  What are the park hours?  Shelter hours?<br>
-  Is there nearby camping?  hotels?  other lodging?<br>
-  How convenient is the location from major highways? (don't want <br>
too many people wandering around aimlessly looking for the park)<br>
<br>
<br>
(2) Renting the shelter:<br>
<br>
-  Shelter does not need to be fully enclosed, but should have a roof<br>
-  Shelter should be capable of comfortably handling around 50-60 <br>
people<br>
-  Also consider space if there will be workshops, kid's activities, <br>
etc.<br>
-  Electricity is nice for potluck participants, but not absolutely <br>
necessary<br>
-  How close are the restrooms?  water?<br>
-  You will most likely need to pay for the shelter when you reserve <br>
it -- at the gathering we pass a hat to cover the cost of the shelter<br>
<br>
<br>

I am planning a Spring gathering in the Twin Cities area (MN) I would like to get my fellow Minnesotan boxers together to finally meet each other. To the best of my knowledge we have never had a Mn. gathering. I would also like to meet all of the people I've come to know through their boxes I've been to. Alot of them are from Wisconsin and The Twin Cities is close by. We have a plethora of state parks that would be perfect for a gathering. We also have over 60 boxes in the Twin Cities area that would be great for people coming to the gathering. Many of them are very close to each other. The planning is a large undertaking I'm sure so I wanted to get started as soon as possible. Thank you for the tips, I'll be advertising my idea everywhere I can soon. <br>

  > NOTES:<br>
  > <br>
  > (1) Some things to consider about the location:<br>
  > <br>
  > - Does this location have a specific policy on letterboxing? (i.e. <br>
  > would not meet at a National Park)<br>
  > - Does this location have a reservable shelter capable of handling <br>
  > 50-60 people?<br>
  > - Does this location have a large enough trail system to handle <br>
  > planting letterboxes that are sent from participants?<br>
  > - What are the park hours? Shelter hours?<br>
  > - Is there nearby camping? hotels? other lodging?<br>
  > - How convenient is the location from major highways? (don't want <br>
  > too many people wandering around aimlessly looking for the park)<br>
  > <br>
  > <br>
  > (2) Renting the shelter:<br>
  > <br>
  > - Shelter does not need to be fully enclosed, but should have a roof<br>
  > - Shelter should be capable of comfortably handling around 50-60 <br>
  > people<br>
  > - Also consider space if there will be workshops, kid's activities, <br>
  > etc.<br>
  > - Electricity is nice for potluck participants, but not absolutely <br>
  > necessary<br>
  > - How close are the restrooms? water?<br>
  > - You will most likely need to pay for the shelter when you reserve <br>
  > it -- at the gathering we pass a hat to cover the cost of the shelter<br>
  > <br>
