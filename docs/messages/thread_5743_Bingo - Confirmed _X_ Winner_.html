So folks, all interim games have now been claimed and we are down to the full card.  Remember for full card, you can use the wildcard in place of any space on your board, and we play for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to all!<br/>

Yesterday was a great LB day: won a bingo game, planted a box, and found Dragon's LockBox finally!<br/>
<br/>
As I woke up this morning, I realized I didn't even try to lift the flaps on the box - I just sat there trying different combos on the lock.  Now I wonder if the lid of the LnL would've lifted off.  Hmmm.  So, all you math geeks, how many possible combos are there with three dials (0-9)?<br/>
<br/>
And today is starting out good - I get to YELL "bingo"!  :-)<br/>

P.S.  We were at a Letterboxing Pub Crawl event a couple of years ago and<br/>
one of the boxes required the teams to unlock a padlock.  Our team hadn't<br/>
spotted the combination hidden in the clues, but one of the members decided<br/>
it wouldn't take very long to try every combination.  Sure enough, they were<br/>
right!  I don't remember how long it took, but less than for us all to get a<br/>
drink and consume it!<br/>
