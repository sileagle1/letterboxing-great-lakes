                    <div class="plaintext-content">We planned a 3-day weekend AUG 12-14 to finally embark on our Around <br>
the World in 80 Days tour.  Unfortunately our travels had an <br>
inauspicious start with the cancellation of the Lake Express ferry.  <br>
This meant a long drive to MI, but we arrived safe and sound.<br>
<br>
We had received our very professional passport on July 31 and <br>
deciphered the clever clues that week.  We were excited to begin our <br>
actual tour on Saturday morning.  We were able to visit 6 cities on <br>
Saturday, 7 on Sunday and the last two on Monday.  Woo hoo!!  We were <br>
quite pleased to be able to visit every city in our whirlwind tour.  <br>
Very nice stamps and some challenging searches!! <br>
<br>
After our first day of travels, we enjoyed the generous hospitality <br>
of the Doglvrs family.  We enjoyed dining with them, exchanging LB <br>
stories and getting to meet the basis for their trailname - dogs <br>
Emily, Alex and Lana.  The family are true animal lovers since they <br>
also have two cats!!<br>
<br>
We had hoped to also meet with Azobox, but the challenges of our <br>
searches on Sunday consumed more time than expected.<br>
<br>
Luckily we had enough time on Monday to visit many of the newer boxes <br>
in Yankee Springs and during the course of the weekend found three <br>
other boxes useful to another Quest.<br>
<br>
We thought we might be able to rendevous with Grandvilla & <br>
MobiusKlein on Monday evening before we caught the late ferry home, <br>
but ALAS, the ferry was cancelled AGAIN!  Another long drive, but we <br>
arrived home safe and sound with approximately 1,400 miles under our <br>
belt.<br>
<br>
In addition to the boxes, items of interest along the way included <br>
many deer, two fat racoons scurrying up a tree, a turkey hen crossing <br>
the road in front of us, tasty turkey jerky and some MI peaches <br>
(we're amazed that they grow peaches in MI!).<br>
<br>
Thanks to all of you who place boxes and make these adventures <br>
possible!!<br>

I  talked with someone who has plans of coming from Wisconsin to  <br>
Michigan on the ferry at the end of the month - and she told me that  <br>
the ferry was down because of some repair  that needed to be done and  <br>
that they had to get some part from Germany.... hopefully the part  <br>
will arrive soon and it will be up and running quickly!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ferry seems to be having lots of problems lately.  Some <br>
supposedly "weather" but many mechanical.  Their website has revised <br>
schedules to accommodate some maintenance this coming weekend.<br>
<br>
Two years ago we took the ferry and both crossings were on time.  <br>
However BindleBabe and Mrs. Doglvrs ran into a cancellation last fall <br>
when they were coming to WI.  Moral of the story is to call in advance <br>
before heading to the ferry dock (or check their website).  Luckily we <br>
did this early enough yesterday that we were able to start driving well <br>
before the ferry would have departed and therefore got home 1.5 hours <br>
earlier than if we had taken the ferry.  However it would have been <br>
much more relaxing sitting on the ferry sipping a glass of wine!<br>

Well what a coinkidink, Hiker! We happened to be in western MI at the same<br>
time! We were trying to come back to WI on the ferry on the 12th, and got<br>
stuck in MI for an extra day. This might not have been so bad, but I had<br>
tickets to a concert that night and I ended up missing it. Bummer.<br>

We planned a 3-day weekend AUG 12-14 to finally embark on our Around<br>
the World in 80 Days tour. Unfortunately our travels had an<br>
inauspicious start with the cancellation of the Lake Express ferry.<br>
This meant a long drive to MI, but we arrived safe and sound.<br>
<br>
We had received our very professional passport on July 31 and<br>
deciphered the clever clues that week. We were excited to begin our<br>
actual tour on Saturday morning. We were able to visit 6 cities on<br>
Saturday, 7 on Sunday and the last two on Monday. Woo hoo!! We were<br>
quite pleased to be able to visit every city in our whirlwind tour.<br>
Very nice stamps and some challenging searches!!<br>
<br>
After our first day of travels, we enjoyed the generous hospitality<br>
of the Doglvrs family. We enjoyed dining with them, exchanging LB<br>
stories and getting to meet the basis for their trailname - dogs<br>
Emily, Alex and Lana. The family are true animal lovers since they<br>
also have two cats!!<br>
<br>
We had hoped to also meet with Azobox, but the challenges of our<br>
searches on Sunday consumed more time than expected.<br>
<br>
Luckily we had enough time on Monday to visit many of the newer boxes<br>
in Yankee Springs and during the course of the weekend found three<br>
other boxes useful to another Quest.<br>
<br>
We thought we might be able to rendevous with Grandvilla &<br>
MobiusKlein on Monday evening before we caught the late ferry home,<br>
but ALAS, the ferry was cancelled AGAIN! Another long drive, but we<br>
arrived home safe and sound with approximately 1,400 miles under our<br>
belt.<br>
<br>
In addition to the boxes, items of interest along the way included<br>
many deer, two fat racoons scurrying up a tree, a turkey hen crossing<br>
the road in front of us, tasty turkey jerky and some MI peaches<br>
(we're amazed that they grow peaches in MI!).<br>
<br>
Thanks to all of you who place boxes and make these adventures<br>
possible!!<br>
