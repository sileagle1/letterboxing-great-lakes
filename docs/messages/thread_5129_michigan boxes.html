the end of May and has been non-stop the past few weeks.  I thought<br/>
last year was overwhelming because I was new to the job, but this year<br/>
was far busier -- everyone says because this year I know what I need<br/>
to be doing.  Anyway camp is full of kids now and things are settling<br/>
into a pleasant routine so it should slow down for me a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize to anyone who e-mailed me and didn't get a reply... I am<br/>
afraid that my e-mail box overfloweth.  I will be slowing wading<br/>
through messages over the next few days, and then resuming work on<br/>
getting my box clues back online... my web hosting issues could not<br/>
have come at a worse time.<br/>
<br/>
It has been cool around here, actually quite pleasant weather for<br/>
letterboxing and I have wistfully thought of the trail and unfound<br/>
boxes many times.<br/>

I thought I'd take this opportunity to introduce myself.  I'm Bill, my<br/>
trail name on LbNA is Chilly, and I live in the most southwesterly<br/>
part of west Michigan.  Retired Navy photographer, engaged to Mary,<br/>
work part time, sail, ride motorcycles, xc and downhill ski, ski<br/>
patrol... I come here via geocaching where I am planting a couple of<br/>
letterbox hybrids.  To bring this around to the topic, they'll be in<br/>
the most northwesterly part of southwestern Michigan.  Been doing my<br/>
homework, trying to absorb the history and traditions, just finished<br/>
carving my first stamp, got a couple of lock n lock boxes together...<br/>
I'm writing the clues both with, and without, the requirement to use a<br/>
GPSr, and will post the latter on LbNA.  Looking forward to visiting<br/>
lots of boxes, putting out a few. and running into many of you along<br/>
they way.<br/>

Our family hails from south side Holland also! As RobinHoodandMerryMen, we have been letterboxing for about 2 years now. We have also dabbled in Geocaching, but prefer letterboxing. We would be very interested in checking out your boxes! It's a great family activity, and we're fortunate to live in an area where there are so many great boxes.<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
