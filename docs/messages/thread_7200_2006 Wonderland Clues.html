I contacted WiHi to see if she had an electronic clue packet, but I just missed her! So she suggested I ask around to see if anyone has it still they could send my way. So anyone? We are going out Sunday, so if anyone can search their emails or files I would greatly appreciate it!!<br>

<br>
What started off to be a rainy day, and a late start, Pitties and I finally got up there and by then the rain had quite and the sun was out(turned out to be really nice!)<br>
I wanted LSB's 2 Pin Ups in the area, so we started with Alice(whoah man what a hike, but most defiantly worth it, and the spring was nice!) and later found Rita. We also had time for 3 others in the park before we parted. <br>
<br>
<br>
We will defiantly have to come back for more time in Wonderland! <br>
