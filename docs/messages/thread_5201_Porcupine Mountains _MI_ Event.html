                    <div class="plaintext-content">I (mis)stated in a previous e-mail that the Porcupine Mountains<br>
Hunter's Harvest Festival was being held on Labor Day weekend, when in<br>
actuality is the weekend following Labor Day...  my error, I had the<br>
right dates, but didn't realize Labor Day was on the 1st this year.<br>
<br>
So, the Porcupine Mountains expo is Saturday and Sunday, September<br>
6-7.  There will be an information table/booth about letterboxing. <br>
Although not really a letterbox event, there just may be an<br>
event-related stamp available to anyone who visits the information table.<br>
<br>
Also, I am looking for anyone who may be willing to help out by<br>
sitting at the info table for a few hours either day.  It is not<br>
difficult, you basically sit there and talk to people who stop and<br>
inquire what letterboxing is, etc.  I realize that the Porkies are not<br>
exactly local to many people, but if you are going to be up that way<br>
or can arrange a trip and would be willing to help out, please contact<br>
me offlist.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
