                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last week, I posted about the City of Streator<br>
contemplating selling the Spring Lake Park property. <br>
Spring Lake is where I have planted the Terminal Tower<br>
Box from Doodle and Deedle Bug as part of the Great<br>
Lakes Exchange.  <br>
<br>
Well it's official, the council has voted to sell the<br>
property.  The sale will be finalized at the next<br>
council meeting which is the third Wednesday in<br>
August.  <br>
<br>
I will leave the letterbox in through August 10th,<br>
after which time it will be pulled until I find out<br>
further as to the fate of this park and a new home for<br>
the box.  <br>
<br>
There is a petition going around to save the park, I<br>
will post the link here later.  <br>

Just to post an update regarding Spring Lake, the city found that <br>
they could not sell it, because it needs to be kept for recreational <br>
use.   However, the council is now claiming that because they are <br>
aware of people swimming, geocaching, letterboxing, bike riding, etc <br>
that it has become a liability for them.    The council has decided <br>
instead to prohibit access, fence the area off and post it as no <br>
trespassing.  I personally would like to see it changed into a <br>
letterbox park....I don't think one exists anywhere..does it?    Any <br>
letterboxers who would like to sound off on this decision and see a <br>
lb be kept there, or have been to the park and enjoyed it, you can <br>
email city manager John D. Kolata at:  email@ci.streator.il.us<br>
