contemplating selling the Spring Lake Park property. <br/>
Spring Lake is where I have planted the Terminal Tower<br/>
Box from Doodle and Deedle Bug as part of the Great<br/>
Lakes Exchange.  <br/>
<br/>
Well it's official, the council has voted to sell the<br/>
property.  The sale will be finalized at the next<br/>
council meeting which is the third Wednesday in<br/>
August.  <br/>
<br/>
I will leave the letterbox in through August 10th,<br/>
after which time it will be pulled until I find out<br/>
further as to the fate of this park and a new home for<br/>
the box.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a petition going around to save the park, I<br/>
will post the link here later.  <br/>

letterboxers who would like to sound off on this decision and see a <br/>
