straight-forward clues that do not necessarily require computer access<br/>

   I like your clues... In the "Sandy Seasons Series", You had me back tracking several times to find the darned "Caterpillar across the trail"!!.... I don't always research my clues to death before going out to the trail either.. Must be the ADD in me. :)<br/>
   In either case, straight forward, imaginative, and sometimes down right bizzare clues tend to draw me in. For me it's the walking adventure, and discovery, and finding that unique stamp (Prefer Hand Carved, But Store bought works as long as location fits) that keeps me hunting....<br/>
   Just my two cents...  <br/>

We really like clues that are puzzles or require some research.  That <br/>
was the one aspect that intrigued us the most when we started <br/>
letterboxing and it gives us a sense of satisfaction to solve the <br/>
puzzle/clues. Since we already hiked quite a bit, the clues were the <br/>
novelty for us.  (We later also developed a real appreciation for the <br/>
stamps.) <br/>
<br/>
We also enjoy a story type clue, whether it is based on true history <br/>
or just an amusing tale.  These can be very informative &amp; <br/>
entertaining while we are on the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Our very favorite boxes are those that cleverly combine clues, <br/>
location and stamp image so that they all hang together as <br/>
a "package", with each individual component obviously related to the <br/>
theme. <br/>

while you are on your search for the box/stamp.  I like it when the <br/>
clues not only give the directions to the box, but also tell you a <br/>
little about the area, the historical site, the natural history, etc.  <br/>
That being said, I also like some variety in the clues--sometimes it is <br/>
nice to have straightforward directions, and other times it is fun to <br/>
have to decipher more cryptic clues or to solve a puzzle.<br/>

When that information is included in the clues, it lets us better <br/>

if there is extra time later in the day, we can do some shorter <br/>

passing through an area. I print out all the boxes we will be passing <br/>
and have to stop when we run out of time, since letterboxing we have <br/>

say " __ minutes" cause when time is running out they go to the top <br/>
of the list. The longer 1-2 hours are the start of our day and the <br/>
undisclosed get shifted in and out of the list as the day goes. Those <br/>
are bonuses in my opinion and don't expect everyone to includ them, <br/>
what might be 15 minutes to the planter may be a few hours to me <br/>
(refering to the one box I cannot find, we attempted it our 5th time <br/>
this weekend, still no luck, not sure when we are going up north <br/>
again this year, but now my husband is the one that is determaned we <br/>
will find this box, then he says after that we will have to stop at <br/>
this roadside park every time we pass by cause its become such a <br/>
tradition. We have let other boxes go without much thought not sure <br/>
why this one is eating at us so.)<br/>

I love the solving even when they are "turn left at the green pole" <br/>
all the way "to decypher these jumbled letters THEN sort them into <br/>
words" (I was surprised that cypher didn't take me more than an hour <br/>

following them and I like being the leader with my kids watching me <br/>
in amazement "how'd she know that?". I guess my favorite is when I <br/>
can do most the solving from looking at the print out at home and <br/>
when I get out into the field it's more of "checking my answers" to <br/>
see if I got it right. I'm not very good with google (I haven't <br/>
figured out how anyone could mess up an internet search but I sure <br/>
can) so the clues that require proir research are the most difficult <br/>
and time consuming, the math ones I really enjoy and I feel important <br/>
(and really adventuris) when the clues require a compass, some times <br/>
I just wear my compass and randomly look at it while on the trail to <br/>
make sure my enternal locator is in sink (heehee ok I know now most <br/>
of you are putting me on the "warning" setting in your yahoo :) <br/>
<br/>
As far as location almost ALL of our boxes have been hidded in places <br/>
we have been before, boxes we have passed many times before and never <br/>
knew about (the novilty of that hasn't worn off yet) so we haven't <br/>
been to very any new and really great locations cause we have alredy <br/>
been there as a family, so that's why some of the store bought stamps <br/>
have been let down cause the new location wasn't all that good, the <br/>
stamp was boring/cheaply made and we honestly felt we wasted our time <br/>
going to this place when there were other places we could be enjoying <br/>
more without a letterbox nearby.<br/>
<br/>
(after this topic dies down I would like to see what kind of clues <br/>
and or boxes you do NOT like, as I'm working on locations, clues and <br/>
images for my first few plants and I feel some of my clues may be <br/>
turning out a bit to abstract or cheesy)<br/>

figure it out! It doesn't matter what type of mystery, as long as it <br/>
involves us using our heads to figure it out... and then we get that <br/>
marvelous feeling of "look what we did!" when we find the box!<br/>

&gt; What kind of clues do you like the most? Do the clues somewhat <br/>
detrmine <br/>
&gt; if you are going to do the box? Do you prefer a story, a "turn left 5 <br/>
&gt; paces to the right" type clue, or things that involve solving <br/>
methods? <br/>
&gt; Besides the stamp what makes the box enjoyable to find?<br/>
