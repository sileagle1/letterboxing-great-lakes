Pepin and St. Croix counties now have a box each!   Clues are posted.<br/>
<br/>
-The Red Cat<br/>

<br/>
=======================<br/>
<br/>
Woo Hoo!  Our friends from Minnesota help out again!!  The Red Cat (a former<br/>
Wisconsinite) covered two more counties on the western border of WI, which<br/>
leaves only 8 more WI counties that need a box.  I think MI is at 4, which<br/>
is only half of what we have left.  HOWEVER, each state has actually covered<br/>
the same number of new counties since the friendly competition began.  WI<br/>
thought it was starting out with a 2 county disadvantage, but that soon<br/>
changed to 4 when the wily Wolverines discovered that 2 boxes had not been<br/>
listed on letterboxing.org in the county they actually resided in (but I'm<br/>
not sure if both have been officially "corrected" yet, so maybe they have 5<br/>
counties left....).<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like MI has a definite plan in place to cover their remaining 4,<br/>
but even if we don't beat them, I'm really happy that we've seen the surge<br/>
in placements in these barren areas!  Maybe someone wants to make a trip up<br/>
there to find the new boxes, and then plant a few in the neighboring<br/>
counties while they are up there....<br/>

Congratulations on getting more WI counties filled.  I just checked <br/>
out your map.  It's looking really good.  I miss "Italy" though!<br/>
<br/>
I believe the Michiganders do have 4 left, with plans to cover 3 this <br/>
weekend!  I think the last county has no plan for coverage at this <br/>
point.  Should be fun to see how it all pans out!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of MN, I was looking at the LBNA map and it says there are <br/>
only boxes in 3 counties there.  Can that be right?<br/>
<br/>
Other replies:<br/>
I love the new patch colors!<br/>
<br/>
My emails have always taken long periods of times ranging from 1/2 <br/>
hour, several hours or a couple days to show up here.  I always just <br/>
assumed it was because I was new and the posts were moderated or <br/>
something.  Maybe it's just Yahoo being wacky again, though!<br/>

<br/>
No, it's not right.  The map hasn't been updated in awhile. There's <br/>
boxes in about 28 counties.  We have 87 counties.  It'll be awhile <br/>
before there's a box in every Minnesota county!<br/>
