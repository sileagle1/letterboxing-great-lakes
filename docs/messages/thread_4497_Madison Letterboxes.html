Congratulations!  If you feel like making a short drive over to the UW Campus and taking a 5-mile walk on some nice paths along the lakeshore, you might be able to find 4 boxes in the "Picnic Point" area (1 listed on LBNA and 3 on AQ).  You can stop for some great ice cream in the union after your hike.<br>

The student union is probably less than 3 miles from the Arboretum.  Bikes are allowed on the trails.  Some sections even have separate lanes, but in other areas you are advised to be very watchful of pedestrians.  We used bikes to get to all 4 boxes.<br>
