When I was off last week I had grandiose plans for finding a bunch in the area I'd missed over the years. The rain earlier in the week dampened (literally) those plans...but the day was saved by the numerous indoor boxes Growly and LVLYF placed in Hinsdale, and P.Granola's Cornerstone Books. All required research which also helped while away the rainy hours.<br/>

Just to let you know that our "Chocolate Milk" letterbox has been <br/>
returned to the business' new location (just a block from the old <br/>
location). Clues have been updated.<br/>
