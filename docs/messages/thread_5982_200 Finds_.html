    Today, I entered my 200th traditional find on Atlas Quest. It's not a competition, but I'm always amazed at the number of finds some new letterboxers have achieved in a short time. But then I look at my profile and see the number of planted boxes, etc. and I realize - I'm just well rounded. LOL! Now, if I can only figure out how to create virtual boxes. Even after 200 traditional finds, I can honestly say, the thrill of the find is still there. No, it's not an addiction and I'm sure I could stop at any time...???
