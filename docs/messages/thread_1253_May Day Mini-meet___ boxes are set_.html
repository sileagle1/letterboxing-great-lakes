There are currently 3 placed with unplublished clues (I'll be <br>
bringing those).  These boxes are all in the same place as one of <br>
mine.  It would be really helpful if you folks could print up and <br>
bring at lease these clues listed below:<br>
<br>
"C.J.'s Loathing"<br>
"Heartbreak Hostel" (bring a HH if you'd like)<br>
"Coon Zoom" (might want to do this one before noon)<br>
