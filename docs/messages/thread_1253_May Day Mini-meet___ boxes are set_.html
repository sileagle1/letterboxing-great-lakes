There are currently 3 placed with unplublished clues (I'll be <br/>
bringing those).  These boxes are all in the same place as one of <br/>
mine.  It would be really helpful if you folks could print up and <br/>
bring at lease these clues listed below:<br/>
<br/>
"C.J.'s Loathing"<br/>
"Heartbreak Hostel" (bring a HH if you'd like)<br/>
"Coon Zoom" (might want to do this one before noon)<br/>

&gt; From the Links on LbGLK:<br/>
&gt; Michigan clues from Doglvrs - the "Little Piece of<br/>
&gt; Heaven" series<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PLEASE don't hesitate to print up others in the area<br/>
&gt; that you might <br/>
&gt; like to hunt up - everyone is free to put in their 2<br/>
&gt; cents!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It sounds like some boxers are bringing their<br/>
&gt; personal travelers - <br/>
&gt; WAY COOL! - and to that I say...be sure to check<br/>
&gt; messages on this <br/>
&gt; list in the morning before heading out.  (hint,<br/>
&gt; hint)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OK, I think that's it - any more questions, send<br/>
&gt; them on ~ I'll be <br/>
&gt; checking email one last time Sunday am around 9:00<br/>
&gt; am, but not after <br/>
&gt; that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can't wait!!!!!!!!  : )<br/>
