                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there!<br>
I just wanted to let you  know that I didn't get out to Waterford <br>
today to relocate Jerome the Nomadic Gnome after all.  So, if you <br>
still wanted to find him in his Winter home, you have a little while <br>
longer.  At this point, I might just wait until Easter Sunday to go move him.<br>
<br>
I did get some letterboxing adventures in today, though.  We ended up <br>
going back out to Maybury State Park again this week and found all <br>
three boxes we didn't find last week!  I think we had Winter Brain <br>
Fog last week after  2 months of not finding any boxes!  Actually, we <br>
think that some other boxers had one of the boxes we were searching <br>
for last week.  There was a log entry from the same day.  What are the odds!?<br>
<br>
The other two, we stupidly followed the wrong trail markers because <br>
we were trying to find three boxes at the same time and assumed the <br>
trail marker #'s were the same numbers.  Of course, we didn't realize <br>
it because we didn't see any of the "other" style numbers.  The one <br>
box clues have you go to pole #2, then 3.  The other boxes say 1, 2, <br>
3, 4... so we figured they were referring to the same trail numbers <br>
and we could meet up with #3 on those clues once we found the first <br>
box.  Nope!  Totally took us to the wrong #4 pole.  And to make <br>
matters worse, there's a tree at the wrong #4 that "fits" the clues <br>
to a tree mentioned for the other box.  So, it really seemed like we <br>
were in the right place.<br>
<br>
Hope you all managed to get some letterboxing in this fine weekend!<br>
<br>
