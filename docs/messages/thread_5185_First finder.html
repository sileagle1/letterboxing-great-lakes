As to first finder stuff...............<br/>
<br/>
Do it if you want to, don't if you don't want to.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing that says you have to or that you're expected to.  And I<br/>
don't really know as if it's actually even thought very much of anyway<br/>
because in only a very few cases did the first finder ever contact us to<br/>
even let us know they had found the box.  We did have one guy, tho, who was<br/>
the second finder contact us, upset at the fact that we had nothing in the<br/>
box for the second finder.  (The first finder had mentioned the certificate<br/>
and gift in the logbook.)  That made our day.  We were rollin' on the floor<br/>
over that one.  That was really good.  I would guess that that person was<br/>
pretty much a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
I used to make up a "First Finder Certificate" that gave the name of the<br/>
box, date it was planted, the location of the box, and it had a stamp image<br/>
on it.  I did it on the computer so that I could scale it down and make it<br/>
small.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, however, I'm making ATCs as first finder certificates.  On<br/>
the front will be the stamp image as part of the ATC design and on the back<br/>
will have the rest of the information.  It'll allow me to get a little more<br/>
creative with using the stamp image.<br/>
<br/>
I used to also put in some sort of "gift" that pertained to the box or to<br/>
the area for the first finder..........but as boxes have to get smaller and<br/>
smaller and smaller to find unmuggleable hiding places, I'm probably not<br/>
going to do that in the future.   People who boxed with children did contact<br/>
us on occasion, to tell us they liked that because the kids liked it.  Or<br/>
sometimes I'd put in a gift certificate to a local store.  For example, for<br/>
the box by Yorktown Shopping Center, Pippi put in a gift certificate to the<br/>
shopping center.  For the box in Long Grove, I put in a gift certificate<br/>
good for any of the stores in Long Grove.  That kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Could a "gift" be thought of as too much like geocaching?  Possibly.  I've<br/>
rec'd comments like that from other letterboxers.  But we only did it for<br/>
the first finder.  And I tried to make the gifts a little nicer than the<br/>
trinkets found in geocaches and a little more appropriate to the box and/or<br/>
the area.  So I think that set the idea apart from geocaching.<br/>

I'm glad you like my trail name. It corresponds with our small part time business, which is a popcorn wagon in Wauwatosa, WI. I also put a little "gift" (if you can call it that) in all my planted boxes too: one of my business cards that has on the back to bring it to the popcorn wagon for a free bag of popcorn. I had two boxers yesterday in fact, who found them in a box I just planted Friday, so I was very excited that they turned them in!! My boxes are all named with Popcorn in their title: Popcorn in the Village, Popcorn in the Library, and Popcorn in the Woods. I'm hoping to get Popcorn in the Cemetery out in the next couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Really love this hobby, having a blast. My husband, son and I found 3 today. Unfortunately, none of them had an ink pad in them and I didn't bring one. I will keep one with me from now on though! <br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>

Are you going to plant one around a movie theater or a drive-in or would<br/>
that be too obvious a box title?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, inkpads in boxes are getting to be more and more rare, around this<br/>
neck of the woods at least.  And a lot of box seekers are going to carrying<br/>
a set of the Marvy marking pens because more and more of the carved stamps<br/>
around here lend themselves nicely to multiple colors.<br/>

providing an extra prize for many finders of your boxes!  We enjoyed the<br/>
popcorn (and also purchased some very tasty FRESH squeezed lemonade!).  If<br/>
we have any hitchhikers in our possession when we plant a box, we often<br/>
include that as a "first finder" prize.  We've sometimes included something<br/>
else relevant to the box, such as an ornament in a Christmas-themed box,<br/>
etc., but we don't put something in every box we plant.<br/>
<br/>
We've only run into a couple of boxes in WI that had ink pads.  Due to<br/>
weather conditions and space constraints, the vast majority of letterboxers<br/>
do not include them.  As Mosey mentioned, many of us carry a wide spectrum<br/>
of colored markers in addition to some ink pads so we can create<br/>
multi-colored images.  If you go that route, I suggest you use a 40% or 50%<br/>
off coupon from the Sunday paper for Michaels craft stores and then get some<br/>
LePlume Marvy brush markers.<br/>

Actually, my mom works at Michael's part time, so I will definitely grab some of those pens there. I noticed pens in some boxes, but I didn't really understand what they were for. Now it makes sense!!!<br/>

Yeah, no worries about "first finders" certificates, since you are actually<br/>
providing an extra prize for many finders of your boxes! We enjoyed the<br/>
popcorn (and also purchased some very tasty FRESH squeezed lemonade!). If<br/>
we have any hitchhikers in our possession when we plant a box, we often<br/>
include that as a "first finder" prize. We've sometimes included something<br/>
else relevant to the box, such as an ornament in a Christmas-themed box,<br/>
etc., but we don't put something in every box we plant.<br/>
<br/>
We've only run into a couple of boxes in WI that had ink pads. Due to<br/>
weather conditions and space constraints, the vast majority of letterboxers<br/>
do not include them. As Mosey mentioned, many of us carry a wide spectrum<br/>
of colored markers in addition to some ink pads so we can create<br/>
multi-colored images. If you go that route, I suggest you use a 40% or 50%<br/>
off coupon from the Sunday paper for Michaels craft stores and then get some<br/>
LePlume Marvy brush markers.<br/>

Thanks much for the info, I really appreciate it. In one of the boxes I<br/>
placed, a boxer had a specific stamp that he carved 'first finder" into,<br/>
which I thought was really neat. I'm thinking about doing that myself<br/>
sometime.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you like my trail name. It corresponds with our small part time<br/>
business, which is a popcorn wagon in Wauwatosa, WI. I also put a little<br/>
"gift" (if you can call it that) in all my planted boxes too: one of my<br/>
business cards that has on the back to bring it to the popcorn wagon for a<br/>
free bag of popcorn. I had two boxers yesterday in fact, who found them in<br/>
a box I just planted Friday, so I was very excited that they turned them<br/>
in!! My boxes are all named with Popcorn in their title: Popcorn in the<br/>
Village, Popcorn in the Library, and Popcorn in the Woods. I'm hoping to<br/>
get Popcorn in the Cemetery out in the next couple of weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Really love this hobby, having a blast. My husband, son and I found 3<br/>
today. Unfortunately, none of them had an ink pad in them and I didn't<br/>
bring one. I will keep one with me from now on though!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>

Haven't thought about hiding one near a drive in or theater, though that's a great idea! Actually, all 3 of my boxes have free certificates for free popcorn at our popcorn wagon. I think in LB terms, that means my box is an Easter Egg, right?<br/>

Your box names sound great!<br/>
<br/>
Are you going to plant one around a movie theater or a drive-in or would<br/>
that be too obvious a box title?<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, inkpads in boxes are getting to be more and more rare, around this<br/>
neck of the woods at least. And a lot of box seekers are going to carrying<br/>
a set of the Marvy marking pens because more and more of the carved stamps<br/>
around here lend themselves nicely to multiple colors.<br/>

Oooooooooooh, great trailname... .......I love popcorn! It's a shame it<br/>
leaves an odor on the fingers so can't eat it on the boxing trail.<br/>
<br/>
As to first finder stuff....... ........<br/>
<br/>
Do it if you want to, don't if you don't want to.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing that says you have to or that you're expected to. And I<br/>
don't really know as if it's actually even thought very much of anyway<br/>
because in only a very few cases did the first finder ever contact us to<br/>
even let us know they had found the box. We did have one guy, tho, who was<br/>
the second finder contact us, upset at the fact that we had nothing in the<br/>
box for the second finder. (The first finder had mentioned the certificate<br/>
and gift in the logbook.) That made our day. We were rollin' on the floor<br/>
over that one. That was really good. I would guess that that person was<br/>
pretty much a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
I used to make up a "First Finder Certificate" that gave the name of the<br/>
box, date it was planted, the location of the box, and it had a stamp image<br/>
on it. I did it on the computer so that I could scale it down and make it<br/>
small.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, however, I'm making ATCs as first finder certificates. On<br/>
the front will be the stamp image as part of the ATC design and on the back<br/>
will have the rest of the information. It'll allow me to get a little more<br/>
creative with using the stamp image.<br/>
<br/>
I used to also put in some sort of "gift" that pertained to the box or to<br/>
the area for the first finder...... ....but as boxes have to get smaller and<br/>
smaller and smaller to find unmuggleable hiding places, I'm probably not<br/>
going to do that in the future. People who boxed with children did contact<br/>
us on occasion, to tell us they liked that because the kids liked it. Or<br/>
sometimes I'd put in a gift certificate to a local store. For example, for<br/>
the box by Yorktown Shopping Center, Pippi put in a gift certificate to the<br/>
shopping center. For the box in Long Grove, I put in a gift certificate<br/>
good for any of the stores in Long Grove. That kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Could a "gift" be thought of as too much like geocaching? Possibly. I've<br/>
rec'd comments like that from other letterboxers. But we only did it for<br/>
the first finder. And I tried to make the gifts a little nicer than the<br/>
trinkets found in geocaches and a little more appropriate to the box and/or<br/>
the area. So I think that set the idea apart from geocaching.<br/>

Hi everyone:<br/>
Hope you're all having a nice day..beautiful here in SE Wisconsin.<br/>
Anyway, I have a question about first finders. Should I be putting<br/>
something special in the boxes I plant for the first finder? I didn't<br/>
know if there was a protocol or something. Thanks!!<br/>
