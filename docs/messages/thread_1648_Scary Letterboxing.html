This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

I just made arrangements with my elderly parents to take them out tomorrow for a leisurely day (no long hikes, I hope) of letterboxing in northwestern Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin.  We'll no doubt end up at Baumgartner's in Monroe, WI, for a lunch of braunschweiger sandwiches and beer.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah.  Me too.  I was going to plant a box in honor of Les Paul in the city of Waukesha.  I was walking along the New Berlin bike trail, looking for a good hiding place, and noticed a footpath just off the trail.  I thought, "Here might be a place to hide the box!  Now all I have to do is find a good tree or a cluster of rocks...."  Well, I ended up finding a pile of at least 15 odd pairs of little girls' underpants.  I turned around and went home and called the police.  I never did end up planting the box because, who wants to hide a box where some possible pedophile is lurking around?  So sad!  <br>
 <br>
Another time, while I want hunting for the Calatrava box in the woods across from Lake Michigan, I came across a discarded women's purse.  Make-up, wallet and other odds and ends were laying scattered about.  I appeared as though someone had stolen the purse and then took it somewhere to pilfer through it..... or even worse.....<br>
 <br>
All I can say is that I always take my dog with me when I go out letterboxing and a cellphone, because you can never be to sure or be too trusting.<br>
 <br>
Have fun, but keep safe!<br>

was walking along fairly quietly.<br>

I was brave enough to drive back a little later, with dog in tow - plus<br>
there were two groups of people with kids and strollers just heading down<br>
the trail, so I felt safe enough to follow behind and go get the boxes.<br>
<br>
Anyone else run into scary people out on the trail??<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>

potential is huge (or something like that).<br>
<br>
In two weeks, I'll have all 5 boxes finished for the completion of <br>
the Swiss Village series near New Glarus, WI (not too far from <br>
Monroe).  If you were thinking of getting the one box listed, you <br>
may want to wait until the rest are up.<br>

Happy hunting!  Let us know how things go.<br>

OK, so snakes in the trail do not scare me, but this did:<br>
<br>
I'm walking along yesterday afternoon looking for a box, and I come around<br>
a curve in the trail, and I see a man's naked butt - his pants are down<br>
around his ankles, and he's just standing there on the side of the trail.<br>
THANKFULLY! he was facing AWAY from the direction I was coming from and I<br>
was walking along fairly quietly.<br>
Talk about doing a QUIET and QUICK backwards walk around the curve I came<br>
from and a sprint to the car.<br>
<br>
I was brave enough to drive back a little later, with dog in tow - plus<br>
there were two groups of people with kids and strollers just heading down<br>
the trail, so I felt safe enough to follow behind and go get the boxes.<br>
<br>
Anyone else run into scary people out on the trail??<br>

direction in a jog. It was great!<br>

I don't know;  I was once hiking on state land in California and came<br>
across a family that had strayed from the clothing-optional<br>
hotsprings.  They were all properly attired for a hike in the noon day<br>
sun - sturdy hiking shoes and socks, sunglass, hats and backpacks. <br>
Nothing to guard against arthropods, plants or snakes, but they could<br>
have had lb supplies in the pack - I didn't ask (I didn't know about<br>
letterboxing then).<br>
