some Box Maintenance on all the Cemetery Stroll boxes and the <br>
Undergound RR one in Lombard.  I was pleased to FIND all the boxes I <br>
went out looking for and also pleased that they were all hidden well! <br>
This box maintenance can be some work though--I needed to replace a few <br>
baggies and THREE logbooks.  I had some spare logbooks in my bag <br>
(already stamped with the Waltzing Pigs stamp) but I still had to stamp <br>
the box's stamp into the log books and write down when we placed it and <br>
who the FF was, etc.  I made a mental note to myself--make 2 logbooks <br>
for each box when first placing it so that maintenance will be easier. <br>
It was fun to go back home and look at all those filled-up logbooks, <br>
though<br>
<br>
One of the boxes I checked is a bonus box which I recently discovered <br>
is about 2 feet from a geocache.  When someone reported that they <br>
couldn't find this box, I went out and found it IN the geocache.  I put <br>
it back where it belonged and all is well.  I have noticed several <br>
geocachers who have logged in.  Even found (and removed) a few trinkets <br>
when doing the maintenance  <br>
<br>
There seems to be a rash of HH lately.  Found one when I was doing this <br>
maintenance, so that was a nice bonus.  It was interesting to see all <br>
of the HH that have gone through our boxes.  Even more interesting to <br>
see that some of these HH were ones that we had found in other boxes, <br>
placed in different boxes, and then made their way to OUR boxes.  <br>
<br>
Had a chance to drop off some HH when we were up in Michigan over <br>
Thanksgiving.  One of the boxes we found has been around for a few <br>
years and had a lot of stamps.  It was fun to see some of the stamps <br>
from folks who post on this list.<br>
