addresses down while visiting your boxes on our mini-letterboxing <br/>
trip, and wanted to give you a little status update. <br/>
<br/>
BindleBabe, The Fill 'er Up series is awesome! We had a great time <br/>
with this (even though the Cinnamon hearts caused us a bit of a <br/>
problem -- and I discovered that my Spanish skills are rusty, at <br/>
best) and all the boxes are in good shape. We also helped save Easter <br/>
at the Fate of Easter series; again all is well here, too (although <br/>
the clue on the first box that refers to the triple fours had been <br/>
flipped dirt-wards... we fixed it. And the last box was just sitting <br/>
out in plain view. Yikes! We tried to hide it a little better.).<br/>
<br/>
Scheherezade, we loved The Ogre and the Princess series. All the <br/>
boxes were in fine shape. What a fun story! And I was coveting the <br/>
logbooks... :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all (includung the people who we sent separate emails to) <br/>
for a great trip!<br/>
