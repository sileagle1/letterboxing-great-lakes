                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is a reason why we refer to Trail Troll as the "Lady" in the letterbox bingo games. Go back and look at how lucky she has been with wins:<br/>
<br/>
2007...4 Corners Winner (tied with TJ_Mich)<br/>
2011...Full Card 2nd Place Winner<br/>
2012...Ten Spot Winner (tied with TJ_Mich)<br/>
2012...Straight Line Winner<br/>
<br/>
That makes Trail Troll one of the most successful winner and elevates her to Goddess status on the boards. (I wonder if WiHi will have the picture for us to see).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
....which brings us back to TJ-Mich. Tom and Jill are being elevated to God and Goddess as also be the biggest winners.<br/>
<br/>
2007...4 Corners Winner (tie with Trail Troll)<br/>
2009...Full Card Winners/ 2nd &amp; 3rd place<br/>
2012...Ten Spot (ties with Trail Troll)<br/>
<br/>
We are not worthy to look upon the greatness of Kristen, Tom, or Jill. All bow down and worship Goddess Trail Troll, God &amp; Goddess TJ_Mich. (A shrine is being erected in your honor!)<br/>

But now, true confessions:  What's the key to their success?  Lots of boxes?<br/>
Exchanges?  Avoiding general terms?  Or just dumb luck?  <br/>
