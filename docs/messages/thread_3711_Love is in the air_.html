letterboxing) for the last several months due to an internship and <br>
its location (north!), but I am finally delurking to spread some <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
        CoffeeBeans and Atom118 just got engaged! <br>

I'm hoping you all will humor me by offering them a congratulatory <br>
haiku about marriage, boxing, or anything else (a haiku is a three-<br>
line poem; the first and third lines have five syllables, and the <br>
middle line has seven syllables).<br>
<br>
I'll start, to show my lack of pride (and skill):<br>
<br>
Two families merge; <br>
New relations for you both, <br>
Ignored while boxing. <br>
<br>
If you are not in a haiku mood, any old congratulations will be <br>
appreciated. <br>
<br>
Welcome to the family, CoffeeBeans! <br>
<br>
Love,<br>

P.S.  In the spirit of haiku, you might want to look for my "Winter <br>
Fun #2 - Tobogganing" box the next time you are in the Milwaukee area.<br>
