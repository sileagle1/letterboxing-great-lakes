                    <div class="plaintext-content">And so I stayed inside &amp; carved our new signature<br/>
stamp instead.  But at least Deedle &amp; I also got our<br/>
cars washed with the time we didn't spend going out<br/>
letterbox hunting.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm quite happy with our new sig stamp.  I also<br/>
designed it (can you tell I'm more of the do-er in our<br/>
letterboxing team, and Deedle is more of the one who<br/>
gets to poke in all the dark holes I won't stick my<br/>
hand in :)  It combines our trail names (which our old<br/>
stamp didn't, because we didn't have trail names yet<br/>
when it was carved) and our home location of Ohio.<br/>
<br/>
We're going to be ceremonious about it &amp; start using<br/>
it after we hit find 100 (we're up to, like, 52 finds<br/>
right now - or is it 56?) so be on the look out - now<br/>
that the cars got some of the winter muck off of them<br/>
next nice weekend we should be able to get out of the<br/>
house! :)  <br/>
<br/>
Doodle Bug, out :)<br/>
