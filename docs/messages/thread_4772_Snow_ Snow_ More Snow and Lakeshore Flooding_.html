I just bought some Yaktrax over Christmas!  They work great!<br>
<br>
I didn't see these unisex ones, though.  Mine were $29.  I wonder <br>
what the difference is?  Mine are black instead of neon green, but <br>
other than that, they look the same.<br>

  I think you're looking for cleats rather than gaiters. Gaiters go over your<br>
  shins and prevent snow from getting into your boots. Here's a link as an<br>

  There are a couple REI stores that recently opened up in the Chicagoland<br>
  area. I'll check it out tomorrow. The price of gaiters is cheap in<br>
  comparison to slipping on the ice and breaking a hip!<br>

  You can probably find gaiters at any outdoor sports store, either on-line or<br>
  in the store. Examples in Milwaukee would be REI, Laacke & Joys, or<br>
  Sherpers..<br>

I'm sure that they will have cleats to keep you from slipping on the <br>
ice. You will also be able to find some less expensesive ones in the <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you to all my letterboxing friends for the tips on cleats.  I go camping often, but I don't go ice fishing, so I've never seen cleats in the stores.  However, I do think fishing is one of those basic life skills that everyone should know how to do and I would like to learn someday.  I'm not afraid of worms either.  My dad took me fishing once, I didn't catch anything, but I would like to go fishing.  Hey, maybe we can plan a summer letterbox gathering in a fishing area.  There's a great theme: Fishing for Bass and Boxes.  <br>

We will miss you at SILO 2.  You can read about it, and you can look at the digital photos, but you still won't believe your eyes.  LOL!<br>
