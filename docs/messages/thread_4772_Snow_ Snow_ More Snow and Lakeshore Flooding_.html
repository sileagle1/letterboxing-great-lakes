I didn't see these unisex ones, though.  Mine were $29.  I wonder <br/>

other than that, they look the same.<br/>

  I think you're looking for cleats rather than gaiters. Gaiters go over your<br/>
  shins and prevent snow from getting into your boots. Here's a link as an<br/>

  Cleats (or traction gear) usually fit over your boot to provide tractions<br/>
  when walking on ice or slippery snow. Here's a link an an example of one<br/>
  type: http://www.rei.com/product/760280<http: 760280="" product="" www.rei.com=""><br/>

  Both should be available at outdoor sporting stores, if they aren't already<br/>
  sold out.<br/>

  Too cold to go out today though - stay safe &amp; warm!<br/>

  You can probably find gaiters at any outdoor sports store, either on-line or<br/>
  in the store. Examples in Milwaukee would be REI, Laacke &amp; Joys, or<br/>
  Sherpers..<br/>

&gt; I didn't see these unisex ones, though.  Mine were $29.  I wonder <br/>

I'm sure that they will have cleats to keep you from slipping on the <br/>

I go camping often, but I don't go ice fishing, so I've never seen cleats in the stores.  However, I do think fishing is one of those basic life skills that everyone should know how to do and I would like to learn someday.  I'm not afraid of worms either.  My dad took me fishing once, I didn't catch anything, but I would like to go fishing.  Hey, maybe we can plan a summer letterbox gathering in a fishing area.  There's a great theme: Fishing for Bass and Boxes.  <br/>

We will miss you at SILO 2.  You can read about it, and you can look at the digital photos, but you still won't believe your eyes.  LOL!<br/>
