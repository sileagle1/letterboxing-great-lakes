the "Wing" event i thought those of you in the area might want to be <br/>
aware of this if you are not already.  condo<br/>

Not sure if this is the right board or not , but I have a report from<br/>
Pigeon Creek in West Olive:<br/>
I was up there a few days ago , and oh my! They are logging- in a big <br/>
way!<br/>
Most of the trails = especially the horse side and the side by the <br/>
campground <br/>
are closed due to the logging operation, but from what I could see,<br/>
ALOT is changing up there..<br/>
If you have boxes in those areas, you may want to keep an eye on <br/>
when they'll let you back in, so you can [hopefully] locate your box <br/>
and/ or update<br/>
your clues if you need too. <br/>
I was very unhappy with the closures, as this was to be my first trip <br/>
there of the season, <br/>
couldn't hunt the boxes I was hoping to find!!<br/>
Hope this update will help someone out, gemgirl65<br/>
