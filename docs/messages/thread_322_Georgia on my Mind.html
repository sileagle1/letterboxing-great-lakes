10 hours in a car with a 2-year old, and 66 email messages later, I am officially done with my familial duties and back from Georgia.  And for all my dutiful doings what did I get?  One stinking (literally), water logged box in the middle of a campground that seemed to contain more confederate flags than I've ever seen in one place (interesting side note:  my beloved brother-in-law, a narcotics officer and good-old boy if I've ever seen one, tells me that displaying a confederate flag in your car is deemed obscene and therefore illegal by the state of Georgia and is often the pretense under which he pulls people he suspects possessing illegal drugs....) so SpringChick, your HH did NOT get sent out into the wilds of Georgia, simply because the poor box was in no condition to hold its original stamp, let alone yours.<br>
<br>
However, I THINK I may have made a letterboxing convert out of my 2-year old niece, who had more fun playing in the dirt and tick-infested pine straw than I've ever seen her have in her short life.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

p.s.  Chalk me up as a card-carrying English major/English teacher.<br>

p.p.s.  If there are any homegrown Georgians on this list, please accept my apologies if you were in any way offended by the above write-up of my experience in Georgia.  I really do like Georgia.  I really LOVE those Waffle Houses and sweet tea.  <br>
