                    <div class="plaintext-content">DUDE!  (sorry) For some reason, we always say "I hate white rabbits" whenever the smoke is blowing at us.  People not in the family always look at us like we're crazy, but then the wind shifts, and the smoke is no longer in our eyes- ha ha!! who looks so crazy THEN? (I know, still me).  But I never knew where or why that phrase came into family vernacular.  You say it's from the Girl Scouts?  Curiouser and curiouser, considering no one in the family's ever been a girl scout.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm going to have to research this one deeper!<br/>

Our old Girl Scout tradition from when I was in scouts was to say "I hate rabbits" when the smoke from the campfire started blowing your way.  Evidently hating rabbits caused the wind to start blowing in a different direction...<br/>

it's now Friday night and they're at camp, so Lutefisk Out of Water's <br/>

boxing pleasure. Knock your socks off...er...well, not <br/>
