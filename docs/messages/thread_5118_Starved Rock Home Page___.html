                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, its been there for several years.  They actually have at least one box in the building, (actually more than one when we visited several years ago) and several in the park.  I've used their site as an example of parks that embrace letterboxing rather than prohibit it.  Same holds true for Connecticut State Forests.<br/>
<br/>
I believe a letterboxer used to work at the park, but I'm not sure of the current status of all the Starved Rocks boxes.<br/>
