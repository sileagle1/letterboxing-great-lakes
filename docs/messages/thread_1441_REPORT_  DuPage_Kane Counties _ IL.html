for letterboxing rather than housecleaning.<br>
<br>
1. & 2.  Stopped first at Oakhurst Forest Preserve, near Aurora, Kane<br>
County, for two boxes there planted by Howling Coyote.  Nice little lake --<br>
the history behind how the place was developed was interesting.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, couldn't find Box #1.  The clues were pretty basic, so I<br>
can't imagine that we weren't in the right area.  We found two possibilities<br>
for the "happy couple" that the box was supposed to be near, one<br>
"vegetable", one "mineral."  We checked out both.  There are some smallish<br>
rocks scattered about in one place that look like they might have been the<br>
"cover" for the box.  About a foot from the rocks was an empty liquor bottle<br>
in a brown paper bag.  Looking around the area, it seems like it might be<br>
rather popular for hosting "get-togethers" -- water bottles, soda cans, the<br>
liquor bottle.  We were sure we were in the right place, but hopefully we<br>
weren't. Or we were but the box is just hidden better than we were looking.<br>
We thought we did a thorough check, but ya never know.<br>
<br>
Had a nice walk by the lake to Box #2. Egrets, herons, and barn swallows<br>
galore.  Momma Goose, Papa Goose, and three little goslings were snacking by<br>
the side of the lake.  Didn't get too close -- the parents didn't look<br>
welcoming to human guests -- if looks could kill, momma and papa would've<br>
succeeded in burying us.  From the logbook, it appeared we were the first<br>
finders.  But the container was in a plastic bag that was very badly ripped<br>
and torn already, even tho the box was only planted a couple of weeks ago.<br>
We didn't have a gallon size bag, so we used the next size down, and it fit<br>
and closed, but barely.  So maybe if someone else heads out to snag the box,<br>
they can bring a gallon size bag along if they have one?<br>
<br>
We picked up a "Hitchhiker Book" in Box #2 -- more about that in another<br>
post.<br>
<br>
3.  Then drove down to snag "As the Dragon Flies" at the DuPage River Park<br>
near Naperville, placed by the Weekend Warriors.  Leave it to wealthy<br>
Naperville -- fancy "outhouse," free poop bags for the dogs, even a pay<br>
phone there.  Tho I would imagine by now that everyone in Naperville would<br>
have a cellphone.  Quite a few folks were there with their dogs, playing in<br>
the pond -- the dogs were playing in the pond, not the people.  One yellow<br>
Lab was busy retrieving a branch almost as large as a tree, and at least<br>
twice as big as him.  Nice hiding spot for the box.  Box was in great shape<br>
and seemed happy. Once we saw the stamp, the title of the box made sense.<br>
More barn swallows galore.<br>

Couldn't help but laugh at this - my cousin and her<br>
husband, who I joking call "my 'rich' cousins" live in<br>
Naperville :)  <br>
