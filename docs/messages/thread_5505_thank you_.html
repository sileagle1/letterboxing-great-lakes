Ok, I feel silly asking again about Bingo--one would think I've never <br>
heard of the game--but I'm still a bit confused.  I understand that the <br>
games are played simultaneously, therefore I should mark everything on <br>
one card.  However, does that mean once someone wins the straight line, <br>
or 4 corners, etc., that no one else can win that particular way? <br>
Thanks for your patience with me.<br>

Yes, once some one has won one of the interim games, no one else can win<br>
that same way.  For the big game (crossing off all 25 squares), however,<br>
there will be three ranked winners (1st. 2nd, and 3rd).  You can win more<br>
than one game - say four corners plus the X - or none, but the fun is in the<br>
playing, and in reading all the comments people make about the daily bingo<br>
call.<br>
