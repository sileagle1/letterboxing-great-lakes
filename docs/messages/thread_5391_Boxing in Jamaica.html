OT and I will leave it for our blog (I will be getting a disk of <br/>
pictures this weekend -- then I will update our blog).<br/>
<br/>
Jamaica was my first boxing abroad, and boy what adventures I had :-)<br/>
<br/>
We had a couple free days at the end of the missions trip in Ocho <br/>
Rios where two boxes reside. After climbing Dunns River Falls, and <br/>
buying junk . . . er . . . gifts for the kids ;-) I took a buddy of <br/>
mine (Oster Toaster) to find his first two boxes (and to hide one of <br/>
my own!).<br/>
<br/>
So, off to find "Smile Mon". Hidden in a bunch of ivy behind a water <br/>
spout on a wall.<br/>
<br/>
We couldn't find the water spout with all the ivy there. We decided <br/>
to go look somewhere else and gave up and went back to where the <br/>
spout is, however there was a Jamaican man standing there going to <br/>
the bathroom on the wall!!!<br/>
<br/>
We apologized for "interrupting" him and kept walking. After he was <br/>
done, I still couldn't find the spout! <br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to give up on my first overseas box, I went to that same <br/>
Jamaican (who ran the little stand at the entrance) and asked if he <br/>
knew where I could find some water to splash on my face to cool off.<br/>
<br/>
He pointed me back to the same corner, I looked another minute and <br/>
asked if he would be willing to show me -- as I was "very hot and <br/>
needed water to splash on my face" he wasn't to happy, but walked <br/>
right up and touched it for me.<br/>
<br/>
How could I have missed it!! DUH!<br/>
<br/>
I dutifully splashed water on my face as he returned to his stand and <br/>
when he was out of sight, I grabbed the box!! LOL<br/>
<br/>
As we were stamping in this couple were walking around the parking <br/>
lot, just looking at the vegetation and taking in the scenery.<br/>
<br/>
I knew they had spotted us earlier looking around like a couple of <br/>
buffoon's so I invited them over and explained letterboxing to them.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out they were from Belgium and had been to many of the sites in <br/>
Jamaica already. They seemed very interested in the hobby and <br/>
wondered if there were any in Belgium.<br/>
<br/>
I assured them that there probably were boxes in Belgium.<br/>
<br/>
I gave them a copy of the stamp image and my signature stamp, with <br/>
both LBNA &amp; AQ web addresses, with of course my dissertation on <br/>
letterboxing. :-)<br/>
<br/>
All this and we still had one more box to find in town . . . a mile <br/>
outside of town. We decided not to spend $8 on a cab ride, we could <br/>
just hike it. <br/>
<br/>
You would be amazed though at how many cabs slowed down for the poor <br/>
white guys trudging up the hill :-)<br/>
<br/>
It was quite the climb, but we made it. Shaw Park Gardens was the <br/>
location. We were taken around the gardens where James Bonds "Live <br/>
and Let Die" was filmed.<br/>
<br/>
We were taken on a tour of the magnificent gardens, we were the only <br/>
two on the tour. So, it was easy for me to slip away and hide my box <br/>
under the massive trunk of a banion tree.<br/>
<br/>
After the tour was over we headed to the bathrooms, the sidewalk to <br/>
which led right by the other letterbox in town.<br/>
<br/>
I went to grab it and Oster Toaster alerted me someone was coming. I <br/>
jumped back to the sidewalk and we casually walked to the bathrooms. <br/>
<br/>
After some relief :-) I went back and grabbed the box.<br/>
<br/>
It was a very successful trip finding 2 of 2 and hiding one of my <br/>
own :-)<br/>
<br/>
hx6 <br/>
<br/>
P.S. Oh, forgot to mention. The first box we found was also found by <br/>
none other than Great Lakes own Travel'n Turtle!! <br/>
<br/>
You're right WiHi, the Great Lakes Group's reach is far and wide :-)<br/>
<br/>
And TT, it was awesome seeing a familiar sig. stamp, even with the <br/>
disguise of dreds :-)<br/>
