Thanks for the input ceralcityboxers.  The fact that 3 was  missing and two <br/>
stamps were broken, and one missing actually does  help.  I thinking those two <br/>
were probably removed.  We found the  lid to #7 but the tree it was supposed <br/>
to be by had been recently cut  down.  The park was really a beautiful <br/>
location.  Across the  street near the police station was a nice picnic area also.  <br/>
This was  my first time to Berea and I was impressed.  It's a very nice  town.  <br/>

CerealCityBoxer's report is more current, but I still<br/>
wanted to chime in.  We had managed to find all 8<br/>
stamps, I think there were total, but it was tricky<br/>
and took a lot of retraced steps, and several people<br/>
after the fact have been amazed that we found them all<br/>
in one go.  Both broken stamps were also broken in<br/>
June '04.  I met the placer Fat Larry (or Phat Larry,<br/>
as I think she goes by now) at the Lake Eeerie<br/>
Gathering back in October, so she's still around, but<br/>
I think she's not quite as active as most of us on<br/>
this board.<br/>
