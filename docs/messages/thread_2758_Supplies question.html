This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

&gt; This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to<br/>
use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do<br/>
today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for<br/>
it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place<br/>
is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

be spotty.  I've had the best luck at Gander Mountain, which usually <br/>
has at least two patterns in stock.  Let your fingers do the walking <br/>

tape) chase.<br/>
