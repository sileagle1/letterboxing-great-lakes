  <http://dingo.care2.com/globalwarming/email/randyphoto.jpg> Hi Fungus - <br>
<br>
What's the most important movie of the year? It's a movie I think will knock<br>
your socks off. It's so important I'm sending this request to all 6 million<br>
Care2 members. I'd like you to  <http://go.care2.com/e/KaV/LG/gn8W> see the<br>
movie and then come back to Care2 and talk about it. A simple and fun<br>
request that I believe could help change the world. <br>
<br>
The movie is called An Inconvenient Truth. It received standing ovations<br>
during its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, and Roger Friedman,<br>
the movie critic for Fox News said: <br>
<br>
"Not to be missed. It doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or<br>
Democrat, liberal or conservative... your mind will be changed in a<br>
nanosecond."<br>
<br>
 <br>

It's an incredible look at the facts about global warming presented by<br>
former Vice President Al Gore. I know this sounds a little crazy: you could<br>
go see Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks, and I'm thinking you'd rather watch Al<br>
Gore?! Trust me, this is a movie that will leave you more stunned, with more<br>
to talk about around the water cooler than any other you'll see this year. <br>
<br>
I thought I knew a lot about global warming, and frankly, that I had watched<br>
enough documentaries about it. But this is not a movie about some distant<br>
island nation getting submerged or endangered species in Africa dying off.<br>
And it's not about problems that will happen in 50 or 100 years. This is a<br>
stunning look at facts (that some folks don't want us to know about) that<br>
will shatter your image of what you thought "global warming" was and how it<br>
will affect you. <br>
<br>
Be among the first to see it when it opens this week in NYC and LA, or<br>
during the next couple of weeks as it opens across the country. Bring your<br>
friends and family. This is an important movie you'll want them to see. <br>
<br>
After the movie,  <http://go.care2.com/e/KaV/LG/gn8W> join in the<br>
conversation at the global warming site on Care2<br>
(http://www.Care2.com/globalwarming/) to talk about what we can do to help<br>
stop this crisis from happening. We'll have experts on hand to help answer<br>
your questions. We've also gathered together<br>
<http://go.care2.com/e/KaV/LG/gn8W> dozens of ideas for easy ways that you<br>
can make a difference. <br>
<br>
Please join us. <br>

p.s. I was fortunate enough to meet Al Gore a few weeks ago and see his<br>
incredible presentation on global warming. I told him Care2 members were<br>
changing the world and I was going to ask all 6 million of you to go watch<br>
this movie and become a powerful force for good in this campaign against<br>
global warming. Let's show him we care! <br>
<br>
p.p.s. Here's what the critics are saying about An Inconvenient Truth <br>
<br>
"One of the most important films ever. If this does not move you to change,<br>
nothing will." <br>
- Larry King, CNN <br>
<br>
"Made me want to buy a hybrid and shoot my old car, so no one else could<br>
drive it... Amazing and smartly done film." <br>
- Bob Mondello, NPR <br>
<br>
"This is activist cinema at its very best, for it serves to popularize and<br>
demythologize a problem long obscured by those most threatened by the<br>
solution. With humor and searing intelligence, Gore outlines crucial steps<br>
we must take to avert impending disaster and proves that inaction is no<br>
longer an option-in fact, it's immoral." <br>
- Sundance Film Festival <br>
<br>
"Not to be missed. It doesn't matter whether you're a Republican or<br>
Democrat, liberal or conservative... your mind will be changed in a<br>
nanosecond." <br>
- Roger Friedman, Fox News <br>
