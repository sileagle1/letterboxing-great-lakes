letterboxers in the Great Lakes region!  Welcome to all of you!<br>
<br>
I just wanted to take a minute to give you a quickie guided tour <br>
around the group.  I'm sure some of you may be familiar with Yahoo! <br>
group in general, but for those who aren't, I'll start at the <br>
beginning...<br>
<br>
If you go to the group home page online <br>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/), you will see a navigation menu <br>
along the left side of the page.  Here you will find links to the <br>
Files, Photos, Database, Polls and Links section of the group.  There <br>
is a lot of useful information to be found here, so take some time to <br>
browse through here and it will no doubt answer some of your questions <br>
and also I am sure, inspire others (don't be afraid to ask them).<br>
