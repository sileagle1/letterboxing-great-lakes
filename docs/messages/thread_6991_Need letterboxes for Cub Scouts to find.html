If I could find a few appropriate ones that we could use, I would definitely pass the information on to the other Packs in our council.  The Boy Scouts in our area are just getting into geocaching but there are limited GPS units available.  I thought that letterboxing might be a good fit for our Cub Scouts.  It is not something I have ever tried but I have read about it for a while and wanted to try it for years now.  <br>
<br>
The listings I have found that I thought might be appropriate are at Stoney Run Park and a local pay to fish lake.  It would be good if there were several at one location.  I had thought I could make a few more for them to look for at one of the locations but I've never done it.  Coming up with the clues seems like it would be the hardest part! <br>

I am in northern IL where we have a lot of boxes but still some driving is <br>
required.  We are trying to get more scouts into lb'ing here too.<br>

Good luck,<br>

Hi, everyone. I just joined last night. I am a Cub Scout leader in Lake County, <br>
IN. I am looking for letterboxes appropriate for Cub Scouts (ages 6-10) to find <br>
in our area. I have checked out letterboxing.org and atlasquest. I found 2 <br>
possibilities but it seems that most of them are either inactive, missing, or <br>
involve driving to find them. Since Cub Scouts travel primarily with their <br>
parents, that isn't as much fun as hiking with the other scouts. We do have a <br>
hiking club in our Pack so it would be wonderful to find a couple at parks in <br>
the area, particularly if they were on trails. I wondered if any of you might <br>
know of some boxes in the area, or even have some of your own or be willing to <br>
create something appropriate if you are in the area? If I could find a few <br>
appropriate ones that we could use, I would definitely pass the information on <br>
to the other Packs in our council. The Boy Scouts in our area are just getting <br>
into geocaching but there are limited GPS units available. I thought that <br>
letterboxing might be a good fit for our Cub Scouts. It is not something I have <br>
ever tried but I have read about it for a while and wanted to try it for years <br>
now. <br>

Park and a local pay to fish lake. It would be good if there were several at one <br>
location. I had thought I could make a few more for them to look for at one of <br>
the locations but I've never done it. Coming up with the clues seems like it <br>
