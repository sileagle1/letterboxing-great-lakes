I have mine done too, and like you, I'm waiting to see who my assigned<br>
partner will be.<br>
<br>
I didn't sign up for the "regular" exchange that SpringChick is<br>
hosting because I already have a bunch of boxes ready to go (none of<br>
which fit the theme) and no time to do another right now. It was<br>
easier to do the "alternate" exchange.<br>
<br>
Anyone else have a box already done that wants to exchange? Looks like<br>
3 out of 5 of us players are in Mich and I'd like to send a box out on<br>
a trip and get one from another state.<br>
<br>
Hey, I wonder if maybe Coon Dog is waiting to see if more players sign<br>
up? Yooo-hoo, Coon Dog .. where are you? <br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
