...not quite as exciting as SpringChick's in Florida (no PI or naked<br/>
bodies, but the weather was nice and warm inside the Paw!)...<br/>
<br/>
We did have a lot of fun on an otherwise nondescript Saturday<br/>
afternoon (who wants to clean house anyway??).  Laughing Coyote and<br/>
Shutterfly came down from Rockford area, and the rest of us were<br/>
relatively local...let's see...Pippin, CMoon, Kookaburra and Buckaneer<br/>
(formerly the Two Dragons), Squeek, FrogMama, Stargirl and Ketchup Boy<br/>
(love that name!!!).  You may not recognize all the names, since<br/>
they're new recruits (CMoon is quite the Letterboxing Crusader!). <br/>
Buckaneer's mom and Mr. Pippin came along for the ride, but we haven't<br/>
quite converted them yet...but we're darn close!  Next time....<br/>

I was really glad we got to go, seeing as how up until the last <br/>
minute that day, I didn't think we would be able to. I had to help <br/>
sort food at a local pantry and didn't know what time I would be <br/>
getting done. Ended up I got out earlier than expected, so I went <br/>
back home, ran around like crazy trying to round up my boxing stuff, <br/>
and then was off to kidnap Laughing Coyote from her home.<br/>
It was nice to meet all the new people, adults and kids alike. I hope <br/>
we can do it again sometime! Maybe we'll even see you in the Rockford <br/>
area sometime soon. ;)<br/>

We would have found time to go, but have been too busy to even check<br/>
the group recently.  I guess we will have to check more often so we<br/>
don't miss out again!<br/>
