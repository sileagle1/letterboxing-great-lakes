                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today's word is only good for four players. You guys/gals chose well. It is:<br/>
<br/>
Column I: Choi<br/>
<br/>
However, a few more chose the 50 Boxes of Springchick box.<br/>
<br/>
50 BOS: Spirit of the Dunes<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I checked everyone's cards. Here are a few things I noticed:<br/>
<br/>
It's feast or famine...<br/>
Many players chose the same terms...<br/>
A few players chose decisive words that only 1 or 2 players have...<br/>
There were several players close to straight lines ans a few who were close to two straight lines...<br/>
Doglvrs, Leapin Lizards, and Atomic Beans are well loved, there are a good number of you with Awesome Pants on your Team, and many of you are huffing. (That would explain the crazed looks at gatherings!)...<br/>
Gunhild is doing better than she thinks...<br/>
<br/>
AND although many games have already been called rather early, I would caution not to throw in the towel just yet. We still are looking for the X and full card for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place. We all know how this bingo game can turn rather quickly and it's going to be a rat race to the end.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you're curious, the # of terms from each column as of 2-12-2011 are:<br/>
<br/>
B: 6<br/>
I: 13<br/>
N: 3<br/>
G: 10<br/>
O: 13<br/>

Huh..I guess we really don't like the N word around here, do we?<br/>

However we hope to do so in October at an event in Maine.<br/>

<br/>
Here are two more statistics:  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1)  As of today, exactly 1/3 of the Bingo words have been called<br/>
(unfortunately my card is NOT 1/3 full)<br/>
<br/>
2)  As of today, my SpringChick card is exactly 1/2 full<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that the 4-Corners game is still in play.<br/>

WOO HOO!!!  the next time we see ol' Choi Boy, we will get down on our hands and knees...and maybe even kiss his little letterboxing hand!  Both of us got a real shot in the arm today with getting all 4 words called!!!  Feeling very lucky today....<br/>
Thanks Fam of Many...we think this news just might have chased the flubug away and we might get out there and roll around in the snow today...Oh wait!  That's precisely how we think we caught these colds in the first place!<br/>

We've met him on several occasions, the first time being 3 years ago.  This primarily takes place when our letterboxing wanderlust leads us up to VT and NH.  We can soundly attest to the delightful character of the Northeast letterboxers - Choi being one of the nicest!<br/>
