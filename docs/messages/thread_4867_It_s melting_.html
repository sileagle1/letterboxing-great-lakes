This snowy slop isn't going to keep my in the house any longer.  I just <br/>
placed a new letterbox (Adler Memorial Park Letterbox), and I scoped <br/>
out several new locations for additional boxes that I plan to place <br/>
this week.  The snow is not even ankle deep, so pull on some boots and <br/>
ignore these last traces of winter.  Spring is here!  <br/>
<br/>
If you know people who think it's unusual to be hiking and looking for <br/>
hidden outdoor freezer boxes in the winter, guess what I saw today? <br/>
There are actually groups of people who play disc golf in the snow!  <br/>
How's that for weird?  Well, we all have our unique hobbies.  <br/>

weekend!  However we WILL be in IL next Saturday on the hunt for a few<br/>
boxes, snow or no snow.  (We are definitely hoping for NO snow, so are<br/>
planning to start as far south as Chicago. LOL!)  Luckily the next weekend<br/>
after that will find us in the Atlanta area, so we are not only hoping for<br/>
no snow (or tornados), but actually expecting temperatures in the<br/>
70s....We'll find spring one way or the other....<br/>

P.S.   We're still carefully watching those BINGO calls....  Hope springs<br/>
eternal!<br/>
