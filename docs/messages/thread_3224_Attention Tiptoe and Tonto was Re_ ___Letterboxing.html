&gt; &gt;   boxes of hers! Fortunately, we met up with Doglvrs and between <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt;   five of us we finally got all three boxes! We also met up with <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; &gt;   least three other groups searching for the same boxes! Did she <br/>
bat <br/>
&gt; &gt;   those "feel-sorry-for-me" eyes at anyone else? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   O.K. We have to admit that they were great stamps...a great <br/>
hiking <br/>
&gt; &gt;   workout....a great time with Doglvrs...So what's our beef? I <br/>
guess <br/>
&gt; &gt;   we really don't have any other than knowing that another 9 <br/>
stamps <br/>
&gt; &gt;   didn't get a visit! - We had a fabulous time!...thanks SC!<br/>
&gt; &gt;   ..and azobox, we promise to ignore SC next time and go for your <br/>
&gt; &gt;   elusive Snap, Crackle anad Pop!<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; This talk of squished pennies reminds me! We found Froggie <br/>
Went<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; A-courtin' last Saturday and in spite of the steady stream of <br/>
&gt; &gt;   muggles<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; along the way, they were oblivious to our activity from <br/>
above. <br/>
&gt; &gt;   This was<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; one time were we didn't think it wise to carry the letterbox <br/>
away <br/>
&gt; &gt;   too far.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; It also helped we were disguised as "hi-tech hikers." I had a <br/>
&gt; &gt;   pair of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; collapsible trekking poles. Several adults commented to the <br/>
young <br/>
&gt; &gt;   members<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; ... "look, they are serious hikers." If they only knew. We <br/>
still <br/>
&gt; &gt;   have a<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; secret!<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; I was disappointed to find 55 cents in the letterbox, but I <br/>
left it<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; behind. Some geocachers commented they found the letterbox <br/>
while <br/>
&gt; &gt;   hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; for a geocache in the area. This is really amazing that both <br/>
&gt; &gt;   containers<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; could be THAT close. I didn't poke around to find the <br/>
geocache, <br/>
&gt; &gt;   just<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; happy to get the letterbox back without detection.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; And my better half actually loved the clues (he carried and <br/>
read <br/>
&gt; &gt;   them as<br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; we walked), the hike, stamp, and the entire day.<br/>
