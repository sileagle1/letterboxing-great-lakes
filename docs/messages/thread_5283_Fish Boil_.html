  like to meet up for dinner on Friday night as well. Staying up in <br>

I am not familiar with the Square Rigger Gallery, but if most of the letterboxers staying overnight on Friday will be in that general area, check it out!  The length of the Door Co. peninsula is about a 45 minute drive from the bridge in Sturgeon Bay to the northern most tip, not counting side roads or unusual traffic jams in town when there are festivals. Jacksonport is on the Lake Michigan side closer to White Fish Dunes State Park.  <br>

Let us know what you find out about Square Rigger Gallery.  OK<br>
