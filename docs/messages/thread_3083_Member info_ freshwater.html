                    <div class="plaintext-content">I learned about letterboxing at a bookcrossing meeting (see <br/>
www.bookcrossing.com for more info).  One of the ladies --aimlesst-- <br/>
mentioned that she'd long wanted to start this hobby.  Three of us <br/>
met and so began our informal team/individual boxing in the <br/>
Milwaukee area.  Actually, the others were boxing....I didn't search <br/>
again for almost a year!  However, with a little help from my <br/>
friends, I've found about a dozen boxes and am a true convert.  <br/>
<br/>
While camping on Madeline Island (in Lake Superior) in August I <br/>
scouted out some sites and plan to place a series of boxes when we <br/>
return next summer.  As an adult fan of Harry Potter, I am planning <br/>
a HP series of boxes for the bicycle trail that passes behind my <br/>
house....realistically they probably won't be placed before late <br/>
spring, 2007, but I'm already enjoying the planning for the clues <br/>
and the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I am a special education teacher, a single parent, a knitter and <br/>
spinner, and love to read.  The art and exercise aspects of this <br/>
hobby appeal to me.  I am also a great fan of British folk music and <br/>
literature, so hope to combine letterboxing with a trip to England <br/>
to celebrate my 50th birthday in a few years.<br/>
