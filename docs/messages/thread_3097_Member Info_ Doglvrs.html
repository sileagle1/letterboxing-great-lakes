info added(Mrs. Doglvrs speaking ~ as usual)<br/>
<br/>
Long about May of '04 a gal in my knitting group at church came in totally<br/>
 excited about this new thing she had done that weekend (Memorial Day weekend)  with <br/>
her Mom. "It was so fun!" she proclaimed and proceeded to tell the rest of us about it with <br/>
intense excitement. One of the other ladies in our group was a rubberstamper and she <br/>
asked a few questions...but mostly the rest of us ~ who obviously enjoy entertaining <br/>
ourselves while sitting on our butts ~ looked on. <br/>
<br/>
When she was finished showing us the clue sheet and talking about walking for a really <br/>
long time for the second box...I looked at her and said "Cindy ~ you mean you tromped <br/>
around in the woods for 2 hours and you found a rubberstamp for all your trouble?" Poor <br/>
Cindy replied, "Well yes, but it was so much fun!" To which I replied...."Dang! Sounds like <br/>
exercise to me." Earned me a round of laughter...which of course is what I was after... ; )<br/>
<br/>
Then around August of afore mentioned year...Granny came to visit. This little family had <br/>
no cash to speak of, and a whole 4 days of entertaining of Granny to do. So, I emailed <br/>
Cindy and said..."Hey, what was the thingy about the woods and stamp and whatnot?" <br/>
Cindy - bless her sweet little heart was happy to oblige. I printed off some local clues and <br/>
the kids and I were ready ~ Granny, however - was not. Seems she had the same silly idea <br/>
her daughter did...you know, about the exercise...<br/>
<br/>
Jump to Monday - bored kids, school is yet to begin..."Hey," I says "go grab<br/>
 that compass Dad bought last month and we'll give this letterboxing a try." Off we go to <br/>
hunt up a couple of turtles. We followed along and did real<br/>
 good....when we got to the first box, and it was exactly where it should be...I jumped up <br/>
and down I was so excited! (Brings you back to your first find don't it?) My sweet children <br/>
looked at me and said "Mom, are you crying?!" Never mind that....onward.<br/>
<br/>
At dinner ~ we regaled Dad with our adventure...along with how we tried and tried to find <br/>
a Sphinx in with turtles. On the way home, I happen to glance at the name of the park and <br/>
noticed it was not the same as the Turtles home....Dad says "I know that park! I can take <br/>
you there!"...all manly like. And thus he did  then back to find Who was at Hager too!<br/>
Two days later we became the Doglvrs ~ we chose our name because we have 3 dogs <br/>
(Emily, Alex &amp; Lana) who we all love dearly ~ and because we had a paw print stamp in the <br/>
house.  I eventually hand carved one for us and if you've ever seen it, the RASW in the paw <br/>
prints stands for Rick, Angel, Stephanie &amp; Wyatt.  We live in Hudsonville, Michigan where <br/>
we do things like make cheese, teach piano &amp; flute lessons, play clarinet, and battle with <br/>
Pokemon cards.<br/>
<br/>
We have letterboxed in 4 states and planted boxes all over our county and a couple of <br/>
others.  I am the carver/logbook maker/addicted boxer ~ and Mr. gives me ideas.  I feel it <br/>
is our duty to hide boxes that men want to find  thus more hubby's will want to box with <br/>
their wives.  I know there are a few of our number who have it the other way `round  and <br/>
for them, I am sorryI could teach all your wives to knit, and then you'll have hats, gloves <br/>
and scarves for boxing in winter.  ; )<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to each and every gathering  and hope to be able to meet many of the new <br/>
faces around the list ~ especially those of you who have exchanged emails with me.<br/>
