A related funny here, we were driving home on Sunday from a friends <br>

the Waukesha Airport back towards Sussex - the over the river and <br>
through the woods route (there is a farm with sheep, chickens and a <br>
cow that the children like to see).  We come around the first curve <br>

they are safe in this person's front yard.  We were laughing <br>

you had to be there, but it cracked us up!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The deer hangin' out in someone front yard while the deer hunters <br>
hunting not far away reminds me of a Far Side Calendar page!  Cat <br>
Herder, your description was hillarious!<br>
<br>
I want to throw one more caution out there about hunters and hunting <br>
season.  ( I hunt as well and so this is in now way meant to be mean in <br>
any way or to anyone.) <br>
<br>
For those of us who letterbox in the dark, sometimes hunters are there <br>
in the dark too.  Responsible hunters never shoot unless they SEE and <br>
confirm their target as the animal they intend to shoot, but sadly the <br>
very first shot taken in Ohio for gun/deer season was one half hour <br>
before the season began and was in the dark.  It resulted in a 20 year <br>
old nephew being shot by his uncle.  The uncle shot at the noise.  The <br>
nephew "misunderstood" where he was supposed to be flushing out the <br>
deer, "according to the uncle".  In other words the uncle rationalized <br>
it was "okay" to fire at an uncertain target because he thought he knew <br>
who was and wasn't in the woods.  Luckily most hunters are very safe, <br>
but it was a sobering reminder for me on both sides of the fence that <br>
things do happen.<br>
<br>
I hope everyone has a great and safe time at the first snow event this <br>
weekend in WI!  I know all of us in Ohio are jealous.  I hear that same <br>
weather will be hitting us starting tomorrow!  This is our last 66 <br>
degree day for quite some time, I'm sure.<br>
<br>
Good luck to the Brat Pack too!  Way to bring another letterboxer into <br>
our world!!<br>

3PM on Sunday.  He must be a graduate student at Miami.<br>

  On the way from Marietta to Columbus, we also did some letterboxing on Thanksgiving Day. We were driving down some back road and came into this little town. There was a group of guys on one corner, all leaning up against a truck, drinking beer, and waving at all the passing cars. We kept going and right around the next curve in the road was a deer. He was just moseying along like he didn't have a care in the world. Not only was he in town limits and in someone's front yard, but he also had a strip of what appeared to be bright orange caution tape wrapped around his neck!

  We still think it was some kind of strange Brotherhood-of-the-Deer initiation thing.<br>

  For those who wanted to see pictures of the deer wearing an orange <br>
  safety tie, I finally figured out how to post the pictures. I can't <br>
  figure out how to make a link for you to click on, but they are in the <br>
  photos section of this group's site. The photo album is called Hunting <br>
  Deer. The pictures are a bit fuzzy and I'm not the best photographer, <br>
  but it's still funny. <br>
