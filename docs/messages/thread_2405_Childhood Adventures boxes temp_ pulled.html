                    <div class="plaintext-content">While out on my box-checking rounds today, I found both of BirkieBob's <br>
Childhood Adventures (1 and 2) boxes open with their contents strewn <br>
about.  I picked them both up for major repairs.  I don't know when <br>
they will be back in action or in what condition.<br>
<br>
Although I suspect animals or delinquents to be at fault, I would like <br>
to put in a friendly reminder to be sure to re-seal everything back <br>
into their baggies, if not double bag them!  In both cases I found the <br>
logbooks outside their bags with other contents in their bags and <br>
sealed.  As a result, the logbooks are extremely wet and may not be <br>
salvageable.  Considering the age of the boxes, these logbooks are a <br>
huge piece of WI letterboxing history, and now may be lost to us all.  <br>
Remember - the next box you go may be of historical significance to <br>
future letterboxers.  Treat all boxes better than if they were your <br>
own!<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
