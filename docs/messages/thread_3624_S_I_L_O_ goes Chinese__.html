This will be my third year making a "Year of the xxx" stamp for Chinese New Year.  I did one in 2005 (Rooster) and 2006 (Dog).  My 2007 "Year of the Pig" stamp will be placed in the Milwaukee area sometime before FEB 18.  However I could make a different stamp for the event.<br>

  The Chinese New Year theme sounds like a great idea to us. Is everyone who is planning on attending game to go with that? We both like the idea of carving your trailnames (once you can get them translated, I too am one who doesn't have the Chinese character set loaded on my 'puter) and/or Chinese astrological signs for exchanges. Since this is basically a chow down and exchange kind of event, that would fit in beautifully (Of course you've also got us now thinking about making our own fortune cookies, after I specifically told Beetle "we've got to keep this simple!"). Might I suggest if you are going to carve an astrological sign, let me know so we can keep track of which signs are accounted for (hoping you'll all agree, I already set it up on AQ as an event stamp series, and will give the creators credit for each individual stamp). There are also the Chinese earth elements (metal, water, wood, fire, earth). And if worse comes to worse, I think I actually have all<br>
  these stamps commercially made which I could bring along.<br>
<br>
  I do have to warn you, the site we're looking at does not serve Chinese food, but I'm sure we can pick up some chopsticks at a restaurant supply place!<br>
