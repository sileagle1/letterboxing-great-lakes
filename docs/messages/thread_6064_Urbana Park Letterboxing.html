reference LBNA in their clues and the boxes are listed on both LBNA and AQ.<br>

Anyway, it's kind of a neat program, but the stamps are all store bought/manufactured and a lot of them are in areas where the dogs aren't allowed and unless we're on vacation without the dogs I generally don't go after boxes planted in areas where the dogs can't come with us. On the other hand, I discovered that one of the ladies that was in my pre-natal aquatic exercise class is a letterboxer when she mentioned going after the one in Busey Woods with her daughters one night in class. Unfortunately, I never did remember to ask her what her trail name is. <br>
