earlier today, and found several Ott-Lites in the clearance aisle.  <br/>
We've been using an Ott-Lite recently to provide better illumination <br/>
when carving stamps, and it makes a huge difference.  (I'm told that <br/>
they are useful for other crafts as well...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we were surprised to see this brand, which is usually a bit on <br/>
the expensive side, at Wal-Mart for half price.  We're not sure if it's <br/>
particular to Gurnee, but we thought we'd mention it, just in case Wal-<br/>
Mart is phasing Ott-Lite out as a vendor across all of its stores.  If <br/>
so, then they might be on clearance elsewhere across the U.S.<br/>
