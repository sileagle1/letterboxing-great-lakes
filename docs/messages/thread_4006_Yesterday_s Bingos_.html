Congratulations to all of the winners and thanks to everyone who <br/>
played and enthusiastically awaited the word each day.  I'm glad you <br/>
enjoyed it; I know it is something I've come to look forward to <br/>
during the winter months.  Watch for details on next year's game <br/>
around the beginning of December.<br/>
<br/>
But for now, it looks like the weather is going to cooperate and it <br/>
is finally spring!  So get out there and box!<br/>
