                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone, and Happy New Year!!!! I'd like to share some <br/>
information I've received with the rest of you.  I had seen in a <br/>
recent post that the Geauga Park District is embracing the hobbies <br/>
of Geo Caching and now Letterboxing.  Here is a portion of <br/>
information provided in the description of the box Lions, Tigers and <br/>
Bears.  "Geocaching, the high-tech sport of hide &amp; seek, continues <br/>
in Geauga Park District with the introduction of letterboxing. These <br/>
hybrid caches will allow both letterboxers and geocachers to enjoy <br/>
the sport of searching for these hidden containers. <br/>
<br/>
As Geauga County celebrates its bicentennial in 2006, the <br/>
letterbox/caches will have a historic theme and introduce you to the <br/>
history of some of our parks. The first of four letterbox/caches for <br/>
2006 is located in Beartown Lakes Reservation." <br/>
<br/>
They are asking anyone who places a box to apply for a permit.  <br/>
Since I had a box placed at Swine Creek, I called today to find out <br/>
how this is done.  I was told a letter needs to be written to Geauga <br/>
Park District Atten:  Thomas Curtain, Director 9160 Robinson Road <br/>
Chardon, Oh 44024.  They said the letter should explain what the box <br/>
is, where it is to be located (both park and best description <br/>
possible of hiding spot).  When this information is received they <br/>
will send a ranger out to determine if the traffice from finding the <br/>
box will have an adverse affect on the location.  If the feel all is <br/>
well, they will isssure the permit.  Their main objective for this <br/>
is to protect the integrity of the vegitation etc.  They were very <br/>
nice when I called.  If you would like to contact them for any more <br/>
information their number is 440-286-9516.   <br/>
<br/>
I'd like to give the Geauga Park District a thumbs up for embracing <br/>
both hobbies and encouraging it in their parks!  They also told me <br/>
that on January 8th 2006 from 2:00 to 4:00 pm at Best Lake Lodge <br/>
they are hosting a Geo Caching event.  Gander Mountain will be <br/>
providing GPS systems and it is open to anyone who would like to try <br/>
out the hobby.  <br/>
<br/>
So, thanks all for giving me a few minutes of your time.  I figured <br/>
I'd pass this information along.  I know I want to comply with their <br/>
wishes, so they will continue to welcome letterboxers to their <br/>
parks!  <br/>
<br/>
As always, happy hunting <br/>
