I have been thinking of your problem ever since you Emailed it. I was  <br/>
thinking of glue scrap pieces of eraser, any kind of filler at all, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing really came up. Bali, I am intrigued at your suggestion and think  it <br/>
maybe possible. I was just impressed someone responded with something that  <br/>
may work.<br/>
<br/>
I was standing in the shower thinking of Bali's great suggestion when the  <br/>
great idea hit me (when else other than in the shower?)<br/>
<br/>
Don't do anything to the stamp at all. That is where we all think the  <br/>
problem is, but its not, the problem will be in the image you stamp ~ It is  THERE <br/>
that needs to be fixed and not the stamp itself.<br/>
<br/>
Just have a fine tipped marker that doesn't bleed in the color you are  going <br/>
to use (Creative Memories have a GREAT set that may or may not be  available <br/>
individually). After you stamp in just have your fine tipped marker  and draw <br/>
a line in the image where the line should be and viola. <br/>
<br/>
No extra clutting/glueing/headaches and the problem is solved . . . hope  its <br/>
not to late (I would have recarved the whole image by now).<br/>

doesn't work then I will try what Bali says. The problem was that I <br/>
was working in a negative image and got messed up on things I had to <br/>
remove. I even marked Xes on the spots to remove. I guess the lesson <br/>
learned here is, if you need a break take it!<br/>
