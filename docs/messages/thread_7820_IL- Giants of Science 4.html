                    <html><body><p>MamaMir was the first to look for this series on OCT 26 and she told me found Scientist #3 in the middle of a clearing about four feet away from his hiding space.  She said it looked like some critter moved him about.  The box was completely intact so she put him back where he was supposed to be.</p><p> </p><p>However on NOV 4 the Atomic Beans couldn't find a trace of him.  It is currently a very leafy area, so if anyone else looks for this series, I wanted to give you a "heads up" that you may need to search the surrounding area.  I'm hoping someone will be able find this Scientist.  If you can find a rock to weigh him down, or find another nearby spot that might be more secure, please send me the info and I'll update the clues.</p><p> </p><p>Thanks!</p><p> </p><p>Wisconsin Hiker<var id="yui-ie-cursor"></var></p></body></html>
