Sometimes accidents have a purpose.  So here's some advice for Ryan's Round Barn.  If you listed it as a traditional letterbox, place it at the Silo as a temporary traditional letterbox and spread the clue as a WOM.   <br>
<br>
To be honest, I've lost track of the total number of stamps and letterboxes that will make an appearance at the Special Indoor Letterboxing Outing (S.I.L.O.) on Saturday, February 17.  But you can never have too many stamps or letterboxes at a gathering, and you can never have too many letterboxing friends.  <br>
<br>
See you at the Silo Restaurant in Lake Bluff, Illinois between 12 noon and 4 pm.  Just look for the group of people all dressed in RED!  <br>

People may not remember, but as I recall it was YOU who mentioned Chinese New Years and that's when all this RED stuff started.  So you have to take some of the credit (blame) for this fun and foolery planned for the SILO Event.  <br>
<br>
And River Rat...Bunny Butt Cooties will be the least of your worries next weekend. <br>
<br>
Trust us....Fungus Woman and Beetle are "keeping it simple."  That's been our plan all the time.  A little bit of food, a few friends, a few stamps, just keep it simple.  ROFLOL!!!<br>

Think RED!  <br>

  Yes, we're also looking forward to next Saturday! However I'm a <br>
  little worried about the "FungusWoman and I are planning... mischief" <br>
  line. Who knows what that Dynamic Duo, I mean "Team Dutch Elm" have <br>
  up their kimono sleeves???<br>
