Excellent!  We ran into Happy Hippo this week while seeking the <br>
Johnson Mound box, and she told us about your mishap.  She mentioned <br>
32 stitches...or was it 36?  <br>
<br>
BTW, we found the Silver Springs box.  It was just lying out in the <br>
open, so we replaced it carefully when we were done.  I gotta say, <br>
your carving just keeps getting better with every box!<br>
<br>
Get well soon!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for your kind words and for replacing the Silver Springs box.  I<br>
only received 30 stitches.  I also retrieved the box I had planted just<br>
prior to the nasty gash.  I felt that bridge was just too slippery even when<br>
dry for me to send others, including kiddos, across.  I will find a new home<br>
for that one and also for the several stamps I have carved to keep from<br>
being too stir crazy.  Thanks again.<br>
