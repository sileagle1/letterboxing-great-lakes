New Year's Eve tradition, while I wait for the kids to come home safely, to<br/>
fill out my BINGO cards, create my list for thedeadpool.com, and make a list<br/>
of knitting projects that I want to complete during the next year!  I should<br/>
be more considerate of the issues that this causes others.  Next year, I<br/>
will probably be writing the same apology!  So,  sorry in advance for 2014!<br/>
