                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we create and place a letterbox, we assume the risk that the box may be short lived due to many factors.  When I revisit my boxes for routine maintenance, I look at the clues and use deductive reasoning to assess the evidence I have, knowing that I never will have all the pieces to the puzzle.  Some factors will remain a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
One of these 5 boxes was found open and laying on the ground, stamp missing, log book roll of paper was crumpled into a ball.  We all tend to look at the last entry as the person to blame for not replacing the box properly which may well be unfair.  That may be human nature when we are morning the destruction of a letterbox which took time and effort to create.   There is always the possibility that someone may have observed the last finders and they were the culprits.  In this case, I can't blame an animal for crumbling up the logbook or for scribbling on many of the pages with child-like printing and doodle lines.  I simply use the term unsupervised children because, unfortunately, some (not all) parents think letterboxing is a fun summer activity for their kids and they may not be supervising how boxes are found or replaced.  <br/>
<br/>
As for other boxes, I found the stamps missing, cracked completely in half, or with finger nail marks imbedded into both sides of the stamps.  I guess a child might be curious enough about the stamp to do this, but if a parent was supervising them, they might say - Hey, you'll damage that stamp! rather than passively look the other way and just allow their children to play and have fun.    <br/>
<br/>
Whenever a letterbox disappears or is vandalized, it is a good time for placers to reassess the location and the clue.  So, I may replace these boxes in the near future.  There are other letterboxes in the Door County area that I highly recommend!  They lead me to some uniquely beautiful locations I might not otherwise have visited.   <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your trip to Door County.  <br/>

  I wouldn't assume it's unauthorized children, but you may be right. Two of my boxes that I spent a lot of time carving were destroyed (and both times the last person there was the same person, and they had older kids!) It's too bad, because my family and I were planning on coming over from Michigan in two weeks and planned to find your boxes. :(<br/>

  I just returned from a short, but relaxing vacation. I checked my out of state boxes and I have decided to 'pull' all 5 boxes in the Door County, WI area. Why? Vandalism....plain and simple. The last entries in the logbooks were first time letterboxing families with young, obviously unsupervised children. Stamps were damaged, boxes left open, contents tossed on the ground. YIKES! I may replace these boxes in the future. Just wanted to give you the update change on the status of my boxes in WI. <br/>
