                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last night I was sparked to action by Dragon's question about the<br>
well-being of our friend Delirium.<br>
I wrote to her. This morning she responded and I'm happy to report<br>
that they are all doing well.<br>
By the time Katrina reached their part of Mississippi, it had been<br>
downgraded to a tropical storm. She said the winds at 50 mph were<br>
still fierce and at one point she feared they'd lose their roof. But<br>
they suffered no serious damage and everyone is fine. A small silver<br>
lining is that they saw rain for the first time since mid July.<br>
In typical Delirium fashion, she regaled me with stories of a Michigan<br>
woman who is out of her element. (Mostly it had to do with snakes and<br>
locusts).<br>
<br>
For those who are newer to this list, a little background: Delirium<br>
was an active Michigan letterboxer who found herself, somewhat<br>
unhappily, transplanted to the South when her husaband's job took them<br>
to Mississippi. Her posts were pure entertainment.<br>
<br>
She says that the presence of copperhead snakes makes box maintenance<br>
more of a challenge than she's willing to undertake, and the<br>
temperatures/humidity preclude much outdoor activity.<br>
<br>
But she's fine. And so are the kids.<br>
