                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a blast!!! Get there before 9:30am.  Everything is pretty awesome!!!  We didn't sit too long to watch the shows to the end, but they are great!! The jousting is really cool!!! And the shops, gorgeous!!!!  You can actually spend the WHOLE day there and only scrape the surface of everything.  The boat is cool too!!!   If you can get the Fun Faire package, for only $75.  It has 2 tickets, parking, free tankard (mug), free T-shirt, and $20 in the Queen's currency for food and beverages,  it's an awesome deal, really worth the money!!!   I would love to go every weekend so I can see EVERYTHING, but hubby says no.  =(  (Says 1 weekend a year is good enough...NOT!!!)   I hope you have lots of fun!!! (HUGS)<br>
