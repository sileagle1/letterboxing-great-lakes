                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have only recently realized that a lot of 'Contact the Placer' emails <br/>
from LbNA have been ending up in my junkmail.  This may have been an <br/>
ongoing issue for months and months, since it doesn't happen to ever <br/>
email, only some of them.  I've only just recently started checking my <br/>
junkmail regularly (I used to have it set on automatic delete) so I <br/>
have no idea how many attempted communcations may have been perceived <br/>
as ignored.  It's frustrating that some get through and some don't.  <br/>
Any other Hotmail users have this problem?<br/>
<br/>
My Cartoons of the 80's series is what I'm particularly concerned <br/>
about, since it requires the seeker to answer some questions in order <br/>
to get the clues.  If anyone has emailed me in the last year with <br/>
answers for this series, and I haven't answered you, rest assured that <br/>
it wasn't on purpose.  If you'd like to try again, I'm checking my <br/>
junkmail every day from now on. :)<br/>

LBNA webmaster I realized the problem.  You need to put the address <br/>
that these updates come from into your address book and then change <br/>
your spam filter settings to always allow mail from addresses that are <br/>
in the address book.  If you don't know how to do that your email <br/>
server's webmaster should be able to help.<br/>

I meant to reply to this sooner but boxing got in the way.  Sorry :P<br/>
