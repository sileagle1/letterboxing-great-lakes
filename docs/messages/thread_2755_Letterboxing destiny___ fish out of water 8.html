 Some of you may recall my aborted plans two years ago to go to the Florida Keys over my daughter's spring break, and how after we ended up going to MN instead (to MOA), I placed a box there commemorating my first find ever, DebRock's Bass Pond box.  Here's a status report from K Frog who recently found that box.  Letterboxing Destiny - she's going to take the HH she found there to the Keys!<br/>

Message: All is well at the Bass Ponds!  I liked the container - nice camo touch!  We had a good walk and tried fishing a bit too.  Inside your box was a hitchhiker!  I took it - my first one!!!  I'm not sure where it will end up yet but we are going to the Fl. Keys in a couple of weeks so I thought it might be fitting to hide it there sort of in honor of your missed trip! :) Plus, I like when they travel far!Denise<br/>
