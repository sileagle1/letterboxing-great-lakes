                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to thank the generous folks at the gathering this past weekend.  $68 dollars was raised with the help of the K-9 fundraiser letterbox.  This will be added to the funds already collected to get a custom fit bullet proof vest for a police K-9 near Cincinnati Ohio.  The vests are $1800 each!  And we only need a little over $100 more to be able to purchase the vest!  <br>
<br>
I'll be updating the amount raised on the website very soon.  If you'd like to learn more about it or see a photo of the recipient, or want to make a donation... please visit my Dog Scout Troop's website: www.DogScoutTroop107.com <br>
<br>
Donations of $20 or more still can get a custom patch (photo of the patch is on the website.) Just be sure to include your return address and a stamp to cover the postage.<br>
<br>
Thank you all again!  We had a GREAT time!  <br>
