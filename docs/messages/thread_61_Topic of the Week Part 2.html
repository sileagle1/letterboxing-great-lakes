                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I thought a picture was worth a thousand words, so I uploaded <br/>
two pictures of my letterboxing bag and contents.  As you can see in <br/>
the pictures, I also have a "clip-on" pen on the outside of my bag <br/>
and I also have some "first-finder" prizes on a key ring on the <br/>
outside too.  I haven't gotten around to ordering my patches yet, <br/>
but they will be sewn on the bag eventually.<br/>
<br/>
You can view these photos in the photos section in the Dragon's <br/>
pictures folder.<br/>
<br/>
My students are also in the process of completing thier version of <br/>
the Triangles Triangles Everywhere letterbox series for thier <br/>
PreCalculus or Trigonometry class with me.  I hope to add some of <br/>
thier photos soon as well.  (Hopefully no spoilers.)<br/>
