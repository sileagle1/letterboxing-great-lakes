One thing about your post that I noticed; it sounds as if you placed <br/>
the entire letterbox into an additional plastic bag. Did I read that <br/>
correctly?<br/>
<br/>
I haven't put any of my boxes into an exterior plastic bag. I'm <br/>
afraid it would arouse the curiosity of little critters plus give <br/>
them an easy way to drag it around with all that loose plastic to <br/>
get little paws on or sink teeth into. <br/>
<br/>
I have only come across a couple of boxes that were contained within <br/>
an exterior protective plastic bag layer.  Like yours, they were <br/>
near areas in which flooding was a possibility.  Just wondering how <br/>
many others on the list do use exterior plastic bags around their <br/>
letterboxes???  What kind of experience have you had doing so???<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

might not survive spring flooding.  However the water levels are <br/>
fairly low this year so we weren't concerned about it as we traipsed <br/>
out to check it.  But when we got to the trestle all that we found <br/>
was the outer ziploc bag (secured in place).  We searched around the <br/>
area, but saw no sign of box or contents.  <br/>

exactly what Bindlestiff noted -- the bag being the <br/>
convenient 'handle' for the critters to pull, drag and move the <br/>
bagged box -- I have not bagged my boxes for quite awhile.<br/>
However, in a couple of cases, I have noticed during maintenance that <br/>
well meaning finders have added a bag to the outside of my box <br/>
(presumably to be helpful). I s'pose I could include a note asking <br/>
finders not to do that but I haven't.<br/>
