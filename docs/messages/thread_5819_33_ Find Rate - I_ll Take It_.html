                    <div class="plaintext-content">I ended up going for 12 boxes today in Madison, WI - and consider it a victory that I found 3.5!  This was my first crack at these - and most were urban boxes.  Some of them require more research, puzzling out and, ahem, going to the RIGHT park.  Some of them appear to be missing - these were the more urban ones.  In one sad case, all I found was half the stamp.  :(  My real victory was the box I thought was gonna be impossible - the Cow Protection Program, whose clue once you get to the park reads:  N8-66@215-crotch@255.  I am slowly learning that the puzzling, more difficult boxes are the more fun ones, generally.  I'll have to work on my clue writing since I want to provide such fun for you all.  (Wish I knew the icon for a thinking cap or devilish smiley.)<br/>

FungusWoman - I feel for you - I'm going to a shower in an untouched by me area for LB's, and I probably won't get to search 'cause of the weather and possibly riding with non-boxers.  Fooey.  Maybe I can do it before the wedding in May?  Hmmmmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all have gotten to enjoy the nice weather by going boxing!<br/>
