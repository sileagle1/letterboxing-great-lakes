one would be. I had to inform them that there was nothing coming up <br/>
for a LONG time. They were all very bummed, so I can't wait to tell <br/>
them about this one. I also can't wait to visit Door County. Sadly I <br/>
have lived in WI my entire life and never been there *shame on <br/>
me*...LOL. <br/>

from the 1970's (you know, the ones that all turn yellow) of my brother  and <br/>
I in the sand at Door County.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, I don't think we (any of us) will make it to this historic gathering  <br/>
:-(<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to be going on a Missions Trip to Jamaica from October 10 - 19  <br/>
and Door County is just too far for us to make in a day/weekend. . . we really  <br/>
need at least 3 or 4 days for a trip that long.<br/>
<br/>
Hope there is a great turn out and that everyone enjoys themselves.<br/>
