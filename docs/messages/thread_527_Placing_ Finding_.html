As for finding...  I especially enjoy the boxes with hikes and those <br>
such as mystery boxes, that require reasearch and/or puzzle-solving.<br>

Good thing we all do this for different reasons, or there wouldn't <br>
be that balance between placing and finding boxes.<br>

Well, that's part of it...!<br>
<br>
For me, placing is less of an out-of-the-house time committment.  I can<br>
carve my stamps, write up my clues, prepare my boxes, etc. any time of the<br>
day...like now, it's 11:30 pm...safe and sound at home.  My available time<br>
to go wandering is very limited (I work lots of weekends), and as stated<br>
many times before, my husband is not really crazy about me galavanting all<br>
over tarnation!  So I can use bits of time to place my own, and live<br>
vicariously through you guys finding them!  I enjoy going out to check on my<br>
babies when I can, and when I do get out to actually find someone else's<br>
boxes, it's an even bigger treat!<br>
<br>
This Friday night I'm having my GS troop over for a carving workshop (blind<br>
leading the blind!) and to teach them the rules of boxing.  After I take<br>
them out to find my local boxes, it will be a good excuse to plan excursions<br>
elsewhere to find other boxes!<br>

I truly think I enjoy placing boxes more than finding them. I love carving<br>
and coming up with clues. Maybe it's because I am a city girl at heart, I'm<br>
just not sure. Any one else out there like me? Surely I'm not alone on<br>
this...<br>
