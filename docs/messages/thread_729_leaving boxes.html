<br/>
You're lucky you have that option.  Of the 23 boxes listed in "Central Illinois" 10 of them were placed by either me or my friend Katy.  And only 5 of those 13 boxes we didn't place are really all that close to us...the rest are all an hour and a half or more away.  And we found all but two of those 5 before we started placing our own boxes (they may be MIA or maybe we just misread the clues...one of the clues is not at all helpfull, in fact it's fairly equivilant to "go to the abandoned brickyard and look under a brick.")<br/>
<br/>
Placing boxes is a lot of fun too though...even if you do have to be very patient in this area to get a visitor.  The boxes we found had still been fairly well visited (except the first one...we were the first finders there).  Besides, there are so many great hiding places out there and so many fun images to turn into stamps!  I must remember to pace myself and leave some of those great hiding places to the newbies that are sure to follow after us.<br/>
