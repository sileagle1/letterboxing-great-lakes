Smoking Fish - In great shape.  Lots of fun, though was confusing <br>
for a bit.  Please make more!<br>
<br>
Playing Possum - in good shape.  Fun journey thru the woods.<br>
<br>
Cooler by the Lake (Pico and 'D) - I found it down the hill a bit.  <br>
Snuggled under root so hopefully it will stick to its spot now.  <br>
<br>
Fool's Errand #17 (The Star) - In good shape.  The mushrooms made me <br>
hungry.  The mosquitos were hungry too.<br>
<br>
Cooler by the Lake (Team Taco) - Found scattered around at hiding <br>
location.  I think the hiding spot is a living quarters for an <br>
animal.  Packaged things back up and placed back in spot, but you <br>
might want to check on it and/or move it.<br>
<br>
Fool's Errand #1 (The Magician) - in good shape.<br>
<br>
Fool's Errand #18 (Moon) - in good shape.<br>
<br>
Fool's Errand #19 (Sun) - in good shape.<br>
<br>
Big Foot - in good shape.  Go do Smoking Fish to learn about the <br>
real Big Foot ;-)<br>
<br>
Chocolate City #1 - First finder!!!!  In good shape.  Made me hungry.<br>
<br>
Chocolate City #2 - NOT first finder (go figure).  In good shape.  <br>
Made me hungrier.  Too bad the concessions was closed.<br>
<br>
These were temporary boxes, and are now picked up to be sent back to <br>
their owners or replanted:<br>

Wherever Corn is Grown<br>
Cooler by the Lake (Artistamp)<br>

Michi-gami (SpringChick)<br>
RainyDay Rabbit (Team Rabbit)<br>
Freebird (Delirium)<br>
Cooler by the Lake (Team Bindlestiff)<br>
Spirit of the Lake (SpringChick)- found scattered about and wet.  <br>
Hope it is not too damaged.<br>
<br>
And the COOLEST of the bunch yesterday.....<br>
<br>
Dragon's Hitchhiker!!!<br>
<br>
Team Taco, Acorn and Golden Boy made and hid this HH/box just for <br>
me.  They secretly put clues under my wiper blade both on Friday at <br>
Chain o' Lakes and on Sat at the gathering, but I didn't have time <br>
to go look for this "Mathman" box (as it was called in the clues) <br>
until yesterday.  I also almost gave up on this one, until I <br>
happened upon an area that looked like what was described in the <br>
clues as I was searching for the other boxes.  Even then it wasn't <br>
easy.  Great clues, great spot, great box.  Maybe I'll hide a box in <br>
the same spot with the same clues for you guys to try.  <br>
<br>
As for the HH, I'm still deciding where to plant it.  I'm thinking <br>
of sending it down to the Atlanta gathering with all the other <br>
traveling event stamps I'm sending, but then those of you up here <br>
will miss out on seeing the great stamp they made!  Decisions, <br>
decisions...<br>

Has anyone found the Milk Capital box lately? I was out there with a <br>

Maybe we weren't looking in the right spot. It didn't help much that <br>
there were SWARMS of mosquitos all around us either. They made us <br>

off. :)<br>

Kate's been on my case for days to ask you this, so here goes:  <br>
Should we post the Vampire Hunter Series on the LbNA site, given <br>
that it may be at that location only until October?<br>
<br>
And while I'm on the subject, could you tell us how you made a stamp <br>
directly from a picture?  Your vampires were truly a sight to behold!<br>

Neither of us had ever found a box so well hidden. The first box we <br>
did together was a library box, and I did Red Rover before that. We <br>
really didn't know how well people hide their boxes, but now we <br>
do. :) We've been having a blast finding all the others in the area.<br>
<br>
Next question. Has anyone found the Playing Possum box lately? We <br>
stopped by there on the way to Chain O'Lakes today. We think we found <br>
the tree that the clues talk about, but the middle was filled with <br>
water, and even though we poked around with sticks, we didn't feel a <br>
box there. Maybe we were just way off...who knows.<br>
