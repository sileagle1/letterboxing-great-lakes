Snuggled under root so hopefully it will stick to its spot now.  <br/>

Fool's Errand #17 (The Star) - In good shape.  The mushrooms made me <br/>
hungry.  The mosquitos were hungry too.<br/>
<br/>
Cooler by the Lake (Team Taco) - Found scattered around at hiding <br/>
location.  I think the hiding spot is a living quarters for an <br/>
animal.  Packaged things back up and placed back in spot, but you <br/>
might want to check on it and/or move it.<br/>

Chocolate City #2 - NOT first finder (go figure).  In good shape.  <br/>
Made me hungrier.  Too bad the concessions was closed.<br/>

<br/>
Team Taco, Acorn and Golden Boy made and hid this HH/box just for <br/>
me.  They secretly put clues under my wiper blade both on Friday at <br/>
Chain o' Lakes and on Sat at the gathering, but I didn't have time <br/>
to go look for this "Mathman" box (as it was called in the clues) <br/>
until yesterday.  I also almost gave up on this one, until I <br/>
happened upon an area that looked like what was described in the <br/>
clues as I was searching for the other boxes.  Even then it wasn't <br/>
easy.  Great clues, great spot, great box.  Maybe I'll hide a box in <br/>
the same spot with the same clues for you guys to try.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the HH, I'm still deciding where to plant it.  I'm thinking <br/>
of sending it down to the Atlanta gathering with all the other <br/>
traveling event stamps I'm sending, but then those of you up here <br/>
will miss out on seeing the great stamp they made!  Decisions, <br/>

Should we post the Vampire Hunter Series on the LbNA site, given <br/>
that it may be at that location only until October?<br/>

And while I'm on the subject, could you tell us how you made a stamp <br/>

&gt; happened upon an area that looked like what was described in the <br/>
&gt; clues as I was searching for the other boxes.  Even then it wasn't <br/>
&gt; easy.  Great clues, great spot, great box.  Maybe I'll hide a box <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the same spot with the same clues for you guys to try.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the HH, I'm still deciding where to plant it.  I'm thinking <br/>
&gt; of sending it down to the Atlanta gathering with all the other <br/>
&gt; traveling event stamps I'm sending, but then those of you up here <br/>
&gt; will miss out on seeing the great stamp they made!  Decisions, <br/>
&gt; decisions...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, after all that, I'm now<br/>

with a <br/>

find it. <br/>
&gt; Maybe we weren't looking in the right spot. It didn't help much <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; there were SWARMS of mosquitos all around us either. They <br/>
made us <br/>

died <br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I did end up making it back down to northern IL on <br/>
Friday.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt; picked up some of the gathering boxes, left some, and found <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; &gt; others on the way down and on the way home.  He's the <br/>
scoop:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; These are permament boxes left where found:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Smoking Fish - In great shape.  Lots of fun, though was <br/>
confusing <br/>
&gt; &gt; for a bit.  Please make more!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Playing Possum - in good shape.  Fun journey thru the <br/>
woods.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Cooler by the Lake (Pico and 'D) - I found it down the hill a bit.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Snuggled under root so hopefully it will stick to its spot now.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fool's Errand #17 (The Star) - In good shape.  The <br/>
mushrooms made <br/>
&gt; me <br/>
&gt; &gt; hungry.  The mosquitos were hungry too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Cooler by the Lake (Team Taco) - Found scattered around at <br/>
hiding <br/>
&gt; &gt; location.  I think the hiding spot is a living quarters for an <br/>
&gt; &gt; animal.  Packaged things back up and placed back in spot, <br/>
but you <br/>
&gt; &gt; might want to check on it and/or move it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fool's Errand #1 (The Magician) - in good shape.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fool's Errand #18 (Moon) - in good shape.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fool's Errand #19 (Sun) - in good shape.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Big Foot - in good shape.  Go do Smoking Fish to learn <br/>
about the <br/>
&gt; &gt; real Big Foot ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Chocolate City #1 - First finder!!!!  In good shape.  Made me <br/>
&gt; hungry.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Chocolate City #2 - NOT first finder (go figure).  In good <br/>
shape.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Made me hungrier.  Too bad the concessions was closed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; These were temporary boxes, and are now picked up to be <br/>
sent back <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; their owners or replanted:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Wherever Corn is Grown<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cooler by the Lake (Artistamp)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cooler by the Drake (TJ Mich)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Michi-gami (SpringChick)<br/>
&gt; &gt; RainyDay Rabbit (Team Rabbit)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freebird (Delirium)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cooler by the Lake (Team Bindlestiff)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Spirit of the Lake (SpringChick)- found scattered about and <br/>
wet.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope it is not too damaged.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And the COOLEST of the bunch yesterday.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Dragon's Hitchhiker!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Team Taco, Acorn and Golden Boy made and hid this HH/<br/>
box just for <br/>
&gt; &gt; me.  They secretly put clues under my wiper blade both on <br/>
Friday at <br/>
&gt; &gt; Chain o' Lakes and on Sat at the gathering, but I didn't have <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; &gt; to go look for this "Mathman" box (as it was called in the <br/>
clues) <br/>
&gt; &gt; until yesterday.  I also almost gave up on this one, until I <br/>
&gt; &gt; happened upon an area that looked like what was described <br/>
in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; clues as I was searching for the other boxes.  Even then it <br/>
wasn't <br/>
&gt; &gt; easy.  Great clues, great spot, great box.  Maybe I'll hide a box <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the same spot with the same clues for you guys to try.  <br/>

Decisions, <br/>
&gt; &gt; decisions...<br/>

Neither of us had ever found a box so well hidden. The first box we <br/>
did together was a library box, and I did Red Rover before that. We <br/>
really didn't know how well people hide their boxes, but now we <br/>
do. :) We've been having a blast finding all the others in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Next question. Has anyone found the Playing Possum box lately? We <br/>
stopped by there on the way to Chain O'Lakes today. We think we found <br/>
the tree that the clues talk about, but the middle was filled with <br/>
water, and even though we poked around with sticks, we didn't feel a <br/>
box there. Maybe we were just way off...who knows.<br/>
