<br/>
I usually put the date and city that the box was found in and sometimes a little blurb.  If I picked up a hitch hiker I also note that next to the box stamp (or, if I don't do that I will note which box I found a HH in next to the HH stamp).  But it's really all up to you what you want to put in your log book.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;2)  I got 2 stamps today that were in "businesses". <br/><br/>
&gt;Are there any rules for placing a box at a business?<br/>
<br/>
Other than getting the business owner's permission, not really.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;3)  Are there any places that absolutely taboo for<br/><br/>
&gt;placing boxes? <br/><br/>
&gt;I have some great ideas for a cemetary series, is that<br/><br/>
&gt;too weird?<br/>
<br/>
The only places that come to mind as being off-limits are national parks (doesn't stop some people, but it is actually illegal) and private property or other such places that the public doesn't have access to.  I don't think that a cemetary series is weird at all...in fact one of my favorite series was a Holloween series that was hidden in two different cemetaries.  I might have some reservations about making it a permenant series, especially if you don't have permission from the cemetary management.<br/>

digest, and then forget to look if anyone else has already responded with<br/>
the same thing directly on the list!):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.  I think there is variation on this one.  Some get very elaborate, as<br/>
they stamp onto an index card (or similar) and then later turn it into a<br/>
scrapbook page.  Others just stamp and go, while yet others may add a<br/>
comment or two.  Whatever youd like to do is perfect for you!  I minimally<br/>
do the date and location, but sometimes add extra comments.  I use a small<br/>
daytimer type 6-ring binder for my log, so I can move, remove, or add<br/>
pages at will.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.  Were you by any chance referring to my boxes placed in businesses?<br/>
Those I definitely got blessings for, particularly since one must ask for<br/>
them by code name.  Ive done three that way, and all have been very<br/>
cooperative and enthusiastic about it, though I must admit I was a little<br/>
disappointed to hear that the owner of Grumpys threw away the cup container<br/>
I made for the box, since he felt it was unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3.  I think the answer here is common sense.  There are many boxes hidden in<br/>
cemeteries, but only when done tastefully and respectfully.  You dont want<br/>
to lift a fallen tombstone in a historical cemetery to hide a box, but if<br/>
there is a tree nearby a grave, that would be okay.  Even if you dont have<br/>
any particular thoughts about the sanctity of a spot, remember there are<br/>
those out there that do.  You dont want to give letterboxing a bad name!<br/>
<br/>
            Absolutely taboo?  About the only things here I can think of are<br/>
government property or high security areas.  In these post 9-11 days,<br/>
security is much tighter.  Base of the Sears Tower?   Not a good idea.  You<br/>
dont want bomb squads to have to investigate your suspicious looking<br/>
Tupperware (that camo tape will do it every time!).  In my earlier, more<br/>
nave days of boxing (wow, last year!) I saw several cool spots on the<br/>
campus of the VA med center where I work.  Duh.  We have federal officers<br/>
posted at the gates.  Uh, dont mind me, officer, Im just looking for the<br/>
letterbox FungusWoman placed on the grounds here.  Dont think that would<br/>
reflect well on my performance evaluation!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>
