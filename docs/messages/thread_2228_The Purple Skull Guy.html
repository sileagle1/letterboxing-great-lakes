<br/>
There has been great speculation at some of the talk lists and discussion forums as to the possible identity of this mystery letterboxer.  It appears he/she has been present at several gathering but has not made him/herself known as several people have reported that the stamp appeared in their log book at the gathering, but nobody has actually met this person.<br/>
<br/>
The mystery letterboxer is quite well-traveled as stamps have been spotted from California to Washington to Maine to Florida. Although they seem to be concentrated the east and west coasts, there have been a few isolated spottings mid-country and I did recently see one in a box logbook in West Michigan.<br/>

Huh?  Who?  Have I been that buried under wedding<br/>
magazines that I have no idea who or what this mystery<br/>
person is?  Could someone pretty please enlighten, or<br/>
point me to a link?<br/>

PS - More wedding related than letterboxing related,<br/>
but there's still a connection, my mother and<br/>
bridesmaids are planning our wedding shower and had<br/>
been tossing around ideas for favors.  They finally<br/>
decided on these little treasure chests they found at<br/>
Oriental Trading Company because they thought they'd<br/>
reflect our love of letterboxing.  How sweet!  <br/>

last month (though in only one box of a ten box series). Mystery <br/>
