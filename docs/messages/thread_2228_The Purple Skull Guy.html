<br>
There has been great speculation at some of the talk lists and discussion forums as to the possible identity of this mystery letterboxer.  It appears he/she has been present at several gathering but has not made him/herself known as several people have reported that the stamp appeared in their log book at the gathering, but nobody has actually met this person.<br>
<br>
The mystery letterboxer is quite well-traveled as stamps have been spotted from California to Washington to Maine to Florida. Although they seem to be concentrated the east and west coasts, there have been a few isolated spottings mid-country and I did recently see one in a box logbook in West Michigan.<br>

Huh?  Who?  Have I been that buried under wedding<br>
magazines that I have no idea who or what this mystery<br>
person is?  Could someone pretty please enlighten, or<br>
point me to a link?<br>

Oriental Trading Company because they thought they'd<br>
reflect our love of letterboxing.  How sweet!  <br>

I've seen the stamp in boxes in quite a few Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic <br>
states over the past few years and even in one down in Birmingham, Alabama <br>
last month (though in only one box of a ten box series). Mystery <br>
letterboxer, indeed...<br>
