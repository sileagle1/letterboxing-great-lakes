                    <div class="plaintext-content">"The Sprite", a long-time letterboxer from Buffalo NY will be in Milwaukee this week to compete in the Comedy League 2009 ComedySportz World Championship.  For more info on her, you can check out her blog:  http://spriteandhighlander.blogspot.com<br>
<br>
She's interested in meeting some local boxers, and hopes to get out to do some boxing in our area when she isn't busy "competing" and taking comedy classes. She's staying at the La Quinta in Glendale. She won't have her own car, so if anyone would like to pick her up to do some boxing, you can let her know (dasprite222@yahoo.com).  <br>
<br>
Here are 2 other chances to meet her & see her in action:<br>
<br>
WEDNESDAY  JULY 8<br>
Does anyone have any suggestions for places near Bayshore Mall & Whitefish Bay for a Meet & Greet & Eat on Wednesday at 6pm or so?   <br>
<br>
FRIDAY - JULY 10<br>
The Sprite is on the Buffalo NY team and will be performing/competing at 8pm against the Portland team.  Following that is a match-up between Los Angeles and Philadelphia. We've been to some ComedySportz performances before, and they are usually hilarious!<br>
Tickets for the show (8pm  9:30 pm) are $15/person.<br>
<br>
More info at:  http://comedysportzmilwaukee.com/tournament.html<br>
<br>
ComedySportz<br>
420 South 1st Street<br>
Milwaukee, WI 53204<br>
<br>
Martini Man & I are definitely planning to attend the show.  Is anyone else in interested in joining us? Also, if anyone wants to get together with us before the show, here are two options:<br>
<br>
Bastille Days at Cathedral Square (free admission) - a little over 1 mile from ComedySportz<br>
