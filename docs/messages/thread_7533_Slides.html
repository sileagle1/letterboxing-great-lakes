Has anyone out there made power point slides about the hobby of<br>
letterboxing? I have to do a introduction about myself at a workshop next<br>
week and am thinking about talking about my favorite hobby! Please let me<br>
know if anyone else has done this and is willing to share an intro to<br>
letterboxing!<br>

(Indiana).  The former has a link on LbNA's Facebook page, and the latter is somewhere down my wall.<br>
