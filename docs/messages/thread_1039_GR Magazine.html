Well, I was one of those who was interviewed at length but whose<br>

the writer DID "get it" but he to wrote me that, "It got cut<br>

was deeply backgrounded on a range of letterboxing variations and I<br>
sensed that he understood how differently letterboxers may approach<br>
the game. He expressed intrigue and curiosity about mystery boxes,<br>
encrypted clues and word-of-mouth boxes. He clearly understood the<br>
inherent conflict between the secrecy of letterboxing and the effect<br>
of publicity on the public places in which boxes are placed.<br>
He and I corresponded just before and after he took a cold, wet and<br>
snowy Lb search with his photographer for a GR area series (with a the<br>
placer's permission). When he finished his hunt he was pretty psyched<br>
up and excited about his adventure and he seemed to feel a real<br>
respect the deeper subtleties of letterboxing. In fact, he said that<br>
he'd probably go back and finish the series when the weather was better.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I think the piece is so incredibly lightweight and<br>
fluffy that it'll not likely generate much of any new interest in<br>

a serious potential boxer may take the bait and look into it further based<br>

Do you think as a favor to those of you interviewed that the author might<br>
provide a full copy which can be posted here?  I'd like to read the whole<br>

I didn't really feel like it was one versus the other -- that <br>
BindleBabe and I were pitted against each other, or that it was in <br>
any way derogatory toward either of us.  I just think he was trying <br>
to show there is something for everyone and you can make it as easy <br>
or complex as you want it to be -- a spectrum I would guess intended <br>
to lure hesitant newcomers as well as geeky puzzle solvers and die-<br>
hard outdoor types.<br>
<br>
It only seemed logical to me that the reporter would pull the <br>
comments he did from his conversation with me and use that in regards <br>
to the more cryptic, mysterious aspects of the game.  Although I try <br>
to offer something for everyone (especially when things were just <br>
getting off the ground here in West Michgan) and have several <br>
straightforward letterboxes and shorter hikes, there are also a lot <br>
of mystery boxes, more vague clues and tough hikes.  Not to mention, <br>
I tend to talk a lot about the "underground" aspects of letterboxing, <br>
hoping that people will see past the tupperware and get to the heart <br>
of the game -- but I do realize that not everyone shares that <br>
perspective and passion.  On the other hand, it makes sense to me <br>
that the reporter pulled what he did from his conversation with <br>
BindleBabe as she offered a different perspective to what he had been <br>
hearing from me and she has worked very hard to place boxes that are <br>
more accessible, putting the game within reach to many people who may <br>
not be able to do a long hike, etc.  One is not better or worse than <br>
the other, one is not right and the other wrong -- just different <br>
approaches.  Everybody looks for something different and letterboxing <br>
can meet that diversity of interest.<br>
<br>
While I think he did a good job of pointing that out, I would have <br>
liked to see less "she said," "she said" and more case-in-point, <br>
trail talk and hands-on letterboxing talk from the author, who did go <br>
on a successful letterbox hunt before writing the article and has <br>
indicated he will probably go again once the weather gets nicer.<br>
<br>
I do agree that the article as it was presented, probably won't lure <br>
too many folks into letterboxing.  Perhaps that is a blessing.<br>
<br>
Such is editing.<br>
