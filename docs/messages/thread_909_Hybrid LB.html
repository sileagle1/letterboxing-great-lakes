Yesterday a friend of mine who is into geocaching asked if I wanted <br>
to go.   I said yes, figuring that he went with me letterboxing a <br>
few weeks ago.  As we were driving to the site, he was telling me <br>
about hybrid letterboxing, which is essentially a letterbox that is <br>
hid, but is found in the same manner as a geocache.  <br>
<br>
Has anyone ever heard of this or found lb's using this method?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I've been to some.  "Squirrel's Stash", which used to be in West Bloomfield, MI, was like this.  There are also quite a few like that in Rochester Hills, MI.  <br>
The only problem I've seen is that some geocachers who aren't familiar with letterboxing accidentally take the box's stamp, thinking it's a trinket.  (Ask the placer of  the "Stone Gulley" box how that goes...).  My mother-in-law tells me that although the letterboxing prospects in the Memphis area are slim, geocaching is so big it was just recently covered by the local paper (again).  Because of this, a local geocacher took pity on us 'boxers and planted a hybrid box.<br>
 <br>
As for my above mentioned new hometown, I find myself settling in nicely- as long as I don't come into contact with any locals.  Their accents make me frantic, and my appearently quick speech cadence makes them just as alarmed.  Two contacts have been marked with a lot of "I'm sorry?"s  (me) and "Ma'am?"s. (them)  It seems that "Ma'am?"  roughly translates into "I didn't understand what you just said at the speed of light, could you please slow down, take a breath, and say it again slower?"  I don't see myself as a fast speaker (and, as a former seventh grade teacher, I have been around the masters of fast talk- anyone who comes into contact with an excitable adolescent girl knows what I'm talking about), but my husband keeps telling me their going to put me in a nervous hospital if I don't calm down.<br>
 <br>
Also, it turns out that "hey" being directed at you is not, in fact, going to be followed by anything else.  "Hey" equals "Hello".  Now that I know this, I probably won't be shooting the greeters at Wal-Mart any more quizzical looks when they say this to me.<br>
 <br>
Ok, off to try and figure my way around town.<br>
Cheers,<br>
Delirium, still saying "pop", even though I've stopped ordering it at restaurants.  Now I just stick to sweet tea.<br>

it was neat to look through the trinkets in addition to seeing the stamps <br>

haven't found those boxes yet.<br>

We drove down near Scott Air Force Base near St. Louis this <br>
Thanksgiving weekend, and I hoped to catch a couple boxes on the <br>
way.  However, most of the clues for St. Clair and Madison counties <br>
are hybrid boxes.  I was able to get letterbox clues for 5 of the 7 I <br>
hoped to get to (I pass one of them each time I drive to visit my <br>
parents!), and even met a geocacher on the way (he was willing to <br>
lead us to one of the hybrids with only the GPS coordinates - thanks <br>
Blue Bead Man!).  These had 2 separate sections - one put-and-take <br>
bag and one stamp and logbook bag.  As these were the oldest <br>
letterboxes I had found (the logbooks go back to 1999 and 2000), the <br>
stamps were in pretty poor shape (likely from the extreme temperature <br>
and humidity changes).  But as they are listed on LbNA, I'll add them <br>
to my find count.<br>
<br>
The St. Louis area geocaches (and hybrids) seem to be geared towards <br>
families with smaller children.  The boxes are found fairly quickly <br>
(for those with shorter attention spans and/or patience) and have <br>
lots of neat toys (that I would have loved to trade when I was a kid!)<br>
But the parks are just as nice to wander through and we had a fun, <br>
but slightly chilly time finding them!<br>
