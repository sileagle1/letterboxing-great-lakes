I got a copy of the Grand Rapids magazine in the mail yesterday which<br>
has the article on local letterboxing. <br>
<br>
Interesting how the final presentation came out.<br>

Anyone else seen it yet and have comments?<br>

<br>
But it is my understanding from talking with him that the article was cut considerably.  Who knows how the editing may have changed the tone of his original piece.  I doubt there will be much impact from this article...  quite frankly, I don't think the magazine distribution is high enough, particularly to outdoorsy kinds of people.  I couldn't even find a copy of the magazine anywhere in the greater Muskegon area -- not even Barnes and Noble carries it outside of the Metro Grand Rapids area.<br>

What were your thoughts?<br>

Perhaps when reporters approach letterboxers for a piece, we could ask them to invite the <br>
editor to join in an afternoon of letterboxing.  Maybe the editor would be more <br>
sympathetic to the aspects they believe expendable?  Just a thought.<br>
