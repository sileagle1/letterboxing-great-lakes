                    <div class="plaintext-content">Everyone's letterboxing gear and carving supplies<br>
vary, and one of the things I love about the talk list<br>
is hearing about different things that people use,<br>
esp. when I realize, "Hey, we should get one of those,<br>
too," or, "Wouldn't life be so much easier if we<br>
started using that instead..."  <br>
<br>
So, my proposed topic of the week is, what one piece<br>
of letterboxing equipment can you just not live<br>
without?  You know, the item that, when you think back<br>
to your early letterbox days, you just wonder, "How<br>
did I ever get by without this??"  <br>
<br>
For us, I think it's the plastic school box.  We found<br>
it at an area closeout store for like, $1 or $2; it<br>
has openings on both sides; the one side is more<br>
shallow, with dividers creating different<br>
compartments.  The other side is deeper and one big<br>
compartment, and it's perfect for us to store our<br>
stamps, pens, inks, etc. all in one handy place, so<br>
that we don't have to rummage around our great big bag<br>
or worry about our stamps getting damaged.  I don't<br>
even remember how we carried our stamp & ink pads<br>
around before then - I think we may have stored the<br>
stamp in an Altoid tin and just rummaged for the ink<br>
pads.<br>
<br>
So, what about everyone else?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd have to say that one of our most used items (other than a logbook and our stamps, of course!) is the DeLorme Atlas & Gazetteer.  If you're not familiar with this, it's a book of maps the same size as a normal road atlas -- but each book covers one state, instead of the whole country.  It's detailed enough to show the name of each road in most rural areas... very helpful for planning routes, finding back roads, and locating some of the more obscure parks, waterfalls, lighthouses, etc.  I've often pre-plotted trips by using small sticky-notes to mark the location of all the boxes in certain areas.<br>
   <br>
  I haven't yet tried the Microsoft Streets and Trips software that several of you have praised highly, so perhaps this is an outdated method, but it has served us well.<br>

<br>
I agree with DeLorme Gazeteers!  I love maps and wouldn't you know, I have<br>
two of Indiana (I forgot I had bought one, BL), one of Ohio, and will add<br>
WI and MI sometime this year.  Well worth the cost.  I highly recommend<br>
this map for Jabber&JoBob's many boxes in Rush County.  I marked the<br>
locations beforehand and when I found a closed road, it made finding an<br>
alternative route much quicker during the trip.<br>
<br>
I absolutely love my hiking stick.  I am contemplating a set of trekking<br>
poles this year.  I want to get into tougher terrain and there have been<br>
times when I wish I had a second pole.  Since they can be pricey, I would<br>
love to hear recommendations.  I've also been eye-ing nordic walking poles<br>
... but that's an entirely different activity.<br>

<br>
Once I'm at the trailhead I use the unit to track me as I walk through the woods. My sense of direction is pretty cruddy, I'm not sure that I'd have the confidence to explore the woods for a box without the GPS unit which leaves electronic crumbs and tracks back so I can get back to the car. (Although I don't completely rely on it and try to be aware of landmarks along the way). <br>

 I think the thing I can't live without at this point is the backpack/stool combo.  I had read some info about it on one of the list and purchased one.  I LOVE IT!!!!! :-) <br>

I really like the wet sponge in the plastic soap case for cleaning off <br>
stamps. I used to put wet paper towels in a ziploc bag. This works much nicer<br>

I myself like the logbook I use.  It's a hard-covered zippered daytimer-type<br>
book, with the standard 6-ring binding.  I have blank paper I punch to fit<br>
it.  When it fills up, I can remove and replace pages.  (My only complaint<br>
is that they don't sell bigger non-zippered binders for archiving, but I<br>
suppose I can always set up a file box type system.)  The inside front cover<br>
of the book has a mesh zippered pouch that fits about a dozen LePlume pens,<br>
and the inside back cover has a pocket I keep my stamp in.  Neat and<br>
compact!  <br>
