Just a reminder that if you'd like to vote for a patch shape, you have one<br/>
more week to cast your vote (see below).<br/>
<br/>
It's also been interesting to see how close the vote is between Ohio &amp;<br/>
Minnesota for next year's gathering location...<br/>

<br/>
  Just a question - off the topic here.....Do you know what's going on with the letterboxing.org website?  Whenever I log on, it says "account suspended".  Is it that way for everyone or just my computer?  I'm headed out to western MI tomorrow and I really wanted to print off some clues, but alas.....  Got any info about this situation?<br/>
