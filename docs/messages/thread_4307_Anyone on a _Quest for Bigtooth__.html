                    <div class="plaintext-content">I dropped off a HH in Milwaukee last August and recently received it <br>
back in the mail.  Someone was doing cleanup in a nature reserve and <br>
found my HH.  When they mailed it back to me, there was another stamp <br>
and logbook in my baggie.  I think it is the log and stamp from <br>
the "Quest for Bigtooth" letterbox from Middleton WI. I've emailed the <br>
planter, but haven't received a reply.<br>
<br>
Can anyone help?  I'd be happy to mail the stamp and logbook to anyone <br>
who would be willing to plant it back in its original location (the <br>
clues are on LBNA) or help me contact the placer (MonkeyHunters) to <br>
return it to them.<br>

Please email me off board if you'd like to help.<br>

know what stamp looks like.  I used my best detective skills to <br>
identity the box since there is no name on the stamp or log book.  It <br>
could be a different box entirely ;-)<br>
