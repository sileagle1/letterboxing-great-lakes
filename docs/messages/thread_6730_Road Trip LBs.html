                    <div class="plaintext-content">THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU to all of you who plant (and rehide well) road trip letterboxes in our region!  We put on over 1000 miles on our car this weekend, and the LBs saved my sanity!  I will definitely be returning the favor by planting some for you all.  THANK YOU!  <br>
<br>
BTW, it was a hoot to see the sig stamps of some of the LbGLK-ers that I've met or "seen" here in the boxes on our trip!  I could just imagine Tiptoe and Tonto trying to be stealthy while in the little booths at the MaidRite in Springfield, IL - or WiHi and MM driving straight to the Babe in the Woods LB in Sprott, MO.  Um, we had some real challenges finding the trailhead for that location - crazy narrow, gravel, winding, crazy country roads.  <br>
<br>
I sure wish the box at Fort Defiance at the tip of IL was still there - stunning location for a native (northern) flatlander!  Yes, I found myself glancing around for the box even though it probably went with flood waters to the Gulf.<br>
<br>
I love this hobby for the places it takes me, the people I meet and the satisfactions of solving clues and finding pieces of art!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well said, Sunny! LK and I go on many long road trips, as I have family both<br>
in MA and CO and frankly, I just love to travel. I think this year, I've<br>
probably put almost 40K miles on my little Honda! And despite the fact that<br>
letterboxing will extend an 18 hour trip to a 24 hour trip (depending on how<br>
many states you go through) we make sure to find at least one box per state<br>
we travel through. It certainly does save one's sanity! Gives you something<br>
to look forward to... little pieces of joy along the road. Ah yes, once<br>
again we sing the praises of this hobby!<br>
<br>
My love to you all!<br>

....Your imagination of Tonto squeezed into those little booths is spot on! He literally looked like Gulliver on a journey to Lilliput!  We still laugh about that box.  Glad to hear that box is still alive and well...<br>
Glad you had a great trip!<br>
