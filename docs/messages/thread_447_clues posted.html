                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, everyone.  Clues for "Shuffle off to Bluffalo" have been posted <br>
in the files ("Clues and more clues").<br>
<br>
Also, I'm taking a chance and putting "Hurray for Hollywood" back out <br>
there.  Clues are posted (also in the files) since it's no longer a <br>
bonus box.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>

PS:  After reading comments about double bagging on the big list, I'm <br>
wondering if I protected my little Bluffalo adequately.  If someone <br>
who goes off looking for her (when you read the clues, you'll know <br>
why I use the feminine) could give her a few more coats of plastic, <br>
I'd sure appreciate it.  I think I may even need to replace the box <br>
my next trip out there.  It was tight when I bought it, but now seems <br>
to be loosening up.<br>

I've posted my two new Minnesota boxes in our files (complete clues) <br>
as well as on LbNA and AQ (teaser version which requires asking me for <br>
the actual clues).  DebRocks will be checking up on the location of <br>
FOOW8, and may need to move it if she deems it an unwise location, so <br>
those may be subject to change.<br>
<br>
I'm putting the finishing touches to the box for FOOW9: Hoffman Tower, <br>
the sister box to the exchange Artdog placed in Indy.  This one will <br>
be within eyeshot of its namesake.  And of course, in keeping with my <br>
series name, fish or water will be tied into the clues!<br>
