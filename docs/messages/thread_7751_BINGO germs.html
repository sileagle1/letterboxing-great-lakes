I'm back home from Florida and this BINGO game is STILL going on. Maybe it is trying to last as long as our long Great Lakes winter. Minnesota sure has been getting hit with late season snow!<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised there hasn't been more complaining. Perhaps there are a lot of you only waiting for one last word?  Don't forget that if your Wildcard has been called, you can use it to fill in your last empty spot.<br/>

You'd think with as few words as are left on the board, you might accidentally stumble on one of mine, but you seem to be sidestepping them!<br/>
