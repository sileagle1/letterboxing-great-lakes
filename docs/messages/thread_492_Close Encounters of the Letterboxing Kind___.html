                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, I was fortunate to have the afternoon off<br/>
of work. I utilized my time by going on yet another<br/>
letterboxing trip (this hobby is ADDICTING!) Headed up<br/>
to the Indiana/Michigan state line at Hesston to go<br/>
after the Hard Scrabble box. As I was pulling out of<br/>
the deserted Hesston Steam Museum post-stamping, a<br/>
minivan with IL plates pulled in the drive way, headed<br/>
for the general direction of the letterbox. I didn't<br/>
stick around to find out if they were letterboxers or<br/>
just vacationing IL people. Then I headed to Warren<br/>
Woods State Preserve near Three Oaks, MI. This really<br/>
shouldn't have been a challenging box, but it appears<br/>
that a bench threw me completely off course. The clue<br/>
states that the bench is before a particular landmark.<br/>
So I pass the bench and come to a spot where 2 VERY<br/>
large trees blocked the path. I'm looking EVERYWHERE<br/>
for this landmark. I go around the trees...nothing. I<br/>
start to look at every cotton pickin' beech tree I can<br/>
see from the trail. Nuttin. So after about an hour of<br/>
nuttin....I head back to the car. I get to the spot<br/>
where the bench is, and began to look at EVERY tree on<br/>
the left for the landmark. A tree BEFORE the bench had<br/>
it, and the Walking Tree was (very)obvious from this<br/>
point forward. However, as I was discovering the<br/>
location of the walking tree, a family came up the<br/>
trail and were rooting around. They didn't have any<br/>
letterboxing equipment with them, but they weren't<br/>
moving too fast. I just nonchalantly walked off in the<br/>
general direction of the box and had a few grand<br/>
moments with the Walking Tree. My, is it ever<br/>
breathtaking! <br/>
In a few weeks I'm planning on heading to the<br/>
Cleveland area to visit relatives and of course, do<br/>
some letterboxing. Can't wait!<br/>

about 2 miles in.  I guess you didn't notice the first bench at the<br/>

getting lucky to spot the mark.<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

&gt; Do you know what boxes you'll be looking for yet?<br/>
<br/>
Well, we're going to start boxing at the BGSU box in<br/>
Bowling Green, then on to Pemberton, Port Clinton,<br/>
Vermilion, Sheffield, West side of Cleveland...<br/>
<br/>
Then, possibly on Sunday we're going to try to hit<br/>
Western PA near where my aunt lives. <br/>
<br/>
*sigh* Today, I'm debating whether to drive to Indy to<br/>
potentially first-find some new boxes......went to<br/>
Chicago yesterday, but couldn't box because I had<br/>
obnoxious non-boxers with me....<br/>
<br/>
What can ya do?<br/>

PS- Dragon: Nope, didn't see the first bench. I think<br/>
I might have come in on the wrong trail initially. <br/>
