&gt;HEY VA! HAVE YOU HEARD? June 14, 2007<br/>
&gt;More than 500 veterans with physical disabilities converge on Milwaukee<br/>
<br/>
&gt;June 19   23 to test their agility, athleticism and strength of spirit at <br/>
&gt;the 27th National Veterans Wheelchair Games, the largest annual <br/>
&gt;wheelchair sports event in the world.  More than 20 veterans injured in<br/>
&gt;current conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq will join veterans from the <br/>
&gt;Gulf War, Vietnam and other conflicts in 17 competitive events. The <br/>
&gt;Wheelchair Games, presented each year by VA and Paralyzed Veterans of <br/>
&gt;America (PVA), are open to all U.S. military veterans who use wheelchairs <br/>
&gt;for sports competition due to spinal cord injuries, certain neurological <br/>
&gt;conditions, amputations or other mobility impairments.  For the first <br/>
&gt;time at the Games, a demonstration track and field clinic will be held <br/>
&gt;for athletes who are able to stand using prosthetic devices. The Clement <br/>
&gt;J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee and the Wisconsin chapter of<br/>
&gt;PVA are hosting the 2007 Games.  Veterans competing in the National <br/>
&gt;Veterans Wheelchair Games come from nearly all 50 states, plus the <br/>
&gt;District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Great Britain. At the Games, <br/>
&gt;veterans will compete in track and field, swimming, basketball, <br/>
&gt;weightlifting, softball, air guns, quad rugby, 9-ball, bowling, table <br/>
&gt;tennis, archery, hand cycling, a motorized rally, wheelchair slalom, a <br/>
&gt;power wheelchair relay and power soccer. Trapshooting and wheelchair <br/>
&gt;curling are exhibition events this year. To obtain more information about <br/>
&gt;the competitive events, visit the Games Web site at <br/>
