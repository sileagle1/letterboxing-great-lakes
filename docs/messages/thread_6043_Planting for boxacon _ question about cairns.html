<br>
To answer questions, I have updated where I have planted on the website.  The only areas that are not planted right now are up around the lake area and the yellow only trail down on the south side of the park.<br>
<br>
We saw cairns while we were out hiking also.  There was a cross country meet there, but they were using white spray paint on the ground to mark the course.  Here is what wikipedia says about cairns:<br>
<br>
In some regions, piles of rocks used to mark hiking trails are called "ducks" or "duckies". These are typically smaller cairns, so named because some would have a "beak" pointing in the direction of the route. An expression "two rocks do not make a duck" reminds hikers that just one rock resting upon another could be the result of accident or nature rather than intentional trail marking.<br>
<br>
We were more concerned about getting things planted and did not stop to investigate the cairns we saw.  Perhaps once the event is all taken care of I'll be able to take more time in the park!<br>
