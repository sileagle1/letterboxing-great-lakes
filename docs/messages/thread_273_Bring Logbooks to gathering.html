for/with their logbooks.  I know we'll be showing each other the <br/>
regular logbooks we'll use to collect stamps this weekend.  Some <br/>
others would like to see "the ones kept at home", the scrapbooks, <br/>
etc.  If you do anything special with your logbooks or make a <br/>
special logbook of your journeys and you are willing to bring it to <br/>
share, please do.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
