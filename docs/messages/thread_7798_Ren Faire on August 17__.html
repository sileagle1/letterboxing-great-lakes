Front Range Hiker (a Colorado letterboxer) will be in Milwaukee again this year from AUG 14-19.  She's interested in going the to Bristol Renaissance Faire on Saturday AUG 17.  Martini Man &amp; I are going with her and I thought it would be fun to meet up with any other LBers that might be there that day.<br/>

Let us know if any of you saucy wenches or goatish peasants will perchance be traveling through the Bristol lands that day.<br/>

<br/>
I highly suggest you invest in a Friends of Faire 'day pass' at the garden. For the cost of $5 per person, you get access to the garden which has doubled in size this year so plenty of space to sit, relax and eat meals without dealing with the crowds. The cost also includes FREE water and gatorade (bring a mug or bottle to refill). That alone is worth the $5 as water to purchase is $2.50 a bottle at the faire. They also have clean privies with usually no lines. Great value! <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am there every day. :-) Just check at the Friends of Faire garden as<br/>
I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; usually there periodically throughout the day. I can send you a PM with<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; phone number, but I don't always hear it. DO check in with Bristol<br/>
Stitch<br/>
&gt; at<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mockingbird Studios. If you need help, she is the go to person as she<br/>
&gt; &gt; planted the boxes this year. There are also at least 2 others who are<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; &gt; most days that I know of. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I highly suggest you invest in a Friends of Faire 'day pass' at the<br/>
&gt; garden.<br/>
&gt; &gt; For the cost of $5 per person, you get access to the garden which has<br/>
&gt; &gt; doubled in size this year so plenty of space to sit, relax and eat meals<br/>
&gt; &gt; without dealing with the crowds. The cost also includes FREE water and<br/>
&gt; &gt; gatorade (bring a mug or bottle to refill). That alone is worth the $5<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; &gt; water to purchase is $2.50 a bottle at the faire. They also have clean<br/>
&gt; &gt; privies with usually no lines. Great value! <br/>

Make sure you bring the clues for the Wenches of Bristol as well as the main clues and the other individual ones placed at the Faire.<br/>

Do you need discount tickets? I can get ticketd set aside at the Will Call window for $10, which is about 1/2 price. Give me a call or text to 262 361 1270.<br/>

<br/>
Merlin had done an excellent job of preparation and had mapped the likely location of all the boxes.  As a result, we were able to find 34 boxes on Saturday!  It probably also helped that we had 5 people/brains searching.  We surprised another LBer (AltChar) when she was replacing a box we were looking for - this meant we also got an unexpected exchange. We missed seeing Calico Krys, but did run into Gibson Girl and saw BristolStitch in her shop.<br/>
<br/>
It had been 10 years since we had been to the Faire and we won't wait that long again.  There is so much to see, and in our quest for boxes we didn't see as much of the entertainment as we could have.  However we did enjoy a few performances, some food, and managed to make a few purchases.  I particularly liked seeing all the human-powered amusement rides!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to those who have planted or assisted with boxes at the Faire!<br/>

&gt; Huzzah!  I LOVED finding some of her boxes on my recent trip to Georgetown! And I'm so excited to say I'll be at Faire as well on Saturday. I'll make sure I'm wearing my signature giant feather hat (you'll know it when you see it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Make sure you bring the clues for the Wenches of Bristol as well as the main clues and the other individual ones placed at the Faire.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you need discount tickets? I can get ticketd set aside at the Will Call window for $10, which is about 1/2 price. Give me a call or text to 262 361 1270.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Front Range Hiker (a Colorado letterboxer) will be in Milwaukee again this year from AUG 14-19.  She's interested in going the to Bristol Renaissance Faire on Saturday AUG 17.  Martini Man &amp; I are going with her and I thought it would be fun to meet up with any other LBers that might be there that day.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Let us know if any of you saucy wenches or goatish peasants will perchance be traveling through the Bristol lands that day.<br/>
