Thank you to all who took part in making it happen.  I can't imagine all of the work it took to organize it all.  It was so fun to put faces with trail names and personalities.<br/>
<br/>
Probably one of my favorite parts was doing all of the pre-event background research for the personal travelers.  Thanks to everyone who put those mysterious questions out there that picqued my interest and helped me get to know you better.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few questions about some of the personal travelers.  You can email me the answers if you want, assuming you want to use the same info for future events.  I will be try to not have my questions be a spoiler for anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Altchar - I did look up and find the answer to "Oh Horrors!"  I would love to know more about your experience with all of that.  How interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Atomic Beans - I forgot to congratulate you!  What did you do your paper on?<br/>
<br/>
Lock Shock and Barrel - I brought you some beads but couldn't find you.  Waaah.  I'd love to hear about your project though.<br/>
<br/>
tat2bob and kimberly - I found the info but am still a bit confused since the era was before your time, I would assume.  Can you explain a bit more?  Was that a relative of yours or something?<br/>
<br/>
Terrio - P.R.?<br/>
<br/>
Trail Rider - You totally have me baffled on your question, but I might have an idea or two.  Any more clues?<br/>
<br/>
Pugnasties - What are "chucks?"<br/>
<br/>
Wormy Wanderers - Any self-respecting 12 yr old boy knows the person you asked about, lol.  Unfortunately I didn't find you, however.  Hopefully next time.<br/>
<br/>
One love jouneying - I was ready    to give you the answer, but couldn't find you.  Grrr.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone.  Looking forward to seeing you again!  <br/>
<br/>
Revode  P.S.  To those who asked - my stamp was a carving of me sitting at my computer, with keyboard, mouse, and my cat watching.  <br/>
