I will keep everyone informed of the proceedings. So far I have a location chosen but not a date. A HUGE state park with 20+ miles of trails and plenty of facilities.I will say more later as I don't want the D.N.R. to "accidentally" find out my plans. Although the MN. D.N.R. only says geocaching is forbidden,<br>
 not boxing (ah yes, I love semantics). Anyway, I digress, My name is Gooble Gobble, or I suppose Chris if you really have to. It's a pleasure to meet all of you and consider this your official, albeit early and uncertain of the details, invitation to Minnesota this coming spring for the first annual Mn. Gathering. Until then, may the road rise up to meet you, may the wind be always at your back, may the sun shine warm upon your face and the rains fall soft upon your fields.<br>

)  Even though MN is not on the home page graphic, you are certainly <br>
welcome here, because yes, Minnesota does border one of the Great <br>
Lakes...  but then so does New York...  but somehow I don't find it <br>
odd that they are not on the GL map.<br>
<br>
Anyway I digress... for the beginning of the "Why is MN not on the GL <br>
Map?" debate, see message #236 (April 2004).  The bottom line -- we <br>
really don't have any hard and fast state boundaries.  Anyone who <br>
letterboxes and feels comfortable in this group is welcome here.<br>
<br>
There have been a few other folks from MN who have been on the list <br>
from time to time.  It is great that you are planning a gathering for <br>
next year!<br>

Hi!<br>
<br>
We'd love to get up that way.  The sooner you have a date the more <br>
likely we can make it by reserving it on our calendar.  (The same holds <br>
true for the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering.)  We already have some hiking <br>
club weekends planned for May 6-7 and June 10-11, so of course we're <br>
hoping the LB events end up on different weekends!<br>
