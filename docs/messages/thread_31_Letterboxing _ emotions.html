                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I lost my first letterbox. First, in more ways than one ... <br>
not only the first time a box has gone MIA for me, but this was also <br>
the very first stamp I ever carved and the first box I ever planted.<br>
<br>
The stamp wasn't anything special to look at, in fact it was really <br>
quite crude. I had found the letterboxing site and gotten excited <br>
enough to want to participate, but had not explored the carving <br>
tutorials yet. I took an eraser and hacked it with a kitchen knife <br>
into a rough aproximation of a pine tree and called it good. LOL<br>
<br>
I have since gotten better at carving (IMHO) and have placed other <br>
boxes.  If anyone had asked me about my philosophy on it, my off-the-<br>
cuff reply would've been something along the lines of those <br>
sentimental things I've seen for sale in the tourist traps. I don't <br>
remember exactly how it goes, but it's something like "If you have <br>
something, set it free. If it comes back to you, keep it forever. If <br>
it  doesn't, it's no big deal."  (Obviously I don't have one of <br>
those cross-stitch throw pillows around to refer to ... LOL, but I <br>
hope you get the drift of it.)<br>
<br>
Ok .... so it's like my kids. I always had this belief that my "job" <br>
as a parent was to work myself out of that job ... ie: to have them <br>
become self-sufficent, productive members of society.<br>
<br>
So how come I miss that ulgy little stamp so much?<br>
<br>
I expect I'll loose some more before all is said and done .. that's <br>
the nature of this activity and a risk I'm willing to take. <br>
<br>
Now, on the "good" emotional side ... today while we were out <br>
placing boxes an elderly gent who was walking his dog yelled out to <br>
us, "Hey! What do you kids think you're doing?" I looked around to <br>
see who he was yelling at and my daughter whispers, "He's talking to <br>
us, Mom."  LOL ... I'm in my mid 40's!!! I could've run over and <br>
kiss the old guy for calling me a kid. (grin) Fortunately, we <br>
practice "trash out" so my daughter held up our trash bag and <br>
said, "Cleaning up the mess other people left."  Smart girl, hey?<br>
<br>
Anyone else have a story they're willing to share?<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, they become like your babies.  Fortunately my first carved box <br>
stamp is still in place.  I keep close tabs on that box because <br>
although it is not my first box (did 3 with purchased stamps first), <br>
it was my first carving -- well, okay my second...  the first one <br>
was identical with backward letters.<br>
<br>
Sorry to hear your box went missing...  that is the frustrating part <br>
of this hobby.  But I find it inspires me to look for better hiding <br>
places -- both in terms of where the box rests, and also the area <br>
around it -- high traffic areas make it difficult for people to <br>
search, stamp and replace without being seen.  Also prompts me to <br>
make my clues not quite so straightforward as I did in the <br>
beginning, which I think deters any intentional vandalism, although <br>
I don't even want to admit that happens.  Still not foolproof, but <br>
it does seem to help some.<br>
