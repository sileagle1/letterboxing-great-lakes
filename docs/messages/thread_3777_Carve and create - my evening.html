                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speedsquare, your book sounds great!  I have started the same tradition - an individual handmade book for each gathering.  It will be fun to have this collection of unique books filled with stamps specific to that gathering.  The one I made for the Carve & Create last week was only 4 thin signatures and still has a lot of empty pages because we were a small group, but June will require a thick book for sure!  I did double needle coptic stitch for the binding and was really happy with the results.  I may even get more creative on the next one and add in a couple of envelopes and perhaps a different type of paper to mark sections -- i.e. event boxes, exchanges, etc.  Can't wait to see photos of your new book!<br>

the directions last night.  "Taking the plunge" is exactly how it <br>
sounds!  I look forward to meeting you and seeing your shamrock logbook <br>
as well!  Thanks for sharing your experience with the rest of us.<br>
<br>
How long did it take you??  I saw that for someone experienced, it takes <br>
about 30 minutes. <br>
