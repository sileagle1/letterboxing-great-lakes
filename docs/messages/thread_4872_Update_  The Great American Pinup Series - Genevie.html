We just wanted to give a quick update on Genevieve, who until this <br/>
afternoon was hopelessly trapped in a block of ice.  She's been rescued <br/>
from the ice, but the box needs some minor repairs.  Fortunately, <br/>
everything inside the box was dry and intact.  (All hail the awesome <br/>
watertightness that is Lock &amp; Lock!)<br/>
<br/>
We'll be doing those repairs during the next 24 hours, and plan to have <br/>
the box replanted before the weekend (same preserve, new location).  So <br/>
when we've replanted and the clues are updated, we'll update this post <br/>
to let you know!<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>

Genevieve has been replanted, in a new home within the same forest <br/>
preserve.  Revised clues are available on www.letterboxing.org, and on <br/>
Atlasquest.<br/>

Happy hunting!<br/>
