Welcome to the group. You have no reason to apologize for your<br>
comments. They are funny. By all means, please keep them coming.<br>
Between my voodoo antics, Tiptoe's adventure in Bingoland, and WiHI's<br>
photo's, the lol comments are getting us all through this dreary<br>
winter. Watch out for SC so....I hear her exteremities are tingling.... :0<br>
