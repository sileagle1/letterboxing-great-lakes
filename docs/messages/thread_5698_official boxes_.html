                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got a letter from a friend who works for the Urbana Park<br>
District, saying that one of my letterboxes was found by a grounds<br>
crew this past week and is in her office awaiting me. For some reason,<br>
the box was in a flower bed, which means it was halfway across the<br>
park from where it should have been!  Oh, well. <br>
<br>
But the more interesting part of the email was that indicated that 30<br>
boxes are going to be planted by the park district as part of the 30th<br>
anniversary celebration.  This has me a little concerned.  Any one<br>
have any experience with "official" letterboxes?  Some how the park<br>
district having official, advertised boxes worries me, but maybe I'm<br>
over-reacting.  <br>

had were geared towards families and kids.  I'm curious how long they <br>
lasted.  One was in the library and I think it went missing the first <br>
weekend.  The few others that were hidden in the parks were tied down to <br>
the ground and rather easy to find.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The staff at Porcupine Mountains State Park in Michigan U.P. have planted 8 letterboxes in their park.  They are listed on letterboxing.org and I believe also at AQ.  They have a display at the visitor center about letterboxing and have all of the clues available there also.  They also allow letterboxers to plant "unofficial" boxes in the park without a permit as long as they are placed responsibly (i.e. not in an are that would harm the seeker or the environment) and maintained.  I am very encouraged by their involvement in the hobby and their willingness to just play along rather than take control.<br>
