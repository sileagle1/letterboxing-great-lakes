Hey Speedsquare,<br>
<br>
I've done this sort of thing with several stamps I've carved as gifts.<br>
<br>
Until I saw your message, I hadn't tried a snowflake though. I ran a<br>
few ideas through my graphics program last night. I ended up doing it<br>
as a 1/6th portion of the final snowflake image. I carved it while<br>
OD'ing on back segments from the CSI show (thanks to a NetFlicks<br>
membership for Xmas) and it worked out really well. <br>
<br>
I'd love to hear how your attempts went.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

Thanks to Acorn (I think) I was thinking of the snowflake website and<br>
wondered if I carved just 1/8 or 1/12 wedge of a circle and then<br>
stamped around 8 or 12 times, would this give me a pretty good image?<br>
