                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi guys, just wanted to give you a heads up. I released a HH in the <br>
Cleveland, OH area and couldn't find the info on it. Subsequently <br>
the owner contacted me and made a request to add info to the HH. See <br>
below:<br>
<br>
BarefootLucy here - SJZ's mom (maker of the HH Jolly). You can log <br>
Jolly as shown below. It's listed under my name. I realized when you <br>
emailed that I had not listed it on LBNA, but it's there now. Would <br>
you mind writing my email address on the cover? Although SJZ is <br>
still letterboxing, she doesn't read the boards and has an agent <br>
(me) to maintain her clues.<br>
<br>
SJZ will be glad to hear you found it. Since turning Jolly loose on <br>
the world, she has ventured out into the world and found herself a <br>
great guy, and as I type this, she is two days overdue with her <br>
first child, so she has a bad case of the summertime no-baby-yet <br>
blues!<br>
