                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of gatherings.  Since everyone seemed supportive of the idea, <br>
we posted "GLG2015: A Baker's Dozen" on AtlasQuest and reserved the <br>
shelters at Castle Rock.  As we wade through winter, we'll supply more <br>
information, but for now, please mark down June 13th!<br>
<br>
If anyone is interested in hosting a pre-event get-together on Friday, <br>
please let me know, and I'll be happy to include a link to it.<br>
<br>
Finally, would people traveling to the event be interested in having <br>
some boxes to do along the route?  Maybe one stopping point, from a <br>
variety of directions, that would be 1-2 hrs outside the main event area?<br>
