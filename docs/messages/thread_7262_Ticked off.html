Will's finger is all better, thanks for asking. He now has a nice scar he can show you next time you guys meet up -- it's Alex's time to come with me to SILO (she's the only one who hasn't been to a SILO event).<br>
<br>
Another thing, found 3 more Egyptian stamps while on lunch break at work today. That first hill is a killer in the snow, but I made it without falling :-)<br>
<br>
Just one more trip to get the Sphinx and I'll have the whole collection :-)<br>

Will's finger is all better, thanks for asking. He now has a nice scar he can show you next time you guys meet up -- it's Alex's time to come with me to SILO (she's the only one who hasn't been to a SILO event).<br>
