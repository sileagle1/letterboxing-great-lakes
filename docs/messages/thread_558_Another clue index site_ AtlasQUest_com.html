<br>
I don't think Atlas Quest has been promoted much yet, but I know that at<br>
least a few members of this regional group are registered at the site.  I<br>
agree that it looks like a very promising tool and have used it recently to<br>
find boxes that are located on longer hikes.  In an email correspondence<br>
with Ryan last week he confirmed that only boxes submitted by placers are<br>
included, so if any of us want our boxes included on this site, we need to<br>
add the appropriate info.<br>
