&gt; reaction to any of these pesky plants.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could say I have been so lucky.  I am right now nursing a mild case<br/>
of poison ivy -- fortunately not nearly as bad as last time I had it, but<br/>
annoying to the point of insanity all the same.  Not quite sure where I<br/>
picked it up...  We were camping up at Silver Lake in Mears this weekend and<br/>
I spent Friday 'boxing in Ludington and Pentwater, but I didn't see any<br/>
along the way either place.  Must just have been focused on the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
BTW -- Foregone Flamingo, MI or Bust, Cheeseburger in Pardise and Misplaced<br/>
Manatee are all in fine shape.  Thanks for a great afternoon Bindle Babe!<br/>
