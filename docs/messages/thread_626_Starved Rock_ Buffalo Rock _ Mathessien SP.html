Stargazer I wasn't really sure about if you have to go down the <br>

closed and beign rebuilt) <br>
<br>
Didn't really put much effort into the Point.  Because of work, <br>
there are some issues with point about why you shouldn't be <br>
there..but that is a different story.<br>

We found Stargazer and the Point letterboxes. We didn't go on the<br>
stairs at all, if that helps any. They were being worked on when we<br>
were there too. We didn't find St. Loius, though. I don't even see<br>
St. Loius on the list anymore, unless I'm looking at the wrong place.<br>
