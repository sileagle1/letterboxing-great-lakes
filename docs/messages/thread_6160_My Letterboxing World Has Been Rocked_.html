However, when I first started I counted HH's in with my F-count. Once I got <br/>
 to about F300 I reconsidered and went through and deleted out all the HH's <br/>
I  counted as finds. So, ALL my F-counts changed and I lost about 22 off <br/>
the total  number.<br/>
<br/>
I log my PFX counts in my logbook alongside the stamp image, so I have some <br/>
 overlap and double numbers in my logbooks. However, my spread sheet is now <br/>
spot  on (as far as I can tell) :-)<br/>
