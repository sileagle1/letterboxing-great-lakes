  You go on a 48 hour two state boxing trip with only two hours of so called sleep in your car. I did just that this summer in Mn. and Wisc. Sooooooooo much fun. Especially Dragon's tunnel series on very little sleep, by myself, with no flashlight. Don't forget to set aside May 19th-21st for Minnesota's first ever gathering. Plan ahead, We'd love to see you here (Please forgive me for the shameless plug, but I figured it fit in) Who knows, you could be saying "You know you're addicted when... you drive to Minnesota from (put your city/state here) for a gathering and hit countless boxes on the way to and from."<br>

Those brown signs on the highway - that never even entered your line of vision before - now make you scramble for a piece of paper to quick write down the name of the park so you can check for a box as soon as you get to the next library....or wi-fi truck stop (HAHAHAHA....BindleBabe will get that one!)<br>

-  You drive 2 hours to get a stamp you already have just so the new <br>
log book you bought in February will include the January stamps (is <br>
that addiction or compulsion?).<br>
<br>
-  You plan your vacations around "hot" letterboxing spots and assure <br>
your non-addicted, but compliant, partner that there are "just a few" <br>
letterboxing stops to make along the way.<br>
<br>
-  Your Palm Pilot contains more letterbox clues and park maps than <br>
anything else.<br>
<br>
-  Every movie you see, every book you read, every interesting place <br>
you visit becomes fodder for a "future" letterbox series.<br>
<br>
-  You travel halfway across the country to visit your daughter and <br>
spend the first entire day you are there at a letterbox gathering <br>

...  you discover you're only slightly more upset about the fact that <br>
your house caught on fire as you are upset that you've lost 3 weeks of <br>
planned letterboxing, the clues and work done towards the around the <br>
world boxes and missed all the long planned gatherings.<br>
<br>
Sidenote: It was a kitchen fire with no major structural damage just <br>
extensive smoke damage and only a few "irreplaceable" items were lost. <br>
So being the positive people we try to be when we think about what we <br>
could have lost compared to what we actually lost it's hard to be too <br>
upset.<br>

Isn't it amazing the things that run through your mind while you are <br>
sleeping?  When I was in college, I used to joke that I debugged my <br>
COBOL programs in my sleep...  never failed if there was one that was <br>
giving me fits, it would come to me while I was sleeping.<br>
<br>
Reminds me of this summer when we were in the U.P.  I spent a couple <br>
of hours trying to figure out a LB and was making a really stupid <br>
mistake (really, very stupid).  It was 1 of a series of 3 and I had <br>
got the other 2 boxes, so I really wanted to find this one.  But, <br>
finally after walking around the entire park a couple of time (a few <br>
miles), I gave up.  We were about 45 minutes up the highway en route <br>
to the Porcupine Mountains when I suddenly realized where I went <br>
wrong.  I blurted it out, but thought it best not to ask to go back <br>
as we were already way behind schedule due to the time I had already <br>
spent looking for that box.  Imagine how thrilled I was when Old Shoe <br>
turned the truck around and headed back down for it! (What a guy!)<br>

That IS great!  It's wonderful when there is someone who understands <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">.when you submit your yearly vacation schedule at work (in January) and it<br>
is based on all the gatherings you are aware of to date.  And when one comes<br>
up later, you beg your coworkers to swap weekends (sometimes at a<br>
two-for-one rate!) so you can attend it!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Or you begrudge the fact that you miss a gathering because you have to pick<br>
up your daughter from the airport after she is gone for a week on a school<br>
trip out of the country (still mad about that one!!!).....   Or you have to<br>
leave one early because it's her Homecoming Dance that evening.....<br>
