from you and forget to mail your bingo stuff.  Remember, I need to <br/>
have it in my hands by 12/31/05.<br/>
<br/>
Several people have already sent their lists and booty items -- this <br/>
is going to be a great prize package!  If you've sent your stuff and <br/>
are wondering if I've received it, I am keeping a list of who is <br/>
playing (i.e. who I have received stuff from) in a database at the <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like more info about the game, see the files LBBING_play <br/>
and LBBING_list in the files section at the list.<br/>

I also included my TESS stamp inside the package.<br/>
