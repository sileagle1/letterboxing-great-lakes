Hi all, I have two questions.<br/>
<br/>
 1.  What exactly is a "cootie"?  I have a vague impression that it is a<br/>
stamp passed to an unsuspecting letterboxer to find later among his<br/>
possessions . . . right?  Is it JUST a stamp, no little logbook, or what?<br/>
Does the recipient then pass it along as well?<br/>
<br/>
 2.  I have just started carving stamps, and have tried the image transfer<br/>
method that uses fingernail polish remover.  I find this works quite well as<br/>
long as I don't over-soak it!  However, when I have finished carving the<br/>
stamp, how do I remove the original image and end up with a nice clean<br/>
stamp?<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

  I've found that using one more quick wash of acetone (the same nail polish remover you tranferred the image with) takes off all the transferred toner nicely.  However, don't do this too many times as it does seem to remove a *very* thin layer of the stamp.  I figured that out when I had a carving with some extremely shallow, light lines... and they started disappearing after multiple cleanings with acetone.<br/>
