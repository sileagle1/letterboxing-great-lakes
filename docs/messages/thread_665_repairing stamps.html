Here's one from me:<br>
<br>
For my stamps, I use that darn crumby stuff because its carves <br>
sooooo easily. There have been times that small, but important bits <br>
have broken off; especially when I'm trying for a really fine line. <br>
I've repaired those void areas using the matte gel medium that I use <br>
for mounting by building up the area in layers. There are several <br>
other products that could be used in the same manner, for the same <br>
purpose. <br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

I always use master carve or speedy stamp that does'nt crumble easy. <br>
Also if you dont get an even coat on the stamp it will effect the way <br>
the stamp looks after it is stamped.<br>
