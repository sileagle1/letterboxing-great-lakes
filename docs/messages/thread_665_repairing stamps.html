Here's one from me:<br/>
<br/>
For my stamps, I use that darn crumby stuff because its carves <br/>
sooooo easily. There have been times that small, but important bits <br/>
have broken off; especially when I'm trying for a really fine line. <br/>
I've repaired those void areas using the matte gel medium that I use <br/>
for mounting by building up the area in layers. There are several <br/>
other products that could be used in the same manner, for the same <br/>
purpose. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

I always use master carve or speedy stamp that does'nt crumble easy. <br/>
Also if you dont get an even coat on the stamp it will effect the way <br/>
the stamp looks after it is stamped.<br/>
