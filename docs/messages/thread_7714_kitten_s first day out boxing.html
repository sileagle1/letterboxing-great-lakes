boxing adventure.  He did pretty well, and dealt quite well with the<br/>
tummy carrier we picked up on the spur of the moment.  We're hoping to<br/>
get him chipped, and more acclimatized to going on adventures with us,<br/>
at least on day trips so far.<br/>
<br/>
He's pretty calm and collected in the car, and gave the boxes a really<br/>
good sniff.  I think he wants his own personal stamp, but I'm going to<br/>
hold out on making him a personal traveler, as he's still pretty new at<br/>
this.  Keep an eye out for the 3 of us on the trail!<br/>
