&gt; So at azobox's suggestion, I started perusing Mark &amp;<br/><br/>
&gt; Sue's planted boxes, and I'll be, they DID plant one<br/><br/>
&gt; on a cruise ship!  Too bad that's not the ship (or<br/><br/>
&gt; cruise line) we're using for our honeymoon.  But now<br/><br/>
&gt; I'm inspired...hmmmm...<br/><br/>
&gt; <br/><br/>
&gt; OK, must come back to earth.  Too much to do before<br/><br/>

I think I remember reading on Mark Pepe's blog site that he left a <br/>
letterbox on a cruise ship, so it has been done! Of course, maybe it <br/>
was that cruise ship that went up in flames recently ;)<br/>
