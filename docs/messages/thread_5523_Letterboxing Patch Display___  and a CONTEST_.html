September at the "We Live and Breath" gathering in Oregon there was a<br/>
display of letterboxing patches throughout the years -- LbNA patches,<br/>
Dartmoor patches and of course regional and state patches, including<br/>
the two version of our own Great Lakes Letterboxing patch.  Here is a<br/>
link to the display online if you are interested in seeing it.<br/>

<br/>
Anyway, after taking a look at the variety of patches displayed, I<br/>
noticed that a couple of states within the GL region have their own<br/>
patch (Ohio and Indiana) and I thought it would be fun if all 6 states<br/>
within the region had individual patches.  So what does everyone<br/>
think?  How about a contest for patch designs for the other 4 states<br/>
(Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota)?<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to coordinate the entries and post them online for<br/>
voting.  Once the final designs are selected, I would solicit a<br/>
volunteer from each state to be the point person for getting the<br/>
patches made and taking orders, etc.  I am sure Wisconsin Hiker could<br/>
share her experience with this as she currently does this for our<br/>
regional patch.  If we time it right, maybe we could have them in time<br/>
for this year's Great Lakes Gathering!<br/>
<br/>
Is there interest?  Give me your thoughts and I will put together a<br/>
timeline and instructions for submitting your design(s) for consideration.<br/>

I'd love to see a MI patch!  I have no artistic ability, so I'm not <br/>
sure I'd be great at ideas, but I but it could be cool!<br/>
