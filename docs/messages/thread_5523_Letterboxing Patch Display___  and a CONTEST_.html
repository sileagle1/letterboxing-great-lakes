so I thought I'd pass along this item of interest.  This past<br>
September at the "We Live and Breath" gathering in Oregon there was a<br>
display of letterboxing patches throughout the years -- LbNA patches,<br>
Dartmoor patches and of course regional and state patches, including<br>
the two version of our own Great Lakes Letterboxing patch.  Here is a<br>
link to the display online if you are interested in seeing it.<br>
<br>
http://www.weliveandbreathe.com/history.htm<br>
<br>
Anyway, after taking a look at the variety of patches displayed, I<br>
noticed that a couple of states within the GL region have their own<br>
patch (Ohio and Indiana) and I thought it would be fun if all 6 states<br>
within the region had individual patches.  So what does everyone<br>
think?  How about a contest for patch designs for the other 4 states<br>
(Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota)?<br>
<br>
I would be happy to coordinate the entries and post them online for<br>
voting.  Once the final designs are selected, I would solicit a<br>
volunteer from each state to be the point person for getting the<br>
patches made and taking orders, etc.  I am sure Wisconsin Hiker could<br>
share her experience with this as she currently does this for our<br>
regional patch.  If we time it right, maybe we could have them in time<br>
for this year's Great Lakes Gathering!<br>
<br>
Is there interest?  Give me your thoughts and I will put together a<br>
timeline and instructions for submitting your design(s) for consideration.<br>

I'd love to see a MI patch!  I have no artistic ability, so I'm not <br>
sure I'd be great at ideas, but I but it could be cool!<br>
