Perfect size for a gathering - just make sure you put your name on it so we can tell which book belongs to which person when a bunch of us show up with the same thing (I plan on personalizing the cover but utilizing the "2007").  (They had a similar type of book last year which I used for the '06 gathering - it worked out perfectly.  Although this time I'm going to pencil little "this side up" arrows so I don't do like I did last year, with an entire page stamped upside down.  Oh, well!)<br>

The last gathering I attended had event stamps bigger than my 5 x 7 log book.  I was envious of people that had larger, spiral notebooks for their exchanges and event stamps.  Other than that - I'd say do whatever you like.  I plan to have 3 books (exchanges, event stamps and letterbox finds).<br>
