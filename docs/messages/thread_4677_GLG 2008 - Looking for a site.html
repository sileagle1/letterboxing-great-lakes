                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, most places can either be reserved 1 year in advance or beginning JAN<br>
1.  It's best to plan well ahead if you want to reserve things in popular<br>
parks.  The year we hosted, we knew in November of the previous year that we<br>
would hosting, that way we were able to make reservations the first day of<br>
the year.   I know the organizers of the Mythical Creatures event in Iowa<br>
did the same thing this year - reserved the first day they were able to at<br>
the start of the year.<br>
<br>
Hopefully something will work out for a place in Indiana or Minnesota if we<br>
get a decision soon.  I think today was the day that SpringChick wanted any<br>
"bids to be host city" in to her, so we should know in the near future.<br>

P.S.  I wouldn't worry too much about exceeding the capacity a bit - it is<br>
rare that everyone actually would be there at the same time.<br>

 Have you looked into Shades State Park at Waveland on the western side of Indiana?? That place had the wildest stairs/ladders and trails I've seen in any park. <br>

pavilion has 20 picnic tables, with room to spare; there is a real  <br>
restroom, bar-b-q grills, a HUGE grassy area - 5 miles of hiking  <br>

(several times).<br>
It is an ideal spot - and not as used (or known) in the area as the  <br>

There is a grocery store close by; hotels in Chesterton, and of  <br>

At one time Tiptoe and Tonto had a letterbox in this area - but it  <br>
had to be moved as they are also starting to build in the area (it  <br>
was conceived as a place to live, work, and play).<br>
<br>
Unfortuately, I cannot co-host, but would be able to find more info  <br>
if this spot sounds good to willing hosts.<br>

I would think Whitewater park would work out fine.  It has boating, golf, camping, and some really nice trails!  There are also some large cemetaries in nearby Harrison that are nice where I had some boxes planted.  www.metamora.com is only 25 minutes away too.  <br>
 <br>
Most of the time, ALL of the attendees are not at the pavillion at the same time anyway.  People float in and out.  If you can get the High Plains shelter, it has a capacity of 350!  The Bluebird and Big Sycamore shelters have a 180 capacity.  The high plains one is the most "out of the way" and least likely to get closely patrolled by the park police.  Big Sycamore is also "out of the way" but doesn't have as large a parking area and the park police are BIG on enforcing the parking rules. The Blue Bird shelter has a HUGE grassy area near it and an additional shelter (Tanager) nearby- within view.   If two of the smaller shelters that are close together can be reserved, that's another option.<br>
 <br>
The park does have a $3 day pass or $5 yearly park pass that everyone will need to pay.<br>
I'll offer to help as my limited time and energy permits since I'm only 10 minutes from this park. <br>
 <br>
If we use the whitewater, people will want to reserve the campground NOW!  If it's not already full.<br>
 <br>
There's a nice new hotel in Harrison OH that's not far from the park as well, just off Bigg's blvd.  Don't recall the hotel name, but it's a chain.<br>

Bummer.I know it had not been brought to the group for location approval, but I thought if I waited any longer, I would not find anything available. I guess I've learned that if we want to have this location for 2009, I should reserve it on June 1, 2008 - one year in advance.So, I am back to square one in finding a good location. I have been to a number of state parks, and some of the best locations are also the most popular -- Turkey Run, Brown County, McCormick's Creek and Pokagon. I haven't been to Clifty Falls in a number of years, but I think it could be nice too.My biggest obstacle would be in getting letterboxes planted. Richmond is located along I-70 at the IN/OH border, just about 3 hours from the better state parks. If there are other Indiana letterboxers closer to a desirable location who are willing to co-host the gathering, let me know. The online reservation system is easy to use, but shelters may be filling up fast.Do we know anything about Minnesota for 2008?~speedsquare<br>
