Message: <br/>
While placing a geocache at the Ridges in Athens,Oh we found what appears to be <br/>
a letterbox that has suffered great amounts of damage. While we really don't <br/>
want to adopt it, there doesn't seem to be any attention paid to it. We don't <br/>
know who the owner is and don't know whom to contact. There still is a stamp <br/>
inside. It is near the driftwood horse statue behind the Ridges Auditorium. <br/>
Please advise?<br/>
