                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I was helping with recovery tonight at Hobby Lobby and I went over <br/>
to work on the art department. We just spent a few weeks at the <br/>
Rockford store moving aisles and getting all new merchandise in. (my <br/>
jewelry and wearables department are coming up next..yippee!) Well, <br/>
there is a new section in the art aisle that has Mastercarve and the <br/>
Speedball "pink stuff". There is also some of the off-whiteish <br/>
Speedball stuff (that it seems nobody likes) and carving tools. But <br/>
yeah, seeing as how every Hobby Lobby in the country is supposed to <br/>
have the exact same stuff in stock, all the HLs should be carrying <br/>
carving material again! Woo hoo!<br/>
