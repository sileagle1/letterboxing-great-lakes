Dumpster Diva and I have even had another stamper try the  clues because we <br/>
were newbies, and realize we had to "adjust" the clues that we  had already <br/>
posted.  I think we have reposted those a couple more times  since then.  You are <br/>
not alone!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Posting,<br/>

Apparently, you didn't know your sentence should have been  written: No, <br/>
because I am flawless.  It's only one sentence,  goofball!  Take the "And" off of <br/>
your next sentence, and give a comma  before the "never."  Those are only a <br/>
few of the mistakes I can see,  and I am not an English major.<br/>

Got you, Smarty Pants!<br/>
