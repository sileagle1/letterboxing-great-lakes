I recommend Repel 100% DEET.  I have a small pump bottle in my bag.  The mosquitoes must really hate this full strength stuff.  A little spray here, there, and eerywhere, usually on my clothes more than directly on my skin, and those human eating pests don't even fly around me.  But I need to be more careful thrashing around in bushes; my arms are all srapped up and I think I might have an allergy to Junipers.  Long sleeves would help, but it's soooo hot!  <br>

Don't let 80 bugs stop you....have fun letterboxing!<br>

The mosquitoes are ravenous this summer!  Even with bug spray, a mosquito bit me on my face on my cheek.  A bump was forming so I immediately applied After Bite and the swelling and redness were eliminated and the itching stopped.  That's my letterboxing tip for the day.  <br>

Now that's what I call an outfit which surely won't attract attention when you're sneeking around looking for letterboxes.  LOL.   But mosquitoes aren't going to ruin our summer months for finding (and placing) letterboxes.  <br>
