pictures of them, too.  Personally, I think with Thanksgiving coming <br>
up, they are just trying to get the sympathies of letterboxers:<br>
<br>
"Gobble, gobble...but if you eat me....gobble gobble....how will you <br>
ever letterbox again without my help?  Gobble Gobble..."<br>
<br>
Nice try.  Pass the gravy.  --Papeseed<br>

box, I saw a group of wild turkeys surrounding a tree. As it turned <br>

letterbox was out of it's hiding place. The turkeys had been looking <br>

Birds of a feather gathering and they weren't invited.<br>
