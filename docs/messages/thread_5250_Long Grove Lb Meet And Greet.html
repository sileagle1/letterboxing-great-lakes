from 10 am to 5 pm. in the Stemple Parking Lot in downtown Long Grove, <br/>
Illinois. Join me for a very informal Letterboxer's Meet and Greet on <br/>
Saturday, August 16. There are several letterboxes in the Long Grove <br/>
and Buffalo Grove areas. Find the Long Grove Bridge Letterbox between <br/>
12 noon - 12:30 pm, and I'll be sitting nearby on a bench.  And for <br/>
this very informal gathering, I'll bring my signature stamp Letterbox <br/>
Trading Cards to swap with you. I'm posting this event on AQ and LbNA.  <br/>
<br/>
Long Grove is a small village that is like taking a step back in time.  <br/>
Many shops and restaurants too.  www.longgroveonline.com.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you on Saturday.<br/>
