a stamp company to get an entire sheet of stamps.  I haven't tried that yet<br>
tho.  So far, I've bought them already mounted.<br>

<br>
Absolutely! Stamp carving at first seems completely<br>
impossible. I NEVER thought I would be able to do it,<br>
ever. But me being the kind of person that wants to do<br>
things the "preferred" way, I knew that I would have<br>
to carve my own stamp before I could allow myself to<br>
even begin letterboxing. So I bought the little<br>
Speedball kit at Michael's, held my breath....drew a<br>
little armadillo on the medium and carved it out. I<br>
was completely *amazed* on how well it turned out,<br>
considering that during the carving process it pretty<br>
much looks like crap. The key is to not get too<br>
complicated on your first few stamps. Choose small<br>
objects without a lot of detail. Practice....and it<br>
gets easier. I find that drawing on the medium with a<br>
Sharpie helped me define lines, light/dark better.<br>
Every stamp I carve now, I try something different.<br>
For the replacement stamp for the Seven Pillars, I<br>
tried teeny tiny letters. Shockingly, they didn't come<br>
out half bad! <br>
<br>
You can do it! <br>

Perfectionism ruins the stamp.  Every time.<br>

finding that cool little armadillo stamp in one of my boxes and was<br>
thrilled. So, don't be fearful, give it a try.<br>
My first box had the absolutly most primitive stamp possible 'cause<br>
that's all I knew how to do. I've advanced a little since then but<br>
when I had to replace that box's stamp, I deliberatley recarved a<br>
primitive stamp. There is a charm to those stamps.<br>
We've all had the first-stamp experience..... and lived to carve a<br>
second and a third or more.<br>
<br>
As SpringChick mentioned in a workshop or two, knowing when to quit is<br>
the most difficult lesson.<br>

There's a Speedball Speedy-stamp beginners set that<br>
comes with a 4x6 sheet of the pink stuff, a wooden<br>
carving handle and two random blades. You'll need the<br>
#1 blade for stamp carving. Either choice will get you<br>
on the path to carving. If you have trouble finding<br>
what you need at Michael's, try<br>
http://www.stampeaz.com They have a variety of carving<br>
supplies and are the purveyors of the holy grail of<br>
carving materials, PZ Kut. Good luck! <br>

Yay!  You won't regret it.  Carving stamps is just as addictive as letterboxing!  And don't worry if your first stamp doesn't come out exactly as you had envisioned...they rarely do.  But there's something about them that's just special because they are the first.  And they only get better from there.<br>

Thank you for encouraging Kody to carve himself, rather than going the  store <br>
bought route.  I love it when someone has made an attempt at  carving.  For <br>
some reason it feels like a REAL find to me.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I second the "Yay!"  Although we didn't really care that much about the<br>
stamps initially (we really like the CLUES part), we have developed a<br>
definite preference for hand-carved stamps. SO much so that if faced with a<br>
decision on what boxes to search for in a limited time, we will always<br>
choose those with hand=carved stamps.  The first 3 boxes we hid were<br>
custom-ordered stamps (similar to what I've heard is common in Dartmoor and<br>
I think what Matt the Rat does), but then we got brave enough to start<br>
carving.  Practice (and a great lighted magnifying lens!) have helped us<br>
improve our skills.  It was not as hard as I thought it would be!<br>

Yay!  You won't regret it.  Carving stamps is just as addictive as<br>
letterboxing!  And don't worry if your first stamp doesn't come out exactly<br>
as you had envisioned...they rarely do.  But there's something about them<br>
that's just special because they are the first.  And they only get better<br>

Welcome to the mysteries of hand carved stamps! Yup, making<br>
letters/words is a big part of the challenge (besides remembering to<br>
make them backwards). But I'll bet if you aksed everyone on this list<br>
how the first few (dozen!) stamps with letters went, the consensus<br>
would support your sentiment.<br>
Hang in there... and congratulations on your commitment to carve your own.<br>

Letters are hard to get a uniform look.  They are my least favorite part of a stamp.  A lot of people just don't put the box name on the stamp because they don't want to carve letters.  I used to always put the box name, even though the letters were crummy, but lately I have been excluding the box name on some where the stamp needs to be smaller to fit into a smaller box.<br>
<br>
All I can say about the letters -- it gets better with time and experience.  A few things I have found helpful -- <br>
<br>
-  Use Sans Serif fonts -- the ones without the little tails, legs and feet on the letters (Times Roman is a Serif font, whereas Arial is Sans Serif -- i.e. "without" serif).<br>
-  Carve out the small inside spaces first, like the insides of the letters o, a, e, d, b, p, etc.  It is difficult to get these once you've taken away the support from around the letter itself.<br>
-  Make small sectioned cuts -- don't try to do around the whole outside of a letter in one stroke, rather first make a cut along the bottom of a letter, then up the right side, then across the top, then down the other side.<br>
-  When doing circular cuts, for instance around an "O", keep the tool steady and instead of moving the tool along the letter outline, turn the piece of carving material -- this seems to give a much smoother cut.<br>
-  Make the letters larger.<br>
-  I always carve the letters on my stamp first because this is the most difficult for me.  This way if I mess up and have to start the stamp over, I haven't spent tons of time on the image already.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>
