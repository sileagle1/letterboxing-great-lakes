A few of the boxes you listed were ours... and thank you for the nice <br/>
emails too.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids were excited to hear that we had visitors :)<br/>
<br/>
We will try to get out that way to the Woodie Box, to see if we find <br/>
your compas.<br/>

It wasn't our first adventure.  We started about a month or so ago <br/>
and have been out every weekend since, I think.  It was just a very <br/>
eventful day with the hitchhiker, first finds and great venues.  I <br/>
just thought I'd post since there were previous comments about people <br/>
being disappointed with not finding boxes.  We had 2 "unfounds", but <br/>
didn't let that ruin the day.  Had a lot of fun!<br/>
<br/>
I love the place you choose for the Butterfly stamp and that super <br/>
deep "Woodie" stump was super creepy and great for a near dark find!<br/>
