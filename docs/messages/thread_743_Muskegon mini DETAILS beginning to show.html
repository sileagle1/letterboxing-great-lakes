1. If you're interested in attending, please send me an email so I <br/>
can add you to the group mailing list I'm creating. (Don't want to <br/>
clutter up the list with TOO much of our traffic)<br/>
<br/>
2. Tentative start time is 11am meeting for brunch somewhere in <br/>
Muskegon.<br/>
<br/>
3. We have a name for the get-together and an event stamp has been <br/>
carved for the ... drum roll please ... SWEETEST DAY MINI MEET<br/>
<br/>
4. A series of 3 new boxes have been placed in the Duck Lake area <br/>
for our mini-meet. We get the clues for the weekend, they won't be <br/>
posted top public via letterboxing.org until Mon 10/18<br/>
<br/>
5. End of the day will be in the White Lake area. I'm thinking we'll <br/>
stop boxing by 6 or 7pm and either go get some dinner and/or do a <br/>
campfire thing at Team Bindlestiff's land-based winter dwelling.<br/>
<br/>
6. I've unpacked some of my supplies and they'll be available for <br/>
use (no charge, of course) by anyone who ends up back at our place.<br/>
Logbook stuff: I have a professional paper trimmer (the Genesis <br/>
Safety Trimmer) if you want to easily cut papers exactly the same <br/>
size. I also have a Quick Coil Binding Punch which punches at 4:1 <br/>
pitch and some coils. (Note, this is not a comb binding system, <br/>
these are coils. Just ask if you have questions, ok?)<br/>
Stamp stuff: Do you have some stamps already carved but not mounted <br/>
yet?  Well ... I have plenty of foam core board and matte medium; <br/>
bring those stamps along and we'll get them mounted.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
