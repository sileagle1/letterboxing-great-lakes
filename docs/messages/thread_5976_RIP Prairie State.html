It had been hidden under some rocks wedged at the base of a tree, but we <br/>
found the rocks scattered about and no box in sight. :(  It had been <br/>
planted over 2 years ago, and we believe only had one finder -- <br/>
FungusWoman -- shortly after planting, so who knows when it actually <br/>
disappeared.  We will not be replacing it since it was planted a ways <br/>
off the beaten track for us, and I doubt we'll get back out there any <br/>
time soon.<br/>

Anyway, congrats to FW on having a truly limited edition image! ;)<br/>

Speaking of that box, does anyone know if IL 71 is open south of Ottawa all the way to 178?  I'm assuming it is, since that was a couple of years ago that it was closed for repairs, but I haven't heard anything.  That is such a beautiful approach to Starved Rock!<br/>
