We are not even in the game at all this year - neither Martini Man nor I<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is exciting!  I woke up this morning, after a week of not-much-fun, <br>
really looking forward to the SILO meet-up.  Then the phone rang - my MIL <br>
needed to go to the ER for a UTI - and with her Alzheimer's she can't go <br>
alone.  Aarrgg.<br>
<br>
So getting a 4-corners makes up a little for missing SILO - and since TWO of <br>
my words were exchanges, I must be grateful for the 2 meet-ups that I did <br>
make it to!<br>
<br>
Sorry I missed SILO - really glad I FINALLY won something!   And Grandma is <br>
back at her assisted living home with antibiotics and she told me to "BUG <br>
OFF"  and "leave me alone" at about 4:00.  She's on the mend for sure!<br>
