Of course, TJ Mich's Michigan J Frog LB from the GLG was one of those surprises!  <br/>

If you choose to go for this unique hide, be prepared for tall grass - and keep your eyes open for the yellow blazes of the Ice Age Trail.<br/>

What has been a pleasant surprise for you all when it comes to LBing?<br/>
