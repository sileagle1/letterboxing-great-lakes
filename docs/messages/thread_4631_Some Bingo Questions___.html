                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've received a few e-mails with Bingo questions that I thought I<br/>
would share with the group because they are good questions and there<br/>
are several new players this year.<br/>
<br/>
Q:  What if I can't check the group every day, will I miss the words?<br/>
A:  You can always look back in the group messages to the previous<br/>
day, but if you are playing Bingo, you might want to turn on e-mails<br/>
or daily digest if you are not already getting group messages.  There<br/>
is also a database on the group site that lists all of the words.  It<br/>
is to your advantage to keep up when we are playing as there may be<br/>
times when action is required on your part within a limited time window.<br/>
<br/>
Q:  What do I do when I get a Bingo?<br/>
A:  Please e-mail me (letterbox@comcast.net).  I will then confirm<br/>
against the copy of your card that you mailed me and post notice of<br/>
confirmed Bingos to the group.  You can certainly gloat and share your<br/>
excitement with the group if you want to, but remember that it is not<br/>
an official Bingo until I have confirmed against your card...  there<br/>
have been instances of *false* Bingos in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Q:  Do I have to let you know on the exact day that I win?  What if I<br/>
don't check the list that day and then somebody else wins in the meantime?<br/>
A:  I suspect that once you get close to a Bingo, you will be making a<br/>
point to check for the word each day, however, because life can<br/>
sometimes get in the way...  you have 3 days from the time of your win<br/>
day to claim your Bingo and still have it be effective on the day you<br/>
actually won.  If you miss this, you can still claim it, but it is<br/>
then effective on the day I receive your e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
Q:  What if more than one person has a Bingo on the same day?<br/>
A:  The first year we played, I did a tie-breaker, but last year there<br/>
was enough stuff in the Bingo Booty to award all winners in a tie<br/>
situation.  The prize box is looking great already, so this year I<br/>
will do the same thing as last year -- in the case of a tie, all<br/>
confirmed bingos on the same day will be winners.<br/>
<br/>
Q.  Can I win more than once?<br/>
A.  Yes, multiple wins are allowed.  For instance, if you are the<br/>
winner of one of the Interim games (i.e. 4 corners, perimeter, etc.),<br/>
you are still in the running for the other games.<br/>
<br/>
I have opened up all of the packages I have received so far (as of<br/>
yesterday's mail) and updated the database with status.  Thanks for<br/>
all the great prize items so far -- this is going to be fun!<br/>
<br/>
Also a big thank you to those who sent holiday wishes and goodies for<br/>
the host and her OldShoe...  it is much appreciated and I trust these<br/>
were solely in the spirit of the season with no intent to bribe ;-)<br/>
