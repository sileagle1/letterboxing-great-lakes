Speaking of articles...has anyone in the Chicago area or outskirts been contacted by a woman named Jennifer (don't recall her last name at the moment)?  She emailed me a month or so ago about doing a freelance article (possibly to be submitted to the Chicago Tribune).  Being hesitant to be responsible for another piece of media coverage, I attempted to explain the concept that while not unfriendly, letterboxers like to preserve the secrecy of the activity.  I then tried to talk her into doing something on the topic of postals as mail art (pitching the idea that there have been so many articles lately on conventional boxing, maybe she'd like an original angle), but she wouldn't bite.  I eventually sort of agreed to work with her, but had stipulated I'd like to see the draft before she submitted it.  The last I heard from her was that she would be unable to do that.  I was wondering if she contacted anyone else.  Nitrocat, you came to mind as someone she might contact since I<br/>
 think she lived out your way.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few years back, Deedle &amp; I received an email from a<br/>
reporter for a local weekly newspaper around Cleveland<br/>
(The Sun News, for those in the area) who wanted to do<br/>
a story on letterboxing.  Now, lucky me, I have a<br/>
friend who used to be a reporter for The Sun News so I<br/>
was able to get the scoop on this guy and find out if<br/>
he'd treat the story properly, and if<br/>
The-Editor-Who-Messes-Up-Everything (the editor my<br/>
friend used to work under) would be touching the<br/>
piece.  (One example of why I refer to him as<br/>
The-Editor-Who-Messes-Up-Everything:  He decided he<br/>
needed to clarify a photo caption once about speed<br/>
limits, and rather than leave the caption reading<br/>
"Speed limits such as the one in the photo above,"<br/>
changed it to "Speed limits of 55 such as the one in<br/>
the photo above."  Too bad the speed limit on the sign<br/>
in the photo above was 50, NOT 55).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, feeling that the reporter would do justice, I<br/>
emailed back but stipulated that we did not want our<br/>
real names used in the article, only trailnames<br/>
(Deedle's family is so uncomprehending of letterboxing<br/>
we no longer tell them that's what we're doing, we're<br/>
just "going hiking in the woods - didn't need to get<br/>
any more grief from people who knew us) and we didn't<br/>
want our faces included in any photos.  Never did hear<br/>
back from that reporter....<br/>
