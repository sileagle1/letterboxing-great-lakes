I emailed the placer to confirm if that was indeed the case, but got no response.  We are planning on heading down there to try again this weekend.  If anyone has found this box and would be willing to confirm our wrong start spot (and tell me if our next idea for a start spot would work better), please email me off list at papeseed at tds dot net.  Thanks!  --Papeseed<br/>
