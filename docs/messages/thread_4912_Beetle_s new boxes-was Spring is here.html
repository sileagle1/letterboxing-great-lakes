                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lbers were out looking for my boxes, but I,  Beetle, was at a place called Wonderland in Camp Lake, WI. conducting a Lb workshop and mini letterbox gathering this weekend.  Now, there are a dozen new Lb addicts who are well educated in the proper etiquette of being sneaky.  This weekend, I placed 4 temporary boxes, but I was also able to place another permanent, traditional box for everyone to seek and find. I gotta add it to AQ tonight.   The hardest part....where is Camp Lake, WI?  Blink and you'll miss it.  LOL!  <br>
<br>
All that warm sunshine felt so good today.  I was driving home and I drove past three locations where I knew there were new letterboxes by Lock Shock and Barrel.  GRRR...and I didn't have the clue sheets with me.  Then I thought, such a nice day, there's bound to be a letterboxer dropping by the area soon, maybe I should just sit and wait for one to show up.  LOL!  But I went home instead.  I didn't think I could keep my eyes open nor did I think I had enough strength left in me to hike and seek.  I am totally sleep deprived from all the fun I had this weekend in Camp Lake.  6 1/2 hours sleep over three days....YAWN!!!  Fun has it's price.  <br>
