time to look for the box on the trail... but who knows about the evil ranger<br/>
station???<br/>

Will do. We contacted ArtGekko whose clues were not posted publicly on AQ so<br/>
we are likely to go back if/when we get those. Either way, we wouldn't be<br/>
opposed to just stopping by on one of our many commutes between WI and MN<br/>
just for the sole purpose of bugging those rangers. Always a WI lbxr at<br/>
heart. :)<br/>

&gt; If you do go back, you're welcome to ask if they have Manoomin or The Body<br/>
&gt; (Martini Man's box), but I suspect they tossed them long ago. The images<br/>
&gt; were very specific to MN, so if by some miracle they still exist they<br/>
could<br/>

&gt;  Seriously? lol. are you guys (Leapin Lizzards) really moving up here?<br/>
&gt; Hoping<br/>
&gt; to make a box in honor of our wonderful Stout university... maybe you can<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; my first finders! hehe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WiHi... did you ever call the rangers? We'd be happy to pick up your box<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; you and bring it back safely for a re-plant in our safe WI parks if they<br/>
&gt; still have it. LK and I tried stopping by after our adventure the other<br/>
day<br/>
&gt; because we wanted to ask, but they were closed by the time we were done.<br/>
If<br/>
&gt; you (or anyone else) finds that the Afton SP rangers are sittin on your<br/>
&gt; precious treasure, let us know so we can return it to you!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was wondering about LB placement on MN state trails. They're not part<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the MN state park system, so is it okay to stash boxes along them?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know about permits for this kind of thing, or does one just<br/>
&gt; &gt; hide it real good and ask for forgiveness later? I've looked about for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the information, but I haven't found anything terribly specific to<br/>
&gt; &gt; TRAILS.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; any info would be appreciated, there are gods that need to hide along<br/>
&gt; &gt; trails!<br/>

seeing as I'm pretty much an anarchist anyway, that goes along with my<br/>
ideas, but I don't really want attention from the great state of MN, so<br/>
I'll hide well enough, and hopefully the squirrels won't care for the<br/>
smell, too. :D<br/>
<br/>
For me, it's all about the art, sharing the art, and getting people to<br/>
maybe see a place they have never seen before, or to see a place in a<br/>
different way than they've seen before.  I also like the "hidden in<br/>
plain sight" idea.<br/>
<br/>
...speaking of which, when is anyone going to Darwin to check out the<br/>
box there? :)<br/>

I tend to disagree on this point, although not enough to bother trying to persuade anyone. If you like to play your secret and perhaps subversive method, I'm not here to stop you.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who would like to play it safer (keeping the park managers on your side- they will mostly leave you alone) the "permit" method for placing a letterbox (or geocache- the same rules apply) is really very easy and can be found here: http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/geocaching/index.html<br/>
It is supposed to apply to state parks and trails.<br/>
<br/>
In all fairness, the park staff do have a job in maintaining the park for everyone, and they do have every right to curtail activities that they feel might negatively impact the land. If the only reason they pull a box is 'cause you're not playing by the rules (registering) then I too think that's dumb. But as custodians of the park, they get to make those rules. That's why I think you ought to play on their terms; it's easy, it works, and as far as I know, they don't get involved once the box is planted. That's enough from me, thanks.<br/>
