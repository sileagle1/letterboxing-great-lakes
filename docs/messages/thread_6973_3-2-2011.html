Clearly more pleading is required, so here we go:<br/>
<br/>
There once was a man from Nantucket...<br/>
(Oh wait, this is a family-friendly site, can't use that one.<br/>
Okay, let's try again.)<br/>
<br/>
There once was a young man from Portland...<br/>
(Frap  nothing good rhymes with Portland.  Back to the drawing board.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Here we go - with sincere apologies to Edgar Allen Poe)<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a morning deary while I pondered weak and weary<br/>
Over many a quaint and curious word I'd not seen before<br/>
Alice DeGarmo, queen of the Big Top?<br/>
And Gitchee Gumee made my heart drop<br/>
Did I have them?  Nevermore.<br/>
<br/>
Highlighter poised &amp; at the ready, I tried to hold my poor hand steady<br/>
Searching for surcease of sorrow from the selections at my door<br/>
"Be these words our sign of parting" I longed to shriek upstarting<br/>
"Since my losing spell's unbroken!<br/>
I shall read your words no more"<br/>
<br/>
Yet in my deepest yearning<br/>
I knew that I was learning<br/>
To be patient with the bingo fates<br/>
I am their servant, nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
So I linger with my sorrow<br/>
wondering what will be tomorrow<br/>
As I perch here in my chair<br/>
Prepared to amble out the door.<br/>
Am I hopeful? Evermore!<br/>
<br/>

WOW!!  I think that you have earned your title as court poet. Hopefully, you will be rewarded (esp if you have the same words that I do)<br/>
