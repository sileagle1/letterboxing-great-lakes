the Inspector interrogating everyone, we had to get out of here and add <br/>
a new box.  Yeah our 2nd box we planted!!! =)  <head down="">  But, it's <br/>
not in Illinois.  =(   We're hoping to plant one here in Illinois real <br/>
soon, just still trying to find the right spot for it.  Kids are out of <br/>
school, so we'll be planning more trips out to hunt for more locations <br/>
for boxes.  We hope everyone has fun with this one just like the 1st <br/>
one we planted.  =)  The clue is located on both Letterboxing.org and <br/>
AQ.<br/>
