Garrison Keillor performed to a sell out audience through the Performing Arts concert series at Dominican University in River Forest.  <br/>
Our original intent was to pick up a few more boxes by Waltzing Pigs and FungusWoman (as that is very near their stomping grounds) before the event.  But, due to Tonto's insistence to go morel mushroom hunting AND letterboxing, we spent the day foraging 40 miles south!  Which turned out just fine for Kemosabe, as he would've been abandoned at home if plan A had played out...making for a very happy dog..albeit, one filled with burrs, and dare we say, possibly the elusive tick!<br/>
