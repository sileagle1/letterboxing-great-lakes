                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, happy Fathers Day to all you Dads out there. Second, thanks for <br/>
a great third annual GLkG. Team 5th.Wheel had so much fun and learned <br/>
a lot. Thanks to the Wulfes for being so kind with their clues and <br/>
Stormy for putting up with everything. Thanks for the classes, which <br/>
by the way, Spring Chick, we were paying attention,and I love my <br/>
signature book so much I can't put it in a box. The food was great and <br/>
the T-shirts fab. Looking forward to many more "gatherings". Thanks <br/>
to  Mark and Sue for an interesting presentation on letterboxing in <br/>
England. And, most of all Thanks to Team Rabbit for putting the whole <br/>
thing together. Ok, Tom, just waiting for the pics. <br/>
GO NASCAR ! !<br/>
<br/>
p.s. will any boxes be left in place for awhile, especially motown <br/>
     landmarks by Team Rabbit? <br/>
