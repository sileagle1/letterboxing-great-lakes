                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sure! Mine came about mostly from lack of originality. Before I got into letterboxing I had been attending anime conventions for a while and was part of an online forum for said convention. Since I didn't have a costume for the first convention but didn't want to miss out on the dress-up fun that is part of many conventions I made myself a generic kimono (which was really more of a bath robe really, it's kind of a little embarrassing looking back). And being less-than-imaginative when I signed up for the online forum for that convention the only thing that I came up with was "Kimono Girl." When I first learned about letterboxing the very first stamp I carved was done from a photo I have of my dog Aina wearing a kimono for Holloween. And that's how I became Kimono Girl.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not very clear on the origin of Flying Dragon's trail name. He's always been into dragons though so it's probably the first thing he thought of. I want to say his sig. stamp is based on a constellation of stars, but I'm not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Sooner or later we'll probably pick a team name. We've been talking about making a team stamp with a simpler design to use when we're out on the trail with the dogs so that it doesn't take us forever to stamp in. The journey of our group stamp through the washing machine after our last gathering gives us the perfect opportunity, we just haven't come up with anything good yet.<br/>

And we are glad you did!  We have to laugh at you being so humble about your sig <br/>
stamp...Whenever we need an example of a beautiful sig stamp we show both your original <br/>
with Aina and your Kimona Girl  - they are our favorites!  <br/>
