I haven't found that box so I can't help with the stamp image.  I would <br>
encourage you to consider possible reasons that the box went missing. <br>
The most common reason is a poor location.<br>
<br>
I love to see old boxes maintained/updated/replaced.  But I also know of <br>
many boxes that should never have been placed in their hiding locations <br>
to begin with and I don't think those should be replaced.<br>
<br>
As I said, I'm not familiar with this box or its location so I can't <br>
give you an opinion, I just don't want you to invest a lot of time if <br>
the box is not worth the effort.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for your thoughts.  I completely agree!  This location should be okay, if slightly altered.  There were trees that got damaged in a storm and changed the hiding spot into a visible location.  <br>

I think that we have the Sneak by the Creek stamp in our books....and we could scan and send the image to you. Just need to dig it out.....that was an oldie for us! :-)<br>

That would be wonderful!  Sneak by the Creek hadn't been found in quite awhile and I was hoping someone would have it.  Thanks!<br>
