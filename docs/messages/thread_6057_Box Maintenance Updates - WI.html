                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a gorgeous day!  We were out on the trails all day, finding 6 boxes (and a HH and great FF prize!) and doing box checks/mainteance on 7 of our boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
We're happy to report that all 7 boxes are in good shape!!!  A few had water in the box, but the baggies kept the contents safe.  Thanks to all of you that take the time to be sure they are closed securely.  As a result of our maintenance checks, Martini Man has tweaked the clues for his "Field Survey" 4-box series at Nashotah Park.  Hopefully people will now have an easier time in actually locating the boxes.  My "Diamond in the Rough" box at Nashotah was in perfect condition, even though it is almost 5 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
I have updated the clues for my "Marsh Visitors" box at the Horicon Marsh.  This is the box that had been found by maintenance personnel.  Luckily they saved it and someone from the state office contacted me.  They definitely wanted the box to remain at the marsh.  When we went to replant it, we couldn't find the sign mentioned in the original clues, so please print the NEW clues if you want to look for the box.  While we were there, we also checked on my "Marsh Vegetation" box.  We had almost given up on it, when my diligent scraping finally revealed the box.  It is amazing how much tree dirt/sawdust a rotting tree can create!  We had to dig down at least 4"-6" before we found the box.  Amazingly it was in great shape.  We've run into this situation before on at least 2 other occasions.  If you are ever looking for a box in rotting tree debris, be thorough in your search.  It is probably buried deeper than you would think.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you all had a chance to get outdoors today, even if you weren't able to box.  It was a perfect fall day!<br/>

and plants for the Boxacon in Minooka Park yesterday.<br/>
We planted a 4 box series that will sure be a fun hike!  It was great seeing<br/>
the purples, red and oranges that are appearing in the trees already and<br/>
hearing the acorns drop from the trees.  Finnigan (our dog) also had a fun<br/>
time romping through the woods and taking in the fresh air.<br/>
<br/>
We are sooo excited about the Boxacon we are counting down the days! It<br/>
would be great if the weather is as beautiful as it was today, however if it<br/>
isn't One Love and I always like a challange and an adventure!<br/>
