I was just trying to access the files for this group and nothing will open.<br>
I wanted to check out some of the older clues and nothing would open so I<br>
thought maybe they are to old so I went into the bingo files and those<br>
wouldn't open either. I kept getting a yahoo file not found error. Anybody<br>
know what's going on or if I'm doing something wrong? I tried just double<br>
clicking on them to open them and right clicking and doing a save target as,<br>
neither worked.<br>
