  We have been having a horrendous few months. Things have just been <br>
crazy. We were soooo looking forward to making this gathering and <br>
were supposed to be spending this week doing nothing but driving <br>
around and boxing but our house caught on fire on Sept. 5th. Right <br>
now we are living in our RV and with family. We THINK we know where <br>
are stamp is at and that it didn't get put into the boxes the <br>
company is cleaning for us.<br>
<br>
  Depending on what happens today with the insurance guy and the <br>
contractor we are thinking of coming down. If we can make it would <br>
it be OK to just bring something store bought???<br>
<br>
  Anyway here's to hoping we can make it there and if not there than <br>
that we'll be able to find our passport and start traveling around <br>
the world. We're so far behind there too. And our 80 days are going <br>
by fast LOL<br>
<br>
  Thankfully although the house will probably need to be entirely <br>
gutted we didn't lose any photos, scrapbooked pages, irreplaceable <br>
items or our logbooks LOL<br>

That is so terrible to hear.  I am sorry for your loss<br>
and happy that you didn't lose any of those<br>
irreplacable memory items.  We will keep you in our<br>
prayers and hope that everyhting works out for you in<br>
the best ways possible.<br>
<br>
I am not the organizer of the event, just an attendee,<br>
but I would love to see you there even without any<br>
stamp at all.  I know when I bring food for a potluck,<br>
I bring extra for the people that decide they are able<br>
to come at the last minute so you are fine by me.<br>
<br>
I really hope to see you there, and agian wish you the<br>
best in putting everything back together after your<br>
loss.<br>

You can definitely still come to the gathering.  I mainly wanted to have<br>
people let us know if they were coming so we had a rough idea of how many <br>
to expect - or if we should just cancel the reservation on the pavilion<br>
and stay home.  Thankfully, people are coming and the weather forecast<br>
looks decent.  Store-bought stamps are fine;  I was planning to bring a<br>
few extra stamps and ink pads because I invited some non-experienced<br>
boxers to come and see what it's all about, so don't worry about it.<br>
<br>
I was out yesterday planting two boxes and noticed that the pavilion has<br>
bathrooms attached, a playground next to it and a nice fireplace full of<br>
wood.  I'm thinking marshmellows...<br>
<br>
See you tomorrow!!!<br>

  We're still hoping to make the Oct.22nd gathering in MI (we have our fingers crossed) so hopefully we will be able to meet some of you there.<br>
