Bali,  That is SO COOL!  Thanks for sharing. If they are attached to some sort of backing, they might even work for letterboxes!Chris Puls "Scoutdogs"Troop Leader for Dog Scout Troop 107 (OH-KY-IN tri-state) www.DogScoutTroop107.comCaptain of the Dearborn County Animal Response Teamwww.TriStateCART.com My boys: www.Dog-GoneHappy.itgo.comMy book: www.SafeHomeVisits.comMy art: www.PictureTrail.com/scoutdogs<br/>

home stamping making kit <br/>

WOW! I just saw this "make it at home stamp kit" being demonstrated. It's a really cool product that turns any image or photo into a polymer stamp, without carving. It's really pretty expensive, and I can't really see using it for letterboxing, but it's fun to watch. I'd still much rather hand carve my own stamps, but I thought I'd share the video if anyone was interested in seeing it. Maybe some people that "can't carve" would be interested in this for making custom stamps, rather than store-bought.http://crafttvweekly.com The video should be on the main page, but if not search for Tricia Morris and find the video titled "stamp your art out".Bali <br/>
