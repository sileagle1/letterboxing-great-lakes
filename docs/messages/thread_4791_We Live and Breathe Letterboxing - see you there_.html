                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey you Great Lakers!  Wow, it's been a long time since I logged on <br>
to this group - way too long!  I guess that's sort of par for the <br>
course when you move across the country, to lose track of what's <br>
going on in your former back yard.<br>
<br>
I wanted to pop on today though to mention We Live and Breathe <br>
Letterboxing, the weekend long gathering Der Mad Stamper and friends <br>
are holding out here in the Portland, OR to celebrate 10 years of <br>
American Letterboxing - or, as DMS thinks of it, 10 years since his <br>
life was changed by that Smithsonian Magazine he picked up in a <br>
doctor's office waiting room.<br>
<br>
We opened up registration for the event yesterday, and wow, has there <br>
been a massive response!  We have tons of confirmed attendees from <br>
all over the United States...Florida, Rhode Island, Georgia, New <br>
York, you name it.....only as we began processing the bombardment of <br>
online forms, I couldn't help but think, "Where the heck are all the <br>
Great Lakers?  Feel free to pipe up if I'm wrong, but I didn't see a <br>
single trail name I recognized from Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, or <br>
my home state of Illinois.<br>
<br>
So I just had to swing by, and make sure you guys knew what was up.  <br>
The official website for the event is here:<br>
www.weliveandbreathe.com<br>
<br>
There are two yahoo groups devoted to helping attendees with similar <br>
needs find each other for roadtrip buddies, or room on a Portland <br>
letterboxer's couch if you want to stay for longer than just the <br>
weekend.  One is here:<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NeedaBedGottaBed/<br>
<br>
I'll post the other as soon as I can remember the url.<br>
<br>
This is quite literally going to be the LB event of the decade, so I <br>
sure hope I get to see some of you there - we still have room right <br>
now, but registration is filling up FAST so I don't know how long <br>
that will be the case.  You won't want to miss it!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, here's the other yahoo group I mentioned: <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Liveandbreatheroadtrip/<br>
<br>
This one is devoted to finding people to drive with if you want to <br>
make a roadtrip out of coming to the event.  Mainekokopellian started <br>
it for the East Coasters (there are people driving to Oregon from <br>
Connecticut!)but it's purpose has been expanded to help people in all <br>
states find potential travel buddies.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
I didn't mention before the part of the weekend that I'm probably the <br>
most excited about - we're having a real Letterboxer's Masquerade <br>
Ball on Saturday night, where participants are invited to dress as <br>
their trail persona, or wear what ever other silliness they feel <br>
like.  It's truly going to be a night to remember!<br>
<br>
If anyone has any questions or concerns or just wants more <br>
information, feel free to email me at enigma3742 at hotmail or just <br>
ask away right here and I'll be happy to address that for you!<br>
