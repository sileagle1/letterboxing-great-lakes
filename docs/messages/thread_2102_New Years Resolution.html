                    <div class="plaintext-content">I guess I'll chime in on this subject.  The first part of my <br>
resolution is to placed hand carved stamps into two boxes i have <br>
planted that have store bought stamps in them.  The second part of the <br>
resolution is to recarve a couple earlier stamps I planted.  I find im <br>
better at carving now then I was a year ago and think I can improve <br>
upon them.  The third part of the resolution, which is the biggie, is <br>
to make it to a few letterboxing events to meet some of the people who <br>
share my love and passion for this hobby.  I read the posts and i've <br>
become familiar with names, and i've seen some of the names in boxes <br>
i've found.  Now, I'd love to be able to put faces with the trail <br>
names, and real names to the trail names.  So hopefully I'll be <br>
meeting some of you in '06.  And may everyone have a blessed and safe <br>
holiday season and a joyous and prosperous New Year!!! As always, <br>
happy hunting ~The Cat's Meow~      Becky & Tom Alexander <br>
