Maybe our next Topic of the Week should be where were you on 6/5/10 around 8<br/>
pm... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
...I was in the basement of the Jubilee Cafe eating chocolate cream pie<br/>
(YUM!), while my daughter and her friend were huddled in the office at the<br/>
Country Inn.<br/>

Those that were at the hotel last night were<br/>
apparently asked to congregate in some "safe" areas and the TJMich parents<br/>
told their boys that everyone was having a cookie party so they didn't get<br/>
too worried about the storm (our hotel always had cookies available in the<br/>
lobby). We heard that the LBers at the hotel took the opportunity to do a<br/>
few exchanges at this time (Great Lake boxers are always prepared!). I'm<br/>
curious how the hotel contacted people. Since we were out to dinner w/Tiptoe<br/>
&amp; Tonto at the time, we weren't part of the hotel corridor/laundry room<br/>
party. (By the way, at Buffalo Wild Wings, someone who works there did tell<br/>
us the best place to go in case of a tornado was the restaurant cooler room.<br/>
This was probably the same thing as the Steak &amp; Shake freezer, except we<br/>
didn't actually need to go into it! Instead we stood around and watched the<br/>
storm reports on the large screen TVs, then sat down to eat &amp; socialize. I<br/>
heard the people that ate earlier at the Jubilee Cafe went into the basement<br/>
for safety, but they also got free pie while there!) <br/>
