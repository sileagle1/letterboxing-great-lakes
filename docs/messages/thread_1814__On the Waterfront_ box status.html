In case anyone is still interested in grabbing the "On the Waterfront" <br/>
<br/>
letterbox in Rockford, IL but couldn't make it to the festival, I am leaving<br/>
the box in place until at least mid-October.  I don't want to leave it<br/>
through the winter because it's in a spot that could easily be found by<br/>
groundskeepers when the spring thaw comes but I think it's probably ok for a<br/>
month or so.  <br/>
