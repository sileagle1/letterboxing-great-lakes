story, bear with me on this one...<br/>
<br/>
Way back in 2004 when I first started letterboxing, my fourth find <br/>
was the Milk Capital box...or so I thought. You see, when Wiener <br/>
Mouse and I went searching for it, we went the OPPOSITE direction <br/>
from where we were supposed to go. We either didn't have a compass or <br/>
we didn't know how to read the one we had (my how much we've <br/>
grown...lol). Okay, so we get to the tree we thought we were supposed <br/>
to be at and searched like crazy to find it. We were so excited when <br/>
we actually did find the box. We stamped into it, wondering why a <br/>
handcarved SNAIL stamp was in the Milk Capital box. We shrugged and <br/>
put the box back where we found it and went on our merry way.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward about a year. I see a stamp in Laughing Coyote's book <br/>
that I don't recognize and I ask her where she got it. She tells me <br/>
it is the Milk Capital stamp. Confused, because it certainly wasn't <br/>
the one I found, I decide to go check it out. I went back to the <br/>
location to find the box once again and I have no luck. Since I found <br/>
the box once before, I didn't feel I needed the directions, so I left <br/>
them at home. I did the same thing EVERY time I went back looking for <br/>
the box. Every time I search and do not find anything, I ask Acorn <br/>
about it and every time she informs me that the box is still there. <br/>
Little did I know WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT BOXES.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to today. I went letterboxing with Trail Rider and I <br/>
decided that since I had been having so much trouble with it, I <br/>
wouldn't "help" her find it at all. I gave her the clues and she <br/>
started walking in the OTHER DIRECTION from where I had gone previous <br/>
times. Sure enough, I peeked over her shoulder (like I ever doubted <br/>
her) to look at her compass and noticed she was correct in going the <br/>
other direction. She found the box, safe and sound and without my <br/>
signature stamp in the log. This proved that I didn't find the box at <br/>
all, but a completely different one. Of course I finally stamped into <br/>
it...lol.<br/>
<br/>
Now my question to all of you wise letterboxers is this: WHAT BOX DID <br/>
I FIND THE FIRST TIME? I could never find the clues to this box and I <br/>
have had it recorded as the Milk Capital box for over two years now <br/>
and that was completely wrong. There were a ton of other signature <br/>
stamps in the other box, so I know someone from this list had to have <br/>
found it. If you need to see a photo of the stamp in order to help me <br/>
out, let me know and I will email it to you.<br/>

I checked my binder.  Often I will print out clue sheets and I group <br/>
them by areas.  I haven't been out to the Harvard area, but I still <br/>
have several clue sheets printed from 9/24/2004.  So many boxes, so <br/>
little time to find them all.  <br/>
<br/>
I have the clue for the Milk Capital Box.  But here's the other <br/>
clues I found.  Smokin' Fish and Fool's Errand #19 The Sun were <br/>
placed in 2004 by Acorn.  Right On Track was placed in August 2004 <br/>
by George. Those are the only clues I have from that area back in <br/>
2004. Beetle<br/>

left you a gift. Hey, maybe I should follow the Milk Capital clues the wrong way.  Maybe I'll <br/>
find your mysterious snail.<br/>
<br/>
I started letterboxing in 2003, and Milk Capital had been in place since Thanksgiving of <br/>
2002my very first stamp!  No other Harvard stamps were listed on LBNA at that time.  If <br/>
you were to ask me what my guess is, I guess that an inexperienced boxer visited Milk <br/>
Capital, switched their snail signature stamp with Milk Capital (probably under the <br/>
influence of an insidious geocaching philosophy), realized their mistake later, and <br/>
switched it back.<br/>

Mosey, thanks for jogging my memory.  Yes, I remember Pippi's boxes, but I never knew Keith.  I only remember the two letterboxes in Lake County.  One box was under a bridge and the second box was in a tree, but the clue used another bridge as a landmark.  I found those two Lake County boxes in 11/2004.  But those two boxes were not in the Harvard area.  I believe she moved out of Illinois and took her boxes with her which might explain why they are no longer on a website.  But in 2004, they were listed on LbNA.  I guess it pays to hang on to old clue sheets.  <br/>

probably wasn't a good idea, just in case anyone peeked at my book, I <br/>
stopped doing it. Since it was one of my first finds, I have a photo <br/>
of exactly where it was hidden under the log. You can't miss it if <br/>
you take 34 STEPS (not paces) past post 16. Nearly to the parking lot <br/>
and under the uprooted tree. Maybe...just maybe it is still there <br/>
somewhere. I really want to just heave the log over and look for it. <br/>
The area isn't nearly as overgrown as what the MC area is.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, everyone let me know what the thoughts are on posting the <br/>
photos of the location and stamp. If it is thought of as wrong, I <br/>
won't do it. Maybe Acorn will be a doll and hunt for it. Or maybe, <br/>
just maybe, I can convince Manic Mechanic to drive out there with me <br/>
to search the area for the lost mystery letterbox. :)<br/>

is <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; story, bear with me on this one...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Way back in 2004 when I first started letterboxing, my fourth <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; &gt; was the Milk Capital box...or so I thought. You see, when Wiener <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mouse and I went searching for it, we went the OPPOSITE direction <br/>
&gt; &gt; from where we were supposed to go. We either didn't have a <br/>
compass <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; we didn't know how to read the one we had (my how much we've <br/>
&gt; &gt; grown...lol). Okay, so we get to the tree we thought we were <br/>
&gt; supposed <br/>
&gt; &gt; to be at and searched like crazy to find it. We were so excited <br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; &gt; we actually did find the box. We stamped into it, wondering why a <br/>
&gt; &gt; handcarved SNAIL stamp was in the Milk Capital box. We shrugged <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; put the box back where we found it and went on our merry way.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fast forward about a year. I see a stamp in Laughing Coyote's <br/>
book <br/>
&gt; &gt; that I don't recognize and I ask her where she got it. She tells <br/>
&gt; me <br/>
&gt; &gt; it is the Milk Capital stamp. Confused, because it certainly <br/>
&gt; wasn't <br/>
&gt; &gt; the one I found, I decide to go check it out. I went back to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; location to find the box once again and I have no luck. Since I <br/>
&gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; the box once before, I didn't feel I needed the directions, so I <br/>
&gt; left <br/>
&gt; &gt; them at home. I did the same thing EVERY time I went back looking <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the box. Every time I search and do not find anything, I ask <br/>
Acorn <br/>
&gt; &gt; about it and every time she informs me that the box is still <br/>
&gt; there. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Little did I know WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT BOXES.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fast forward to today. I went letterboxing with Trail Rider and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; decided that since I had been having so much trouble with it, I <br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn't "help" her find it at all. I gave her the clues and she <br/>
&gt; &gt; started walking in the OTHER DIRECTION from where I had gone <br/>
&gt; previous <br/>
&gt; &gt; times. Sure enough, I peeked over her shoulder (like I ever <br/>
&gt; doubted <br/>
&gt; &gt; her) to look at her compass and noticed she was correct in going <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; other direction. She found the box, safe and sound and without my <br/>
&gt; &gt; signature stamp in the log. This proved that I didn't find the <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; &gt; all, but a completely different one. Of course I finally stamped <br/>
&gt; into <br/>
&gt; &gt; it...lol.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now my question to all of you wise letterboxers is this: WHAT BOX <br/>
&gt; DID <br/>
&gt; &gt; I FIND THE FIRST TIME? I could never find the clues to this box <br/>
&gt; and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; have had it recorded as the Milk Capital box for over two years <br/>
&gt; now <br/>
&gt; &gt; and that was completely wrong. There were a ton of other <br/>
signature <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps in the other box, so I know someone from this list had to <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; found it. If you need to see a photo of the stamp in order to <br/>
help <br/>

My feeling is that you should not post the little snail publicly, but feel free to show it to <br/>
any boxers and ask if they've seen it. <br/>
<br/>
Are you saying that the snail is no longer there? Did you check last weekend?  If it's any <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay...Acorn is totally going to kick me for being so stupid even <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; though she tried to help me out with this box for SO LONG! Here <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; story, bear with me on this one...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Way back in 2004 when I first started letterboxing, my fourth <br/>
&gt; find <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was the Milk Capital box...or so I thought. You see, when Wiener <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Mouse and I went searching for it, we went the OPPOSITE direction <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from where we were supposed to go. We either didn't have a <br/>
&gt; compass <br/>
&gt; &gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we didn't know how to read the one we had (my how much we've <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; grown...lol). Okay, so we get to the tree we thought we were <br/>
&gt; &gt; supposed <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be at and searched like crazy to find it. We were so excited <br/>
&gt; &gt; when <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we actually did find the box. We stamped into it, wondering why a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handcarved SNAIL stamp was in the Milk Capital box. We shrugged <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; put the box back where we found it and went on our merry way.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fast forward about a year. I see a stamp in Laughing Coyote's <br/>
&gt; book <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I don't recognize and I ask her where she got it. She tells <br/>
&gt; &gt; me <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is the Milk Capital stamp. Confused, because it certainly <br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn't <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the one I found, I decide to go check it out. I went back to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; location to find the box once again and I have no luck. Since I <br/>
&gt; &gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box once before, I didn't feel I needed the directions, so I <br/>
&gt; &gt; left <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them at home. I did the same thing EVERY time I went back looking <br/>
&gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box. Every time I search and do not find anything, I ask <br/>
&gt; Acorn <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about it and every time she informs me that the box is still <br/>
&gt; &gt; there. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Little did I know WE WERE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT BOXES.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fast forward to today. I went letterboxing with Trail Rider and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; decided that since I had been having so much trouble with it, I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't "help" her find it at all. I gave her the clues and she <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; started walking in the OTHER DIRECTION from where I had gone <br/>
&gt; &gt; previous <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; times. Sure enough, I peeked over her shoulder (like I ever <br/>
&gt; &gt; doubted <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her) to look at her compass and noticed she was correct in going <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other direction. She found the box, safe and sound and without my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; signature stamp in the log. This proved that I didn't find the <br/>
&gt; box <br/>
&gt; &gt; at <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all, but a completely different one. Of course I finally stamped <br/>
&gt; &gt; into <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it...lol.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now my question to all of you wise letterboxers is this: WHAT BOX <br/>
&gt; &gt; DID <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I FIND THE FIRST TIME? I could never find the clues to this box <br/>
&gt; &gt; and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have had it recorded as the Milk Capital box for over two years <br/>
&gt; &gt; now <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and that was completely wrong. There were a ton of other <br/>
&gt; signature <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamps in the other box, so I know someone from this list had to <br/>
&gt; &gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; found it. If you need to see a photo of the stamp in order to <br/>
&gt; help <br/>
&gt; &gt; me <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out, let me know and I will email it to you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Help me out here, people...PLEASE! :)<br/>

&gt; Personally, I know of no "snail" stamp at that place.  Didn't the <br/>
&gt; placer of the Milk Capital say they were going to hide another box <br/>
&gt; there?  Maybe that is it.  Is there a bonus or cukoo?  Or is this <br/>
&gt; like Boyhood Adventures #3 hare in WI?<br/>
