drive-by and we stamped in while in the car.  Before we could put it back,<br/>
another car pulled up and unloaded some serious camera gear to take photos<br/>
of Table Rock Mountain across the way.  It was obvious that they would be<br/>
there for quite a while, and since we had plans to meet people at a certain<br/>
time, we had to leave &amp; therefore took the box with us rather than try to<br/>
rehide it in plain sight of the photographers.  However since it was early<br/>
evening, we didn't think there would be many other searchers that day and we<br/>
returned it early the next morning.<br/>

P.S.  I certainly wasn't suggesting that "Mystery Letterboxers" were bad or<br/>
irresponsible.  All of them that visited my Demon's Dwelling box certainly<br/>
seemed to do a good job, even though they didn't contact me, so I'm fine<br/>
with that.  As I said before, the box was in almost perfect condition even<br/>
though it is almost 3.5 years old.  It's nice to know that it has brought<br/>
some pleasure to even more people than I realized.<br/>
<br/>
However we DO really appreciate getting the notes from others to let us know<br/>
the status of the box and how they did on the hunt!  Since we aren't able to<br/>
check on all of our boxes very often, those emails allow us to get more<br/>
frequent feedback.  Thanks to all of you that do send notes after finding<br/>
our boxes!<br/>

<br/>
I agree, as far as people who might have forgotten their stamp.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes, there's not a whole lot of choice. I've been in a position 4<br/>
times now where I had no choice but to take the box with me temporarily.<br/>
Granted that's 4 times over almost twice as many years but it does happen<br/>
where I'll find a box, take it away to someplace secluded to stamp in, and<br/>
then go to return the box only to find a veritable picnic taking place right<br/>
where I have to return the box. Once recently, in Oakbrook, IL on the<br/>
McDonald's campus, a love-in was taking place when we returned to the spot,<br/>
so we took the box home, waited a few hours, and then returned. We thought<br/>
we were posolutely, absitively, safe since it was Halloween. I mean, who<br/>
goes out into the woods on Halloween. Who goes out into the woods to *make<br/>
out* on Halloween?? Haven't they watched 'Blair Witch'????<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there's just no way to create a reliable distraction where I can<br/>
feel really sure the box was safe, and to me, the ultimate rule is to keep<br/>
the box safe. My sister once almost ended up having to take a box home.<br/>
She was out letterboxing on the N.I.U. campus and ended up spending<br/>
something like 5 hours there, waiting for the scene to be free enough so<br/>
that she could replace the box. She was just on the verge of having to take<br/>
the box home when the place cleared out sufficiently.<br/>
<br/>
For that reason, the safety of the box, we don't like to stamp in anywhere<br/>
in the actual vicinity of the box. We tend to go far away. And sometimes,<br/>
when we've returned, conditions have unfortunately changed for the worse.<br/>
And it's always possible that someone else came along looking for the box,<br/>
didn't find it, and naturally didn't see us because we weren't right there<br/>
stamping in.........we were far away stamping in...........and might have<br/>
left, assuming the box is missing. I've been thinking of making up a little<br/>
business card that says something like "If you're looking for a particular<br/>
treasure, it hasn't gone missing, it's just being stamped into at the<br/>
moment. It shall return soon." The only trouble is, if someone waits<br/>
around for us to return, and we don't know they're boxers, we're not just<br/>
going to walk up with the box in hand, we're going to hide in the woods<br/>
until we see the coast is clear.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it's happened 5 times, but once was to my own box. I went to<br/>
check on the box, which was at the very tip of Boy Scout Island in Geneva,<br/>
IL, took it back to my car early in the morning to quietly see if any<br/>
maintenance was necessary, and lo and behold, when I went to replace the<br/>
box, it seemed like all the fishermen in the world had come out of the<br/>
woodwork to congregate at the tip of that island. I hadn't thought of the<br/>
fact that people who fish often start their fishing very early in the<br/>
morning. So that box got replaced but unfortunately rather rudely. Because<br/>
the fishermen just never showed any signs of leaving.<br/>
<br/>
So finally, my Caveman was tired of waiting, decided to become a klutz for<br/>
the day, "tripped" over a tree stump near the shoreline, and fell into the<br/>
Fox River. Created quite a splash. Continued to flounder around out there<br/>
and made a ton of noise and splash while I snuck over and replaced the box<br/>
since he now had the attention of everyone on shore except me. The only<br/>
downside was that he then had a large bunch of fishermen more than a little<br/>
angry with him and he was soaking wet to boot and it was a 45 minute drive<br/>
home to dry clothes. But, yipee, I got the box replaced. And I let him<br/>
stop at Starbucks in Geneva so that was one very small thing that made his<br/>
day a wee bit better. :-)<br/>

The idea of mystery letterboxers who are simply 'out there' and may not be<br/>
playing by 'the rules' is a scary thing. Ex. You go looking for a<br/>
letterbox, but forgot your stamp at home. So, simply take the box home with<br/>
you to stamp in and then bring it back the next time you get around to it.<br/>
YIKES!<br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
I think frankly the reason I got out of the habit of contacting placers<br/>
after a find had to do with plain ol' discouragement.  I'd say that in the<br/>
past, quite literally 95% of the boxers who found my boxes didn't contact me<br/>
after finding them.  And among those 95% were all too often the same boxers<br/>
who I *had* contacted after finding *their* boxes.  So it became<br/>
discouraging and I gave it up.  It seemed like they didn't think it too much<br/>
trouble for others to contact them but that they were just too busy boxing<br/>
to bother doing it themselves.  Some boxers even emailed me after I'd<br/>
contact them, telling me how happy and pleased they were to receive my email<br/>
and our story of finding their box and to keep those stories comin'.  Yet<br/>
they couldn't be bothered to return the favor?<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not at all saying you were one of them Wisconsin Hiker, because I<br/>
really don't remember if you were or not.  But I do remember that several<br/>
"prominent" boxers in this area never returned the favor.  And I felt hurt<br/>
and discouraged by that.  So I simply stopped for the most part and now I<br/>
just go online and record it as a "find" so that the placer at least knows<br/>
that it's still there.  I do always carry supplies with me so if a box needs<br/>
maintenance, I go ahead and do it.  But I rarely take the time to contact<br/>
the placer and write anything of our experience.<br/>
<br/>
And, like I said, I *don't* mean to cast aspersion on Wisconsin Hiker<br/>
because I don't remember at this point who the boxers were.  I remember<br/>
seeing several prominent names who had posted in the past about wanting to<br/>
receive feedback and finders' stories, yet never *once* contacted me after<br/>
finding a box of mine.  So I truly felt, why am I bothering?<br/>
<br/>
We even had a nasty note once left in one of my sister's boxes by a boxer<br/>
who was prominent in boxing in the past and who had posted here about the<br/>
fact that finders shouldn't say anything at all in a logbook if they<br/>
couldn't say something nice.  And then they leave a nasty note themselves in<br/>
a logbook???<br/>
<br/>
With the housing market the way it is, it doesn't look like we'll be putting<br/>
our house on the market again &amp; moving to Tennessee anytime soon so I might<br/>
place boxes out there again and see.  I've missed having boxes out there but<br/>
we've been soooo unsure of when we might be too busy with moving.  I can't<br/>
wait to retire and get outta Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don't mean to point this Wisconsin Hiker's way at all, but merely<br/>
to use WH's post as a jump point....................I think all boxers on<br/>
the list need to take stock of themselves and figure out if they're<br/>
following that good ol' Golden Rule of do unto others.<br/>
