<br/>
My partner and I are rather new to the letterboxing community, and I apologize ahead of time for not having yet introduced ourselves! Still, we'd absolutely love the chance to meet up with some of the long-time letterboxers of the Milwaukee area whose lovely stamps we find in nearly ever single box. ;) Lighthouse Keeper is scheduled to work until 8, but she is trying to get off a bit early so she can make it on time. The two of us intend to be there, however, and look forward to meeting you all, including enjoying "The Sprite's" comedy show!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to organize this! <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
One Love Journeying and Lighthouse Keeper<br/>
