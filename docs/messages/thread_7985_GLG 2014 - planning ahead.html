Would there be any interest in this one?  If so, I can add it as event box on AQ.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>If our plans work out, we plan to head back to Minneapolis Friday morning to do some shopping and box back to North Branch.  I have never stepped foot into Minnesota, so guess where we will shop??  Nope, not Mall of America.  Bauer Brothers Salvage is where I want to go.  I love the Rehab Addict.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Finally, are there any plans for a meet-n-greet Friday evening in the area?  If not, DH is interested in finding a decent place for dinner.  Taking suggestions.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p>We are so ready for a break!</p><p><br/></p><p>See you all there,</p><p>speedsquare</p></body></html>
