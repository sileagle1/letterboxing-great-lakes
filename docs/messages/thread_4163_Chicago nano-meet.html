Well, believe it or not, it happened to us yesterday afternoon! :)<br/>
<br/>
Atom and I stopped by to get some coffee refreshment at the Starbucks on <br/>
the corner of State and Wabash, and who should we spot just hanging out <br/>
with someone else at an outside table?  None other than Azobox! (so much <br/>
for your motto "blend in" ;) )  Atom pointed him out first, and both of <br/>
us had to look twice, but sure enough -- it was him!  We walked over to <br/>
a very surprised Azobox, who then proceeded to introduce us to his <br/>
brother as "Coffee Beans" and "Atom 118."  His brother just sorta nodded <br/>
and went, "Huh, more letterboxers" or something like that.  Anyway, it <br/>
was great fun. :)  And maybe we'll make it 3 weeks in a row seeing each <br/>
other, as Atom and I will be in Portage/Kzoo next weekend to visit my <br/>
parents for father's day. ;)  Where should we meet this time -- the <br/>
Meijer on Westnedge at 2pm on Sunday? ;) j/k<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had an experience at all similar to that?  I'm even <br/>
curious how many times people have run into fellow boxers on the trail <br/>
in a non-gathering setting?  It's happened to us 5 times in the past <br/>
year and a half.<br/>

Well, you two beat me to the list (of course *I* was the one out of my<br/>
normal surroundings and without a computer.)<br/>
I was going to post the event as the Lake/Michigan Micro Meet -- since<br/>
we were mighty close to the corner of Lake and Michigan.<br/>
And as CoffeBeans pointed out, we *were* having a refreshment at<br/>
Starbuck's.<br/>
<br/>
I am still laughing at the wonderful and totally unbelievable chance<br/>
of that happening.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, now about next weekend.....<br/>
<br/>
blend in!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, back from Canada for our 1st anniversary vacation,<br/>
eh.  :)  A few years ago in Ohio, there was an<br/>
unofficial mini-meet to say good-bye to The Gamecock,<br/>
who was moving to another state.  That's where we<br/>
first met The Cats Meow.  We also got to meet Blaze,<br/>
who planted the Squire's Castle letterbox (and Katy,<br/>
I'm sure if you sent her an email she'd be able to let<br/>
you know as far as she knows what the box's status<br/>
is).  Meeting Blaze was significant for us because her<br/>
Squire's Castle box was our very first attempted find.<br/>
<br/>
So, a few weeks later, we were doing this Rails n'<br/>
Trails bike tour in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park<br/>
where our bikes were loaded on the train and we rode<br/>
the train to Pennisula, then biked back to where we<br/>
originally boarded the train.  As Deedle &amp; I were<br/>
waiting to board the train, I tugged on his shirt<br/>
sleeve, pointed, and whispered, "Hey, isn't that<br/>
Blaze?"  Sure enough, she was not just an avid<br/>
letterboxer but also an avid cyclist doing the same<br/>
bike tour we were!<br/>

&gt; that?  I'm even <br/>
&gt; curious how many times people have run into fellow<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What are the odds of running into a fellow<br/>
&gt; letterboxer... in a <br/>
&gt; completely random, non-boxing setting... in a city<br/>
&gt; of about 3 million? <br/>
&gt; Well, believe it or not, it happened to us yesterday<br/>
&gt; afternoon! :)<br/>
