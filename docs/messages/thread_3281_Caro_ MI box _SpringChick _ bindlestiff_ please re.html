I still can't get over the what has to be about a billion to one odds <br>
that we planted these boxes in almost the exact same spot.  How can <br>
that be?  All of Tuscola County and two boxes get planted in the <br>
practically the exact same spot on the same day?<br>
<br>
My box was supposed to be a mystery box, but if anyone with 1/2 a <br>
brain looks at the clues to both Tuscola County boxes, it's pretty <br>
obvious they're in the same place.  So, I am definitely going to <br>
relocate it.   I was thinking of moving it somewhere else in Caro, <br>
but if I'm going to drive all the way back up there, I may as well go <br>
a little farther and get another County covered.  I've decided I'm <br>
going to move it to Gladwin this weekend.<br>
<br>
If anyone wants to find my box before it moves, you better go before <br>
this weekend!  LOL<br>
<br>
SpringChick, when you get to updating your webpage map, will you <br>
please list TrailTroll's Caro "Tuscola County Courthouse" box as the <br>
first box?  She was actually there 2 hours before me and mine won't <br>
be active long anyway!<br>
<br>
Bindlestiff, will you please remove 2 of my points in your contest <br>
and please add two for TrailTroll's box being first in Tuscola?  (Or <br>
leave mine in there and see if I manage to be first to Gladwin next weekend!)<br>
<br>
Thanks!  Sorry to be a PITA!<br>
