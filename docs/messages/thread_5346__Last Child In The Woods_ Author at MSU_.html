<br>
Some of you might be interested in this little tidbit:<br>
<br>
Richard Louv, Author of Last Child in the Woods:  Saving our Children<br>
from Nature Deficit Disorder, will be speaking at MSU on October 22nd<br>
at 7:30 in the MSU Concert Auditorium on Farm Lane.  Admission is<br>
free with ticket (available at the Wharton Center box office, -<br>
lpanich@naturecenter.org or 269-381-1574 ext 38).<br>
<br>
Richard Louv has launched a growing movement to reconnect children<br>
with nature.  Unstructured play outdoors has a positive impact on<br>
healthy child development, creativity and cognitive functioning while<br>
improving health risks such as ADHD, child obesity, and stress.  He<br>
will discuss new scientific evidence and offer practical suggestions<br>
for parents, teachers, and anyone concerned with the future of our<br>
children and the environment.<br>
<br>
This ties in with Michigan's "No Child Left Inside" movement and is<br>
sponsored by the Kalamazoo Nature Center and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.<br>
