prefer no backing.  Even the foam backing can negatively influence the image<br/>
quality.  I often find myself having to push on the paper to get a good<br/>
image if the stamp is backed.  Besides, if I really think the stamp is too<br/>
flimsy, I can always use my stamp tin or the box itself to help with the<br/>
pressing.<br/>

As Wisconsin Hiker, I too prefer unbacked stamps as they take less<br/>

If any water gets inside a letterbox, that will damage the logbook, but an unmounted rubber stamp can be dried off and used again.  So I don't tend to mount my stamps.  Some types of wood and foam could absorb water and cause the stamp to get moldy.  yucko!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boxes will crack if they are frozen to the ground and pulled out of their locations.  Or, if a frozen box is accidentally dropped it will crack.  A good reason to bring camo duct tape along for box repairs.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What would make a stamp crack?  I'm not sure the answer is the weather.   There are some very old boxes out there and the stamps are fine.  But I did have one stamp crack...it was an indoor box.  So, sadly, a cracked stamp might simply be an accident that occures when someone bends the rubber, plays with it, and then....crack!  <br/>

One of the good reasons to be part of this yahoo group is that we all learn from the experience of others.  <br/>

<br/>
Here's hoping that all the boxes survived this winter with the unusual amount of ice and snow.  <br/>

I have not had a problem with unbacked stamps cracking either in the<br/>
extremes of cold and hot in Michigan. When I do back with wood, I<br/>
prefer to use hardwood blocks (i.e. oak) which I have had issues with<br/>
only when they were completely submerged in water for long periods of<br/>
time. Plywood does tend to suck in water and therefore the potential<br/>
for mold.<br/>
<br/>
As Wisconsin Hiker, I too prefer unbacked stamps as they take less<br/>
room in the box and I find it easier to get a good stamp impression.<br/>

stamps<br/>

&gt; In Minne-snow-ta planted stamps with a plywood backing will eventually<br/>
&gt; be covered with mold or will warp. If stamps are not backed at all,<br/>
&gt; they crack and break after a freeze-thaw-freeze-boil cycle or two.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I prefer stamps that are backed with 1/4 inch foam. The foam keeps the<br/>
&gt; stamp from breaking. Mold doesn't seem to find anything to eat. The<br/>
&gt; added thickness of the foam gives your hands something to grab and the<br/>
&gt; stamp is still flexible enough to stamp a nice image. And best of all;<br/>
&gt; the foam-backed stamps survive the local temperature extremes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For adhering, I use Krazy Glue with a brush applicator.<br/>
