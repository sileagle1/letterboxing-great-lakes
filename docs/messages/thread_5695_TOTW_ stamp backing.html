prefer no backing.  Even the foam backing can negatively influence the image<br>

If any water gets inside a letterbox, that will damage the logbook, but an unmounted rubber stamp can be dried off and used again.  So I don't tend to mount my stamps.  Some types of wood and foam could absorb water and cause the stamp to get moldy.  yucko!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Boxes will crack if they are frozen to the ground and pulled out of their locations.  Or, if a frozen box is accidentally dropped it will crack.  A good reason to bring camo duct tape along for box repairs.   <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
What would make a stamp crack?  I'm not sure the answer is the weather.   There are some very old boxes out there and the stamps are fine.  But I did have one stamp crack...it was an indoor box.  So, sadly, a cracked stamp might simply be an accident that occures when someone bends the rubber, plays with it, and then....crack!  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
One of the good reasons to be part of this yahoo group is that we all learn from the experience of others.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Here's hoping that all the boxes survived this winter with the unusual amount of ice and snow.  <br>

I have not had a problem with unbacked stamps cracking either in the<br>
extremes of cold and hot in Michigan. When I do back with wood, I<br>
prefer to use hardwood blocks (i.e. oak) which I have had issues with<br>
only when they were completely submerged in water for long periods of<br>
