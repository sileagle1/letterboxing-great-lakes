"Gods, Historic Idols and Mountains"<br>
<br>
Feel:<br>
The first thing I should say is that even the Kings and Queens: the<br>
Royal Historic contributors to Letterboxing feel. They laugh, cry, and<br>
worry. We as people are never truly free from our Social Constraints<br>
and the desire for loving acceptance.<br>
<br>
We want our Letterboxes to please, we long for acceptance, our tender<br>
feelings are sometimes woven into our boxes, our LB Persona and that<br>
can be damaged by others who are not careful and considerate. (Does<br>
This Make Sense To You Readers)?<br>
<br>
Just because we are, they are Letterboxers does not exclude us/them<br>
from pain. In that sense the PNW was no different than Spring Lake,<br>
Michigan. (Did I think it would be different)???<br>
<br>
Yes, I thought being the crux of Legends, I would find, cutting edge<br>
boxes, places with reckless, loving, artistic abandon. I thought I<br>
would find my heroes infallible to the words and critiques of others.<br>
Or that, no harsh words would/could ever find there way into such a<br>
fine group. This was SO not the case. I am not writing this as a<br>
critic myself, I truly loved what I found, I just thought it was<br>
noteworthy that YES, we all feel even our Gods. So lets be nice to<br>
them, wrap them, swaddle them and nurture there lives. Tell them that<br>
they are appreciated, hold our tongues when we feel the need to<br>
control, play nice and praise hard work, though it may differ from<br>
ours. Let's live with the knowledge that all who walk this Earth feel<br>
pain, and it is our duty as humans to recognize this and try to<br>
alleviate others fears and melancholy.<br>
<br>
See:<br>
My main pursuits were to infiltrate Der Mad Stampers life,<br>
vampiracally suck the Genius out of his soul and become a God myself.<br>
Well, he is So worth Vamping, but I left him intact and I can say that<br>
I felt I have found a true friend. He is a fantastical person and<br>
should be given the posh life of Royalty that he deserves! I hope that<br>
we serve him well and carry on his legacy for all of time.<br>
<br>
I met the Goddess Pandora and her loving Iron Bear, to me there is no<br>
woman finer than she who planted the most amazing boxes I found! True<br>
tender love resides in Pandora and we must praise her for so<br>
fearlessly making her boxes windows to her soul. Thank you Pandora,<br>
for having the whimsical notion that a person who plants there soul in<br>
a box will not get crushed by fearful finders. I am afraid boxes of<br>
this nature may not last very long. As they are wrought with such fine<br>
feeling, such pure love that others may easily have access to the<br>
maker's heart. It is dangerous and commendable and I am honored to<br>
have found some.<br>
<br>
Maiden:<br>
Of all the Letterboxers in the area who were asked to meet me at the<br>
Lucky Lab Brew Pub, only Maiden, Tainted Knight, and Der Mad Stamper<br>
braved the meeting of me. Maiden, who plants like there is NO tomorrow<br>
was in a nutshell totally funny and nice! She is been SO horribly<br>
bitten by the LB bug that she has graced us with a seemingly endless<br>
amount of drive by's! As a traveler I found this quite pleasing, to<br>
say the least! Thank you fine Maiden! May you never tire!<br>
<br>
Home?<br>
In the end I missed my Michigan Trails, Spring Chicks boxes and the<br>
sculpting and planting of my own. I did not plant while I was there,<br>
though I did carve there and plan on shipping my creation back to be<br>
planted in a designated place.<br>
<br>
What else can I say when those are the only words in my head? Nothing,<br>
but thank you everyone who made me feel at home and took time out of<br>
their busy lives to entertain Lil' Ol' Me!<br>
<br>
I was entertained! It was a fantastic adventure for me and many<br>
lessons were learned or reinforced.<br>
<br>
The End.<br>
