I had to chuckle when I checked out that fairy house website!  It took me<br>
back to a forgotten memory when I was a child and my friend and I used to<br>
build "ant houses" in the sandbox at the school.  They were very similar to<br>
your fairy houses with stones and sticks and such.  As I relived the memory<br>
I thought about one time when we made a garden for the ants.it had about a<br>
hundred pieces of grass seed heads for the cornpatch!  Thanks for the<br>
memory!  Terrio-who is feeling a tad nostalgic.   <br>

As a child, I spent many hours playing in the sandbox too.  Now, I call it my miniature Zen rock garden...just more sand to rake and play in.  <br>
<br>
I checked out those websites too.  There's all sorts of information out there about Fairy Houses and Doors!  When a friend shared her Fairy House book with me, I didn't realize that was the tip of the iceberg.  Some fairy houses are almost invisible and blend in with nature because they are skillfully arranged, found objects in nature.  You have to use your imagination to visualize a large shell as a swimming pool or a tub for the fairies.  On the other hand, there are companies that manufacture miniature fairy houses and doors and sell other hand made items.  <br>
<br>
I am considering placing a letterbox near a fairy house, or at least using the fairy house as a landmark.  Might be a very special letterbox if you have to follow the trail of the fairies.  <br>
