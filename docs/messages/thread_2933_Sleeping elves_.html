couple of delivery delays.  Please check the list.  If you see something other than "Y" in the <br>
gift received column, and you have indeed received your present, please post a message <br>
acknowledging your gift.  Have Santa's elves been gallavanting about the Faire when chores <br>
have been left undone?<br>
<br>
Elves that have not mailed your gifts ... please send me an email offlist so that I can reassure <br>
the recipients that Schwarze Peter has not made off with them. <br>
