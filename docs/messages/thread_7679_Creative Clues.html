We were in AZ last month and met some newer boxers at an event (a group<br>
of 5 "kids" in their 20s).  They had planted one box last year on a<br>
longer hike and we encouraged them to plant more so we could find them<br>
next year when we are hopefully down in AZ again.<br>
<br>
Well, they have been busy planting since then and have developed some<br>
creative clues for their new boxes.   I therefore felt inspired to get a<br>
bit more creative for the two boxes I had planted during our recent<br>
trip.  If you're planning a visit to AZ, perhaps you can give them a<br>
try!  Here are links to our new AZ boxes, one near Phoenix and one in<br>
Tucson:<br>

ago.)<br>
<br>
It would be great if all of the stamps that appeared at the recent Great<br>
Lakes winter events would get planted on some nice hikes and perhaps you<br>
also might enjoy coming up with creative clues.  (Like several other<br>
boxers in our region, we really like to get out on the trail for a fun<br>
hunt!)<br>

Wow!  Makes us want to save our penny's for airfare/lodging...join a bootcamp to get in shape so we can find that lost Hombre and then check on our box and find the Maiden Pool stamp...so inspiring...you Luna Maiden, you!<br>
BTW...We sure wish that EVERY letterbox had Martini Man standing on the trail pointing to the box...<br>
