                    <div class="plaintext-content">Had a little spare time this morning for a few hikes so gassed up the truck<br>
and set out.<br>
<br>
1.  Shake! Shake! Shake! in Orland Park, placed by Howling Coyote.  Super<br>
simple, yet elegant, creative, and *very* cute stamp.  The view of the lake<br>
was nice, but the stamp was worth going for even if Howling Coyote had<br>
hidden it at a garbage dump.  At least in my opinion.  Box was in good<br>
shape.<br>
<br>
2.  The Turtle by the Lake in Palos Heights, placed by Big Cat.  Box was<br>
placed recently and was in good shape but I didn't figure it would be for<br>
long since neither logbook nor stamp were bagged whatsoever.  And there was<br>
a large brush type marking pen in the box.  I figured the first good summer<br>
rain that comes along..............<br>
<br>
Assuming we get any good rains this summer.  Assuming we get any rain at<br>
*all* this summer.<br>
<br>
So I left everything bagged.  I'm figuring maybe Big Cat is a brand new<br>
placer?<br>
<br>
3.  Lake Katherine and the Waterfall, also in Palos Heights, also placed by<br>
Big Cat.  This one I just could not find.  Clues seemed very<br>
straightforward, everything seemed to fit, but at the very end, I just<br>
didn't seem to have come up with the right place.  No yellow marked boulder<br>
could I see.<br>
<br>
But I couldn't spend long on it since it was the last box of the morning,<br>
and I had already spent so much time investigating the Lake Katherine Nature<br>
Area and laughing at everything.  In one sense it's a beautiful place.  An<br>
awfully lot of work has gone into it.  In another sense, I've never felt so<br>
manipulated or that anything in nature was so contrived in my life.  And The<br>
Rules!  My word, The Rules!  I haven't seen so many rules since I was a<br>
teenager and started dating.  I took a photo of "The Rules Board" because it<br>
blew me away.  And continually, on the hike, there were signs saying "Don't<br>
you dare do this!" and "Don't you dare do that!"  I felt like nuns were<br>
waiting with rulers around each bend in the trail.<br>
<br>
I was rotflmao tho when I went down a particular trail the clues say to take<br>
and lo and behold there was a large downed tree blocking the trail.  The<br>
Doer of the Evil Deed?  A beaver!  It looked like it had been chewed down<br>
very recently.  The nerve of some beavers!  Because I'm sure there's a rule<br>
against chewing down a tree in that particular woods.  If there isn't,<br>
there's soon going to be. :-)<br>
<br>
A nice, cool, fun morning.<br>
