&gt;I was just looking at the Bingo Word List see that "bushwacking" was <br/>
&gt;aclled on 3/3 and is listed as an "O" word. I have it on me card as <br/>
&gt;an "N" word. Which is correct?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Besided the cover all game what other games are we still playing for?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have it listed as a word from the N column.<br/>
<br/>
Other than the full card, the active games are the postage stamp, <br/>
perimeter and X.<br/>
<br/>
I'm doing pretty good on the perimeter and now have an "anti" postage <br/>
stamp!  Meaning the two squares to the left and two beneath are <br/>
filled in, but none of the 4 squares needed for the postage stamp <br/>
have been called.  Can we make that a game? LOL<br/>
