<br>
I used this information yesterday that I found on the LBNA list.  It <br>
worked - the key is clicking the word Cached - I use google search <br>
engine.  I was looking for a box in Southeast MI and when I clicked <br>
the cached link, I got the name of the box I was looking for.  Then I <br>
searched using that name and the words "letterboxing".  It came up <br>
right away.<br>

Thank you to Larry for the info:<br>
<br>
"Boxers,<br>
<br>
Here is what I do for just such an unfortunate event. In Internet <br>
Explorer  you can add each of your favorite regions (I wouldn't <br>
suggest too many) as a  favorite place. When the pop up window comes <br>
up, you can check the box that  says  "Make available offline". Then <br>
you'll be able to check the "Customize"  button".  On the next pop up <br>
window, you can tell it how many pages deep you want  the favorite <br>
place to save. I suggest keeping it at one, although that  won't<br>
get you every clue.<br>
<br>
Now, you have the clues available to you (as of the point in time <br>
when you  did this) for viewing when the site isn't available. You <br>
can synchronize the  offline pages periodically under the Tools menu. <br>
This doesn't work for search  results, but it will work when you view <br>
a specific region. It also will not  work  with Atlasquest clues.<br>
<br>
If you really want to be prepared, you can do this on your laptop and <br>
bring  your laptop with you just in case you find yourself in an area <br>
and want to do  a  box for which you didn't prepare by printing out <br>
the clues in advance.<br>

Thanks for the tip!!!  I was able to track down all but two of the <br>
clues I was looking for.  I don't know if it was significant or not, <br>
but they both had an apostrophe in the title?  I couldn't get the <br>
box's actual name to come up as the link--all I could get was the <br>
Florida page for letterboxing.org and of course couldn't link to the <br>
clue page.<br>
<br>
One of the boxes on our "to find" list is your box:  "You might see <br>
an Eagle".<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the idea.<br>
