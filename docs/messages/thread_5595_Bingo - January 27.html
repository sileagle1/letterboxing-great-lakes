LADYSLIPPER?  No, that's not the right flower!  I'm feeling quite weak this morning.  Like <br>
"Tinkerbell,"  I think I need you to clap.  I feel "The Reaper" at my doorstep ready to put me <br>
"Six Feet Under."  I can barely pull the TV Bingo word out of the hat....Oh, great!...the word is <br>
... "Pushing DAISIES!"  <br>

I started out strong with 4--but it has been over 2 weeks since I got a <br>
hit.  Maybe Tiptoe is rubbing off on us.   :~)<br>

<br>
<br>
It's clear that "America's Most Wanted" desire is that Tiptoe can <br>
shout out " "I Spy" that BINGO word on my card".  This long streak of <br>
uncalled words is almost "Supernatural" and frankly, it is giving <br>
me "Goosebumps".  Tiptoe just wants to be "The Contender" and at <br>
least catch up to Fo6  :~)    Is that too much to ask?<br>
<br>
Based on yesterday's note, it sounds like Tonto has a <br>
real "Emergency!" on his hands (not the least of which is that we are <br>
going to run out of TV shows if this doesn't end soon!).  Their kids <br>
are "Young and Restless" in the face of this crisis and Tiptoe is in <br>
need of a "Guiding Light".  I'm confident that Tonto can deal with <br>
this, even when the "CHiPs" are down; after all, he is a "Family <br>
Guy".  <br>
<br>
It is truly an "Unsolved Mystery" about why Tiptoe's words seem to <br>
be "Lost in Space".  Stay tuned tomorrow for another exciting episode <br>
of "The Empty Bingo Card Queen"!<br>
