&gt; (Although I'm sure that <br/>
&gt; you weren't quite as amused by the whole snake<br/>
&gt; incident!) <br/>
<br/>
Actually, I WAS amused by the whole snake thing,<br/>
because it fits nicely in the long line of completely<br/>
ridiculous things that happen to me fairly regularly. <br/>
For instance, poison ivy....never had it in my life <br/>
until after the gathering when I got it from putting<br/>
my pants into the washer 3 DAYS LATER! So...you<br/>
guessed it...poison ivy on both arms. I guess there's<br/>
a lesson here....be careful with your trail<br/>
clothing...as it's just as infectious as coming into<br/>
direct contact with it. That Tecnu stuff is friggin<br/>
sweet....totally helps out with the itchy oozy mess<br/>
that happens when someone with already supersensitive<br/>
skin gets poison ivy.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of supersensitive skin, does anyone recommend<br/>
an alternative/organic/non (burn your skin off)<br/>
chemical based insect repellant? I've been hesistant<br/>
about longer hikes because I don't want to use the<br/>
stuff I got last year, as my skin has been freaking<br/>
out over minor contact with ANYTHING lately. Any<br/>
recommendations would be helpful, as i've been taking<br/>
WAY too much Benedryl lately.....<br/>

have heard mixed results about using it is as a bug repellent, but it <br/>
certainly would be gentle on your skin!<br/>
