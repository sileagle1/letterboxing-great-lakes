<br>
Actually, I WAS amused by the whole snake thing,<br>
because it fits nicely in the long line of completely<br>
ridiculous things that happen to me fairly regularly. <br>
For instance, poison ivy....never had it in my life <br>
until after the gathering when I got it from putting<br>
my pants into the washer 3 DAYS LATER! So...you<br>
guessed it...poison ivy on both arms. I guess there's<br>
a lesson here....be careful with your trail<br>
clothing...as it's just as infectious as coming into<br>
direct contact with it. That Tecnu stuff is friggin<br>
sweet....totally helps out with the itchy oozy mess<br>
that happens when someone with already supersensitive<br>
skin gets poison ivy.<br>
<br>
Speaking of supersensitive skin, does anyone recommend<br>
an alternative/organic/non (burn your skin off)<br>
chemical based insect repellant? I've been hesistant<br>
about longer hikes because I don't want to use the<br>
stuff I got last year, as my skin has been freaking<br>
out over minor contact with ANYTHING lately. Any<br>
recommendations would be helpful, as i've been taking<br>
WAY too much Benedryl lately.....<br>

have heard mixed results about using it is as a bug repellent, but it <br>
certainly would be gentle on your skin!<br>
