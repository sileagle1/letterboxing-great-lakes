No insult intended!  I have every respect for you guys (and sympathy for<br/>
those who will be teaching Papillon, the Missing Amigo, and their cronies<br/>
this coming fall as they begin their freshman year this fall) and do realize<br/>
the school year does not end with the school year!  I was just having a bad<br/>
day yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Live long and proper to you all!<br/>

PS:  Dragon, can you send or post your address BTW so I can send you a check<br/>
for my tshirt?  And SpringChick...what about the $ for carving material from<br/>
the gathering?<br/>

Subject: survey results<br/>
As a HS math teacher that teaches mostly future techies, I could be<br/>
considered a techie too since I do a lot of techie stuff, AND I love<br/>
Star Trek! Oops! That's Trekkie, sorry :-)<br/>
And before I hear any more "teachers have the summer off" comments<br/>
(grrr), I actually planned to take all of July off before my school<br/>
tacked on more responsibilities for me to do during the summer.<br/>
Apparently checking in ALL of the textbooks, assessing fines, taking<br/>
two AP Calculus workshops/classes, reviewing and deciding on two new<br/>
textbooks, planning 5 courses (2 new), redesigning 5 school web<br/>
pages, and getting ready for cross country season isn't enough to do<br/>
during the summer! (Sorry for the rant.)<br/>
Trust me, I can't wait to "get away" from it all! Ah... peaceful<br/>
Ohio beckons me with its 400-some boxes.............<br/>
