What kind of dogs does everyone have? I love dogs,<br/>

and Kimono Girl (M10, I think).   I was at the Gathering in 2005, and I<br/>
don't think more than 2 of us were even at the same campground for that<br/>
event, so I really like that we'll be walking distance of one another<br/>
this summer.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs:  Claire is a whippet mix and Yuki is officially still a Jack<br/>
Russell mix just because no one at the vet's office has bothered to<br/>
change it;  he's almost 60 lbs and I'm pretty sure there's some hound,<br/>
maybe some pointer, and probably 12 other breeds in there but no Jack Russell.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking it might be fun to make a little camp sign with trail name <br/>
and a blow-up of my stamp image to mark my camp.  Of course, thinking of<br/>
it and actually doing it are two very different things...<br/>
<br/>
I'm with you Gooble gobble, June is far away.  It's almost as bad as<br/>
waiting for Christmas.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">"The Circle" - now it almost makes it sound like an elitist club!  <br/>
And we'll have all those dogs to block the entry way to the inner <br/>
circle, he he he.  I think I'm getting slap happy.  Don't worry, we <br/>
still love all of you who aren't part of the inner circle.  Getting <br/>
serious for a moment, part of the reason I suggested that section of <br/>
the campground wasn't just for the cool circle, but because we could <br/>
take over all of Road M and spill into Road J with reservations if <br/>
need be.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you want to see who's booked what campsite so far, visit <br/>
the GLG 2007 Camping database in the groups yahoo page.  And add <br/>
yourself if you booked a site already.  And, since I'm getting slap <br/>
happy and bored at work, I took the suggestions about how cool it <br/>
would be for everyone to have a sign to denote the boxers and created <br/>
one (feel free to use it or not), which is in the files section, the <br/>
gatherings folder, 2007 gathering, GLG 2007 Sign.  This way we can <br/>
find those of you who aren't part of the inner circle ;)<br/>
<br/>
Oh boy...I need to go home.  Has someone started the official "X <br/>
number of days until the gathering" countdown yet? ;)<br/>
