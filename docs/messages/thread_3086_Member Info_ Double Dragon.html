We have been boxing for over 2 years. We live in SE MI. near lake St. <br/>
Clair. We have no kids, but do have a wonderful cat that we consider  <br/>
our daughter. The fist letterboxes we did were The Rabbits. Soon we <br/>
were hooked (or at least I was). We only have a couple of boxes <br/>
placed, and are just now working on carving our own trail stamp. One <br/>
of the most interesting places we boxed was Hawaii on our honeymoon. <br/>
We never have been to a gathering but decided "what the heck we'll <br/>
give it a try". So we planed the SE MI fantasy gathering. I'm glad we <br/>
did, it was lots of fun and I got to meet some more obsessed LBers! <br/>
I'm looking forward to meeting more!<br/>
