I just saw this article on the Fox News website and thought I'd share.  The smoothies and milkshakes are fantastic, and the variety of fruit you can have in them and buy at the stand is second to none - even Dragonfruit! (I had a strawberry key lime milkshake - yum!)<br/>

There are not many boxes around Miami (I think the officials confiscate them <br/>
like my Hwy 41 box - gone the same day planted...), but if you are in the area, <br/>
be sure not to miss the "Robert is Here" letterbox.  I talked my traveling <br/>
companions into making a side trip to get this box and it ended up being one of <br/>
our favorite stops of the entire vacation.<br/>
