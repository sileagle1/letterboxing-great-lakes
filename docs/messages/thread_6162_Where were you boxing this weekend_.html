I'm happy to report that Martini Man's big project at the office is winding down and we were able to get out both days this weekend.  The decent weather was a definite plus.  Yesterday we stayed in town and did a 6-box series along the Lake Michigan lakefront (busy trail!) and another box along the lakefront in a nice secluded spot.  On our way home we stopped for another box and scouted out an area that looks promising for some of our future plants.<br>
<br>
This morning we headed out to Devil's Lake State Park.  I have 3 boxes there that we planted in 2005.  When we checked on one of them last November we were surprised to see that the logbook was getting quite full.  I therefore made new logbooks for all 3 boxes, but somehow we never made it back out there until today.  An interesting thing about these boxes - for each box I've had 16-20 people contact me to let me know they found or attempted the box (via logging it and/or sending me an email message).  However when we looked through each logbook and counted the individuals/teams that had actually stamped in, the counts were 55, 63, and 88 visitors!  I think these have been my most visited boxes.  One logbook had only 1 blank page left, 1 was full and the last finders had left a piece of paper that they stamped on, and the other had a few pages left.  I decided to leave all the original logbooks in the boxes when I added the very timely "Logbook #2", since there was enough room.  Amazingly each box was in near perfect condition, even though they are over 4 years old.  I wish all our boxes would do so well!  It was fun to see several of our letterboxing friends logged into the boxes, including some that made the trek up from IL (Waltzing Pigs and Lock, Shock & Barrel).  However it is always SO surprising to see all the stamps of people that are "mysteries", since they don't post on the boards, send messages or attend events.  One stamp was from someone who lives in the same suburb as us, but we have no idea who they are!<br>
<br>
We didn't do as well in terms of "finds" today.  Before we went to Devil's Lake we found a quick drive-by in Baraboo by the Pugnasties but then were only 3 finds out of 7 boxes attempted in the park.  We found both "Stranger in a Strange Land" boxes, but only 1 of the 4 planted by someone called Natureally.  Also couldn't find the Minnewauken box.  However these disappontments were balanced by the nice hike and the discovery that our plants were in good shape and had received SO many visitors.<br>
<br>
How about the rest of you?  Were you able to get out & about for some LBing?<br>

We only got a chance to go out today. And since we've been itching to get another box planted before snow falls, that's what we did. We headed to Millennium Park in Grand Rapids and planed one there. As far as I can tell, there are no other boxes in the park (yet). It took quite a while to find a spot in the park that Lulu & I could agree on, but we think it's a good one. By the time we were done, we were quite chilly and decided not to go hunting for any.<br>

One of the other regional boards periodically asks this question, but usually "Where ARE you boxing...?" before the weekend starts. However since it is now Sunday night, I changed it to Where WERE you...?<br>
<br>
I'm happy to report that Martini Man's big project at the office is winding down and we were able to get out both days this weekend. The decent weather was a definite plus. Yesterday we stayed in town and did a 6-box series along the Lake Michigan lakefront (busy trail!) and another box along the lakefront in a nice secluded spot. On our way home we stopped for another box and scouted out an area that looks promising for some of our future plants..<br>
<br>
This morning we headed out to Devil's Lake State Park. I have 3 boxes there that we planted in 2005. When we checked on one of them last November we were surprised to see that the logbook was getting quite full. I therefore made new logbooks for all 3 boxes, but somehow we never made it back out there until today. An interesting thing about these boxes - for each box I've had 16-20 people contact me to let me know they found or attempted the box (via logging it and/or sending me an email message). However when we looked through each logbook and counted the individuals/ teams that had actually stamped in, the counts were 55, 63, and 88 visitors! I think these have been my most visited boxes. One logbook had only 1 blank page left, 1 was full and the last finders had left a piece of paper that they stamped on, and the other had a few pages left. I decided to leave all the original logbooks in the boxes when I added the very timely "Logbook #2", since there<br>
 was enough room. Amazingly each box was in near perfect condition, even though they are over 4 years old. I wish all our boxes would do so well! It was fun to see several of our letterboxing friends logged into the boxes, including some that made the trek up from IL (Waltzing Pigs and Lock, Shock & Barrel). However it is always SO surprising to see all the stamps of people that are "mysteries", since they don't post on the boards, send messages or attend events. One stamp was from someone who lives in the same suburb as us, but we have no idea who they are!<br>

The Apt. Dwellers found a couple of new boxes in Walworth Co. on Sunday. One in Fairfield Wi and the other at Lake Lawn Lodge in Delavan.  It was a little chilly but still a beautiful day for letterboxing.  The boxes had been in place less than a month of were in great condition.  I appreciate more and more the Lock N Lock style of boxes to keep things dry and neat.<br>

An interesting thing about these boxes - for each box I've had 16-20 people contact me to let me know they found or attempted the box (via logging it and/or sending me an email message). However when we looked through each logbook and counted the individuals/ teams that had actually stamped in, the counts were 55, 63, and 88 visitors! I think these have been my most visited boxes. One logbook had only 1 blank page left, 1 was full and the last finders had left a piece of paper that they stamped on, and the other had a few pages left. I decided to leave all the original logbooks in the boxes when I added the very timely "Logbook #2", since<br>
 there was enough room. Amazingly each box was in near perfect condition, even though they are over 4 years old. I wish all our boxes would do so well! It was fun to see several of our letterboxing friends logged into the boxes, including some that made the trek up from IL (Waltzing Pigs and Lock, Shock & Barrel). However it is always SO surprising to see all the stamps of people that are "mysteries", since they don't post on the boards, send messages or attend events. One stamp was from someone who lives in the same suburb as us, but we have no idea who they are!<br>

Before we went to Devil's Lake we found a quick drive-by in Baraboo by the Pugnasties but then were only 3 finds out of 7 boxes attempted in the park. We found both "Stranger in a Strange Land" boxes, but only 1 of the 4 planted by someone called Natureally. Also couldn't find the Minnewauken box. However these disappontments were balanced by the nice hike and the discovery that our plants were in good shape and had received SO many visitors.<br>

While my injury several months ago has severely restricted my ability to walk any distance greater than 1/2 mile, I have been able to get out on the weekend and check on some of my boxes and do some maintenance before the snow hits us.  And I'm happy to report that my boxes are in good condition; only a few new logbooks were needed.   Slowly, I'm beginning to hide some new boxes.  This weekend, I'm planning a trip to Cedarburg, Wisconsin - where that old fashioned Christmas feeling still exists.  Friday and Saturday are Open House in Cedarburg.  HO HO HO!<br>

On Monday the 16th with my fiance...he is a letterboxing GOD. It amazes me how fast he can interpret the clues and find the box. I think it is an outdoors man thing.<br>

This weekend is opening gun-deer hunting season in Wisconsin...my fiance is an avid hunter and although I like to hunt other things, deer are not one of them. So, I am planning a trip with my daughter to Gurnee/Libertyville area. It looks to be a fun weekend.<br>

Trying to get as much LB'ing in before the snow flies. We own a snow plowing business and I won't have the time/or energy once it starts snowing.<br>

I am beginning to think I will need a 7-step program for letterboxing!<br>
