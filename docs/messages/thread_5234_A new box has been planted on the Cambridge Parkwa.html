Question:  Since you planted the box, does that make you "the mightiest member of your letterboxing party"?<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband held the dog's leash while I planted box #10 of<br/>
&gt; Dragon<http: the_lb_dragon="" www.geocities.com=""></http:>'s<br/>
&gt; Cambridge Parkway<br/>
&gt; Series<http: cambridge_parkway_letterbox_seri.htm="" cambridge_parkway_series="" the_lb_dragon="" www.geocities.com="">last<br/>
&gt; night!  This box takes us to the southern end of the Parkway, which<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; means that we have to start planting boxes heading back North again!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box #10 of the series is named "In Memoriam."  Directions:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * * * *<br/>
&gt; To find "In Memoriam" --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After finding "Walk On The Beach" box, continue south down the Parkway.<br/>
&gt; Eventually, on your left, across the street, you will see the SE WI Vietnam<br/>
&gt; Veterans Memorial:  11 granite posts for each year of the war, 5 granite<br/>
&gt; benches for each branch of the military, and three Wausau Red granite<br/>
&gt; columns together representing those killed in action (22 ft tall), those who<br/>
&gt; are missing in action or were prisoners of war (26 ft tall) and those who<br/>
&gt; returned home again (30 ft tall).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Cambridge Parkway ends where the path splits -- there is a signpost<br/>
&gt; there with two brown signs on it.  One tells you to go left, under a bridge;<br/>
&gt; and one tells you to go right, up a hill.  Trust not the sinister sign, and<br/>
&gt; proceed onward dexterously for 66 steps.  Stop, and take out your compass.<br/>
&gt; You'll know you're in the right spot when you can see the Vietnam Veterans<br/>
&gt; Memorial at 100 degrees, the post with two brown signs where the path splits<br/>
&gt; at 60 degrees, and, if you look behind you at 302 degrees, a dead tree with<br/>
&gt; holes in the front about 20 feet up the hill.  "In Memoriam" rests at the<br/>
&gt; base of this tree, under a twisted branch, hidden by bark and twigs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are lots of brush and thistles on this hill in the summer!  I<br/>
&gt; recommend sending the mightiest member of your letterboxing party up the<br/>
&gt; hill to obtain the box, and then stamping in on one of the grassy areas<br/>
&gt; nearby.  Use discretion when retrieving it, as this is a busy area; and<br/>
&gt; replace it well and firmly so it doesn't wash down the hill with the rain!<br/>
&gt; Remember to log your find online, and contact me if any maintenance is<br/>
&gt; needed, or just to let me know the status of this box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please note -- there is a first finder Frog in the box!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * * * *<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now let's get boxes going north again!  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
