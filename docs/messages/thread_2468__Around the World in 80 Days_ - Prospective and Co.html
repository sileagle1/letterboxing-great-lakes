"Around the World in 80 Days" reintroduces the continuing challenge<br>
and notifies prospective travelers of the final season. The tour will<br>
not be supported beyond 2006.<br>
<br>
Notice is hereby given that routes and destinations for "Around the<br>
World in 80 Days" have been certified secure for the upcoming travel<br>
season.<br>
<br>
For those planning their future adventures through the fifteen<br>
ports-of-call, be advised that 2006 will be the final time this tour<br>
is offered.<br>
<br>
For travelers holding valid Passports from the previous season: <br>
Please refer to the status page for any alterations and itinerary<br>
modifications. <br>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/projects/80days_status.asp<br>
<br>
We acknowledge that geo-political conditions have affected the<br>
viability of some sites. In some cases, relocation and redirection has<br>
occurred in the off-season.<br>
<br>
Non-penalty (or �down-days�) have been calculated by the Travel Staff<br>
and will be credited thusly: The period between November 1, 2005 and<br>
April 30, 2006 do not count towards the accumulated 80 Days. <br>
The Travel Staff trusts that each party can determine the remaining<br>
time available to qualify for the bonus letterbox "Around the World<br>
in 80 Days".<br>
But also note that the Travel Staff and the Passport Division are also<br>
tracking accumulated travel time.<br>
<br>
For those who have previously requested a Passport for the current<br>
season:  Fulfillment will be executed by the close of business at the<br>
end of the current week (5/5). Note, this means the Travel Staff will<br>
deliver your order to the Postal Service by week�s end; plan accordingly.<br>
<br>
The entire "Around the World in 80 Days" organization, including the<br>
Travel Staff and the Passport Division, again salutes those intrepid<br>
World Travelers among us who trekked far and wide last summer to<br>
secure the prized "World Traveler" letterbox, and in some cases, the<br>
coveted bonus box "Around the World in 80 Days".<br>
<br>

requests or other concerns.  Reach us at:<br>
