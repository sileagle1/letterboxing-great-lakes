<br/>
We found box #3 in the Henes Park Series in Menominee, MI and were <br/>
replacing it in its hiding spot when we noticed four individuals <br/>
scouring through the woods.  Mushroom hunters?  Nope - fellow <br/>
letterboxers.  I went up to them and said, "Looking for this?" <br/>
because they had obviously found the hiding spot.  It was "Loki's <br/>
Legion" - new boxers from SE MI and we got an on-the-trail stamp <br/>
exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Our trip from WI -&gt; MI didn't have a ton of letterboxing, but we did <br/>
find the following:<br/>
<br/>
Henes Park Series (3 boxes) - our clues said that box #1 was <br/>
missing, but after the exchange with Loki's Legion, they let us know <br/>
it had been moved and graciously gave us their clues.<br/>
<br/>
Do the Wave (Indian River, MI) - nice rest stop and a hitchhiker <br/>
(Tree Tops).<br/>
<br/>
MI-CAT (My Cat) - what a log book!  Neat to see a lot of you there.  <br/>
Great stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Sail Away - another quick Mackinaw City box with a great stamp.<br/>
<br/>
The Old Well - great roadside park on Lake MI.<br/>
<br/>
Beach Bum - loved the stamp, TJ_Mich.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
We're excited because there's a half dozen new boxes in SW WI upon <br/>
our arrival.  Hoorah!<br/>
