Here's a link to a list of the oldest boxes in each state:  http://firststatebox.blogspot.com<br>
If the list is accurate, it looks like the box in WI is the 11th oldest box in the USA.<br>

Other old ones that we've recently found:<br>
<br>
The Starved Rock Letterboxes were April 2002.<br>
Illinois Canyon was January 2003<br>
Effigy Tumuli was April 2003<br>
<br>
Another older one that looks active:<br>
<br>
Milk Capital was November 2002 and last found November 2006<br>
<br>
These are some of the older boxes of which I am aware.  I have a few <br>
more on my list (mainly from around 2002), but I'm rather sure those are <br>
gone.<br>
