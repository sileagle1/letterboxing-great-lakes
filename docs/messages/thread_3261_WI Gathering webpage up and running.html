SpringChick, are you still co-moderating the Traveling Event Stamp <br>
group that She Who Plants started?  Are the boxes listed there still <br>
available?  Checking the database there, I see SWP carved a Jack <br>
Frost box which would be appropriate for this gathering, as well as <br>
perhaps Cameo's Cabin Fever or 3M's Box-o-Sox (even without that <br>
particular box, it sounds like a neat concept we could adopt <br>
ourselves - attendees bring a pair of socks to donate to a <br>
shelter).  I recall there was also another series She was starting - <br>
was it Christmas songs or something like that?  I know I sent <br>
her "Adolph the Green Nosed Turtle" a long time ago.<br>

box to plant, please note a slight change in the address on the page.<br>
 (I once again mixes home and job addresses.)<br>
<br>
Also, I've thought of a neat idea for the logbook of the event stamp -<br>
an Advent calendar where we stamp-in under different dates. <br>
Unfortuntely, I don't know whether I have the time or resources to<br>
make it.  If there are any takers out there, let me know.<br>
