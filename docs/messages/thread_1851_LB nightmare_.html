my first letterboxing nightmare.<br>
<br>
It started off well enough:  I was hiking down this gorgeous woodland<br>
trail with Team Armadillo and a few other people.  We came out onto a<br>
sandy beach and rounded a large rocky cliff to find the letterbox we were <br>
seeking sitting out in plain sight on top of this enormous flat rock.  I<br>
opened the box and it was crammed full of stuff.  Initially I was worried <br>
it had been taken over by some geocachers but I soon found it was<br>
something far more sinister.  Some one had collected the contents of<br>
every letterbox from that park into the one container!  There were 2<br>
logbooks, one stamp, a first finder prize and a part of another stamp.<br>
Of course, in my dream it made perfect sense that we now had to scour the <br>
beach for the rest of the pieces of that one stamp, somehow without<br>
attracting the notice of the gaggle of sunbathers just 20 yards away.  As <br>
the others looked for the pieces, I tried in vain to cram one of the<br>
logbooks or stamps into the only container I had, a centrifuge tube, but<br>
they were all too big.  No one else had any containers and we had 4 boxes <br>
to re-hide...<br>
<br>
It was almost a relief to wake up and come to lab this morning.  Luckily, <br>
the only boxes I plan to go after this week are in centrifuge tubes, so<br>
if my nightmare does come true, I will be prepared!<br>

Well, I'd like to think I am in good company!  I can only remember two<br>
very vivid nightmares.  I have an image in mind to commemorate the first<br>
one!  Mine also had the elements of frustration and sinister activity. <br>
Any dream interpreters among us?<br>
