                    <div class="plaintext-content">Whew! Since last Friday, we have gone boxing three times and found 6 <br/>
boxes! This is definitely a record for us! Besides two beautiful and <br/>
fun stamps in the Around the World in 80 Days series, we have <br/>
ventured down to Monroe to pick up the Old Frenchtown Island and Lake <br/>
Erie Creature Box 1 boxes. The second one was in Sterling State Park <br/>
which neither of us had ever been to and we fell in love with it! We <br/>
took a 3-mile walk around one of the marshes, where we saw a swan, a <br/>
great blue heron, a crane, and a number of rabbits. Talk about a <br/>
nature walk! :-) Yesterday, we drove down to Tipton/Tecumseh to the <br/>
Hidden Lake Gardens boxes. Both boxes are easy to reach and the <br/>
stamps are lovely. We had never been to this park either (for <br/>
somebody born and raised in SE Michigan, there is a surprising number <br/>
of places I have NOT been to!) and, again, we fell in love with it. <br/>
The manicured lawn, extensive flowerbeds, and the hidden lake itself <br/>
were wonderful. Plus, we saw two deer! One word of warning about this <br/>
park, though, is that they do not close at "dusk," as many parks do, <br/>
but at 8:30 on the dot. As we didn't arrive until ten minutes to <br/>
eight, it meant for some very hurried boxing for us! <br/>
<br/>
Anywho-- just wanted to share the fact that all 4 of these boxes are <br/>
in good shape, and though a little out of the way, the parks are well <br/>
worth the trip!<br/>

neat places that we wouldn't have found without letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Hidden Lake Gardens is a great spot!<br/>
