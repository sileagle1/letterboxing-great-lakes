                    <div class="plaintext-content">Due to a sudden change of personal circumstances, I will not be able to host the 80's themed gathering on Sept. 15.  I was really hoping to be able to pull this off and I regret having to cancel, but with the recent changes in my life I will not be able to do it this year.  <br/>
<br/>
If people are interested, I would be willing to host a meet and greet at the Great Pumpkin Patch in Arthur, IL (probably even that same day, I believe Sept. 15 is their opening day) with an event stamp and possibly an event box or two, but it will be a small affair and not a full-blown gathering.<br/>
