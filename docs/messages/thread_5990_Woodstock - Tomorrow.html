I posted a message over the weekend, but here's a recap:<br>
<br>
Two letterboxers from Oregon are in our region.<br>
<br>
Der Mad Stamper was one of the very first involved in the hobby and he was<br>
instrumental in establishing the letterboxing.org site. RaqsEnigma is from<br>
Illinois, but relocated to Oregon two(?) years ago. Some of you may have met<br>
her at the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering in WI or when you visited Portland.<br>
They are in currently in IL to visit Raq's family and attend a wedding.<br>
<br>
A few of us plan to get together for dinner with them on Wednesday JUL 29 at<br>
O'Leary's Pub in Woodstock, IL. We plan to meet around 6 pm, but if you<br>
can't get there until a bit later, that's OK, come anyway! We'll probably<br>
enjoy some liquid refreshments until everyone arrives, then order some food.<br>
<br>
Here's a link to O'Leary's website, which includes their address & menu:<br>
<br>
http://www.olearyso <http://www.olearysonthesquare.com/> nthesquare.com/<br>
<br>
Let me know if you will be able to make it (& approximate arrival time) so<br>
we can have approximate idea of how many to plan for.<br>

And DMS and I might have another couple (some relative newbies) with us as well if the timing works out - they're not going to know until the last minute whether they'll be out of work on time or not.<br>
