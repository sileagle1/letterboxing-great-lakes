I posted a message over the weekend, but here's a recap:<br/>
<br/>
Two letterboxers from Oregon are in our region.<br/>
<br/>
Der Mad Stamper was one of the very first involved in the hobby and he was<br/>
instrumental in establishing the letterboxing.org site. RaqsEnigma is from<br/>
Illinois, but relocated to Oregon two(?) years ago. Some of you may have met<br/>
her at the 2006 Great Lakes Gathering in WI or when you visited Portland.<br/>
They are in currently in IL to visit Raq's family and attend a wedding.<br/>
<br/>
A few of us plan to get together for dinner with them on Wednesday JUL 29 at<br/>
O'Leary's Pub in Woodstock, IL. We plan to meet around 6 pm, but if you<br/>
can't get there until a bit later, that's OK, come anyway! We'll probably<br/>
enjoy some liquid refreshments until everyone arrives, then order some food.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a link to O'Leary's website, which includes their address &amp; menu:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.olearyso <http: www.olearysonthesquare.com=""></http:> nthesquare.com/<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you will be able to make it (&amp; approximate arrival time) so<br/>
we can have approximate idea of how many to plan for.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Great! So far it looks like there will be 13 of us. However the more,<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; merrier, if anyone else can make it.<br/>
