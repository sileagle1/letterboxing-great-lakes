                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm just playing devil's advocate here..........but can we really criticise<br>
this type of "competition" when we have a lot of "regular" letterboxers who<br>
place such a high high value on their own F-counts, even to the point of<br>
reporting about how many boxes they've found in a day and such?  And we now<br>
have ways to keep all those tallies online even.<br>
<br>
What really is the difference between someone attempting 20, 30, or 50 boxes<br>
in one day and the sort of "competition" that these folks have put together?<br>
It seems to me that it's just the idea of "personal best" against "team<br>
play" but what's really the difference in the long run?<br>
<br>
I mean, if it's "all about the hike", I don't see that there's much that a<br>
person can have appreciated about the hikes if they're finding 20, 30, or 50<br>
boxes in a day.  It's hard to believe that there was much, if any,<br>
stop-&-smell-the-roses time.<br>
<br>
This is being done by "newbies" to letterboxing, but is it really any<br>
different than the "power boxing" done by many of "our own troops"?<br>
<br>
Now, I could ask...........how many boxes are these hunters placing?  But<br>
then again, we have plenty of "our own troops" who have never placed a<br>
single box.  So can't really criticise there either.  Planting isn't a<br>
requirement for a person to be thought of as a "letterboxer."<br>
<br>
Another poster made a comment about not wanting the U.S. to become like the<br>
U.K. with requirements such as the "100 found boxes" thing.  But the thing<br>
is, that's true, but it isn't true.  To officially buy a new catalog of<br>
placed boxes, one needs to be a member.  On the other hand, old catalogs are<br>
for sale all over the place.  Very easy to find.  Plus, and this is the<br>
important thing to me, there are scads and scads of folks totally willing to<br>
help out and "mentor" a newbie when they run across one.<br>
<br>
Maybe what's needed to combat all the media information out there that<br>
doesn't stress good techniques and letterboxing etiquette at all, thus<br>
leaving newbies often totally in the dark, we need people willing to take<br>
out new people and be willing to show them the ropes.  Showing people in<br>
person how it's done, I think, would be much more effective than people<br>
skimming thru articles they may find on LBNA or atlasquest.  As good as<br>
those articles with information and tips can be, let's face it, when most<br>
people are reading things on their computer monitor, they're busy skimming,<br>
not really digesting the information.  I don't really know how we could<br>
accomplish this tho.  I'd certainly be willing to go out with new folks on,<br>
say, Sunday afternoons.  But how to get the information out there that<br>
someone is willing to do it, and how to assure safety, I have no idea.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents.......<br>

<br>
unclebubba,<br>
Thanks for coming out and explaining the group to us some more.  It <br>
puts my mind at ease somewhat that the members are concerned with the <br>
stealth and etiquette that boxers typically try to uphold.  I don't <br>
really like the idea of using letterboxing as a contest to get as <br>
many as fast as possible because I think that may diminish the <br>
satisfaction and enjoyment of the finds.  But, as long as the boxes <br>
are cared for, handled well and replaced and rehidden well, I guess I <br>
don't care if that's how they are found.<br>
<br>
I did read the SPY's main site and it looks like a terrific <br>
organization.  I'm happy to hear that your members have worked out <br>
the clues themselves.  When I saw the hotline thing, it made me think <br>
that the box locations were being "given up", the code answers were <br>
being given out and the finders weren't doing any of the work for <br>
themselves.  If that's a wrong assumption on my part, I'm glad and <br>
I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions.  There's a mystery box out <br>
there that I found the location of, got there and sat around for a <br>
long time trying to figure out.  I gave up after an hour or so and <br>
went home empty handed.  I'm still trying to work it out and hope to <br>
get it eventually. I was thinking that this box was just being outed <br>
to anyone in your group who asked and it upset me that people that <br>
didn't really figure it out would claim it as a find.<br>
<br>
To me, a great part of the fun and satisfaction of finding the boxes <br>
is being able to figure those things out on my own and having an AHA <br>
moment.  Even if it takes several attempts.  I thought your members <br>
were being cheated of that experience by having an easy out through <br>
the hotline.<br>
<br>
I still don't like the idea of a hotline or the blog giving out any <br>
types of hints or clues to people's boxes.  Especially if its to <br>
boxes that were planted by people other than the contestants in this <br>
group.  I can see having tips like "the areas flooded", "the box is <br>
missing", "the road is under construction" or what not.  I just hope <br>
that the codes or locations for mystery boxes aren't being just <br>
handed out to everyone.<br>
<br>
I'm still concerned about one of the post's on the SPY blog site <br>
about one member's "power hunting" tactics and destroyed pants.  It <br>
makes me think the area surrounding the box may be destroyed as <br>
well.  Again, that could very well be a misinterpretation on my part.<br>
<br>
Welcome the this group and to this great hobby.  I'm sorry it was <br>
under these circumstances.  I hope this hasn't soured you to the <br>
hobby.  It takes a lot of time, energy, effort and love to put a box <br>
out in the wild.  We may just be like overprotective parents freaking <br>
out about our kids safety and trying to protect them as best as we can.<br>

Bali, <br>
 Thank you for your concern. We are not simply handing out<br>
explanations, I myself put at least 14 hours into one of Family of 6's<br>
boxes after 2 members of our group had found it. We all do the work<br>
and we all have that fantastic AHA moment I love so much! The story of<br>
the pants was a little blown out of proportion by the writer of the<br>
paper/blog (thats what he does, we are all used to it). It was my<br>
father who it happened to, he had to walk through some raspberry<br>
bushes to get to a box and tore his new rain pants, and tore them big!<br>
so he simply discarded them. We all love this sport and take it very<br>
seriously and most of us will continue after the "competition" ends. I<br>
hope this clears up a little more.<br>

Just a quick note. The "leader" of this "competition" has placed 4<br>
boxes and one other member has placed 3, maybe 4 boxes. That is all I<br>
know of.<br>
