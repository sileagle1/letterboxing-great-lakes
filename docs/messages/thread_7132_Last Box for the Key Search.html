not been planted yet.  The coded clue for the LOCATION will hopefully be <br/>
posted later today, but the actual box will not be planted until <br/>
Friday.  The full clue will then be posted Friday night.  If you are <br/>
heading to the gathering, I can bring a few extra copies of the clue for <br/>
those of you who might not have internet over the weekend.  Just let me <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
The last box will be planted, as I mentioned, in western Michigan...so <br/>
it might turn out to be convenient for those of you in the western half <br/>
of the region who are going to the big event this weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and stay cool!<br/>
