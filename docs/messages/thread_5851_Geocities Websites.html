Just found out while reading posts on the Atlas Quest "Atlas Quest" board that Geocities will be closing down its website hosting services later this year, but no date has been announced yet.  Here's the official blurb from www.geocities.com:<br>
<br>
Important Announcement<br>
<br>
After careful consideration, Yahoo! has decided to close GeoCities later this year.<br>
<br>
You can continue enjoying your GeoCities service until then â€” we just wanted you to let you know about the closure as soon as possible. We'll share more details this summer. For now, please visit the help center for more information.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
This means if you're like me and you host your clues on a geocities website you'll have to make new arrangements.  There's a bit of chatter about it on the Atlas Quest "Atlas Quest" board if anyone wants to check it out.<br>
