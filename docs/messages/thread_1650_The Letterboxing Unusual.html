MAN, well, I think he was peeing. I scooted out of of view, but knew<br>
from my "power" opera, that he had definiately heard me. Well. I'm<br>
hiding and giggling and he just keeps peeing, like forever. (or maybe<br>
something else)????? Le' Yuck<br>
<br>
I heard him leave about 5 minutes later! <br>
<br>
Then 2 days ago I'm out boxin and I hear boys giggling, and I round a<br>
curve and there are about 10, fifteen year old boys, in different<br>
stages of nudity!<br>
<br>
They screamed like girls and yelled to me they "were changing." Hum, I<br>
couldn't figure out why they were changing in the middle of the woods.  <br>
<br>
So, I walked around them and went home.<br>

Two things about our adventure to get the Tunnel #3 box:<br>
<br>
1) We'd already been boxing for a year, so some bushwhacking wasn't a<br>
surprise.  However it turned out more challenging because we didn't get near<br>
the box until about 8:30 pm in early July last year.  Needless to say, the<br>
light was fading fast.  To make matters worse, my arm was in a splint and<br>
sling due to a biking injury and walking on the stone wall made me VERY<br>
nervous with my "bad" arm. (You wouldn't think I would let that stop me from<br>
boxing, do you?)  Luckily we had a flashlight for the tunnel, so that helped<br>
us locate the box.  However just as we were stamping in, we heard two guys<br>
on bikes approaching below...<br>
<br>
2)  They stopped just below us, so we had to stay still so we didn't attract<br>
their attention.  Instead of proceeding into the tunnel, they stopped and<br>
talked briefly and then one guy started singing very loudly and<br>
enthusiastically, but NOT loud enough to drown out the sound of him peeing<br>
(like FOREVER!).  It was hilarious, and we struggled to stay quiet.<br>
Eventually he was drained dry and they entered the tunnel so we could finish<br>
up OUR business of stamping in.<br>

I hear the middle of Tunnel #3 is a good place to pee if you really,<br>
really, really, need to...nice and dark for privacy, even if people<br>
walk past you.  And who can tell with all the other water dripping and<br>
