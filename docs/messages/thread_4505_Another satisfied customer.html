the gathering Saturday was marvelous.  It was a great park (even if the <br>
whole park IS upside down), and the lodge worked out really well.  <br>
Thanks to the day's collaboration with J&B Books - and Doglvrs letting <br>
me tag along on the last box - I ended up with 12 boxes, which is <br>
probably the highest percentage I've ever gotten.  The clues were <br>
creative (and kind of sneaky) and the boxes were wonderful.  Thanks to <br>
everybody who participated for making this a fabulous day!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to add our thanks to everyone else's.  The event had something for everyone... the day was perfectly arranged, the boxes were creative, the trails were immaculate, the weather was beautiful, the friends were aplenty, the food was delicious.  We were thrilled to make the trip back to Michigan to join in all the fun.<br>
<br>
In the end we found 5 of the Wing boxes (3 on Saturday, and 2 on Sunday morning before heading home), so were nowhere near all you pacesetters.  But for us, the good times on the trail and at the lodge made up for all the frustrating moments thinking "But it HAS to be THAT log with the green end!!"  Perhaps we'll have a chance to pick up a few more someday.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all!<br>

P.S. For anyone heading back to find more boxes - please note that our "Wing Man" and "Winged Wheelers" were day-of-event-only boxes, and were removed on Sunday, unlike the official series of 16 in the main clue packet.<br>
