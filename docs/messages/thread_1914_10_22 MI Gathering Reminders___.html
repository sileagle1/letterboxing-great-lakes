<br/>
-  The gathering begins at 8:00 a.m. and the potluck is at 12:00 p.m.  <br/>
We are planning to wrap up around 6:00 p.m.  As the afternoon is <br/>
primarily letterboxing time, feel free to stay as long as you want to <br/>
keep boxing.  The park closes at 10:00 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
-  If you placed your own boxes at the park, please bring clues to <br/>
share.<br/>
<br/>
-  Come with questions, ideas and input for the "Building a Better <br/>
Letterbox" forum.<br/>
<br/>
-  There is no running water at the shelter so please come prepared <br/>
with beverages and if you need water for your potluck item, you'll <br/>
need to bring it with you.<br/>
<br/>
-  If you have a lantern or other non-electric light you are willing <br/>
to bring, please do so.<br/>
<br/>
-  Wear bright colors as it is hunting season and land adjacent to <br/>
Yankee Springs is open to hunting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One other thing...<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning to look for the Election '04 boxes by Lucky <br/>
Charms, you might want to read through the clues this evening (they <br/>
are online at letterboxing.org as there is a little bit of research <br/>
required on these).<br/>
<br/>
See you tomorrow!<br/>
