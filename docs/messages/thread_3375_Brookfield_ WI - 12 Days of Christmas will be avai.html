                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are finishing up the hiding of the 12 Days of Christmas this <br>
afternoon.  (One of the boxes needed a new spot and we couldn't find <br>
a good one in the dark!  Imagine us the other night, both in our <br>
business wear, me in heels, trying to find a hiding spot by cell <br>
phone light!)  The boxes will be available starting tomorrow and <br>
will be out until the end of January.  St. Nick's Gathering folks, <br>
these boxes are less than 5 minutes away from the gathering <br>
location.  The clues out on LBNA are not correct right now, since <br>
they do not include the new spot for the one box, so don't print out <br>
copies of the clues until tomorrow AM!  There will be a message at <br>
the top of the clues once they are updated for 2006-2007.<br>
<br>
We will only be at the gathering on Saturday for an hour or two <br>
since we need to drive down to Chicago, but we will print out some <br>
copies of the clues and leave them there for anyone interested that <br>
doesn't get the chance to print them out before hand.  We will also <br>
be leaving clues laying around for our newest box, The Three Little <br>
Kittens Who Lost Their Mittens, which will be available at the <br>
gathering.  <br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing the early folks, and we will be sorry to <br>
miss most of the day!  There are a lot of new boxers that we were <br>
hoping to get to meet!  Stay warm and happy boxing!<br>
