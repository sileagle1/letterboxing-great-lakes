I sit and read the chat, but there is no need to feel like you opened any cn of worms.  People just express their opinions and sometimes the opinions come with fears and concerns about recently missing or damaged boxes.  <br>
I was hoping to place a dozen new letterboxes this spring, a lofty goal but I'm rethinking that total.  I am realizing that the placement of a box is a major factor in the life of that box.  Easy to blame others or other factors, but I'm taking my time and thinking more about placements now.  <br>
<br>
Around Thanksgiving and through December till shortly after Jan. 1 (weather permitting) I have been placing a series of 12 easy boxes for beginners, especially families with children.  And...those boxes have all survived for 2 years...and will reappear again.  <br>
<br>
So my thoughts are this....we need a variety of boxes for beginners and more challenging ones too.  I never labor over a stamp if the location doesn't justify the placement.  Just food for thought for all of us.  <br>
<br>
Hot day today.  Good day to sit inside where it's cool and create some boxes.  <br>

  Didn't mean to open a can of worms regarding the option to limit clues <br>
  by found counts, as I said in an earlier post, I don't think the answer <br>
  is to have all clues restricted in some way. Just wanted to point out <br>
  one option that may (or may not) discourage some less scrupulous <br>
  hunters. As some LBers have pointed out, I think a variety of LB <br>
  options is great - the easier ones will appeal to beginners and those <br>
  limited for other reasons (physical ability, children, etc), the more <br>
  challenging ones will appeal to another set and some to both. That's <br>
  part of what makes it so appealing.<br>
