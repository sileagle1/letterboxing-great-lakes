                    <div class="plaintext-content">Can't wait to see the stamp!  Yes, everyone can designate their box as a<br>
Temporary box or a Permanent box.  I would just like to know the duration of<br>
time it will be at the park so I can include the info in the clues.  At the<br>
Haunted Harvest Gathering last October we had a few that were "one day<br>
only", several that were available for 2 weeks and a bunch that remained as<br>
permanent boxes.<br>
<br>
Since we expect to have at least 40 boxes at the gathering, it will be<br>
difficult to actually find all of them within a single day, especially if<br>
you want to spend time chatting and/or attending any of the workshops.<br>
