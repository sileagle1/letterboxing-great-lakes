<br>
We shall go on to the end,<br>
We shall fight in the cold,<br>
We shall fight in the snow,<br>
We shall fight through the ice,<br>
We shall fight with runny noses and frozen toes.<br>
<br>
We shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island Team or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, we would carry on the struggle.<br>
