with them.  The area where box #1 was had been cleaned up and it seems <br/>
they tossed out the box too.  Box #2 is still in place where I put it <br/>
a year ago with no visitors.  I think CG is either no longer active as <br/>
a LB or for some other reason she never updated the clues to the <br/>
second box when I sent them to her.  I've emailed CG again, and if I <br/>
don't hear back, I'll officially adopt these boxes and fix them up.  <br/>
As for now, they are not available.<br/>
