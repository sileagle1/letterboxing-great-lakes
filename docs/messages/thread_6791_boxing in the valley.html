                    <div class="plaintext-content">When doing a location search near where I live, I notice there seems to be a void in the middle of Kane County in Illinois from South Elgin to pretty much North Aurora. Is this just a coincidence or does Kane County have an issue with letterboxing? I curious both because I like boxing close to home and because this is likely where I would be where I would want to plant in the future.<br/>
