Fortunately, I have another box already to go to replant!  The new box <br/>
will be near the old location, but shifted slightly.  I'm hesitant to <br/>
replant (since I'm usually not a proponent of it), but since our box has <br/>
only been out 3 months and we really like the clue, we are going to give <br/>
it one more try.  Hopefully, it was just the size of the box.  The first <br/>
box was, perhaps, a bit larger than it should have been and was more <br/>
easily seen by muggles.  Check the clues for updates. <br/>

Glad you're going to give it another try.<br/>
