                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a question about planting.  I'm in process of planting a <br>
series of boxes in local cemeteries.  There's a cemetery that I want <br>
to use that I think would be perfect.  But, a friend of mine is a <br>
county deputy sheriff and one of her co-deps told her that they often <br>
bust people in there for various delinquent activities (drugs, <br>
etc).  I've been through there several times in the past few weeks <br>
and have never seen anyone in there, much less people doing these <br>
things.  This isn't a highly dangerous/super high crime area.  I <br>
think if people go there during the day and use common sense, they <br>
would be safe enough in there.  It may not be a great idea to go a <br>
night (I'm not sure if they lock the gates at night here like most seem to do).<br>
<br>
I have a very specific idea of the kind of cemetery I'm looking for <br>
and I'm having a much harder time finding planting sites than I <br>
thought I would.  This one is perfect in all other aspects , so I <br>
really want to plant a box in there.<br>
<br>
My question is, should I:<br>
- not plant it there at all because of this reported activity<br>
- plant it anyway and don't mention anything about it.<br>
- put some kind of vague reminder in the box clues about being extra <br>
careful while there<br>
- put some kind of more specific suggestion about not going at <br>
night/bring a friend with you<br>
- put some kind of really specific warning about possible delinquent <br>
activity and not to stop if there are other people around<br>
<br>
What would you do?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's up to you whether to plant a box in this cemetery or not.  I couldn't say for sure what I would do in your shoes.  If you do plant the box here, I think you should include specific warnings.  The worst thing you could do is not mention any warning at all.  You don't necessarily have to go into great detail about the goings on, but you should somehow warn people that unsavory characters may be about and that they need to exercise extra caution if they choose to go alone or after dark.  I think we all know that we shouldn't letterbox alone and that we should be on the lookout for suspicious persons...but let's face it, in the heat of the moment letterboxing kind of takes over our brains and most of us are not as observant or careful as we might otherwise be.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Amen to that one.  I totally agree.  There's one box in a deserted cemetery<br>
here in this area and the last I looked, the clues mention nothing about the<br>
area having safety problems.  It's in a forest preserve area where crystal<br>
meth dealers and users hang out (and where a few live) and more than once a<br>
body (a dead body) has been pulled out of the pond that's there.  Muggings<br>
have occured, rapes have occured.   And it's not just at night.  I<br>
personally would never risk going alone in the daytime either.  A group of<br>
people are probably fine going in there.  Probably 99 times out of 100,<br>
someone can go in there and nothing will happen.  I just wouldn't want to be<br>
that hundredth person thankyouverymuch.<br>
<br>
Yes, warnings might cause some boxers to decide against looking for a box<br>
that has safety warnings in the clues.  And yes, everybody needs to look out<br>
for themselves and use good judgement.  But it's hard to use good judgement<br>
when one might not know the history of an area, and the placer will has no<br>
idea who-all is going to be coming from where-all to search for the box.<br>
Notwithstanding the fact that it's not going to look too good if someone<br>
gets seriously hurt going after a box and the police later find out it was<br>
because of a letterbox, and it hits the media that way, I wouldn't want to<br>
be responsible for someone getting hurt without at least having warned them<br>
that problems might exist so that they can make an informed choice.  Being<br>
able to make an informed choice is nice.  It's the polite thing for a placer<br>
to do in my opinion.  :-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have two boxes planted in a beautiful park in Youngstown OH.  The <br>
problem with the park is there are a bunch of entrances exits all over <br>
the city.  Some of them in less then desirable areas.  In my clues, i <br>
simply stated please leave the park the same way we had you enter if <br>
you are unfamiliar with this area.  I didn't want to go into great <br>
detail and alarm people, but I also didn't want them exiting into one <br>
of the areas that could be kind of rough.  I felt it was my <br>
responsibility to put something in, since im the one familiar with the <br>
park and the surrounding area.  I think a cautionary note asking <br>
visiting boxers to be aware of people and their surroundings is a good <br>
idea.  ~The Cats Meow~<br>
