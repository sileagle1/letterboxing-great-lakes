The paved bike trail does have some hills.  Eight letterboxes are planted<br>
along one section of the paved trail; most the rest of the boxes are on<br>
UNpaved trails which do not allow bikes.  Six boxes are planted on a<br>
3/4-mile loop of unpaved trail that DOES allow bikes.  Don't know if this<br>
info is of much help to you or not.  Please feel free to email me with any<br>
other questions.<br>
