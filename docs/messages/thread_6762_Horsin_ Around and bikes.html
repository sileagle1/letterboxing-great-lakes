The paved bike trail does have some hills.  Eight letterboxes are planted<br/>
along one section of the paved trail; most the rest of the boxes are on<br/>
UNpaved trails which do not allow bikes.  Six boxes are planted on a<br/>
3/4-mile loop of unpaved trail that DOES allow bikes.  Don't know if this<br/>
info is of much help to you or not.  Please feel free to email me with any<br/>
other questions.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I read in something relating to this event that a person could bring<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; &gt;bike along.  Bakekana gets tired easily, particularly regarding<br/>
&gt; &gt;walking/hiking, and I was thinking maybe she'd do better with being able<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;mix it up with sometimes riding her bike.  But I will also have our<br/>
nearly<br/>
&gt; &gt;3-year old along, and I would have to pull her in a bike trailer.  I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt;wondering what the bike trail is like...is it relatively level?  Anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt;know?  I did note that it's paved.  But I'm kind of wondering if it would<br/>
&gt; &gt;just be a pain in the butt rather than a help...any insight is<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I was thinking maybe we could use the bikes to get from area to area and<br/>
&gt; &gt;then hike to the boxes...but am not sure if this would really work or<br/>
not.<br/>
