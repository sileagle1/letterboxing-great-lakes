I'll make this a quick note. Our deep appreciation to BNL Bali Girl and <br>
Double Dragon for this great event. Between the organization and the <br>
art this was a most enjoyable event and one we will remember for some <br>
time to come.<br>
<br>
Also, our thanks for the hospitality and welcome given by our fellow <br>
letterboxers in Michigan. We enjoyed a lot of exchanges and <br>
conversations today and hope to retain these connections over the years.<br>

Best regards to all! We overcame the rain!<br>

It certainly was!!  Thanks for organizing an interesting & fun event. It was nice to have a relaxing get-together at a private home afterwards - everyone was free to mingle, moving from room to room, chatting & exchanging.<br>
We enjoyed looking at all the photos you posted so promptly at <br>
http://share.shutterfly.com/action/welcome?sid=8CbtnDdo4bP6A<br>
Unfortunately we didn't remember to get our camera out to take any photos at the wrap-up, so didn't get any "people photos"  It was nice to see all of those that you posted.  However I did manage to get a few cemetery shots, which I've posted to this message board.  Here's a direct link:  http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/photos/browse/9392   I especially liked how the Yerkes shot turned out.<br>
Thanks again for a fun day & we enjoyed meeting everyone.  We hope to be out in better weather tomorrow to find more of the local boxes.  (Although it really wasn't raining too bad today after all)<br>

Ohh, that Yerkes one is really pretty!  Thanks for sharing those!  I <br>
took photos of all the stones I used as clues, but didn't take any <br>
overview shots of the whole cemeteries.<br>
<br>
Yeah, thankfully, it didn't rain too hard.  Of course, it really <br>
cleared up after everyone got back to the house.  Figures! =) <br>

<br>
Sorry you couldn't make it Mrs Doglvrs!   There were a lot of <br>
interesting stones in these old cemeteries.  The Double Dragon's said <br>
they saw some born in 1790's stones!  I missed those.<br>
<br>
BTW, are you the one who does the research on stones for that <br>
genealogy group that helps people find ancestors?  (I'm sorry I can't <br>
remember the name of the group)<br>
<br>
Rascal1126 found a very bizarre stone in one of the cemeteries <br>
yesterday that had the name, and above the name it said Husband - <br>
Father.  Below the name, it said "failure".   We wanted to know more <br>
about the person, if there's any way to find anything out.  There <br>
didn't see to be any other family members interred near by, so it's <br>
hard to get an idea of the age of the stone.  It looked fairly new, <br>
though.  It had some carvings of seagulls and other things on the top of it.<br>
<br>
Do you have any ideas or suggestions about how we can go about <br>
finding more information?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Thanks for doing this event, and thanks for getting <br>
back to me about it.  I mostly sulked at home on<br>
Saturday because I couldn't go!  :(  <br>
<br>
Are you going to do another?  It would give me<br>
something to look forward to.  It was nice that it was<br>
so close to me.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

---No, sorry - I'm not.  I come by my appreciate<br>

---Yes -- go to the local library where the cemetery<br>
is located.  They have LOTS of information stored<br>
there, and it is often used by people tracing their<br>
genealogy.<br>

Hope this helps!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I missed the original post, but from what I gather, the group Rick is<br>
looking for is raogk.org<br>
<br>
It stands for Random Acts of Geneological Kindness.  You can check on their<br>
site for someone who volunteers in the county that you need information<br>
from.<br>
<br>
I'm a volunteer for DuPage County, IL.  Things have suddenly got busy 'round<br>
DuPage..........I'm heading over to the county courthouse today to search<br>
for things for 6 different requesters that have emailed me in the past three<br>
weeks.  Nobody at all contacted me in September.  All of a sudden, family<br>
trees are important.  :-)  Must be because we're gettin' closer to the<br>
holidays.<br>
<br>
Libraries are a good source, especially if the library has a great reference<br>
librarian.  Googling for historical societies in the area can also be a<br>
great source.  Even if a person wants to do the legwork themselves,<br>
contacting the RAOGK volunteer for that area, the volunteer might be able to<br>
give them places to contact that would be good for that specific county.<br>
