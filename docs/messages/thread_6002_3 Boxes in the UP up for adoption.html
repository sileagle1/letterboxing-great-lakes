I moved away, and gave them to my son, but he isn't taking care of them - so thought I'd offer them to someone else.  As far as I know, they don't need much attention, although the Copper Country HumaneSociety instructions should probably be changed.  They were re-doing the pathways, and I wasn't able to check the clues after that.<br/>

We get to the UP (Keweenaw) several times every year.  If you still need someone to adopt your boxes, and think that checking on them when we are up there would be adequate, we would be happy to adopt them.  You would need to let us know what we need to do, as we have never adopted a box before.  We will be going up over Labor Day weekend.  Let me know what you think.<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>

Subject: [LbGLK] 3 Boxes in the UP up for adoption<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone interested in adopting my 3 boxes?  They are:  Bear Lake, Copper Country Humane Society, and Snow Thermometer.<br/>
<br/>
I moved away, and gave them to my son, but he isn't taking care of them - so thought I'd offer them to someone else.  As far as I know, they don't need much attention, although the Copper Country HumaneSociety instructions should probably be changed.
