                    <html><body><p>We were very excited a few weeks ago when we saw Lock, Shock &amp; Barrel post clues to a new series.  They haven't been very active for the last year or two but they are excellent carvers and clue writers.  The clues for the new Princess Letters were QUITE funny and the search for the 7 boxes took us on a nice long hike yesterday.  It was a beautiful autumn day to be out on the trails and we packed a lunch for a stop along the way.  In keeping with their previous plants, the new images were fantastic!  We are especially impressed that he can get such detail when carving on the softer pink material.</p><p> </p><p>We highly recommend this series to all of you that like to hike and that appreciate some classic pin-up type images.<var id="yui-ie-cursor"></var></p><p> </p><p>Wisconsin Hiker</p></body></html>
