                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are finally home from the weekend.  OldShoe and I went back today <br>
to grab a couple of boxes that I didn't have time for on Saturday <br>
and then made a stop for Dragon's the "Go to Hell" box on our way <br>
back to the highway.<br>
<br>
For anyone who is still looking for boxes in the next couple of <br>
weeks -- if you were hoping to get the "Perfect vision from the 1st" <br>
box...  sorry, I took it home today.  Actually I went back for it on <br>
Saturday evening on my way out (yes, at 9:45 p.m. in the dark), but <br>
it had moved a bit from where I had originally placed it and I felt <br>
around a bit in the dark (it was really dark back there in that <br>
grove of trees), but didn't find it.  So picture this -- here I am <br>
back in the weeds and trees in the dark (I saw later that there was <br>
a flashlight in the truck), on my hands and knees feeling blindly <br>
under some logs for this box, all the while singing because I didn't <br>
want to startle any critters by my presence and I had seen those two <br>
very large holes (dens?) only a few feet from where that box was <br>
hidden, not to mention this was the place where I saw the Massasauga <br>
rattler a couple years ago.  I didn't find the box, however the <br>
singing was a hit and successfully scared away all critters and <br>
snakes.<br>
<br>
Anyway...  the GL Gathering was great fun -- thanks Team Rabbit for <br>
all of the work you put into this event!  Wow, talk about <br>
overwhelmed and overloaded!  There was so much going on, from the <br>
many new faces to the circus, to meeting Mark and Sue, to the <br>
wonderfully created event boxes and "secret" boxes.  I know I didn't <br>
even get a chance to meet everyone trying to fit everything into the <br>
day.  Hopefully at the next gathering!  I was thrilled though to see <br>
some old friends and meet so many new letterboxers -- from near and <br>
far!<br>
<br>
All of the stamps were awesome and it was nice to see the work of <br>
first-time carvers (way to go Kody!), creative ingenuity (Dragon, <br>
the Mo' Mustangs series was great!) and skillfully carved works of <br>
art (Team Rabbit, the landmarks stamps were gorgeous!)<br>
<br>
Mark & Sue...  it was awesome to finally meet the two of you and <br>
have you at our event here in Michigan!  Thanks for bringing the <br>
circus to town -- some incredible carvings in there!  Mark, thanks <br>
for the informative and inspiring presentation on Dartmoor -- where <br>
do I sign up?<br>
<br>
Moma Bear -- So nice to meet you and have you at the Gathering from <br>
New York -- and thanks for the present you left us over in Grand <br>
Rapids.  I am hoping to get over there while it is still safe and <br>
sound.<br>
<br>
Dragon -- thanks also for your efforts with another successful event <br>
(and BTW -- loved the pi so much had to go back today for another <br>
hit).<br>
<br>
Tom & Jill -- so glad you took pictures and thanks for posting them!<br>
<br>
Again, thank you to EVERYONE and so glad to have had the chance to <br>
spend some time with you all for the day!<br>

'Til the next one...<br>
