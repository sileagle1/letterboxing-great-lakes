                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a fun event today!!  Can you believe it? - The rain held off until<br>
early evening and then it was only a very light sprinkle.  That was a very<br>
good thing since there seemed to be an infinite number of boxes to find!  We<br>
only managed to find about half of them today, but are definitely planning a<br>
return trip (or two) to hunt for the rest.  We think there were probably<br>
about 65 boxes out there today!!  Aimlesst and her crew did an excellent job<br>
of planning & planting.  It was obvious they put a lot of thought into<br>
creating the clues and placing the boxes.  The clues have piqued our<br>
interest in several books we haven't read yet.  Many thanks also to those<br>
that contributed boxes to the event.  We're glad to see that many of the<br>
local boxers planted boxes themselves so aimlesst also has quite a few to<br>
find in addition to the many she planted.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
There was an amazing amount of food at the event and quite a variety.  Lots<br>
of main dishes and side salads as well as appetizers and desserts.  BBQ pork<br>
sandwiches, chili, soup, meatballs, sweet potato meatloaf, baked beans,<br>
pasta salads, cheese, marinated mushrooms, hot apple cider etc, etc.  We<br>
certainly couldn't even hope to taste everything since there were so MANY<br>
things.  By the way, who made those yummy brownies?  Here again, aimlesst<br>
was very organized with plenty of serving spoons and anything else that was<br>
needed.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
It was great to see so many old LB friends from past events and ALSO to see<br>
so many newer boxers.  And the truly newest was 2.5 week old baby Henry (if<br>
I remember correctly his trail name is Two Square, a funny twist on his<br>
birth date).  The littlest Christmas Elf also made an appearance Friday<br>
evening and was tooling around in her stroller on the trail today w/mom &<br>
dad.  She'll be celebrating her 1st birthday later this month. We did<br>
several exchanges with people we hadn't met before, but as usual, there were<br>
plenty of people we missed.  It was nice to put some faces to the stamps<br>
we've seen in logbooks or names we've seen posting on this board.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We also had a fun time chatting with folks at both the pre- and post- event<br>
dinners last night and tonight (18 people each night).  It's always nice to<br>
have some extra time to chat since the event itself is usually so hectic<br>
with so much to do.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
A huge thanks to aimlesst & her friends & family who helped create such a<br>
nice event!!<br>

<br>
Our little elf was pleased when we followed her suggestions to hit the trails.  She enjoyed the scenery followed by a nap as we moved from box to box.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the before-during-and-after planners, carvers, planters, and everyone who attended for all of the fun and food.<br>

<br>
Our families tease us when they hear we're going to a "gathering" (they must think we're wearing costumes and chanting around flames or something equally as odd). We simply tell themthe gatherings arelike a big family reunion picnic...with the purpose of finding Tupperware containers in the woods. (Ok, I guess thatmight sound kind ofodd a nonletterboxer.) It's always a blast to see everyone, share stories from the trail and enjoy a day a fun, hikingand solving clues.<br>

Many thanks to aimlesst for a fabulously organized and fundayand to everyone who created boxes for the event!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Did you ever see a grown woman cry over a stick?  Thanks to all of you who went searching for my lost (on the LOST train, nonetheless) hiking stick, especially HowD Girl, Lampwick, Diana Dolphin, and Red Sea Biscuit who double tracked four boxes with me looking for it (ever try finding a stick amongst a forest full of them?), but especially to WORMY WANDERERS who found it for me!  As I was explaining to some people, it's very sentimental to me.  DESTINY CALLED when we saw Julie and her group approaching with it in hand.  Even Tiptoe called me to let me know rumor had it that WW had it in their possession.  What a great group letterboxers are!<br>
<br>
But more importantly, thank you to aimlesst for spearheading this wonderful event, to Library Grrl, and others who assisted.  So many boxes, so little time!  I only wish we could have stayed longer or returned today.<br>
<br>
The food was wonderful (need sweet potato meatloaf recipe!)  Thank you to everyone who donated batteries for the troop.  Including a donation mailed in by TrailTracker and anonymous donation in the box, we have enough to donate 170 batteries!<br>
<br>
I have plans for the Twilight Zone series.  Keep your fingers crossed that the person I need to contact will be amenable to the idea.<br>

We couldn't have said it any better - wonderful day at Boxacon!  Aimlesst & company did a fantastic job providing for a relaxing, well organized, fun-filled letterboxing day!  Wisconsin Streaker and her teeny man where most enjoyable to box with as usual.  It would've been a perfect day if not for the fact that Tiptoe had to get "just one more box".  In the cover of dark, she hurried  to find "Frankenstein." Rushing to appease a more-than-done-letterboxing spouse, she rushed into the underbrush only to be attacked by a branch that flipped her glasses into the brambles.  After much searching (and grumbling) with flashlights the glasses were deemed  lost. (Maybe Leapin' Lizards will carve an additional "Lost series" stamp including Tiptoe's glasses!)  So, if anyone comes across "Frank" and he is sporting a pair of bifocals, please let her know!<br>

Gibson Girl and I figured as much as we'd love to be there for the start of the gathering, we'd rather sleep in (at our respective homes...don't want to start any rumors here!) to save our energy for those blue- and black-rated trails.  Definitely a good plan, as we missed the morning rains too....  The only downside was that we were out and about and missed seeing a lot of attendees, including the photo op.<br>
<br>
Thanks to aimlesst and her team for a well-planned day with well-planted boxes.  Looking forward to returning some day to find the rest...plus some of those Wonderland boxes still waiting for me. <br>
