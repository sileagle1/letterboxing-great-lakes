Hi everyone!  OldShoe and I are back from a week in the Western <br/>
Upper Peninsula (MI).  Wow!  What a trip!  Although we were a bit <br/>
early for most of the color, we had gorgeous weather most of the <br/>
week and had the opportunity to visit many new places -- with and <br/>
without letterboxes.  We averaged about 8 miles a day hiking -- the <br/>
most memorable hikes being several in the Porcupine Mountains, the <br/>
Sturgeon River Gorge near Baraga and Hogback Mountain in Marquette <br/>
(OMG, what a trek that was!).  We drove winding dirt roads to <br/>
countless waterfalls, saw several lighthouses, visited many <br/>
historical places and saw hundreds of deer, a couple bald eagles and <br/>
a wolf (but no moose or bear), not to mention being immersed in <br/>
breathtaking scenery for the entire week.  I have right around 1000 <br/>
photos -- isn't digital wonderful?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who planted new letterboxes in the western U.P. <br/>
over the past couple of years -- the hunt for the box took us to <br/>
many places we probably would not have otherwise found.  We logged <br/>
about 17 letterbox finds (hit F200 at Canyon Falls -- thanks Tim!), <br/>
checked up on several of our previously planted boxes and planted 7 <br/>
new boxes (I know, I swore I wasn't going to plant so far away from <br/>
home -- but my heart is in the U.P. and I couldn't resist).  Clues <br/>
to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will try to catch up on list messages over the course of <br/>
the next few days.  Thanks Azobox for keeping things running <br/>
smoothly here and a great TOTW last week!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>
