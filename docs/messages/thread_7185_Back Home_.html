                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a great trip "out west" (Montana, North &amp; South Dakota, Wyoming).  Saw the sights, had lots of great hikes, found a bunch of boxes &amp; good number of HHs.  Also were first finders on an unusual number of boxes for a trip.<br/>
<br/>
We were also successful in planting the 14 boxes we brought out with us.  We've already sent Shorty the clues for his box and will send Archaeofrog and SunnySideUp clues for their boxes in the next day or two.  I'll also get the clues to my boxes finalized.  We sure hope we didn't lose any of our notes for all those plants!!!<br/>
