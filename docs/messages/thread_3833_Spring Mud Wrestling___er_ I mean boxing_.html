&gt;Secondly, did anyone have MORE fun than I did this weekend? Finally <br/>
&gt;Indiana had its first<br/>
&gt;Spring Forward and the weather was glorious today. Normally I get my <br/>
&gt;first sunburn in<br/>
&gt;April, but this year March 11th is the date. We just returned home <br/>
&gt;from a full day of<br/>
&gt;boxing in Indy and we are going to grill out dinner. It's still very <br/>
&gt;light out, woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
WooHoo!  Sounds great!  We went out for our first day of spring <br/>
boxing today, too. We were mostly in the woods, so no sun burn for <br/>
us.  It was 50+ degrees in Michigan.  Muddy as heck!  We couldn't <br/>
find 3 of the 4 boxes we were looking for.  The first one we think we <br/>
know where it was, but the branches and stuff were still too frozen <br/>
to get to.  The next two boxes were both really close to each other <br/>
and both boxes' last clue hinges on sitting on a bench.  Well, the <br/>
bench isn't there anymore!  All the other benches on the trail are <br/>
still there, so I think this one was permanently removed.  But, it's <br/>
absense makes it really hard to find the boxes!  We tried divining <br/>
our way to the boxes by playing the "if I were a bench where would I <br/>
be situated" game.  But, we didn't have much luck.  One of the two <br/>
boxes we think we know where it is, but again, too frozen to get to <br/>
still.  The other we don't really have any idea.  We search every <br/>
logical place and couldn't find any trace of it.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up searching for the fourth box just because we didn't want <br/>
to go home completely empty handed.  After some initial confusion, we <br/>
found it finally and it was accessible!  This trail was still really <br/>
slushy and muddy, I thought for sure I'd be in the mud or pond before <br/>
we finished up,but we managed to escape the trail without <br/>
injury.  About 50 feet from the car, my friend's daughter took a face <br/>
plant right into a huge mud puddle!  LOL  She survived!  Luckily, <br/>
super-mom was smart enough to bring a second pair of pants for her <br/>
for just this reason!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was a great day outdoors even if we had our worst "% found <br/>
record" ever.  Hoep you all had as nice of a day as we did!<br/>
