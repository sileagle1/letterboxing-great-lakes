Night.  Everyone is invited on the 2nd Friday of the month 5 - <br/>
midnight.<br/>
<br/>
Most ladies work on scrapbooks, but sometimes I work on cards or <br/>
LTCs, some knit or organize photos.  Everyone brings a snack to <br/>
share.  Usually someone brings their Cricut maching (you are welcome <br/>
to use the machine if you bring your own cutting mat).<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like the Janna's post where there is a day set aside to get <br/>
some scrapbooking done.  Lots of fun and fellowship!<br/>
<br/>
E-mail me if you would like to join us!<br/>

&gt; I recently met a wonderful group of women of all ages who gather on <br/>
the 4th<br/>
&gt; Saturday of each month to scrap till their heart's content!  It's <br/>
an all day<br/>
&gt; event, 9am-5pm, with a potluck that usually has a theme.  They meet <br/>
at the<br/>
&gt; Westchester library service center in Chesterton (not the library <br/>
itself). <br/>
&gt; It is loads of fun!  I hope to see some of you there.  I know I <br/>
hope to be<br/>
&gt; at the next one!<br/>
