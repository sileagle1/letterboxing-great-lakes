                    <div class="plaintext-content">Coming soon to the Great Lakes Yahoo! Group -- Letterbox Bingo!  Will <br/>
you be the first to complete your card and win the Bingo Booty?<br/>
<br/>
Q. What is Letterbox Bingo?<br/>
A. In a nutshell... more detailed instructions to follow...  I will <br/>
post a master list of 125 letterboxing related items.  From this <br/>
master list, each player will choose 25 items to comprise their <br/>
unique Letterbox Bingo "card."  Beginning on January 1, 2006, I will <br/>
call one item from the master list each day  announced in an e-mail <br/>
to the Great Lakes Yahoo! List.  If that item is on your "card" you <br/>
cross it off.  The first person to cross out all 25 items on their <br/>
card, wins.<br/>
<br/>
Q. Is There a Prize?<br/>
A. Of course -- what fun is Bingo without prizes?  Each person or <br/>
team who is playing will contribute one item to the Bingo Booty -- <br/>
any item that would be useful to a letterboxer. Winner gets the Bingo <br/>
Booty!  Depending on how many people are playing, the Booty may be <br/>
split up to have 2nd and 3rd place prizes also.<br/>
<br/>
Q. What kinds of things do we give to the Booty?<br/>
A. Some examples (but please use your imagination):<br/>
<br/>
   Replacement carving nibs<br/>
   Containers<br/>
   A hand-made log book<br/>
   Carving material<br/>
   A stamp pad<br/>
   Purple socks?<br/>
   USE YOUR IMAGINATION!!!<br/>
<br/>
Q. Who can Play?<br/>
A. Any member of the Great Lakes Yahoo! List can play.  Families and <br/>
teams can play either as a group (one list of 25 items is chosen for <br/>
the group) or individually (each person chooses their own 25 items), <br/>
but each person who is playing needs to send in a separate item for <br/>
the Bingo Booty.<br/>
<br/>
Watch for more detailed information to come!  I will post the master <br/>
list of items during the first week of December.  You will need to <br/>
choose your list of 25 items and send me your Bingo Booty items by <br/>
December 23, 2005. <br/>

&gt; SpringChick, this is just too cool.<br/>
&gt; For others, if you haven't taken a look yet at the game, take a <br/>
peek<br/>
&gt; (files section). This will be great fun  during those lonnngggg <br/>
months<br/>
&gt; of January..... February....... March?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, I wonder who else is up for for a little side-wager on when the<br/>
&gt; game will end?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll give this a little more thought and maybe come up with a<br/>
&gt; tag-along game/pool where we can guess when we think the first <br/>
person<br/>
&gt; in the Letterbox Bingo game will complete the thirty item list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay, we're ready to roll with this!  I have posted 2 files in <br/>
the <br/>

&gt; &gt; FILES &gt; BINGO_list.pdf is the master list from which you will <br/>
choose <br/>
&gt; &gt; items to make up your unique Letterbox Bingo list.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In a nutshell, what it is...  I've put together a master list of <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing terms, box names, trail names, etc.  From this list <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; 150 items, you will choose 30 items based on the criteria <br/>
explained <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the instructions.  You will keep 1 copy of your list and send <br/>
1 <br/>
&gt; &gt; copy to me along with 1 item to go into the "Bingo Booty" prize <br/>
&gt; &gt; package.  Beginning January 1, 2006, I will call out 1 item from <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; master list each day -- if that item is on your list, you cross <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; &gt; off.  The first person to mark off all 30 of the items on their <br/>
list <br/>
&gt; &gt; is the winner and gets the Bingo Booty.  If you are going to <br/>
play, <br/>
&gt; &gt; you will need to get your list made up and send me a copy along <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; &gt; your booty item by the end of December.  I know that is a month <br/>
yet, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but with the holidays and people going out of town, etc., I <br/>
wanted to <br/>
&gt; &gt; make sure everyone had plenty of time.<br/>

I will contribute something very useful.  No kidding, I have one purple<br/>

out and check all the finders.  We had a dusting of snow and more is to come.<br/>
