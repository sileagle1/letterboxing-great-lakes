                    <div class="plaintext-content">I mentioned to a few folks that I was trying to get access to the camp letterboxes for us during this year's gathering, as they're only 15 minutes away.<br>
<br>
Due to the new schedule for resident camp (yes, RESIDENT camp at CBS. Gads.), we are unable to get authorization to use the trails.<br>
<br>
I'm honestly disappointed and seriously apologetic.  They're citing safety concerns for the girls and that's difficult to debate.<br>
