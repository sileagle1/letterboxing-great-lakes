                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey everyone. I incorrectly listed the word from January 26th as "Hidden Valleys (IL)". It should have said "Hidden Villages (IL)". I guess that would explain the comment about Hartx6 not knowing there were hidden valleys in Illinois. The only Hidden Valley in this game goes on your salad in the form of ranch dressing.<br>
