It does strike me as odd though that somebody could get their personal stamp into your log book at a gathering without you knowing it.  I find I am usually right there conversing with the person I am exchanging with as it is happening.<br>

  This is nutty! Couldn't some one figure this out... I mean there are <br>
  only so many people at a given gathering... don't people usually have <br>
  like a guest book that people sign when they attend a gathering. And <br>
  what are the chance of a letterboxer attending an east coast <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is a problem with the Pete-and-Wanda theory:<br>
     Many folks discovered the Purple Skull stamp in their logbooks <br>
after the Ithaca gathering last June, but Pete and Wanda were not <br>
there.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed one theory I read that maybe the stamper wore a ring with <br>
the stamp on the underside, making it easier to sneak the stamp into <br>
logbooks unnoticed...<br>
