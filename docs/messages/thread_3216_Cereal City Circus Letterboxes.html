all the available boxes!  I want to add my thanks to SpringChick and <br>
Azobox for a fun gathering, and a very creative start.  We were making <br>
comments about being part of the Amazing Race as we ventured from point <br>
to point, trying to make our map of where the gathering was, and <br>
running into the same teams.  Very creative (as usual)!<br>
