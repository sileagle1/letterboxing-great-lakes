I was just thinking it would be fun to have some sort of car magnet that  <br/>
says something about letterboxing so we can spot each other driving around at  <br/>
gatherings or to let folks know which cars to cootie etc.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping I can come but won't know DH's work schedule until the last minute  <br/>
almost so still not sure if we can make this out first boxing gathering or  not.<br/>

Just cause I'm a little anal and overly curious, I was cross checking <br/>
