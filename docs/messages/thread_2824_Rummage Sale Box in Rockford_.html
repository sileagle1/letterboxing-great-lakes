straight from Jacks' garage sale in Deerfield.  <br/>
<br/>
It will be available July 29-30 (Sat-Sun) from 8-5 both days at 3952 <br/>
Elva Lane, in Rockford.  <br/>
<br/>
All you have to do to retrieve the box is ask anyone working the <br/>
sale: "Is the itsty bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka-dot bikini still <br/>
for sale?" and you will be directed to the box.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought I'd go ahead and post the clues here, since I wasn't sure how <br/>
easily Dragon would be able update the box's clues while he's on <br/>
vacation.  Hope to see a few of you there!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and in case anyone needs extra motivation to come, forgive me the <br/>
shameless self-promotion but I GOTTA get rid of this stuff: this is a <br/>
moving sale and I'm moving into an already stocked apartment, so I'm <br/>
getting rid of all kinds of kitchen wares &amp; appliances, small pieces of <br/>
furniture, actual non-tacky collectible stuff, and a 20-year-old <br/>
porcelain doll collection.<br/>
