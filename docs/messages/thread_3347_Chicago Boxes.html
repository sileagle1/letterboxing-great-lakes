                    <div class="plaintext-content">It seems that there is some desire to be able to find boxes from either <br>
OHare or downtown Chicago.  I've responded to a few of the posts on this <br>
site off-list, but I'm posting a few boxes here for general knowledge.   <br>
Perhaps people could add to this list if I've left a few off....and I've <br>
not included boxes that I suspect aren't there (based on personal <br>
experience).  If you go to www.yourcta.com you can find a trip planner <br>
that will help you find buses and trains.<br>
<br>
Boxes In/Near downtown are: Green Tortuga has one in the train station, <br>
"The Grand Hall" / Minimom has one downtown at the "Harold Washington <br>
Library" / Matt The Rat has one downtown, "Chicago Underground"<br>
<br>
Boxes a bit further from downtown but that you can find via a short <br>
El/Bus ride and hike: via the El Blue Line north, you can find one of <br>
mine "CTA Blue Line"  / Beach Mom has one near downtown in "Humboldt <br>
Park." It can be accessed via the Blue Line and a short hike (~1mile) or <br>
bus. / If you take a bus south (#6) to Hyde Park, Coffee Beans has one <br>
there, "Chicago's Wild Parakeets" and I do too, "CP1." (alas my "White <br>
City Series" has not yet been replanted)  <br>
<br>
Boxes near downtown but would require a bit more work figuring out the <br>
buses:  Beach Mom's "Momentum" box is nearish to a Red Line El Stop / <br>
Pico's "Historic Chicago Box #1: The Clarke House" is just south of <br>
downtown / and you could reach Matt the Rat's "Bubbly Creek or wrgpt9's <br>
"Illinois Centennial Monument" via a buses with a transfer or two.<br>
<br>
Those are the ones that are probably easiest to find without a car from <br>
downtown.<br>
