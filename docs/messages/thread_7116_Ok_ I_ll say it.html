Between the three of us, we spent over $400 -- this did not include gas money for the number of times we drove to plant boxes, to prepare for the gathering, and to pick up the boxes after words. <br>

We had 125 sign-ups divided between 69 lines, or families. So, if every family group donated $5 we would have been just short of what we put into it -- this is about what I expected.<br>

Most hosts consider it a privilege to put together a gathering, as I certainly did!<br>

However, PLEASE keep in mind next time you attend a gathering that there is great expenses involved not only monetarily, but many hours of time too. If there are donation boxes, please donate -- even $5, or whatever you can. If there is a raffle, please buy tickets.<br>

I hope this doesn't come across as complaining . . . that's the reason I've waited nearly a year to post this . . . this is meant to bring awareness to those attending gatherings.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're very sorry to hear that! We received very generous donations when we hosted events in 2005 and 2006.  Perhaps the declining economy or just a decline in thoughtfulness is to blame for the scanty donations for more recent events. We usually donate $20 when we attend a gathering since we know what is involved with hosting.  Hopefully more people will think about this after seeing your post.  I suggest that anyone hosting an event have the donation box "up front & center" when people are registering and signing in for an event.  It should be on the table where the event stamp is and where they get their name tags so it is very easy to know where to donate a few $$.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It doesn't come across as complaining at all!  It is a big undertaking to host <br>
an event, in terms of time and expense -- especially a large event, and it is <br>
frustrating not knowing what may or may not come back in terms of donations.  <br>
Having hosted a variety of events, including the MI Fall Gathering for many <br>
years now, there have been good years and there have been bad years.  I've <br>
always gotten enough at least to cover the cost of the shelter, but sometimes <br>
just barely. I don't think I've ever "broke even" if all things were to be <br>
considered, but it's hard to say because I don't really keep track of my <br>
expenses beyond the shelter, rather I've always just considered time and <br>
materials my way of giving back to the wonderful Michigan letterboxing <br>
community, not to mention I really do enjoy putting it together.  I will have to <br>
say though that there are some very generous donors at these events and it does <br>
seem that a few are carrying the cost for many...  I am aware that there are <br>
some events in other areas that have actually charged an admission fee...  I <br>
would probably stop hosting the events before doing that, but it is something <br>
for people to consider when coming to an event.  Yes, you may have incurred cost <br>
to get there and you brought your own food, etc. but there is a fair amount of <br>
expense associated with hosting the event, cost that should not be the burden of <br>
the host or a handful of generous donors. Even with a fair donation it was a <br>
reasonably priced day of fun for you and your family!<br>

Last year I co-hosted my first gathering -- it was a big one. Being as there <br>
were three hosts, we kept track of all the money we spent on the gathering . . . <br>
so we could divy up the money donated fairly.<br>

prizes), however, we had donation boxes out and I even made an announcement <br>
regarding the donation boxes . . . and to please donate to defray some of the <br>
costs.<br>
<br>
I realized ahead of time, we would be lucky to break even . . . but the final <br>
numbers still surprised me.<br>
<br>
Between the three of us, we spent over $400 -- this did not include gas money <br>
for the number of times we drove to plant boxes, to prepare for the gathering, <br>
and to pick up the boxes after words. <br>
<br>

We had 125 sign-ups divided between 69 lines, or families. So, if every family <br>
group donated $5 we would have been just short of what we put into it -- this is <br>
