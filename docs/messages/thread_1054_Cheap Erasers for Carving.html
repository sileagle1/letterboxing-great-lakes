Just wanted to pass along the deal I found on erasers last night.  <br>
Typically I like to carve on PZKut (like the consistency but wish it <br>
was thicker).  The pink stuff and MasterCarve will also do if need <br>
be.  I also like Staedler erasers but hate sanding off the bumps and <br>
they are not always large enough since the Grand size is no longer <br>
available.  Every now and then I run across a cheap vinyl/plastic <br>
eraser that it quite carvable but it seems like they are hit or miss <br>
and I often can't find the ones I like the next time I look for them.<br>
<br>
Anyway...  last night at one of the local $$ stores I ran across <br>
white vinyl erasers -- 5 in a pack for a buck and each eraser is 2 <br>
3/4" (wide) x 1 1/8" (high) x 1/2" (thick).  I figure I can get 2 <br>
letterbox stamps out of each of these -- that is 10 stamps for a <br>
buck and because they are 1/2" thick, no need for mounting.<br>
<br>
I carved one up last night to test the consistency and they carve <br>
nicely -- not as nice as some of the material mentioned above, but <br>
not bad -- certainly doable for the price.  I was able to get a fair <br>
amount of detail on the little flower I carved.  The one thing I did <br>
find though is that they don't do well with direct, extreme heat.  I <br>
usually transfer my image using my iron and that made kind of a <br>
sticky mess.  I can work around that though.  I think they will hold <br>
up okay -- MI gets hot in the summer, but not as hot as my iron.<br>
<br>
The store I found them at is called Dollar Discount -- this <br>
particular one was a Dollars & Deals the last time I was there so <br>
I'm not sure if the organization changed names, or they changed <br>
hands.  All of their merchandise is the same as before so I have to <br>
think they are one and the same.<br>
<br>
Sorry to anyone in the Muskegon, MI area...  I cleaned out their <br>
supply.<br>
