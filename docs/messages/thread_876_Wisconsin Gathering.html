Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Let me be the first to say,  my family and I had a blast at the <br/>
gathering.  We were all a little nervous, but that went away <br/>
quickly.  Everyone was so freindly and accomodating.  We met alot of <br/>
nice people and collected some fantastic stamps, as well as learned a <br/>
thing or three.  It was definately an added bonus to letterboxing.  <br/>
Just when you think you've found something fantastic, it gets <br/>
better!  Thanks to all that organized and contributed!  We look <br/>
forward to the next one, wherever it may be.  <br/>
<br/>
See ya on the trails,<br/>

I second that. Thanks to Dragon for all the work he put<br/>
into this gathering. It was a really great day and it was so<br/>
nice to meet all the people behind the trailnames.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We want to echo this as well.  We had a great time!  Meeting everyone<br/>
was an added bonus for us too, because I think it "validated" the hobby<br/>
of letterboxing with the kids a bit more.  I think when they met some of<br/>
the people who planted the boxes we have been finding, or who have<br/>
stamped in those boxes before us, they somehow became more excited about<br/>
letterboxing.  The kids talked all the way home about the day, who they<br/>
met, etc.  (Many of you made really nice impressions with our kids.)<br/>
When we got home they sat around the table looking at their logbooks to<br/>
see who they may have missed, which stamps they liked best and which of<br/>
the hunts we did yesterday they liked best.  At the gathering, our six<br/>
year old son took his log book and wandered around seeking others to<br/>
exchange with all on his own.  Everyone was so friendly and encouraging<br/>
with the kids and I really appreciate that.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon, we did find your Environmental Classroom box while there, but it<br/>
was dark by the time we did.  I think we were some of the  last few to<br/>
come in after dark to get something to eat.  Our very last find was the<br/>
White Horse and for some reason that stumped us.  We looked around one<br/>
last time and found it at last and it was hard to keep quiet about it,<br/>
'cause we gave it away to Czeltic Girl!  Yes, Leapin' Lizards, we have<br/>
to work on our "stealth mode".<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for a great afternoon!<br/>

Heh. Yeah. Thanks for saving me a bit of walking <br/>
around in the dark for that one. It was so much harder <br/>
to look up at the school for differences when the<br/>
lights are shining right in your eyes. Sounds, however,<br/>
were pretty easy to pick up on. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I don't think stealth mode is possible at gatherings. It's <br/>
too hard to be quiet when everyone's having so much fun!<br/>

I'd like to say thanks as well to everyone who made this gathering so <br/>
much fun. It was my first, and I am now looking forward to many more. <br/>
It is so surreal to finally meet the faces behind the stamps that we <br/>
always see on the trail. I was starting to think you were all just <br/>
make-believe little wood sprites leaving rubbermaid out in the world <br/>
for me to find... ;)<br/>

We would also love to chime in about the wonderful time we had <br/>
Sunday.  I also second the notion about how seeing all you wonderful <br/>
letterboxers 'validated' this hobby especially for my daughter.  My <br/>
children often look at me and roll their eyes about my activities and <br/>
at least they now know we're not out there with our stamps, log <br/>
books, ink etc.... etc... etc... all alone.<br/>
<br/>
A major thanks to Dragon for planning this gathering and for all of <br/>
you who placed boxes for us to find.  What a different experience <br/>
waiting in line to stamp in, or hiding around the bushes so we can <br/>
wait, and find the box ourselves.  We are most often all alone on the <br/>
trails and sometimes the only car in the parking lot of the nature <br/>
preserve (o.k., maybe we shouldn't letterbox in the rain anymore).  <br/>
Thanks again to everyone who shared with us and we hope to meet up <br/>
again.<br/>

I just want to chime in about the great gathering!  It<br/>
was great to see so many new faces from Wisconsin and<br/>
Illinois.  It was also fun to catch up with people<br/>
we've been in contact with for some time now. I also<br/>
know Sara had a great time being sneaky for my<br/>
birthday.  It was a wonderful birthday spent with<br/>
great people.  Thank you all!<br/>
