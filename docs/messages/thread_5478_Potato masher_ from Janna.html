One of the cooking utensils we bought him this year is a nice, sturdy potato masher.  Upon opening it he said, "Cool, a branding iron!"<br/>

But better yet, when we got to his mother's house, she had also given him a "combat spatula!" And my brother managed to get him exactly the opposite of what he asked for. Instead of a non-metal ball whisk that we could use in our non-stick pans he got a metal balloon whisk!<br/>

I brought an item to a cookout.  These people made Chinese stuff constantly,<br/>
it seemed.  So it seemed perfectly natural to me when they asked me to bring<br/>
a bag of rice.  As I approached the group that day with my bag of rice as<br/>
requested, everyone cracked up.  The only thing I heard for the rest of that<br/>
summer was, "So, where's that bag of ICE?"<br/>
