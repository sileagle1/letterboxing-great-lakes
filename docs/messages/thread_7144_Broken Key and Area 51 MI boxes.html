<br>
Also, I replanted my Broken Key letterbox, but not in the same place.  The new box is in Waterloo SRA.  If there is anyone near Lansing who could swing by and pick up the old box (along with all the Geo-trash in it) I would appreciate it since I wasn't able to head up that way on my way home.  The old clues are still with the new clues.<br>
<br>
Also, a friendly reminder -- please don't add stamp pads to boxes, and please, please, please, reseal bags and boxes well!  I checked on my Hell box and the first two (historical) log books are now destroyed.  (It WASN'T an animal...)  Thanks!<br>
