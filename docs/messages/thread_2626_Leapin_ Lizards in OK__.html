when I visit my Dad in a couple of weeks and what to my wondering <br/>
eyes does appear but a Letterbox at the Blue Whale at the Port of <br/>
Catoosa - By Leapin' Lizards!!  I was surprised and excited!  Goofy, <br/>
I know but how fun to get to see that someone you "know" planted a <br/>
box in your home state!  Somewhere, I have a picture with me standing <br/>
with the Blue Whale!  I may have to add that picture to the log book <br/>
just for the fun of it!<br/>
