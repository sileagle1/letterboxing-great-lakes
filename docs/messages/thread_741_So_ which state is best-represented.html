Hi, Everybody!  We (being the 2-woman trail-tromping dynamic duo <br>
known to all as TEAM TACO) are loudly and proudly shakin' it out for <br>
our home state Illinois!  We live in the far-flung burb of Batavia, <br>
home of the Fightin' Fermi's! <br>
<br>
Disclaimer: there are no Fightin' Fermi's in Batavia or anywhere <br>
else for that matter, but I'm of the firm opinion there really ought <br>
to be.  (Invision football helmets with cute little atomic clusters <br>
on the side.  Enrico would have been thrilled.)<br>
<br>
Melinda, Team Taco<br>

Subject: So, which state is best-represented<br>
<br>
Since it's Friday afternoon and I'm here at work, I decided, in the same<br>
vein of our "English Majors and women named Debbie" poll a few months back,<br>
to start an unscientific poll to see which state has the most groups of<br>
letterboxers represented here on the lbGLK list. I started reading through<br>
the archives and stopped when my eyes started to cross. Since some people<br>
box alone, and some people box in pairs, and some people box in groups of<br>
unspecified numbers, each hash mark in my "study" represents a letterboxing<br>
"group" - ie, although Deedle & I are two people, I counted us as one<br>
"group" since we always box together. So initial results are:<br>
<br>
Indiana - 2<br>
Ohio - 2<br>
Illinios - 10<br>
Wisconsin - 6<br>
Michigan - 9<br>
Tennessee - 1 (OK, Delirium hasn't moved yet - she's included in the<br>
Michigan count)<br>
<br>
If you'd like to be included in this very important occupying of my time,<br>
send me an email off list (so we don't clutter the list traffic and cause<br>
inboxes to implode). I'll post an update - with trailnames, if no one<br>
objects - in a few days. doodle_n_deedle @ yahoo.com<br>

This is a very good project since I lost track awhile back.  When I <br>
joined the list in July I started a notebook that I'd jot things in <br>
about posters such as where they were from and who they boxed with.  <br>
Then when they posted, I could better relate to what they were <br>
talking about.  Now I'll have it all down on one list!  It's going to <br>
be lots of fun to go to my first gathering and see if you all really <br>
look like I imagine you to!<br>

P.S.  Does today hold the record for most messages posted in one day <br>
