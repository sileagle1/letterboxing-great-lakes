<br>
We went out to look for a new box in the area, and when we got close, <br>
we saw (& heard) 2 young men lighting and tossing firecrackers and <br>
drinking beer.  We walked past them along the trail,  looking for the <br>
landmark.  After a bit we figured out that where they were standing was <br>
exactly where we needed to be.  So we turned around and walked past <br>
them again.  We walked a bit further down the trail then stopped.  I <br>
looked back at them and then started taking notes on my clue sheet, <br>
looking over at them occasionally so they might think I was taking <br>
notes about them.  As soon as they saw what I was doing, they picked up <br>
their mini-cooler and firecrackers and hightailed it out of there!  We <br>
then strolled back to the spot and retrieved the box.  Success!<br>
