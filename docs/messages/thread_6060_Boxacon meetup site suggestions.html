We are almost to the point where I can see Oct. 3rd in the long term forecast.  Right now the day before, Friday the 2nd is forecast as 66 and mostly cloudy.  I know that can change, but I am hoping that it will hold through the rest of the weekend.<br/>

I had a couple of messages about getting together Friday night before the gathering and Saturday night afterwards.  I do not know the area restaurants out there.  Is there anyone who is familiar with the western suburb area that would have ideas?  <br/>

    I have a vague memory of a spy themed restaurant it the area that has a box in it. Am I dreaming or does someone know what I'm talking about? If there is such a place that might be fun.<br/>
