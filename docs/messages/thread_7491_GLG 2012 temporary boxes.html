How long will the boxes marked temporary be there?<br>
Are they temporary as in already gone?<br>
I could probably convince the hubby, since the jr. varsity<br>
will be out of school and I also have this Friday off,<br>
to make the trek to Badger country.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<br>
In regard to our temporary Simpsons series, we plan to leave them in place for a while (at least a month or so).  We are planning a trip to come back and pull our boxes as well as get some of the boxes we missed but it doesn't look like we would be able to get up there until at least late July/early August.  So you all have some time to pick up those Simpsons stamps if you haven't already grabbed them. <br>
