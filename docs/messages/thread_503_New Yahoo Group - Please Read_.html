had two people e-mail me about this in the last 10 minutes.  This <br>
new group is not a replacement group -- us Michigan 'boxers are not <br>
breaking off from the Great Lakes group.  I don't think I am <br>
speaking only for myself when I say that we like it here with our <br>
neighboring Great Lakes area 'boxing buddies.<br>
<br>
This is a new, additional Yahoo group which appears to be specific <br>
to Michigan letterboxes.<br>
