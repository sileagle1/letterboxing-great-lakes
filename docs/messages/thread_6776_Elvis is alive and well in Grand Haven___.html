Once again this event will go down in LB history as a great, fun-filled event with lots of great boxes and many cool challenges along the way.<br/>
The photo requirements were a neat twist to the LB challenges of the day.<br/>
Team Roustabouts had a great time and want to express our appreciation and gratitude for all the hard work and planning that went into making it a great day for everyone.<br/>
It was great to see old LB friends again and to finally meet new LB friends face-to-face! <br/>
Happy LBing to all,<br/>
