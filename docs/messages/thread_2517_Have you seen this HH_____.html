=======================<br/>
I'm still waiting to hear about Rapido my Great HH Race entry.  I <br/>
heard he landed in Fort Walton Beach FL and I flew down there in hopes <br/>
of retreiving him (and visit a friend) but he had already been picked <br/>
up by someone from WI!!  Where oh where is my Rapido?<br/>

I'm sure she'd appreciate any info if anyone in our area has it or has <br/>
seen it.  Perhaps it was left somewhere in FL?  If you have any info <br/>
to pass along, here's her email address:  sowbiz@yahoo.com<br/>
<br/>
She also will be at the Great Lakes Gathering on June 3.<br/>
