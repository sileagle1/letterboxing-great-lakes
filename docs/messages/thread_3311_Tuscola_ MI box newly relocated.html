                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I got up to Tuscola today and relocated my box that was planted <br>
a mere 30 feet away from TrailTroll's!  I still can't believe how <br>
close to each other they were planted.  What are the odds?  I was <br>
thinking of moving it to Gladwin, but that didn't work out.  So, now <br>
there are two boxes in Tuscola County!  More incentive to go to the Thumb!<br>
<br>
Here is the link to the new clues... <br>
