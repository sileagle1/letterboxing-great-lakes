<br>
You may recall back in the fall when we had the contest to fill in <br>
all the MI counties, I basically planted a box on top of a box that <br>
TrailTroll planted about 4 hours earlier.  Of all the places in all <br>
the county, I put my box no more than 20 feet from hers.  I really <br>
couldn't believe the odds of THAT occurrence!<br>
<br>
Now, today, I got a status report from a geocacher who said they <br>
found my box because it was on top of a geocache they were looking <br>
for.  How in the world?  My box is in the nook of a large tree where <br>
the trunk starts branching out into smaller trunks.  It's a little <br>
hard to see up there, you kind of have to reach up and into the <br>
cranny to get the box.  I looked up in there and moved the leaves and <br>
stuff around to cover the box when I planted it.  I didn't notice any <br>
other box.  I've had a lot of statuses since it was planted and no <br>
one else reported a geocache!<br>
<br>
I think I just found the geocache clue.  By the google map, it's in <br>
the same general place and was planted a week before mine.  There <br>
were three or four other geocache finders and none of them noted in <br>
their statuses that they found my letterbox.  I can't believe the odds!<br>

My Archie's Chair box is "unavailable" because I put it underneath the  exact <br>
same rock as a geocache -- I had no idea until I started receiving Emails  <br>
saying that there were a lot of confused cachers out there thinking they were  <br>
going to find a cache and pulling out a letterbox.<br>
 <br>

PS Archie's Chair will be back out -- at a new location -- as soon as  <br>
possible.<br>

Glad to hear it's not just me!  The weird thing is several people <br>
have found my box, and until yesterday no one had also found the <br>
geocache.  I found the geocache clue and it looks like none of the <br>
4-5 people that found that had found my box, too.  Or at least they <br>
didn't post it in their comments. Crazy!<br>
