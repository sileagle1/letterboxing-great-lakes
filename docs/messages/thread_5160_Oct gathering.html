We stayed there awhile back and found it to be a wonderful experience! They bring a <br/>
continental breakfast to you in a basket to enjoy in your room or out on your porch - a little <br/>
different than the usual communal breakfast of most B&amp;B's.  The grounds are lovely, the inn <br/>
(a restored barn &amp; cottages) is top notch!  The actual letterbox was placed by a friend of the <br/>
owners who has since moved away.  BTW ...we needed a little help on the old clues...but then <br/>
again, we usually need a lot of help!<br/>
