It's funny (or not so funny), but these days, I write "NOT A GEOCACHE!!!" on<br/>
the outside of my boxes in way bigger and bolder print than I write "This is<br/>
NOT TRASH". Seems our boxes are at greater risk of a different breed of<br/>
treasure hunters than they are the unknowing muggle who just tosses or takes<br/>
it!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to all of everyone's boxes out there trying to survive the<br/>
dangerous wilderness and urbanity!<br/>

However not all geocachers are bad - we've had very good luck with geocachers helping put our boxes back in place, or warning us of nearby caches that could cause a problem.  Our nemesis is the hungry raccoons who have damaged or destroyed more of our boxes than any other cause.<br/>
