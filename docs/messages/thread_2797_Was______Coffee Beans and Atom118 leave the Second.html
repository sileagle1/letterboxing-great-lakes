The Travel Staff (a bit UNDERstaffed these days) has indeed been<br>
tracking the travelers and their success.<br>
<br>
However, communications has been difficult recently due to power<br>
outages and internet challenges. So, in an unusual but necessary move,<br>
the Travel Staff is having, yes,a Staff Meeting today.<br>
<br>
I shall put your question on the agenda and perhaps offer an<br>
answer/solution in the days ahead.<br>
<br>
The Travel Staff may change hats, however, and don the dubious<br>
chapeaux of deception this afternoon and consider the MI Fall Gathering.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned.<br>
