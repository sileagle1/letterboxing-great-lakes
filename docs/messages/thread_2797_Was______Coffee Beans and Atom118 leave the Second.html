The Travel Staff (a bit UNDERstaffed these days) has indeed been<br/>
tracking the travelers and their success.<br/>
<br/>
However, communications has been difficult recently due to power<br/>
outages and internet challenges. So, in an unusual but necessary move,<br/>
the Travel Staff is having, yes,a Staff Meeting today.<br/>
<br/>
I shall put your question on the agenda and perhaps offer an<br/>
answer/solution in the days ahead.<br/>
<br/>
The Travel Staff may change hats, however, and don the dubious<br/>
chapeaux of deception this afternoon and consider the MI Fall Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned.<br/>

&gt; Has your staff been keeping track of the number of travelers who have <br/>
&gt; completed the tour? I think when B and I finished in May, we were maybe <br/>
&gt; the 5th or so...? And it seems like the numbers have exploded this <br/>
&gt; summer! Just curious how many intrepid souls have pulled off this <br/>
&gt; tour.... (which, by the way, was one of our favorites ever and got us <br/>
&gt; completely hooked on boxing when we started last summer!)<br/>
