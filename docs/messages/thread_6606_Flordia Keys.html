<br>
So OLJ and myself are taking a trip to the Florida Keys starting this Wednesday.... we will be driving and camping, wondering if anyone has some outstanding boxes we should do along the way or in Florida? We have done some research into a few we want to hit up for sure but suggestions would be appreciated! <br>
<br>
We will be in Peoria for the GLG our last day of vacation coming home from the Keys, hopefully we won't be lobsters for the event!  We also plan on camping the night before to get on the trails bright and early!<br>
<br>
See everyone soon!<br>

We're in Finland at the moment, so can't access our older logbooks, but do seem to remember that Eat at BO's, Little White House, and Little Key West Drummer Boy were good stamps.<br>

Have fun & we'll see you in Peoria!<br>

I think my Key Lime PI box is still in place although the clues were taken off AQ and LbNA.  They are on my main site:<br>

time...unfortunately our letterboxing endevors were not as great. I hate to<br>
be the bearer of bad news but looks like your box Dragon at the end of hwy<br>
1, has gone missing. We looked and looked! I even got out a flashlight and<br>
try to see if I could find it. We will be in key west again tommorrow and<br>
will look again but in the event we can't find it... olj and I were<br>
wondering if there is anything we can do?? I posted on the main board in<br>
hopes of reaching you in time...if there is something we can do please let<br>
us know. I was super bummed to find it gone...<br>
<br>
Hope to hear from you soon as to what you would like us to do....<br>
