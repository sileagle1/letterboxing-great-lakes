<br/>
I feel the need to put out a blanket apology.  Last fall/winter I <br/>
started a new job and was studying and then took my comprehensive exams <br/>
for my masters.  I did some boxing, but it was mostly stolen time in <br/>
small increments here and there when I needed to get up and walk away <br/>
from studying for awhile.  The result of which is that I didn't get <br/>
many of my finds logged in.  Then I made a trip to Charleston and <br/>
managed to misplace my logbook, and things got really confused.  The <br/>
result of which is that I am just now getting some things logged in on <br/>
the sites, so if you are just now getting an entry on things from last <br/>
fall, deepest apologies.<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I feel the need to put out a blanket apology. Last fall/winter I <br/>
started a new job and was studying and then took my comprehensive exams <br/>
for my masters. I did some boxing, but it was mostly stolen time in <br/>
small increments here and there when I needed to get up and walk away <br/>
from studying for awhile. The result of which is that I didn't get <br/>
many of my finds logged in. Then I made a trip to Charleston and <br/>
managed to misplace my logbook, and things got really confused. The <br/>
result of which is that I am just now getting some things logged in on <br/>
the sites, so if you are just now getting an entry on things from last <br/>
fall, deepest apologies.<br/>
