Armadillo JMO. On Saturday I headed towards Fort Wayne<br/>
to check out the Johnny Appleseed Series. 1 for 3. Was<br/>
not able to find boxes 1 and 2 because I was looking<br/>
in the wrong place (and knew it!) It was hot and I had<br/>
a 9 months pregnant friend along, who was VERY excited<br/>
about letterboxing and kept trying to get into the<br/>
woods, where I was searching for #2. Since I didn't<br/>
want to exhaust her too much...and she was scaring the<br/>
crap out of me hiking around in unbuckled Chacos...we<br/>
decided to try again when it was A: less hot and B:<br/>
she was less pregnant. <br/>
On Sunday, I was bored and decided to go to Warren<br/>
Dunes State Park, MI to go after the "Beach View at<br/>
the Dunes" box. Lord almighty. Beautiful, but hellish<br/>
hike. I'm not a big fan of sand dunes to begin with,<br/>
and now we have an even more strained relationship.<br/>
Heat exhaustion. UG! I did live, however, and found<br/>
the box rather easily (even though we weren't on the<br/>
original trail!). Collected some awesome pebbles and<br/>
sand glass on the beach and saw the sunset. It was<br/>
worth the pain!<br/>
<br/>
Let me just take this opportunity to remind the<br/>
newbies and everyone else to CARRY WATER, lots of it!<br/>
In my haste, I left the water in the car and ended up<br/>
drinking water out of Lake Michigan (which,<br/>
incidentally, was fairly clean and yummy). In case I<br/>
die of e-coli poisoning tomorrow, I stress to<br/>
you....BRING WATER!!! <br/>
<br/>
...and if anyone would like to know the SHORTCUT to<br/>
finding this box, e-mail me off list...because there<br/>
is an alternate (easier) way to get to it than over<br/>
the sand dune and through the woods...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I feel your pain regarding the box at Warren Dunes State Park.  The very<br/>
same thing happened to Old Shoe and me when we hunted that one.  There<br/>
really is no indication as to how long the hike is from the clues; actually<br/>
it appears to be a rather short hike.  WRONG!  Long and grueling.  We too<br/>
left the water in the car and were dying of thirst halfway to the box.  So I<br/>
echo your advice about bringing water.  But like you said, it was a nice<br/>
stamping in spot and worth it in the end.  (Was the pregnant friend with you<br/>
on this hike too?)<br/>
<br/>
Regarding your offer of a shortcut...  If you wish to discuss alternate<br/>
routes to the box with other letterboxers, that is your option.  I do<br/>
however ask that neither the discussion nor the offer are mentioned publicly<br/>
on this list.  Somebody went through some effort to make these clues and for<br/>
whatever reason, they laid out a certain route to their box, making for a<br/>
challenging hike.  If you as a letterboxer discover a shortcut while on the<br/>
trail or know the area well enough to have the inside info on the back way<br/>
in, that is great for you -- figuring out a shortcut using a map and sense<br/>
of direction can be a challenging and fun part of a letterbox hike.<br/>
However, it is disrespectful of the original placer to publicly offer this<br/>
to other letterboxers.  Think about from the perspective of it being your<br/>
box...  more than likely you would like people to follow your clues to the<br/>
box, after all that is the reason you wrote them, right?  If one or two<br/>
people know or figure out a shortcut, no problem... but if somebody<br/>
discovers a shortcut and then begins passing along the shorter, alternate<br/>
route to your box to other letterboxers, that is discouraging.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt; I would love to know if anyone has recently found<br/>
&gt; Johnny's Love from the Johnny <br/>
&gt; Appleseed Series.  <br/>
<br/>
I went there on July 31st and found the spot where<br/>
Johnny's Love was *supposed* to be....but had bad<br/>
shoes on and could not get around the tree as well as<br/>
I would have liked. It was a little muddy that day. I<br/>
gave up after a 5 minute search. I vow to return<br/>
better equipped and ready for a more thorough search,<br/>
as I'm pretty sure it's another microbox and not<br/>
easily seen. There WAS a lot of trash around the spot,<br/>
but nothing indicating that the box was mauled by<br/>
drunks slinging MD 20/20 bottles (the majority of the<br/>
trash consisted of liquor bottles). I'll let you know<br/>
if I do find it. <br/>
<br/>
In other news, I went for a casual hike yesterday and<br/>
had an unfortunate incident involving my little dog<br/>
and one insane woodchuck/rodent/otter/whatever. No one<br/>
was hurt, but it was enough to rattle me. The little<br/>
dog didn't seem to care. The only way to process my<br/>
grief was, of course, to make a stamp commemorating<br/>
the event. This will be a mystery box with a rather<br/>
hilarious story and stamp. It will be planted this<br/>
weekend sometime. <br/>
