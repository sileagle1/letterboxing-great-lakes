                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, it looks like we might be looking at a group of 10-20+ people on Friday night. 6:30 pm seems to be the preference, although at either place listed below it would NOT be a problem if some people showed up later. Here are two restaurant options:<br/>
<br/>
1. Fuddruckers<br/>
Appetizers, burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, shakes, etc. Also serve beer &amp; wine. Very informal, order at the counter. No reservations, but a fairly large dining area where we could arrange tables to suit.  Located near Brookfield Square shopping mall at intersection of Moorland Rd and Brookfield Rd.  More details on menu here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.fuddruckers.com/locations.php<br/>
<br/>
2.  Champps<br/>
Large sports bar with a separate side area frequently used by groups.  Wider variety of food &amp; beverage offerings.  They DO take reservations and DO allow separate checks. Located on Moorland Rd in Brookfield, just south of I-94.  More details on menu here:<br/>

It looks like fewer people are available to get together Saturday night.  This is probably the best restaurant choice:<br/>
<br/>
Matteo's Italian<br/>
A few blocks from the park.  They DO take reservations and DO allow separate checks.  They have pizza and other Italian sandwiches, pastas, entrees. More info here:<br/>

I have created a .pdf file that shows a map of these locations, including the park that the event is at.  You should have already seen a post on this, or perhaps this might also get you to the map:<br/>

I revised the database table so you vote on FRI location and to get firmer numbers for reservations.  Please edit (or add) info if you plan to attend either/both nights.  This link might take you directly there:<br/>

Looks like the expected attendance for "Boxacon"  is creeping towards 100.<br/>
If we all sing "rain, rain, go away!" this week, do you think that could<br/>
influence the weather for Saturday?  Or maybe aimlesst has some futuristic,<br/>
high-powered, super-duper Sci-Fi weather controlling weapons at her<br/>
disposal?<br/>

We posted our preference in the database for that reason.  Maybe other folks have had different experiences.<br/>
