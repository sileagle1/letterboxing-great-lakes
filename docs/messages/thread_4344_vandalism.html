I just replaced my Lake Erie box this weekend, and I don't know if it had been stolen or somehow lost (flood? animal?  park ranger?  who knows...), but I was thinking that from now on I'm going to make my clues a little harder (cryptograms, for example) because I don't think the people who like to vandalize letterboxes really want to work that hard at it!  So if the Lake Erie box goes missing yet again, it's going in a new spot with some tough clues (I don't think the thieves will bother and my letterboxing friends will get a nice mental workout!)  My $.02!<br>

Hi guys, just wanted to give you a heads up. I released a HH in the <br>
Cleveland, OH area and couldn't find the info on it. Subsequently <br>
the owner contacted me and made a request to add info to the HH. See <br>
below:<br>
<br>
BarefootLucy here - SJZ's mom (maker of the HH Jolly). You can log <br>
Jolly as shown below. It's listed under my name. I realized when you <br>
emailed that I had not listed it on LBNA, but it's there now. Would <br>
you mind writing my email address on the cover? Although SJZ is <br>
still letterboxing, she doesn't read the boards and has an agent <br>
(me) to maintain her clues.<br>
<br>
SJZ will be glad to hear you found it. Since turning Jolly loose on <br>
the world, she has ventured out into the world and found herself a <br>
great guy, and as I type this, she is two days overdue with her <br>
first child, so she has a bad case of the summertime no-baby-yet <br>
blues!<br>

I just saw that my local college is offering a course in Geocaching! <br>
Here's the blurb to describe the class: <br>
<br>
8/11/2007 - If You Hide It, They Will Come...Geocaching for the Whole <br>
Family! <br>
Geocaching is the latest outdoor activity that combines Global <br>
Positioning System (GPS) technology and the thrill of treasure <br>
hunting. Learn to program and operate a basic hand-held GPS unit. <br>
Once teams grasp the basics it's off to the great outdoors for <br>
practice and a bit of friendly competition. Teams will run a course <br>
searching for caches along the way and solving clues to guide them. <br>
Then go the distance as the course is also a timed race against other <br>
teams for a grand prize. Fee: $49 per team of up to six people. <br>
Limited to 13 teams. Course is held at the Boy Scouts of America Camp <br>
Indian Trails on North River Road in Janesville. <br>
<br>
I am just curious as about the placers of these geocaches. I <br>
understand that nothing is homemade in them, but these people still <br>
have to take the time to hide the box and place the items in it. <br>
Aren't they worried about their boxes being ruined, just as <br>
letterboxers are? <br>
Let's just hope the next class to be offered isn't "Letterboxing <br>
races for the family" :-P<br>

I would hazard a guess that since the course is being held at the Boy Scouts<br>
of America Camp at a particular location, the caches are being made and<br>
hidden specifically for the event, specifically for "the race".<br>
<br>
But hopefully, they're careful about stressing responsibility when<br>
geocaching out there in the big wide world when the cachers are no longer on<br>
that particular course.<br>

My brother-in-law is a Boy Scout leader. We were talking about <br>
letterboxing and geocaching a few weeks ago. Apparently many Boy Scout <br>
camps have their own geocaches on camp property and the scouts <br>
participate while at camp. I doubt that these Boy Scout geocaches are <br>
listed on public sites so the situation probably isn't comparable.<br>
<br>
On the positive side, it sounds like a great way to get people involved <br>
and learn proper techniques (before they go out in the wild).<br>

Wow, I didn't know that on AQ you could restrict people looking at <br>
your clues by the amout of finds a person has. Good to know. May be I <br>
should log my finds. I just log my finds on LBNA. How do you log finds <br>
that you find at a Gathering?<br>

4a. Trip Report--Alaska <br>
Posted by: "cdem_ltrbox" wp4@sbcglobal.net   cdem_ltrbox <br>
Mon Aug 6, 2007 8:38 am (PST) <br>
Just got back from a wonderful 2 weeks in Alaskabeautiful weather, <br>
gorgeous scenery! Lots of wildlifebut not enough birds. I was <br>
hoping to see 50 species so I could qualify for a "Wings over Alaska" <br>
certificate, but I came up a few short. But I did add 15 birds to my <br>
life list, so that was really good! We did manage to do some <br>
letterboxing in the midst of all of our other activities (biking, <br>
museums, kayaking, shopping, hiking, sight-seeing, mile-long zip <br>
line.). <br>
<br>
It seems like everyone talks about seeing the "Big Five"bear, moose, <br>
caribou, wolf, Dall sheep (we saw everything but wolf). But we also <br>
had some other critters we wanted to see. We decided to do a <br>
letterbox series on the OTHER big five: sled dog, eagle, musk ox, <br>
salmon, whale (and we did see all of these). I think we managed to <br>
put them in some interesting or scenic places, but weren't able to <br>
place them on a long hike. We did 3+ hours of hiking in Denali, but <br>
that was off-limits since it is a national park. Plus, there are no <br>
trailsyou just goso that would have made clues rather difficult.<br>
<br>
We flew into Anchorage and rented a car for a week. While we were <br>
there, we met Alaska Homeschoolmommy and her family for ice cream. <br>
We've never met up with boxers while on vacation so that was nice. <br>
On our way out of town, we tried to find a park with a series of <br>
boxes. Unfortunately, the clues didn't give the name of a parkjust <br>
said it was near something. We found the something, but couldn't <br>
find the park. Oh well. We did find the Thunderbird Falls box at a <br>
waterfall on the outskirts of Anchorage. Then on to Wasilla, where <br>
we left the Sled Dog box near the Iditarod Museum/HQ. On our way to <br>
Fairbanks, we stopped at Hurricane Gulch (gorgeous view) and <br>
spontaneously decided to leave the Bald Eagle box there. But the box <br>
wasn't put together yet. So I stood at the car with the trunk open, <br>
putting the box together and stamping the image into our logbooks <br>
while the rest of the family scouted out a hiding place.<br>
<br>
Left our next 2 boxes at Bird SanctuariesI love being able to <br>
combine 2 hobbies. We left the Musk Ox box in Fairbanks (they have a <br>
herd at the university there). Hoped to find a brand-new series in <br>
Fairbanks, but the rain came at just the wrong time for that. As we <br>
were leaving Fairbanks, we stopped to see a section of the Alaska <br>
pipeline. At the display, they showed a device called a pig that is <br>
used to clean out the pipeline. Right next to this metal pig, they <br>
had a little statue of a dancing pigso we weren't the only waltzing <br>
pigs in Alaska. Then back to Anchorage, where we left the Salmon <br>
box. We were able to find a few of Alaska HSM's boxesplaced during <br>
a Midnight Sun gatheringwhile we were there. We got to the first <br>
box and were looking through the logbook and saw the Doglvers stamp. <br>
We were thinking "Wow, they must be up in Alaska this summer too". <br>
Then we realized that Alaska HSM had launched a postal out into the <br>
wild, but just kept using the logbook from the postal. So we weren't <br>
surprised when we saw P. Granola in the next box. <br>
<br>
Then it was on to our cruise. We placed the whale letterbox at Icy <br>
Strait Pointour first port call and a good place to spot whales. <br>
There was a nice little trail through the cedars. Actually, this <br>
would have been letterboxing heaven. I have never seen so many <br>
uprooted trees and stumps in such quantity. We were able to find the <br>
one and only letterbox in 2 other port callsone in Skagway and one <br>
at a totem pole park in Ketchikan. Now it is back to home and I need <br>
to find the time to plant the 2 Underground RR/Quilt boxes that I <br>
have all ready to go. <br>

What a fun trip... WOW a mile long zip line! I have been wanting to <br>
go on a zip line for a few months now but no one else in my family <br>
will go with me so I'm waiting until my 3 year old is old enough to <br>
go with me, she would go now if it were allowed. When I go on <br>
vacation I drag my family with me to find boxes and I'm so worried <br>
they are sick of it already. anyway I'm planing another trip next <br>
weekend with about 15 boxes within walking distance. not as big of a <br>
trip as yours, but I hope I have as much luck as you did.<br>

Thanks for posting the details of your wonderful trip! I made my first (and <br>
hopefully not only trip) to Alaska in May. Ours was an Inside Passage/Glacier <br>
Bay cruise, so I didn't get to experience the beauty of inland Alaska. I <br>
hope to make that my next trip! I, too, found the letterbox in Skagway. That's <br>
the only one I could fit in. <br>
<br>
Many of you are probably already aware that you can collect the National <br>
Parks Passport cancellation stamps at national parks, monuments, trails, etc. <br>
Most of the stamps look like postage cancellation images, with the name of the <br>
site on the stamp, along with the current date. On my Alaska trip, I did seek <br>
out some of the national park stamps. I was surprised that most of the ones I <br>
found had images that differed from the traditional cancellation. For <br>
instance, Misty Fiords in Ketchikan has an image in the shape of a shield, and within <br>
the shield outline is a very nice rendering of a bald eagle flying over the <br>
water. The Tongass National Forest image has a totem pole, a bear with a <br>
salmon it its mouth, and mountains. Because you cruise the waters of Glacier Bay <br>
when you visit, the park ranger who boards your cruise ship brings the stamp <br>
with them when they come on board. (You do have to locate the ranger on a large <br>
cruise ship - is that similar enough to letterboxing to call it a find? <G>) <br>
It's an image of a whale surfacing the water with the glaciers in the <br>
background. And the Klondike Gold Rush NHP in Skagway has an extra commemorative <br>
centennial stamp that shows the silhouettes of gold miners hiking up the steep <br>
mountain pass, carrying their heavy equipment loads on their backs. In <br>
addition to stamping my parks passport, I made extra images on blank pages in my <br>
journal so I can use them for cards, scrapbooking, etc.<br>
<br>
I know these National Park passport stamps aren't the same as finding a <br>
letterbox, but for me it's still fun to collect them. And the unusual ones I found <br>
on my Alaska trip makes them even more special as mementos of the trip.<br>
<br>
Glad you had such a great time in AK. Now I'm ready to start planning the <br>
next visit there, and it will include letterboxes, of course!<br>

salmon, whale (and we did see all of these). I think we managed to <br>
put them in some interesting or scenic places, but weren't able to <br>
place them on a long hike. We did 3+ hours of hiking in Denali, but <br>
that was off-limits since it is a national park. Plus, there are no <br>
trails-you just go-so that would have made clues rather difficult.<br>
<br>
We flew into Anchorage and rented a car for a week. While we were <br>
there, we met Alaska Homeschoolmommy and her family for ice cream. <br>
We've never met up with boxers while on vacation so that was nice. <br>
On our way out of town, we tried to find a park with a series of <br>
boxes. Unfortunately, the clues didn't give the name of a park-just <br>
said it was near something. We found the something, but couldn't <br>
find the park. Oh well. We did find the Thunderbird Falls box at a <br>
waterfall on the outskirts of Anchorage. Then on to Wasilla, where <br>
we left the Sled Dog box near the Iditarod Museum/HQ. On our way to <br>
Fairbanks, we stopped at Hurricane Gulch (gorgeous view) and <br>
spontaneously decided to leave the Bald Eagle box there. But the box <br>
wasn't put together yet. So I stood at the car with the trunk open, <br>
putting the box together and stamping the image into our logbooks <br>
while the rest of the family scouted out a hiding place.<br>
<br>
Left our next 2 boxes at Bird Sanctuaries-I love being able to <br>
combine 2 hobbies. We left the Musk Ox box in Fairbanks (they have a <br>
herd at the university there). Hoped to find a brand-new series in <br>
Fairbanks, but the rain came at just the wrong time for that. As we <br>
were leaving Fairbanks, we stopped to see a section of the Alaska <br>
pipeline. At the display, they showed a device called a pig that is <br>
used to clean out the pipeline. Right next to this metal pig, they <br>
had a little statue of a dancing pig-so we weren't the only waltzing <br>
pigs in Alaska. Then back to Anchorage, where we left the Salmon <br>
box. We were able to find a few of Alaska HSM's boxes-placed during <br>
a Midnight Sun gathering-while we were there. We got to the first <br>
box and were looking through the logbook and saw the Doglvers stamp. <br>
We were thinking "Wow, they must be up in Alaska this summer too". <br>
Then we realized that Alaska HSM had launched a postal out into the <br>
wild, but just kept using the logbook from the postal. So we weren't <br>
surprised when we saw P. Granola in the next box. <br>
<br>
Then it was on to our cruise. We placed the whale letterbox at Icy <br>
Strait Point-our first port call and a good place to spot whales. <br>
There was a nice little trail through the cedars. Actually, this <br>
would have been letterboxing heaven. I have never seen so many <br>
uprooted trees and stumps in such quantity. We were able to find the <br>
one and only letterbox in 2 other port calls-one in Skagway and one <br>
at a totem pole park in Ketchikan. Now it is back to home and I need <br>
to find the time to plant the 2 Underground RR/Quilt boxes that I <br>
have all ready to go. <br>

Wow - sounds like a great trip! Perhaps we'll get up there someday to <br>
find your boxes and see the sights ourselves. An Alaska trip is <br>
definitely on our "must do" list.<br>

P.S. Martini Man remembered you had a planted some boxes in FL, so we <br>
thought you might be the only boxers who have placed in the opposite <br>
ends of the North American continent. (I was originally going to say <br>
the northern-most and southern-most states, but when I checked I see <br>
that Hawaii is further south. Another trip idea for you????)<br>

I am board right now so I was looking back at the five boxes I have <br>
been unable to find and learned that 4 of them have been <br>
repaired/replaced or clues revised since I was there and the 5th the <br>
owner said right here that it was in need of repaired.. Woohoo that <br>
means I'm really not just missing them they might have been missing! <br>
bad for the owner but makes me feel better about my ability to <br>
letterbox as a newby... Anyway it looks like the Lake Erie box was <br>
replaced on Saturday. I'll be going out there on Sunday to look for it <br>
if it's a nice day for swimming.<br>

I realize this is old news but dang-it, This last box was my next box <br>
I was going to go to, Was just waiting for it to cool off to take my <br>
bike out on the trails. now I'll be riding by thinking man I shoudl <br>
have come out here when it was to hot. Sorry for you loss, I hope you <br>
don't totally give up on planting and after a break you decide to <br>
plant in your hometown again.<br>
<br>
I am new to this and at first was thinking about all the really <br>
special places in my hometown I wanted to plant boxes. I was told to <br>
wait a while before I started planting and so I did and started <br>
thinking "no I don't want to cause it could get lost". but after <br>
reading this thread I have decided it's better to go ahead and take <br>
the risk to plant them cause it will be enjoyed by so many. One <br>
person can mess it up, but think about how MANY have really enjoyed <br>
it (including yourself when you planted it) Thanks for showing this <br>
to me and I hope you can find it in yourself to try again in a few <br>
months.<br>

Didn't mean to open a can of worms regarding the option to limit clues <br>
by found counts, as I said in an earlier post, I don't think the answer <br>
is to have all clues restricted in some way. Just wanted to point out <br>
one option that may (or may not) discourage some less scrupulous <br>
hunters. As some LBers have pointed out, I think a variety of LB <br>
options is great - the easier ones will appeal to beginners and those <br>
limited for other reasons (physical ability, children, etc), the more <br>
challenging ones will appeal to another set and some to both. That's <br>
part of what makes it so appealing.<br>

Blue Sky,<br>
I sit and read the chat, but there is no need to feel like you opened any cn of worms. People just express their opinions and sometimes the opinions come with fears and concerns about recently missing or damaged boxes. <br>
I was hoping to place a dozen new letterboxes this spring, a lofty goal but I'm rethinking that total. I am realizing that the placement of a box is a major factor in the life of that box. Easy to blame others or other factors, but I'm taking my time and thinking more about placements now. <br>
<br>
Around Thanksgiving and through December till shortly after Jan. 1 (weather permitting) I have been placing a series of 12 easy boxes for beginners, especially families with children. And...those boxes have all survived for 2 years...and will reappear again. <br>
<br>
So my thoughts are this....we need a variety of boxes for beginners and more challenging ones too. I never labor over a stamp if the location doesn't justify the placement. Just food for thought for all of us. <br>
<br>
Hot day today. Good day to sit inside where it's cool and create some boxes. <br>

Usually the gathering event planners will post the boxes as event boxes rather than traditional boxes. You can always ask around at a gathering. "FIND" counts aren't necessary; some people count and some don't. Just have fun. I once thought that clues with a find count minimum was the way to go to restrict newbies, but I've rethought that idea. Boxes need to be challenging and the placement needs to be more carefully thought out. Then, there still needs to be some fast and easy boxes for beginners, or experienced letterboxers who just 'need' a quick fix....so to speak. LOL! <br>
<br>

Wow, I didn't know that on AQ you could restrict people looking at <br>
your clues by the amout of finds a person has. Good to know. May be I <br>
should log my finds. I just log my finds on LBNA. How do you log finds <br>
that you find at a Gathering?<br>

10. National Park question <br>
Posted by: "Althea Gill" althea_gill@yahoo.com   althea_gill <br>
Mon Aug 6, 2007 2:19 pm (PST) <br>
Hi all! I've had a series planted in a local National Park (I actually <br>
thought it was a Metropark at the time). One of the boxes was <br>
confiscated so I yanked the last three. <br>
<br>
A cranky Ranger left me a message and we've talked. I gave him my name <br>
and he said I can pick up my box, but that he needs a copy of my <br>
drivers license! Is this normal; has anyone else had this happen.<br>
<br>
Advice? Thanks, Travel'n Turtle<br>

Since my carvings are rudimentry to say the least I haven't done this as yet. I have in FL however had two of the boxes I placed completely disappear. Animals? Humans? Who knows.<br>
<br>
Those who are limiting their boxes are doing so by choice...remember we don't have particular rules so they CAN. <br>
<br>
If it makes them available longer, I would be all for it. Granny<br>

12a. Geocaching on Scout Facilities (was Re: [LbGLK] Geocaching class) <br>

I'm a boy scout leader myself, and our camp here in Texas has some caches,<br>
but they aren't listed publicly because they aren't publicly accessible. In<br>
fact, getting approval to place them was difficult because the Scout<br>
Executive was very concerned that GC'ers would come on camp without<br>
permission to try to find them and that would have been unacceptable from a<br>
safety standpoint for the boys.<br>
<br>
But here's what I wonder, and I've never gotten a good answer - why WOULD<br>
scouts choose geocaching over letterboxing? I've geocached a little myself<br>
in addition to letterboxing, and in my opinion letterboxing does a much<br>
better job of teaching valued outdoor skills like orienteering, compass<br>
reading, field recognition, and landmark navigation. Always been curious...<br>

That is an excellent question! I'm not sure why they would choose <br>
geocaching over letterboxing. I know the Girl Scouts really seem to <br>
be picking up letterboxing though. I see that a few troops have <br>
placed boxes in my general area. <br>
I agree. I think it's a wonderful way for the kids to learn about the <br>
outdoors. A great way for them to be able to identify poison ivy <br>
too : ) I wish I would have known about this hobby when I was a Girl <br>
Scout leader. I definitely would have exposed my troop to it. <br>

That brings up a good question: why geocaching and not letterboxing? I guess geocachers prefer their hobby and we prefer letterboxing. Seldom do you meet someone who does both; like Cinemaboxers. But GS camps usually stress 'stay on the trails,' so I'm not sure why either. I think the clue writing would be part of the activity fun. Also, the GPS units cost money and to give only one unit to a group isn't much fun if there is a large troop and the others just tag along and wonder about till one or two people sharing the GPS unit pin point the location and find the box. I've seen groups trampling an area marching around through all sorts of wild flowers and poison ivy too, with only one goal....find the box. <br>
<br>
As a letterboxer first who has tried both hobbies, I guess I feel that letterboxing is more environmentally friendly...and we should keep that in mind when placing boxes. <br>
<br>
The Chicago council is discussion plans for a geocaching program. Whatever?<br>

13. Series Completion <br>
Posted by: "beckers410" Mathw613@aol.com   beckers410 <br>
Mon Aug 6, 2007 6:59 pm (PST) <br>
After placing my first stamp in this series on April 24th and dragging <br>
my heels and what-not I've finally planted the last two stamps in the <br>
Channel Cat series!!<br>
<br>
Posted on both AQ and LBNA for your enjoyment.<br>
<br>
If you just find my Channel Cat series (in its entirety) you will find <br>
9 stamps. If you find the boxes within walking distance from other <br>
letterboxers you will find another 6 more stamps and if you bring your <br>
bike you will find another 2 boxes.<br>
<br>
So you will enjoy the Quad Cities from the Mississippi River. You will <br>
stop in 5 cities and possibly find 17 boxes!! Sounds like fun (I just <br>
had someone from New Mexico find all but the two I planted today and <br>
got great feedback).<br>
<br>
Also, you can get to all of them by car in the off season, however, I <br>
plan on pulling the one from the Channel Cat itself by Labor Day.<br>

Hello all,<br>
<br>
I just replaced my Lake Erie box this weekend, and I don't know if it had been stolen or somehow lost (flood? animal?  park ranger?  who knows...), but I was thinking that from now on I'm going to make my clues a little harder (cryptograms, for example) because I don't think the people who like to vandalize letterboxes really want to work that hard at it!  So if the Lake Erie box goes missing yet again, it's going in a new spot with some tough clues (I don't think the thieves will bother and my letterboxing friends will get a nice mental workout!)  My $.02!<br>

Hi guys, just wanted to give you a heads up. I released a HH in the <br>
Cleveland, OH area and couldn't find the info on it. Subsequently <br>
the owner contacted me and made a request to add info to the HH. See <br>
below:<br>
<br>
BarefootLucy here - SJZ's mom (maker of the HH Jolly). You can log <br>
Jolly as shown below. It's listed under my name. I realized when you <br>
emailed that I had not listed it on LBNA, but it's there now. Would <br>
you mind writing my email address on the cover? Although SJZ is <br>
still letterboxing, she doesn't read the boards and has an agent <br>
(me) to maintain her clues.<br>
<br>
SJZ will be glad to hear you found it. Since turning Jolly loose on <br>
the world, she has ventured out into the world and found herself a <br>
great guy, and as I type this, she is two days overdue with her <br>
first child, so she has a bad case of the summertime no-baby-yet <br>
blues!<br>

I just saw that my local college is offering a course in Geocaching! <br>
Here's the blurb to describe the class: <br>
<br>
8/11/2007 - If You Hide It, They Will Come...Geocaching for the Whole <br>
Family! <br>
Geocaching is the latest outdoor activity that combines Global <br>
Positioning System (GPS) technology and the thrill of treasure <br>
hunting. Learn to program and operate a basic hand-held GPS unit. <br>
Once teams grasp the basics it's off to the great outdoors for <br>
practice and a bit of friendly competition. Teams will run a course <br>
searching for caches along the way and solving clues to guide them. <br>
Then go the distance as the course is also a timed race against other <br>
teams for a grand prize. Fee: $49 per team of up to six people. <br>
Limited to 13 teams. Course is held at the Boy Scouts of America Camp <br>
Indian Trails on North River Road in Janesville. <br>
<br>
I am just curious as about the placers of these geocaches. I <br>
understand that nothing is homemade in them, but these people still <br>
have to take the time to hide the box and place the items in it. <br>
Aren't they worried about their boxes being ruined, just as <br>
letterboxers are? <br>
Let's just hope the next class to be offered isn't "Letterboxing <br>
races for the family" :-P<br>

I would hazard a guess that since the course is being held at the Boy Scouts<br>
of America Camp at a particular location, the caches are being made and<br>
hidden specifically for the event, specifically for "the race".<br>
<br>
But hopefully, they're careful about stressing responsibility when<br>
geocaching out there in the big wide world when the cachers are no longer on<br>
that particular course.<br>

My brother-in-law is a Boy Scout leader. We were talking about <br>
letterboxing and geocaching a few weeks ago. Apparently many Boy Scout <br>
camps have their own geocaches on camp property and the scouts <br>
participate while at camp. I doubt that these Boy Scout geocaches are <br>
listed on public sites so the situation probably isn't comparable.<br>
<br>
On the positive side, it sounds like a great way to get people involved <br>
and learn proper techniques (before they go out in the wild).<br>

Wow, I didn't know that on AQ you could restrict people looking at <br>
your clues by the amout of finds a person has. Good to know. May be I <br>
should log my finds. I just log my finds on LBNA. How do you log finds <br>
that you find at a Gathering?<br>

4a. Trip Report--Alaska <br>
Posted by: "cdem_ltrbox" wp4@sbcglobal.net   cdem_ltrbox <br>
Mon Aug 6, 2007 8:38 am (PST) <br>
Just got back from a wonderful 2 weeks in Alaskabeautiful weather, <br>
gorgeous scenery! Lots of wildlifebut not enough birds. I was <br>
hoping to see 50 species so I could qualify for a "Wings over Alaska" <br>
certificate, but I came up a few short. But I did add 15 birds to my <br>
life list, so that was really good! We did manage to do some <br>
letterboxing in the midst of all of our other activities (biking, <br>
museums, kayaking, shopping, hiking, sight-seeing, mile-long zip <br>
line.). <br>
<br>
It seems like everyone talks about seeing the "Big Five"bear, moose, <br>
caribou, wolf, Dall sheep (we saw everything but wolf). But we also <br>
had some other critters we wanted to see. We decided to do a <br>
letterbox series on the OTHER big five: sled dog, eagle, musk ox, <br>
salmon, whale (and we did see all of these). I think we managed to <br>
put them in some interesting or scenic places, but weren't able to <br>
place them on a long hike. We did 3+ hours of hiking in Denali, but <br>
that was off-limits since it is a national park. Plus, there are no <br>
trailsyou just goso that would have made clues rather difficult.<br>
<br>
We flew into Anchorage and rented a car for a week. While we were <br>
there, we met Alaska Homeschoolmommy and her family for ice cream. <br>
We've never met up with boxers while on vacation so that was nice. <br>
On our way out of town, we tried to find a park with a series of <br>
boxes. Unfortunately, the clues didn't give the name of a parkjust <br>
said it was near something. We found the something, but couldn't <br>
find the park. Oh well. We did find the Thunderbird Falls box at a <br>
waterfall on the outskirts of Anchorage. Then on to Wasilla, where <br>
we left the Sled Dog box near the Iditarod Museum/HQ. On our way to <br>
Fairbanks, we stopped at Hurricane Gulch (gorgeous view) and <br>
spontaneously decided to leave the Bald Eagle box there. But the box <br>
wasn't put together yet. So I stood at the car with the trunk open, <br>
putting the box together and stamping the image into our logbooks <br>
while the rest of the family scouted out a hiding place.<br>
<br>
Left our next 2 boxes at Bird SanctuariesI love being able to <br>
combine 2 hobbies. We left the Musk Ox box in Fairbanks (they have a <br>
herd at the university there). Hoped to find a brand-new series in <br>
Fairbanks, but the rain came at just the wrong time for that. As we <br>
were leaving Fairbanks, we stopped to see a section of the Alaska <br>
pipeline. At the display, they showed a device called a pig that is <br>
used to clean out the pipeline. Right next to this metal pig, they <br>
had a little statue of a dancing pigso we weren't the only waltzing <br>
pigs in Alaska. Then back to Anchorage, where we left the Salmon <br>
box. We were able to find a few of Alaska HSM's boxesplaced during <br>
a Midnight Sun gatheringwhile we were there. We got to the first <br>
box and were looking through the logbook and saw the Doglvers stamp. <br>
We were thinking "Wow, they must be up in Alaska this summer too". <br>
Then we realized that Alaska HSM had launched a postal out into the <br>
wild, but just kept using the logbook from the postal. So we weren't <br>
surprised when we saw P. Granola in the next box. <br>
<br>
Then it was on to our cruise. We placed the whale letterbox at Icy <br>
Strait Pointour first port call and a good place to spot whales. <br>
There was a nice little trail through the cedars. Actually, this <br>
would have been letterboxing heaven. I have never seen so many <br>
uprooted trees and stumps in such quantity. We were able to find the <br>
one and only letterbox in 2 other port callsone in Skagway and one <br>
at a totem pole park in Ketchikan. Now it is back to home and I need <br>
to find the time to plant the 2 Underground RR/Quilt boxes that I <br>
have all ready to go. <br>

What a fun trip... WOW a mile long zip line! I have been wanting to <br>
go on a zip line for a few months now but no one else in my family <br>
will go with me so I'm waiting until my 3 year old is old enough to <br>
go with me, she would go now if it were allowed. When I go on <br>
vacation I drag my family with me to find boxes and I'm so worried <br>
they are sick of it already. anyway I'm planing another trip next <br>
weekend with about 15 boxes within walking distance. not as big of a <br>
trip as yours, but I hope I have as much luck as you did.<br>

Thanks for posting the details of your wonderful trip! I made my first (and <br>
hopefully not only trip) to Alaska in May. Ours was an Inside Passage/Glacier <br>
Bay cruise, so I didn't get to experience the beauty of inland Alaska. I <br>
hope to make that my next trip! I, too, found the letterbox in Skagway. That's <br>
the only one I could fit in. <br>
<br>
Many of you are probably already aware that you can collect the National <br>
Parks Passport cancellation stamps at national parks, monuments, trails, etc. <br>
Most of the stamps look like postage cancellation images, with the name of the <br>
site on the stamp, along with the current date. On my Alaska trip, I did seek <br>
out some of the national park stamps. I was surprised that most of the ones I <br>
found had images that differed from the traditional cancellation. For <br>
instance, Misty Fiords in Ketchikan has an image in the shape of a shield, and within <br>
the shield outline is a very nice rendering of a bald eagle flying over the <br>
water. The Tongass National Forest image has a totem pole, a bear with a <br>
salmon it its mouth, and mountains. Because you cruise the waters of Glacier Bay <br>
when you visit, the park ranger who boards your cruise ship brings the stamp <br>
with them when they come on board. (You do have to locate the ranger on a large <br>
cruise ship - is that similar enough to letterboxing to call it a find? <G>) <br>
It's an image of a whale surfacing the water with the glaciers in the <br>
background. And the Klondike Gold Rush NHP in Skagway has an extra commemorative <br>
centennial stamp that shows the silhouettes of gold miners hiking up the steep <br>
mountain pass, carrying their heavy equipment loads on their backs. In <br>
addition to stamping my parks passport, I made extra images on blank pages in my <br>
journal so I can use them for cards, scrapbooking, etc.<br>
<br>
I know these National Park passport stamps aren't the same as finding a <br>
letterbox, but for me it's still fun to collect them. And the unusual ones I found <br>
on my Alaska trip makes them even more special as mementos of the trip.<br>
<br>
Glad you had such a great time in AK. Now I'm ready to start planning the <br>
next visit there, and it will include letterboxes, of course!<br>

place them on a long hike. We did 3+ hours of hiking in Denali, but <br>
that was off-limits since it is a national park. Plus, there are no <br>
trails-you just go-so that would have made clues rather difficult.<br>
<br>
We flew into Anchorage and rented a car for a week. While we were <br>
there, we met Alaska Homeschoolmommy and her family for ice cream. <br>
We've never met up with boxers while on vacation so that was nice. <br>
On our way out of town, we tried to find a park with a series of <br>
boxes. Unfortunately, the clues didn't give the name of a park-just <br>
said it was near something. We found the something, but couldn't <br>
find the park. Oh well. We did find the Thunderbird Falls box at a <br>
waterfall on the outskirts of Anchorage. Then on to Wasilla, where <br>
we left the Sled Dog box near the Iditarod Museum/HQ. On our way to <br>
Fairbanks, we stopped at Hurricane Gulch (gorgeous view) and <br>
spontaneously decided to leave the Bald Eagle box there. But the box <br>
wasn't put together yet. So I stood at the car with the trunk open, <br>
putting the box together and stamping the image into our logbooks <br>
while the rest of the family scouted out a hiding place.<br>
<br>
Left our next 2 boxes at Bird Sanctuaries-I love being able to <br>
combine 2 hobbies. We left the Musk Ox box in Fairbanks (they have a <br>
herd at the university there). Hoped to find a brand-new series in <br>
Fairbanks, but the rain came at just the wrong time for that. As we <br>
were leaving Fairbanks, we stopped to see a section of the Alaska <br>
pipeline. At the display, they showed a device called a pig that is <br>
used to clean out the pipeline. Right next to this metal pig, they <br>
had a little statue of a dancing pig-so we weren't the only waltzing <br>
pigs in Alaska. Then back to Anchorage, where we left the Salmon <br>
box. We were able to find a few of Alaska HSM's boxes-placed during <br>
a Midnight Sun gathering-while we were there. We got to the first <br>
box and were looking through the logbook and saw the Doglvers stamp. <br>
We were thinking "Wow, they must be up in Alaska this summer too". <br>
Then we realized that Alaska HSM had launched a postal out into the <br>
wild, but just kept using the logbook from the postal. So we weren't <br>
surprised when we saw P. Granola in the next box. <br>
<br>
Then it was on to our cruise. We placed the whale letterbox at Icy <br>
Strait Point-our first port call and a good place to spot whales. <br>
There was a nice little trail through the cedars. Actually, this <br>
would have been letterboxing heaven. I have never seen so many <br>
uprooted trees and stumps in such quantity. We were able to find the <br>
one and only letterbox in 2 other port calls-one in Skagway and one <br>
at a totem pole park in Ketchikan. Now it is back to home and I need <br>
to find the time to plant the 2 Underground RR/Quilt boxes that I <br>
have all ready to go. <br>

Wow - sounds like a great trip! Perhaps we'll get up there someday to <br>
find your boxes and see the sights ourselves. An Alaska trip is <br>
definitely on our "must do" list.<br>

P.S. Martini Man remembered you had a planted some boxes in FL, so we <br>
thought you might be the only boxers who have placed in the opposite <br>
ends of the North American continent. (I was originally going to say <br>
the northern-most and southern-most states, but when I checked I see <br>
that Hawaii is further south. Another trip idea for you????)<br>

I am board right now so I was looking back at the five boxes I have <br>
been unable to find and learned that 4 of them have been <br>
repaired/replaced or clues revised since I was there and the 5th the <br>
owner said right here that it was in need of repaired.. Woohoo that <br>
means I'm really not just missing them they might have been missing! <br>
bad for the owner but makes me feel better about my ability to <br>
letterbox as a newby... Anyway it looks like the Lake Erie box was <br>
replaced on Saturday. I'll be going out there on Sunday to look for it <br>
if it's a nice day for swimming.<br>

I realize this is old news but dang-it, This last box was my next box <br>
I was going to go to, Was just waiting for it to cool off to take my <br>
bike out on the trails. now I'll be riding by thinking man I shoudl <br>
have come out here when it was to hot. Sorry for you loss, I hope you <br>
don't totally give up on planting and after a break you decide to <br>
plant in your hometown again.<br>
<br>
I am new to this and at first was thinking about all the really <br>
special places in my hometown I wanted to plant boxes. I was told to <br>
wait a while before I started planting and so I did and started <br>
thinking "no I don't want to cause it could get lost". but after <br>
reading this thread I have decided it's better to go ahead and take <br>
the risk to plant them cause it will be enjoyed by so many. One <br>
person can mess it up, but think about how MANY have really enjoyed <br>
it (including yourself when you planted it) Thanks for showing this <br>
to me and I hope you can find it in yourself to try again in a few <br>
months.<br>

Didn't mean to open a can of worms regarding the option to limit clues <br>
by found counts, as I said in an earlier post, I don't think the answer <br>
is to have all clues restricted in some way. Just wanted to point out <br>
one option that may (or may not) discourage some less scrupulous <br>
hunters. As some LBers have pointed out, I think a variety of LB <br>
options is great - the easier ones will appeal to beginners and those <br>
limited for other reasons (physical ability, children, etc), the more <br>
challenging ones will appeal to another set and some to both. That's <br>
part of what makes it so appealing.<br>

Blue Sky,<br>
I sit and read the chat, but there is no need to feel like you opened any cn of worms. People just express their opinions and sometimes the opinions come with fears and concerns about recently missing or damaged boxes. <br>
I was hoping to place a dozen new letterboxes this spring, a lofty goal but I'm rethinking that total. I am realizing that the placement of a box is a major factor in the life of that box. Easy to blame others or other factors, but I'm taking my time and thinking more about placements now. <br>
<br>
Around Thanksgiving and through December till shortly after Jan. 1 (weather permitting) I have been placing a series of 12 easy boxes for beginners, especially families with children. And...those boxes have all survived for 2 years...and will reappear again. <br>
<br>
So my thoughts are this....we need a variety of boxes for beginners and more challenging ones too. I never labor over a stamp if the location doesn't justify the placement. Just food for thought for all of us. <br>
<br>
Hot day today. Good day to sit inside where it's cool and create some boxes. <br>

Usually the gathering event planners will post the boxes as event boxes rather than traditional boxes. You can always ask around at a gathering. "FIND" counts aren't necessary; some people count and some don't. Just have fun. I once thought that clues with a find count minimum was the way to go to restrict newbies, but I've rethought that idea. Boxes need to be challenging and the placement needs to be more carefully thought out. Then, there still needs to be some fast and easy boxes for beginners, or experienced letterboxers who just 'need' a quick fix....so to speak. LOL! <br>

Wow, I didn't know that on AQ you could restrict people looking at <br>
your clues by the amout of finds a person has. Good to know. May be I <br>
should log my finds. I just log my finds on LBNA. How do you log finds <br>
that you find at a Gathering?<br>

10. National Park question <br>
Posted by: "Althea Gill" althea_gill@yahoo.com   althea_gill <br>
Mon Aug 6, 2007 2:19 pm (PST) <br>
Hi all! I've had a series planted in a local National Park (I actually <br>
thought it was a Metropark at the time). One of the boxes was <br>
confiscated so I yanked the last three. <br>
<br>
A cranky Ranger left me a message and we've talked. I gave him my name <br>
and he said I can pick up my box, but that he needs a copy of my <br>
drivers license! Is this normal; has anyone else had this happen.<br>
<br>
Advice? Thanks, Travel'n Turtle<br>

Since my carvings are rudimentry to say the least I haven't done this as yet. I have in FL however had two of the boxes I placed completely disappear. Animals? Humans? Who knows.<br>
<br>
Those who are limiting their boxes are doing so by choice...remember we don't have particular rules so they CAN. <br>
<br>
If it makes them available longer, I would be all for it. Granny<br>

12a. Geocaching on Scout Facilities (was Re: [LbGLK] Geocaching class) <br>

I'm a boy scout leader myself, and our camp here in Texas has some caches,<br>
but they aren't listed publicly because they aren't publicly accessible. In<br>
fact, getting approval to place them was difficult because the Scout<br>
Executive was very concerned that GC'ers would come on camp without<br>
permission to try to find them and that would have been unacceptable from a<br>
safety standpoint for the boys.<br>
<br>
But here's what I wonder, and I've never gotten a good answer - why WOULD<br>
scouts choose geocaching over letterboxing? I've geocached a little myself<br>
in addition to letterboxing, and in my opinion letterboxing does a much<br>
better job of teaching valued outdoor skills like orienteering, compass<br>
reading, field recognition, and landmark navigation. Always been curious...<br>

That is an excellent question! I'm not sure why they would choose <br>
geocaching over letterboxing. I know the Girl Scouts really seem to <br>
be picking up letterboxing though. I see that a few troops have <br>
placed boxes in my general area. <br>
I agree. I think it's a wonderful way for the kids to learn about the <br>
outdoors. A great way for them to be able to identify poison ivy <br>
too : ) I wish I would have known about this hobby when I was a Girl <br>
Scout leader. I definitely would have exposed my troop to it. <br>

That brings up a good question: why geocaching and not letterboxing? I guess geocachers prefer their hobby and we prefer letterboxing. Seldom do you meet someone who does both; like Cinemaboxers. But GS camps usually stress 'stay on the trails,' so I'm not sure why either. I think the clue writing would be part of the activity fun. Also, the GPS units cost money and to give only one unit to a group isn't much fun if there is a large troop and the others just tag along and wonder about till one or two people sharing the GPS unit pin point the location and find the box. I've seen groups trampling an area marching around through all sorts of wild flowers and poison ivy too, with only one goal....find the box. <br>
<br>
As a letterboxer first who has tried both hobbies, I guess I feel that letterboxing is more environmentally friendly...and we should keep that in mind when placing boxes. <br>
<br>
The Chicago council is discussion plans for a geocaching program. Whatever?<br>

13. Series Completion <br>
Posted by: "beckers410" Mathw613@aol.com   beckers410 <br>
Mon Aug 6, 2007 6:59 pm (PST) <br>
After placing my first stamp in this series on April 24th and dragging <br>
my heels and what-not I've finally planted the last two stamps in the <br>
Channel Cat series!!<br>
<br>
Posted on both AQ and LBNA for your enjoyment.<br>
<br>
If you just find my Channel Cat series (in its entirety) you will find <br>
9 stamps. If you find the boxes within walking distance from other <br>
letterboxers you will find another 6 more stamps and if you bring your <br>
bike you will find another 2 boxes.<br>
<br>
So you will enjoy the Quad Cities from the Mississippi River. You will <br>
stop in 5 cities and possibly find 17 boxes!! Sounds like fun (I just <br>
had someone from New Mexico find all but the two I planted today and <br>
got great feedback).<br>
<br>
Also, you can get to all of them by car in the off season, however, I <br>
plan on pulling the one from the Channel Cat itself by Labor Day.<br>

For those of you not keeping track, we lost a local letterboxer <br>
(GooseChaser) to a motorcycle accident about a year ago. We adopted <br>
her boxes and through communication with other local boxers have <br>
been able to maintain them fairly well. One of the boxes went <br>
missing last November but due to Hartx6 it was recovered this fall! <br>
I thought the box, like it's placer, was gone forever. it was a near <br>
miracle for me to hear that it had been refound. <br>
<br>
Talking with her family, Hart6 replaced the box and wrote new clues <br>
to it's new location in the same park. He sent us the new clues <br>
(since we are the ones with the webpage access) and I went out to <br>
find the new spot. The logical part of my brain knew that I might <br>
need to answer questions from people who went to find it, but the <br>
emotional side of me just wanted to hold it in my hands again. <br>
<br>
When i got to the woods, i found the box had been destroyed. Most <br>
disturbingly, the logbook had been opened, read and comments left. <br>
Rude, ugly, profane comments. The pages where then torn out and <br>
sprinkled down the hillside. i never did find the stamp. I can't <br>
imagine what would make somebody do this.<br>
<br>
I am wondering now about the safety of our other local boxes. <br>
goosechasers boxes almost alway had an info sheet inside with the <br>
LBNA webpage, and a label on the outside of her box with the same <br>
web address. I didn't find either her info sheet or the lid. The <br>
base of the box had the webpage though. do you think these people <br>
will take the time to look for other boxes? <br>

If you fear for the safety of Goosechaser's other boxes, perhaps you could encrypt the clues of the boxes you've adopted?<br>

have the initiative to consciously look for a clues, follow them and <br>
then destroy the box.  Vandals seem to be very opportunistic.  I <br>
agree with the other posting about deterring them.  I've made my <br>
stolen boxes deeper in the woods with harder clues and... knock on <br>
wood, they've not been disturbed.<br>
<br>
Again, my condolences on your loss of your friend and the box.<br>
