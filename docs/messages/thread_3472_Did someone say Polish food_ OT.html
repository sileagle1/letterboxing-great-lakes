                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last week I had to do a photo essay as an assignment, and I looked on Google as <br>
instructed, and there were no decent pictures of a Polish buffet. Oh there were a few tiny <br>
pictures, but mostly of banquet halls. Nothing that really conveys the splendor of it all. So <br>
on Sunday my dear friend Wendy and I met up at Czerwone Jablusko, aka The Red Apple <br>
on Milwaukee Ave. in Chicago.<br>
<br>
http://redapplebuffet.com/<br>
<br>
It was her birthday, and also Koliada -- the Slavic heathen celebration of mid-winter <br>
[technically, koliada is Ukranian, and it's a whole cycle of winter rituals happening between <br>
winter solstice and mid-January]. As usual, I ate so much it was all the calories I would <br>
need for a month. I've gone there for Koliada before, but I never took pictures! So enjoy <br>
and I hope no one is hungry.<br>
<br>
It's a restaurant ...AND a laundromat<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/01RedApplesign.jpg<br>
<br>
This is not just the Polish eagle...it is done in latch hook of all things<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/02Polishflag.jpg<br>
<br>
We exchanged Christmas gifts and Wendy gave me a lovely handmade whisk broom she <br>
bought on a trip to Tennessee this fall. Just as a side note, as I was waiting to pay before <br>
we left, the funniest thing... the pretty blonde lady running the register admired the box <br>
my gift came in. I opened it up and showed her the whisk broom Wendy gave me. She <br>
picked up the broom to look at it and got a very wicked look on her face and started <br>
flicking it like a priest with holy water. "oh, you are exorcist?" she inquired in her heavy <br>
Polish accent. I started laughing and she just kept flicking the broom like she was blessing <br>
me. "this is for boyfriend" *flick flick* "if it start to burn, LEAVE" *flick flick* I laughed so <br>
hard I almost threw up all my lovely fried carbs.<br>
<br>
Right next to the cashier, perfect for those impulse pierogi purchases<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/03pierogiestogo.jpg<br>
<br>
Anyway.... after we opened our presents we still hadn't seen our waitress so we gave up on <br>
our first course, zupy* (soup), which is usually rosl (chicken noodle soup made with <br>
parsley) or grzybowa (creamy mushroom and noodle soup). That was ok though, there was <br>
plenty to eat. As we were walking to the buffet, I said our motto: "Time to eat The Starchy <br>
And Greasy Foods Of Our People." This Polish guy loading his plate at the buffet started <br>
laughing.<br>
<br>
This is just one of the three buffets loaded with food -- it goes around the corner and into <br>
the party room at the back<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/04buffet.jpg<br>
<br>
First, in Polish eating, there is the gelatinous course. Always need to have a gelatinous <br>
course. No one knows why.<br>
<br>
I have no idea, but I bet it is a part of some pig, because everything is pork-related here<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/07gelatinouscourse.jpg<br>
<br>
Thus we evolved The Traditional Polish Winkie, which is far more appetizing. They do not <br>
have winkie at The Red Apple, because if you haven't guessed, that's a sarcastic name for <br>
a jello salad our grandmothers and aunts always served, not an actual dish from Poland. <br>
However, the Red Apple does have other gelatinous, jello-related items.<br>
<br>
We must have The Red Gelatinous Mass Of Our People<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/06buffetfromsalads.jpg<br>
<br>
Except Polish jello is not slimy...it's CHEWY. You can cut it with a knife<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/07Wendyjellospoon.jpg<br>
<br>
If you would like to see how we try to eat The Red Gelatinous Mass<br>
http://www.veoh.com/videoDetails.html?v=e182774e2MMyzrn<br>
<br>
Then usually we move on to salatki na zimno -- the salad course. <br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/08saladcourse.jpg<br>
<br>
This time I was not a good Polish girl. The only vegetables I ate were a few plain <br>
cucumbers, and I forced those. No, this time I went directly to the GREASY FRIED CARBS!<br>
<br>
Time for the pierogi course<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/09pierogiecourse.jpg<br>
<br>
I love how the buffet has RED LIGHTS to make you feel like this is all so appetizing and <br>
warm... hot fried carbs! yum yum! I had  placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes), and <br>
racuszki (apple pancakes), nalesniki (cheese blintzes), all with apple sauce....<br>
<br>
And then dania gorace -- the hot dishes, and the meat course. If you want some kind of <br>
pig, a Polish buffet is the place to find it. They've got pig everything.... kapusta z kielbasa <br>
(sauerkraut and Polish sausage), papryka faszerowana pomaranczowym (baked ham, <br>
carved off the bone), cold ham slices, pork cutlets, pork this and pork that.<br>
<br>
pork pork pork pork....<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/10porkcourse.jpg<br>
<br>
Thank God the lady brought out MORE PORK because I was scared we would RUN OUT<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/10worker.jpg<br>
<br>
That big ham on the end was so delectable I swear I could cut it with my FORK. I had a <br>
ginourmous piece.<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/05buffetfromham.jpg<br>
<br>
Well sometimes they do have more than pig products. The other big piece of meat in the <br>
photo above is a giant roast beef. Since we arrived when they opened at 11:00 am, the <br>
meat was fresh out of the ovens. They also had ryba pieczona w sosie cytrynowo <br>
maslanym (baked fish in lemon butter sauce), and kaczka pieczona z jablkami (baked duck <br>
with apples). And to encourage some kind of vitamin and nutrient ingestion they also have <br>
jarzyny na goraco (hot veggies) -- ziemniaki (potatoes) of course, both gotowane (boiled, <br>
with dill) and pur, or mashed, zielona fasolka (green beans) and kukurydza (corn -- on <br>
the cob). Okay, wait, I did have some mashed potatoes. More starch! But at least it's not <br>
fried.<br>
<br>
And then they have the desserts...some fresh fruit to cut the grease...<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/11fruitsalad.jpg<br>
<br>
Like most of the dishes, the bowl of chopped up fruit had a label on it. The label said:<br>
<br>
Fruit Salad<br>
VEGETARIAN<br>
<br>
[just in case you were worried there was pork of some kind in it]<br>
<br>
So that was helpful.<br>
<br>
And then....kolacky time!<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/12deserts.jpg<br>
<br>
Notice under the kolacky, on the 2nd tier...what is that? More RED GELATINOUS MASS. <br>
That's right, here it is attached to cake. It's a salad AND a dessert.<br>
<br>
We finally got that gelatinous course down...<br>
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v80/mountaineer/Slavic/07Wendyjellosmile.jpg<br>
<br>
*(unfortunately the specialty characters are a mystery to me in this software, so some <br>
words will be missing their add on's)<br>
<br>
This is sad -- I am looking at these pics and now I want pierogis. AGAIN!!! Hope the links <br>
to pictures work for you. Wish my camera was better but at least I got some shots. Next <br>
up, Polish deli. Probably will take some shots on Paczki Day in February.<br>

OMG, I LOVE the Red Apple.  It's the best Polish buffet around!   I take my <br>
mom there for lunch every few months.  Your pics are most  excellent and make <br>
me hungry to take mom there again!  <br>
