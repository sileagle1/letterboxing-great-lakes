I have a freeware program called infanview (www.irfanview.com)that I <br/>
used for photo editing.  I was checking it out today, and there's an <br/>
option under effect to  do "edge detection".  That seemed like it <br/>
might be helpful depending on the photo.  It also has embossing <br/>
options, and BW options that may work.  I'd download that and play <br/>
around with it.<br/>

<br/>
1)  Increase contrast VERY high so there is a clear delineation between dark and light -- adjust brightness as necessary if everything is too light or too dark.<br/>
2)  Split channels to RGB -- this will give you three different copies of your image -- a red, a green and a blue -- choose the one that is closest to a black and white (pay attention to which areas are black and white).  Usually the green is closest to a black and white, but sometimes it will be the red or the blue, depending on the colors in the original picture.  <br/>
3)  Now decrease the colors to 2 (black and white) to remove the gray tones.<br/>

Thanks to everyone who has offered these different resources for <br/>
converting pictures to carve-ready sketches.  Azobox, the file did open <br/>
right to the advanced techniques.  This is wonderful information for all <br/>
of us because there are so many options based on skill and <br/>
understanding.  I'm at the baby-steps and so having all of these options <br/>
that each of your has offered will allow me to try (get started) and <br/>
then progress.  Thanks again to each one of you!!!  Very much <br/>
appreciated!  ~Trailtracker<br/>
