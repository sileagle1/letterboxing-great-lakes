I tried posting clues (my first placing) to Letterboxing.org <br>
yesterday - twice - and they're still not up.  The first time, after <br>
I hit the Submit button, I was told I needed to be signed in to post <br>
(which I already was).  The second time, after retyping everything, I <br>
was given a "Thank you for posting" message but my clues still aren't <br>
up.  Is there generally a lag?  I thought it was supposed to be <br>
pretty instantaneous.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

P.S. I haven't had a chance to post my thanks to the people at the <br>
Wisconsin Gathering yet so I'll do it now.  It was really wonderful <br>
meeting all of you.  I was still very new to this hobby and you guys <br>
all got me completely hooked with your enthusiasm.<br>

Hi RaqsEnigma,<br>
<br>
There seems to be some sort of lag on posting on the site.  They've been <br>
discussing this issue on the LBNA list, too.  Your clues did show up on the <br>
Yahoo announcement list, so I know they're in there somewhere.  You can <br>
find the clues at: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lbox-announce/.<br>
<br>
This morning I was honored to be the first to stamp into your first box--I'm still <br>
humming.<br>

Subject: posting clues<br>
<br>
I tried posting clues (my first placing) to Letterboxing.org<br>
yesterday - twice - and they're still not up. The first time, after<br>
I hit the Submit button, I was told I needed to be signed in to post<br>
(which I already was). The second time, after retyping everything, I<br>
was given a "Thank you for posting" message but my clues still aren't<br>
up. Is there generally a lag? I thought it was supposed to be<br>
pretty instantaneous.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
