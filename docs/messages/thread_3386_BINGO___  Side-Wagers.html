diversion we all call BINGO!, I'll look into the now infamous<br/>
Side-Wagers game.<br/>

Like SC, I'll be happy to consider variations on last years' version,<br/>
off-line.<br/>

Details coming soon.<br/>

&gt; Well, it looks like there are quite a few people interested in<br/>
playing BINGO, so I will work on the game format this weekend and post<br/>
the details early next week.  Thanks to everyone who sent suggestions<br/>
and ideas for variations!<br/>

&gt;   You can count Team Rabbit in again for some Bingo fun! I also <br/>
&gt;   wouldn't mind the same format.....it worked out pretty well last <br/>
&gt;   time ;-) Seriously though, the length of the game just added to the <br/>
&gt;   suspense! Of course, new ideas are always fun too! I know that we <br/>
&gt;   really enjoyed SpringChick's 2 for Tuesday picks!<br/>

&gt;   &gt; We'd definitely be interested again and wouldn't object to the <br/>
&gt;   exact <br/>
&gt;   &gt; same format. It IS a long winter anyway (and starting BIG time <br/>
&gt;   &gt; today)! However any new variations would be fine. <br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; I've gotten a few inquiries about BINGO and am thinking of <br/>
&gt;   running <br/>
&gt;   &gt; it <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; again during January - ??? (hopefully not as long and drawn out <br/>
&gt;   as <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; last year). Wondering if there is interest or if it it old stuff <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; now? Also if you have any suggestions for changing it up a <br/>
&gt;   little, <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; please e-mail me offlist with ideas.<br/>
