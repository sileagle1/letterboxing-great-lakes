Here are links to our posts about the events in IN, MI, WI, IL and IA (some of the posts include other info/photos for a day or two before/after the event):</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>MAY 6 - Indiana Jones event (Indiana):  </span></p><p><span><a href="https://wihimm.blogspot.com/2017/05/chasing-indiana-jones-and-atomic-beans.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wihimm.blogspot.com/2017/05/chasing-indiana-jones-and-atomic-beans.html</a></span></p><p><br/></p><p>MAY 27 - It's SO Random event (Michigan):</p><p><a href="https://wihimm.blogspot.com/2017/05/on-road-again.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wihimm.blogspot.com/2017/05/on-road-again.html</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>JUN 24 - GLG 2017 - One for the Books (Wisconsin):</p><p><a href="https://wihimm.blogspot.com/2017/06/glg-2017.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wihimm.blogspot.com/2017/06/glg-2017.html</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>JUL 15 - Homerdoodle in the Country (Illinois):</p><p><a href="https://wihimm.blogspot.com/2017/07/homerdoodle-in-country.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wihimm.blogspot.com/2017/07/homerdoodle-in-country.html</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>JUL 29 - It's About Time!
