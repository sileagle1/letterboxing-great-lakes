<br>
There was a Bohemian bakery in town that made fresh strawberry filled<br>
paczki.  Now THOSE were good!<br>
<br>
And to catch up with some of the other messages I've missed the past few<br>
days...<br>
<br>
I do recall supper clubs around here as a kid, but not for a LONG time.<br>
<br>
strips of grass between sidewalk & street = parkway, though my goofy<br>
neighborhood does have twisty streets with islands in the middle of some of<br>
them which we do call "islands"<br>
<br>
Diet Coke is my favorite *soda*, though I think pop is the more prevalent<br>
word around here???<br>
<br>
again, being a Bohemian girl, I llllooovvveee breaded pork tenderloin!<br>

<br>
Now I'm stuck at work and hungry!!! Although my grandmother never made<br>
them, I loved going to the Polish Bakery with her and getting paczki and<br>
rye bread. The ones at the grocery store are never the same. At some<br>
point, I started calling my dog paczki (it makes as much sense as<br>
pumpkin or honey); it's fun to see people who actually know the term<br>
react. I've thought of making it her trail name...<br>
