Hi All!  I missed you!<br>
<br>
It has been a really busy summer for me, but now I'm home for awhile and ready to take on more projects (like the ART BASH!)  I'll be sending a separate email about that.<br>
<br>
I haven't done any art or carving all summer! <gasp> and I'm not sure when I'll have a chance to do any, so I'm really looking forward to two days packed with art making projects and learning!<br>
<br>
I won't have time to go through all the messages I missed over the last 2 months, so if there are any new things I need to know about, please fill me in!  I'm back on digest for this group, but the fastest way to get in touch with me is direct email to DogScouts@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
It's good to be back!<br>

<br>
Good to see you around again!  I can relate to your sentiments about summer being crazy and am glad things are settling down for you.  I'm really looking forward to ART BASH!<br>
