Gunhild and Ivor are very sorry to hear of your misfortune.  Maybe you should reconsider the dangerous courses you are planning for our competition????  Especially be mindful of the thermally challenged Swiss team...instead of puny short-shorts, they should be looking for life jackets with some little edelweiss designs for their team uniform!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, we could interest you in trying some of Ivor's homemade Medieval Swedish Herbal Medicine known today as "elixir de schnapps"!  It cures just about every malady...if not illness, it sure helps while they sew you up with stitches! <br/>
Hopefully, you will not spend the entire Olympics in the infirmary......<br/>
Skaal!<br/>
