                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're very excited and looking forward to seeing several of you at <br>
this Saturday's mini-meet in southeast Michigan. The weather forecast <br>
isn't looking to be quite as nice as today and tomorrow, but it's sure <br>
to be a fun day nonetheless.<br>
<br>
For those who like to get a head start on planning their day's <br>
adventures, or who want to start their hunts prior to 10am on <br>
Saturday, we've posted the booklet containing the clues to 11 <br>
temporary boxes, and all 4 permanent boxes.  You can get it at:<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/files/Gatherings/2006%20Michigan%<br>
20Spring%20FLING/<br>
<br>
Of course, this booklet will be available in printed form at the <br>
event.  Also, we know some other letterboxers have or will be planting <br>
additional temporary boxes, so this is by no means a complete <br>
listing.  If you plan to look for other boxes outside of Maybury, <br>
though, please bring your own clues for those.<br>
<br>
Safe travels and happy 'boxing!  See you on Saturday, and as always, <br>
let us know if there are any questions. <br>

I will bring copies with me, but two of them are in puzzle form, so <br>
there's some solving you can do beforehand if you choose.  Can't wait <br>
to see everybody on Saturday!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I took a look at the clue book for the Spring Fling Gathering and <br>
the clues posted by Trail Troll.  Great boxes and clues everyone!  <br>
Love the May Days series idea and the research that went into it is <br>
very interesting!<br>
<br>
I have a box that I will be bringing and planting before the start <br>
of the gathering.  Clues will be available there.  The name of the <br>
box is "Roses and Juleps."  Although the clues will not be a puzzle, <br>
you will need to know what this refers to, so if you don't already <br>
know, you may want to find out before you go.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing many of you on Saturday!<br>
