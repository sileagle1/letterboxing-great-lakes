  Does anyone in this group have a personal stamp of a capitol G with <br/>
  a fish underneath it?  (Or do you know someone who uses that <br/>
  stamp?)  I was notified by a geochcher that she had found a notebook <br/>
  and the last stamp was from my boxes Parrots in the Park at Seidman <br/>
  Park in Grand Rapids/Ada on 8/17.  We went out today to see who had <br/>
  stamped in the parrot logs on 8/17 and that was the stamp we found.  <br/>
  There was no name or signature.<br/>
