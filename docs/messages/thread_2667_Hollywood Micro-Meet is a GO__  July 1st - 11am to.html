Kim from The Paw Caf will be opening the place just for us (not open to the<br>
public, but I doubt theyd turn a paying customer away).  I told her we so<br>
far have 10 yesses and 12 maybes.  Please update your entry in the poll if<br>
there is any change.  They are not charging us anything for use of the<br>
facility, so please be sure to order lunch and place a donation in their tip<br>
jar.<br>

Since this is pretty much going to be just a hang around and exchange<br>
kind of thing, with a bit of show and tell or whatever, if anyone has<br>
anything to bring along, please do so.  Or if anyone wants to offer a<br>
workshop, that would be great too.<br>
<br>
There is also a big TV and jukebox available for any Noxers in the<br>
family who would otherwise be bored by the rest of the goings-on, and<br>
remember the Zoo is walking distance away if you'd like to stop there<br>
before or afterwards.<br>

(And you want to carve another stamp too...fess up....but keep it simple....not like Alice - WOW, what a stamp.)  Don't you just love my run-on sentences?  You'd never know I was a journalism major in college.  I just type like I talk....OK, I hear you....I talk a lot.  For the event stamp, may I suggest...something Paw Caf-like.  Unless that's what the letterbox stamp already looks like.  I'll have to pull up that old clue.  Not sure if it was actually at the Paw or Cyber Dog....but I will find it!  Other than just getting together to chat and show and tell, do you have any ideas for 'projects' also known as make-it-take-its?  Just wondering.  <br>
<br>
Beware!  The Tribune and the Sun Times are both reporting Killer Beetles attacking ash trees.  Millions of ash trees in danger in the Chicagoland area.  As I read the articles, I started humming the GS tune - Ash Grove (because I don't know all the words by heart.)  I guess when beetles and fungus get together....LOOK OUT!!!  We are some pair - total destruction left in our path.  LOL!!!<br>

I am so bummed about the Hollywood Micro-Meet.  We will be out of town <br>
that weekend, so we won't be able to come.  And we missed the winter <br>
mini-meet because we were out of town.  One of these times...<br>

Yes, the Trib and Sun Times articles described the killer beetles attacking ash trees as iridescent green.  I always stamp in green ink too.  But I promise, it's just my trail name, it's not me attacking the ash trees.  <br>

  lot of small, iridescent green beetles--wonder if those are the same <br>
  ones?<br>
<br>
  I am so bummed about the Hollywood Micro-Meet. We will be out of town <br>
  that weekend, so we won't be able to come. And we missed the winter <br>
  mini-meet because we were out of town. One of these times...<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">  I "think" the green beetles at Lapham Park are a species of tiger <br>
beetle.  The ones we saw were along sandy parts of the trails and <br>
tiger beetles are the adult stage of the ant lion: those little <br>
killers that lurk at the bottom of small, sandy pits, waiting for a <br>
tasty ant to "drop in" for dinner.<br>
