                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is nothing that says you can't use wood if you would prefer to use that for carving your stamps.  I have never carved wood before so I don't know if it is difficult.  I am also wondering as to how the wood carving would take ink.  One of the first stamps we found was not made from rubber, rather a curious metallic material that looked a lot like the leading used in making stained glass windows.  It wasn't actually a carving, rather the material had been applied maybe from a tube over a template sketch.  It was a nice piece of work, but the ink didn't take very well.<br/>
<br/>
I am not aware of any carving classes in West Michigan, but if you are haing specific problems, feel free to post problem/question and we will try to offer suggestions.  You mentioned faces and I am supposing it is because of the detail.  Are you using the carving tools or an Exacto knife?  If you are not already, try using an Exacto knife -- I find this much easier to get precise, detailed cuts.<br/>

<br/>
On the other hand, I just can't seem to make the Exacto knife work for me - I have now idea why....it's just not a good tool for me.  I always you the speedball #1 blade...and gauge my definition by how shallow or deep the cut is  I also have more success turning the carving medium to get curves and whatnot - rather than trying to twist my hand/wrist with tool in it<br/>
<br/>
Someone posted on one of the lists a while back that they took the #1 blade and pinched it down even smaller ~ BindleBabe has done this herself with great success using heat tempering.<br/>
