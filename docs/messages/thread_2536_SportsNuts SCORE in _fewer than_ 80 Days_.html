The Travel Staff at "Around the World in 80 Days" was excited to hear<br/>
the fans roar as the SportsNuts crossed the finish line and submitted<br/>
the proper certification for successfully completing their journey.<br/>
All documents were in order and they will receive not only the<br/>
Official letterbox for finishing the series, but the bonus as well.<br/>

Congratulations, SportsNuts!<br/>
You're officially "World Travelers".<br/>
