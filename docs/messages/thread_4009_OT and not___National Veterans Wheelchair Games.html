If you've ever seen these parathletes in action, you know how impressive it is to watch.  The participants range in from WWII-era to recently returned from Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
In honor of the Games, Jigsaw and I are collaborating on a project.  I'm going to be creating some letterboxes, and he's going to place them in the Milwaukee area for me.  Stay tuned for more details, but right now I'm looking at anywhere from 1-5 boxes.<br/>

&gt;HEY VA!  HAVE YOU HEARD? April 25, 2007 <br/>
&gt;The 27th annual National Veterans Wheelchair Games will be held June <br/>
&gt;19-23, 2007 in Milwaukee, Wis.  Participants, all military veterans who <br/>
&gt;use wheelchairs for sports competition due to spinal cord injuries, <br/>
&gt;amputations, or certain neurological problems, compete in events <br/>
&gt;including swimming, table tennis, weightlifting, basketball, and <br/>
&gt;softball, among others.  This year's Games will be hosted by staff and <br/>
&gt;volunteers at the historic Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center, where <br/>
&gt;the event was held in its infancy in 1982. Wheelchair sports began in <br/>
&gt;earnest after World War II, when veterans began playing wheelchair <br/>
&gt;basketball in VA hospitals. Interest soon spread to other sports, such as <br/>
&gt;bowling, swimming, archery and track and field. In 1980, when VA <br/>
&gt;established Recreation Therapy Service, wheelchair sports became a <br/>
&gt;therapeutic tool for treating veterans with disabilities. The first Games <br/>
&gt;were organized by Recreation Therapy Service in 1981 in Richmond, Va. The <br/>
&gt;event got a big boost in 1985 when the Paralyzed Veterans of America <br/>
&gt;became the Games' co-sponsor, along with VA. Today it is the largest <br/>
&gt;annual wheelchair sporting event in the world, with more than 500 <br/>
&gt;participants expected in Milwaukee from all over the U.S. and Puerto Rico <br/>
&gt;and Great Britain, as well. The Games give veterans a chance to show the <br/>
&gt;world what they are capable of in an atmosphere of competitiveness, <br/>
&gt;desire, and drive, but perhaps most of all, tremendous pride.<br/>
