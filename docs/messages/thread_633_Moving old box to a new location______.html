                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a question for you:<br>
I have a box or two which I removed from their previous locations due <br>
to state park restrictions. I'd like to re-plant the boxes elsewhere. <br>
In one case I altered the stamp slightly -- now it's a "new" stamp(?) <br>
So, in a new location with new clues, is it a "new" box? (This is not <br>
important from a "PFX" perspective).<br>
I ask mostly from the point of view of the seeker. Since some finders <br>
would be disappointed to find the box for a second time, I want to <br>
make sure that it's known to be "so-and-so" box, altered/replanted.<br>
Given all that, would you include the original log book, with the <br>
stamps of those who found it in its previous location? Or would you <br>
make a new logbook, including its history when placing in a new <br>
location?<br>
<br>
Just curious what some of you old hands -- okay, "experienced <br>
letterboxers" -- might suggest.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally, one of my favorite things about finding a box is seeing who's been there before me.  In which case, I advocate keeping the original logbook, but writing a note in the first clean page explaining the nature of the replant- date and location of original plant, etc. <br>
 However, in the case of "Freebird", which was a stamp I created for the Gathering, I created a new logbook when he was re-planted back home, simply because I wanted a record of that snapshot in time.<br>
