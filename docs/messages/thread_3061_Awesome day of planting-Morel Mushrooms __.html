   <br>
  Thought I would join the "goobling" about box huntings and mushroom hunting.<br>
   <br>
  I have not yet tried mushroom hunting, BUT I came across a awesome article in our local community magazine about Morel Mushroom Hunting (May 06 Good News Magazine, Adrian Michigan).<br>
   <br>
  It gave a great description on how to find mushrooms.  What I thought was the most interesting, is the article mentions to put your mushrooms in an old "onion" bag or mesh bag when out hunting, because it helps the mushrooms drop new spores to aid in replenshing for next years harvest.  :)<br>
   <br>
  For the "peeps" thinking about hunting and not sure, this little rule of thumb may help you from picking the wrong mushrooms on you hikes.<br>
   <br>
        Morel Mushroom Rules<br>
  #1.  When in doubt, throw it out!<br>
  #2   If it ain't hollow, don't swallow!<br>
  #3   If it's wavy, don't make gravy!<br>
  #4   If it's reddish, you could be dead-ish<br>

          I was out this afternoon planting The Nights who say<br>
NI! and came across several cool things. First and<br>
foremost I saw my first ever Coyote! A strange<br>
coincidence considering the Nights box was carved by<br>
Howling Coyote!!! Second, I was in a small (or so I<br>
thought) park 2 blocks from my house that I had never<br>
been to before only to discover it's huge! I saw a big<br>
white-tailed deer running through the forest perhaps<br>
15 yards away and several species of mushrooms in<br>
profusion. I have been really jonesing for Morel<br>
mushroom season and doing alot of reading online about<br>
it to increase my odds of finding more next year. This<br>
last May was my first time out and now I'M COMPLETELY<br>
HOOKED! Talk about treasure hunts, oh my goodness.<br>
With shroom hunting you never know if you'll even see<br>
a Morel and when you do it's better than finding a<br>
mystery box it's taken you 6 months to solve because<br>
you can eat it. Also the Morel season lasts for only<br>
about 1 month a year (unless you move further north to<br>
follow the weather) If you have never hunted the<br>
elusive and delectable Morel, DO IT! you will have a<br>
new obsession to look forward to every spring. Just<br>
what we all need right? another obsession to make sure<br>
we never get anything done. But seriously, DO IT! If I<br>
get lucky and find enough this next spring I will be<br>
bringing some to the gathering to share with you all.<br>
I've read some incredible stories of people finding 40<br>
+ lbs. in one outing! If you have never tasted the<br>
Morel you don't know what you're missing. I better<br>
stop typing, this message has strayed off topic,<br>
sorry, but you really need to hunt for Morels next<br>
spring. Even if you don't like mushrooms you can sell<br>
the Morels for $20 + per pound! MMMMMM Morels ( read<br>
with a Homer Simpsonesque longing in your eyes and<br>
make sure to drool). Umm where was I, oh yeah, great<br>
day of planting and dreaming about the future.<br>
<br>

P.S. You lucky folks in Wisconsin have some of the<br>
best Morel hunting grounds around I hear. <br>
