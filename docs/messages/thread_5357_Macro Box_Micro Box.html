was a biggie!  So I wondered, what would the smallest letterbox look <br>
like?  <br>
<br>
If you would like to sign up to receive The Flower Power Micro Box, <br>
please contact Beetle.  I was not planning to list this micro box on <br>
LbNA or AQ as a postal, because I want to limit the circulation to just <br>
the members in the LbGLK Group...at least for now.  After this postal <br>
returns to me, the micro box will become a personal traveler. <br>
<br>
How small is the smallerst letterbox?  VERY SMALL!  <br>
