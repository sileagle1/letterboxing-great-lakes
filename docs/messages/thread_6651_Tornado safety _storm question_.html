I don't know how many milliseconds one would have from the point you feel  <br>
tingly to the point you become BBQ.<br>

In that split fraction of a second, I would shoot out a quick "LORD HELP  <br>
ME!" prayer.<br>

Best you can do is make sure that you're not under an umbrella (metal attracts), under a tree (since those are usually the tallest points around and the lightning can go through the tree into the ground and travel that way), is make yourself as small as possible and try to get to someplace indoors and unfortunately, that doesn't include a canopy or picnic shelter.  Truthfully, I hadn't heard that hair starting to stand up is a sure sign of being struck.  But, I will ask someone that's actually an expert on lightning.<br>
