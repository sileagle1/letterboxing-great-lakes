Thanks, that would be great. There's no real rush -- I put a note on the <br/>
clue so people will be aware that some of the landmarks may have changed. <br/>
If we need to revise the clues, we should probably stick as close to the <br/>
original as we can, but just expand/clarify where needed.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the box may need some maintenance, so when you go, it would be great <br/>
if you could be prepared with supplies to freshen it (and let me know if I <br/>
can reimburse you for any expenses).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
