in Ann Arbor, Mi and found a geocache in it's place. The cache was <br>
just placed last week, so I don't suspect the cache placer of any bad <br>
deeds. I was very diasppointed to find the box MIA. There were some <br>
wonderful stamp images and commemts when I last checked on the box. <br>
Too bad I won't be able to see the most recent entries. I'll remove <br>
the clues from the LB site.<br>
