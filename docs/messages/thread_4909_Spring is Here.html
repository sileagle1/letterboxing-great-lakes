Great minds think alike!  When we ran into you on the trail, it never really occured to me to identify myself or ask who you were!  We're still trail newbies I guess.  We were successful in following your footsteps-stamped right behind you on two! (never did find that lonely pine!)<br>

We ran into quite a lot of traffic yesterday at Hemlock Crossings and Pine Bend.  I often ask people if they're letterboxing or geocaching if they have bags or backpacks-I had the opportunity to share information about letterboxing with a couple of geocachers.  Hopefully this will educate them if they ever come across a letterbox.  (BTW: we didn't leave or take anything from the caches, but it was kinda fun to check out what was in their box. I'll stick to swapping stamps thank you!)<br>

Yes, we also could tell Spring has arrived in the Great Lakes area!  <br>
We received messages from 10 different letterboxers that they had <br>
found 8 of our boxes.  Unfortunately we also received 2 reports that <br>
our "February Frolic" box could not be found.  We won't be able to <br>
check on it until the week of APR 14, but hope it is OK since to our <br>
knowledge NO ONE has found it since we planted it in February.<br>
<br>
We were surprised to find a stamp carved by Keddy Writer this <br>
weekend.  Why?  Because we weren't in Illinois, we were in Georgia!  <br>
Martini Man was in the Atlanta area on business last week, so I flew <br>
down to join in for the weekend.  We thought we'd be enjoying some <br>
southern sun, but we were WRONG about that!  My flight Friday night <br>
was delayed due to big storms in Atlanta and then Saturday it rained <br>
all morning.  We didn't head out to do any boxing until almost 1 pm.  <br>
Due to the still "iffy" weather conditions, we only did some short <br>
walks and had to make use of our umbrellas occasionally.  Today was <br>
better - no rain, but overcast.  We were able to spend the whole day <br>
at Little Mulberry Park, hiking 8+ miles and finding lots of boxes.  <br>
Despite the weather, we had a fun birthday weekend!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Along with many others, we too had an awesome letterboxing weekend.  <br>
When we saw the weather forecast, we couldn't resist and decided to <br>
forgo all non-letterboxing plans we had for the weekend.  We have a lot <br>
to catch up on now, but it was worth it.<br>
<br>
We decided to spend Saturday finding boxes, so we drove northwest and <br>
found 14 boxes in/around Wauconda, IL -- Cherokee Rose 2's recently <br>
planted Trip Across America 7 being the draw. :)  Luckily, we hadn't <br>
been to that area before so there were several other boxes nearby for us <br>
to find also.  And to top it off, we ended the day with our 700th find!  <br>
It was a fairly old plant from 2004 by Renfield called "All the World's <br>
a Stage: Kindergarden," and boy did we have to work for this one!  It's <br>
noted in the clues that the park may not be upkeeping this particular <br>
trail anymore, and I definitely agree!  We had to backtrack several <br>
times and use all of our creative clue interpretation skills to find it, <br>
but luckily Atom's keen eye spotted the correct tree and the box. :)<br>
<br>
On Sunday, we went back out to check on some of our more threatened <br>
boxes along the Des Plaines River Trail.  We successfully found most of <br>
the boxes we looked for, but 2 of the 4 in the HHH series were <br>
questionable as the trail leading to the boxes was flooded over.  We're <br>
not entirely sure since we couldn't get close, but the boxes are likely <br>
underwater as well. :(  However, both survived the severe flooding back <br>
in the fall, so I still have hope that they're still there.  We'll be <br>
keeping our fingers crossed and making notes on the clues.<br>
<br>
Happy spring and happy boxing to all!<br>
