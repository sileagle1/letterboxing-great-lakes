We ran into quite a lot of traffic yesterday at Hemlock Crossings and Pine Bend.  I often ask people if they're letterboxing or geocaching if they have bags or backpacks-I had the opportunity to share information about letterboxing with a couple of geocachers.  Hopefully this will educate them if they ever come across a letterbox.  (BTW: we didn't leave or take anything from the caches, but it was kinda fun to check out what was in their box. I'll stick to swapping stamps thank you!)<br/>

&gt;   I wonder sometimes how often this happens? I am not quick to stop somebody<br/>
&gt; and/or introduce myself and many times have later found myself wondering if<br/>
&gt; those people I passed with compass in hand were letterboxers... I passed a<br/>
&gt; young couple at Hoffmaster yesterday with a compass and some papers who acted<br/>
&gt; quite secretive as I passed. I wondered... but either they were not<br/>
&gt; letterboxers or did not find the box as there was not a login yesterday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I did learn from the logbook at one of the boxes there that there is a<br/>
&gt; geocache nearby though. Darn, it's like a curse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   BTW - The Hemlock Crossings Lonely Pine box is missing. Has been gone for<br/>
&gt; some time now, but the people who listed it are no longer letterboxing. I did<br/>
&gt; write to the webmasters about getting it removed but see it is still listed.<br/>

Yes, we also could tell Spring has arrived in the Great Lakes area!  <br/>
We received messages from 10 different letterboxers that they had <br/>
found 8 of our boxes.  Unfortunately we also received 2 reports that <br/>
our "February Frolic" box could not be found.  We won't be able to <br/>
check on it until the week of APR 14, but hope it is OK since to our <br/>
knowledge NO ONE has found it since we planted it in February.<br/>
<br/>
We were surprised to find a stamp carved by Keddy Writer this <br/>
weekend.  Why?  Because we weren't in Illinois, we were in Georgia!  <br/>
Martini Man was in the Atlanta area on business last week, so I flew <br/>
down to join in for the weekend.  We thought we'd be enjoying some <br/>
southern sun, but we were WRONG about that!  My flight Friday night <br/>
was delayed due to big storms in Atlanta and then Saturday it rained <br/>
all morning.  We didn't head out to do any boxing until almost 1 pm.  <br/>
Due to the still "iffy" weather conditions, we only did some short <br/>
walks and had to make use of our umbrellas occasionally.  Today was <br/>
better - no rain, but overcast.  We were able to spend the whole day <br/>
at Little Mulberry Park, hiking 8+ miles and finding lots of boxes.  <br/>
Despite the weather, we had a fun birthday weekend!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Along with many others, we too had an awesome letterboxing weekend.  <br/>
When we saw the weather forecast, we couldn't resist and decided to <br/>
forgo all non-letterboxing plans we had for the weekend.  We have a lot <br/>
to catch up on now, but it was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to spend Saturday finding boxes, so we drove northwest and <br/>
found 14 boxes in/around Wauconda, IL -- Cherokee Rose 2's recently <br/>
planted Trip Across America 7 being the draw. :)  Luckily, we hadn't <br/>
been to that area before so there were several other boxes nearby for us <br/>
to find also.  And to top it off, we ended the day with our 700th find!  <br/>
It was a fairly old plant from 2004 by Renfield called "All the World's <br/>
a Stage: Kindergarden," and boy did we have to work for this one!  It's <br/>
noted in the clues that the park may not be upkeeping this particular <br/>
trail anymore, and I definitely agree!  We had to backtrack several <br/>
times and use all of our creative clue interpretation skills to find it, <br/>
but luckily Atom's keen eye spotted the correct tree and the box. :)<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, we went back out to check on some of our more threatened <br/>
boxes along the Des Plaines River Trail.  We successfully found most of <br/>
the boxes we looked for, but 2 of the 4 in the HHH series were <br/>
questionable as the trail leading to the boxes was flooded over.  We're <br/>
not entirely sure since we couldn't get close, but the boxes are likely <br/>
underwater as well. :(  However, both survived the severe flooding back <br/>
in the fall, so I still have hope that they're still there.  We'll be <br/>
keeping our fingers crossed and making notes on the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Happy spring and happy boxing to all!<br/>
