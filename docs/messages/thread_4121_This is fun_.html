<br>
Just wanted to let you know I'm up to my 3rd find. 1 by accident, 1 fairly easy and 1 that took <br>
considerable amount of work. I think I'll like this hobby. If you don't mind I'll stick around.<br>
<br>
Would it have been 4 finds? Possibly. JB Parks - couldn't reach the location since it was grown <br>
over with vegetation. Since I'm not fond of the itchy rashes and Calamine Lotion- I'll hold off <br>
on it until fall. I put a note in the "Attempted box" on Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
This has been a fun week or two Letterboxing. Even met a few folks along the way. Great <br>
hobby. Told a friend about it, so he and his girl friend are going to put it on their to-do list. <br>
Hopefully we'll see them here before long.<br>
<br>
later<br>
