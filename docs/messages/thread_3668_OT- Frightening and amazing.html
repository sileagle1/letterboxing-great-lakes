How many of these people are near the parks you visit?<br>
<br>
<br>
This is really scary and the number of felons in areas I frequent is amazing.  Use this system to check your neighborhood for sex offenders and people convicted of other felonys like rape and murder.  I was surprized at how many were near me out here "in the country" in Indiana!  Not sure how often this info is updated though.  but if you're good at recognizing faces, you might see these people walking your neighborhood or at the store, it might even be your neighbor!  By clicking on the boxes, you get criminal history info about them and a photo.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Check this out it is scary.  Click on the little house and all dots around it after you put your address.<br>
<br>
   <br>
<br>
  This is good information.  <br>
<br>
   <br>
<br>
   JUST ENTER YOUR ADDRESS AND <br>
<br>
  THE COMPUTER WILL DO THE REST. <br>

  I wanted to share a website with you that is a good idea to visit. It is www.familywatchdog.us <br>
  When you visit this site you can enter your address and a map will pop up with your house as the small icon of a house and red, blue, green, dots surrounding your entire neighborhood <br>
<br>
  When you click on these dots, a picture of a person will appear with an address and the description of the crime he or she had committed. <br>
<br>
  The best thing is that you can do is show your children pictures and see how close these people live to your home or school. <br>

<br>
Thanks so much Scoutdogs for sharing this web address with us?!  OMG <br>
what a dose of reality.  For my address there were several preditors <br>
within 5 miles and I too live out in the boonies of Ohio.  When I <br>
checked the elementary, junior high and high school that all 3 of my <br>
sons went to, there were 2 that worked .21 (that's 2-tenths?!) of a mile <br>
from those buildings?!  I thought they were not allowed to do that?!  <br>
Another guy lived directly across from one of our major parks.  Luckily <br>
we have all had our letterboxes pulled from that one because it is a <br>
Metro Park. <br>
<br>
Thank you for pulling me out of my now obvious denial!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">And the bad thing is that so many of these predators leave and go elsewhere<br>
without notifying the authorities so that there can still be plenty in an<br>
area that *aren't* on the map.  I think it was in the news recently here in<br>
IL that with something like 30 percent of the sexual predators, the police<br>
actually don't have a current address on them.<br>
<br>
I live in DuPage County in IL and the county police also maintain a website<br>
for citizens to check out what sex offenders are living in the county.  And<br>
there's also www.mapsexoffenders.com which is a site similar to the<br>
familywatchdog site.<br>
<br>
The principal of one of the schools in my area was telling me that they only<br>
receive updates from the police every 3 months.  So the person could have<br>
lived there for quite awhile before the police notify the school.  So he<br>
keeps checking the site himself to see any updates that might be there.<br>
<br>
And a lot of us mail carriers also check the list as to who's living on our<br>
routes so that we can keep an eye out in case we see any of them attempting<br>
to get together with any children.  Especially those of us with schools<br>
and/or playgrounds in our route areas.  I have 3 schools on my route and<br>
it's astounding the number of convicted predators living just outside the<br>
boundaries.  In IL, they cannot reside within 500ft of a school or<br>
playground.  500ft ain't much.  With the width of lots around here being<br>
around 50ft, that's only 10 houses away.  That's, like, right down the<br>
block.<br>
<br>
Something I've never understood, however, is why residential homes that are<br>
also schools for mentally handicapped children don't qualify as a school if<br>
they have children going to school there that are minors.  In Lombard, there<br>
are two sex offenders living right across the street from a home and school<br>
for mentally challenged children.  And it's not just a residential home --<br>
it's also a school for children who live at home with their families.  So<br>
why wouldn't that qualify for the 500ft distance?  To me, all schools should<br>
qualify -- public, private, special ed., etc.  But these two predators are<br>
right smack dab across the street.  The school does seem to keep a good eye<br>
on the kids.  I don't doubt they know those two guys are right across the<br>
street.<br>
