nifty backpacks with the camping stool attached, and<br>
for everything we carry with us it's nice & roomy, but<br>
it's such a pain getting it on & off when we arrive at<br>

essentials (i.e., our logbook, markers, compass, camera, and one bottle <br>
of water). We switched to this after J decided that B's hiking backpack <br>
was waaaayyy too heavy for normal letterboxing! I am very happy with <br>
the new one; it is canvas, has one pocket, and is so light that I <br>
hardly ever notice it while hiking. <br>

PS I bought it at Sam's (on E. Liberty) in Ann Arbor.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We usually use a small backpack, for letterboxing supplies, birdwatching supplies, trail snacks and water.  However, when we are urban letterboxing, we simply place the letterboxing supplies in a fanny pack and go.  The nature of urban letterboxing provides plenty of snack stops and watering holes.  We have no experience letterboxing with children, so we can not address that issue.<br>

woven string backpack). Anyway they are just big enough to hold whats needed and a few <br>
extras too. The little zipper compartment holds their stamps and ink. Only Buccaneer has <br>
a fannypack with water bottle "holsters". Maybe its a boy vs. girl thing? <br>
Its been a great improvement for both my back and my enjoyment!<br>

So now my son (6) has "letterboxing pants" -- the kind with zip and velcro and belted pockets all over them of various sizes.  We make him keep all of his own stuff in those.  The only problem with this is that I can see already he will quickly outgrow them!!!  Maybe we could make him tie the pants around his waist when they get too small???  hee hee  --Papeseed<br>
