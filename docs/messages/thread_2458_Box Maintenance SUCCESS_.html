                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Over 200 boxes checked on during the month of April, and that <br>
doesn't count all of those that were checked along the way that <br>
didn't qualify for the drawing (i.e. boxes belonging to other <br>
people, etc.)<br>
<br>
That is really fantastic!!!  Thanks everyone for the super effort of <br>
getting out there and checking your boxes.  The Great Lakes region <br>
has a reputation for quality boxes and keeping on top of our boxes <br>
goes a long way to maintain that.<br>
<br>
You still have this weekend to check your boxes and get in on the <br>
drawing.  I will be exporting the maintenance database early on <br>
Monday morning and cutting the individual records into little slips <br>
to draw one at the May 6 Spring Fling gathering in MI.  Remember, <br>
you do not need to be at that gathering to win the super-duper <br>
fabulous prize.  I will announce it to the list after the gathering <br>
and make arrangements with the winner as needed.<br>
<br>
Thanks again everyone for the great effort!<br>
