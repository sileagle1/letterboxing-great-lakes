If you want more details, this is a good site:<br/>

OK, We will try, try again, LOL!  Now, the question my dh had - for<br/>
winter fun #1 - is the compass reading taken as we look at the signpost<br/>
or facing away from it (strange I know, but you should have seen him<br/>
out there trying to figure out where exactly we should be looking,<br/>
LOL!).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
