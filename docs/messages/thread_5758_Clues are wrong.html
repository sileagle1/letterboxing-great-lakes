after we had started letterboxing.  The clues said to go west but going <br>

observed some other people who seemed to be looking for this letterbox <br>
too; we think they gave up since we never saw them on the right trail.<br>

When we returned home, I emailed the author of the box and let them know <br>
they had the direction backwards but I don't think the clue was ever <br>
updated.  Maybe it was their way of keeping the letterbox only for <br>
persistent individuals?<br>
<br>
Since then, we've only had a couple letterboxes that weren't where the <br>
clues described and the author readily fixed the clues.<br>
<br>
I've also heard about letterboxes where the clues are entirely backwards <br>
but I've never had an opportunity to do such a letterbox.<br>

Tiptoe has no idea which is left and right...she has always referred to them as "your way" and "my way".  For some odd reason it always works....But, she could be inside a box and know North, South, East and West...go figure.<br>

I've already taken up diplomatically letting a placer know that the clues are wrong (in one instance) and omit key info (in another). I had LOTS of time to ponder this while on my detours. And get this, the placer is a friend who I introduced to LBing. I'm only posting this here cause I needed to vent, and the placer doesn't usually read these boards. The intial degrees say head west (280) rather than east (100).

<br>
This comment made me think of something.  One of our favorite letterboxes<br>
ever was quite cleverly written, a rather cryptic clue, and the very last<br>
clue was phrased in such a way to indicate that the final direction was from<br>
the BOX's point of view.  If you skimmed the clues and didn't read<br>
carefully, you would search in the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
I doubt entirely that the screwed-up-direction boxes are due to innate<br>
cleverness such as this, but it might be a case for a handful of them.<br>

Weird.  He also can't do simple addition with regular numbers, but can with<br>

Now that I think about it, I think I have come across some of these clues that didn't make sense.  When the clue told me to go right and I could only go left, I simply figured that the person placed the box and then wrote the clue on their return trip to their car. So all the directions (right/left and east/west) were in reverse.   I found the box, but it was weird.  <br>
