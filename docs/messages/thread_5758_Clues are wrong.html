after we had started letterboxing.  The clues said to go west but going <br/>
east is how we found the box.  While we were figuring this out, we <br/>
observed some other people who seemed to be looking for this letterbox <br/>
too; we think they gave up since we never saw them on the right trail.<br/>
<br/>
When we returned home, I emailed the author of the box and let them know <br/>
they had the direction backwards but I don't think the clue was ever <br/>
updated.  Maybe it was their way of keeping the letterbox only for <br/>
persistent individuals?<br/>
<br/>
Since then, we've only had a couple letterboxes that weren't where the <br/>
clues described and the author readily fixed the clues.<br/>
<br/>
I've also heard about letterboxes where the clues are entirely backwards <br/>
but I've never had an opportunity to do such a letterbox.<br/>

I've already taken up diplomatically letting a placer know that the clues are wrong (in one instance) and omit key info (in another). I had LOTS of time to ponder this while on my detours. And get this, the placer is a friend who I introduced to LBing. I'm only posting this here cause I needed to vent, and the placer doesn't usually read these boards. The intial degrees say head west (280) rather than east (100). Then, being a "goody two-shoes" kind of person, I walked right on by a trail marked with a small round "do not enter" sign, when the clues said take every trail to the left. Turns out that was the trail I needed, and I ended up on a LITTLE detour. ARGGHH. BTW, these were on horse trails, which the placer is familiar with, but I am not.

Tonto is LOL at someone suggesting that I make perfect sense.   He says that living with me IS a psych experience and he has never seen a dime for his "volunteerism"...Tiptoe<br/>

&gt; I've already taken up diplomatically letting a placer know that the  <br/>
&gt; clues<br/>
&gt; are wrong (in one instance) and omit key info (in another). I had  <br/>
&gt; LOTS of time<br/>
&gt; to ponder this while on my detours. And get this, the placer is a  <br/>
&gt; friend who<br/>
&gt; I introduced to LBing. I'm only posting this here cause I needed to  <br/>
&gt; vent, and<br/>
&gt; the placer doesn't usually read these boards. The intial degrees  <br/>
&gt; say head<br/>
&gt; west (280) rather than east (100). Then, being a "goody two-shoes"  <br/>
&gt; kind of<br/>
&gt; person, I walked right on by a trail marked with a small round "do  <br/>
&gt; not enter"<br/>
&gt; sign, when the clues said take every trail to the left. Turns out  <br/>
&gt; that was the<br/>
&gt; trail I needed, and I ended up on a LITTLE detour. ARGGHH. BTW,  <br/>
&gt; these were on<br/>
&gt; horse trails, which the placer is familiar with, but I am not. Yes,  <br/>
&gt; I did<br/>
&gt; find the box - and got LOTS of exercise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Plus I wanted to say that I am (theoretically) done with my  <br/>
&gt; planting frenzy<br/>
&gt; in Jefferson County, WI. The extent of flooding from last summer  <br/>
&gt; and even<br/>
&gt; this spring has been quite surprising to me.<br/>

<br/>
This comment made me think of something.  One of our favorite letterboxes<br/>
ever was quite cleverly written, a rather cryptic clue, and the very last<br/>
clue was phrased in such a way to indicate that the final direction was from<br/>
the BOX's point of view.  If you skimmed the clues and didn't read<br/>
carefully, you would search in the opposite direction.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt entirely that the screwed-up-direction boxes are due to innate<br/>
cleverness such as this, but it might be a case for a handful of them.<br/>

&gt; Since then, we've only had a couple letterboxes that weren't where the<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I've already taken up diplomatically letting a placer know that the<br/>

&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; friend who I introduced to LBing. I'm only posting this here cause I<br/>
&gt; needed<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to vent, and the placer doesn't usually read these boards. The intial<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; degrees say head west (280) rather than east (100). Then, being a "goody<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; two-shoes" kind of person, I walked right on by a trail marked with a<br/>
&gt; small<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; round "do not enter" sign, when the clues said take every trail to the<br/>
&gt; left.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Turns out that was the trail I needed, and I ended up on a LITTLE<br/>
&gt; detour.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; ARGGHH. BTW, these were on horse trails, which the placer is familiar<br/>
&gt; with,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; but I am not. Yes, I did find the box - and got LOTS of exercise.<br/>

Now that I think about it, I think I have come across some of these clues that didn't make sense.  When the clue told me to go right and I could only go left, I simply figured that the person placed the box and then wrote the clue on their return trip to their car. So all the directions (right/left and east/west) were in reverse.   I found the box, but it was weird.  <br/>
