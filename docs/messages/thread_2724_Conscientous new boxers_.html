different boxes that we placed very far from our home. I really <br>
appreciate it when we receive messages via the "Contact the Placer" <br>
feature on LBNA and am excited that many new boxers are taking the <br>
time to send a report and that they are sending some good info.  I <br>
wanted to share the 3 I received recently, so you could see the <br>
enthusiasm of some new boxers in the region:<br>

My wife and I and three kids found this letterbox today.  The walk <br>
over the old train trestle was beautiful and the history added to the <br>
interest for the kids (7,5, and 3).  The box is still in good <br>
condition and it appears that about three others have found it since <br>
it was placed.  We come up this direction once a year and this is the <br>
first year that we have looked for letterboxes.  The area could use a <br>
few more so we are considering adding some.  It was fun, thank you.<br>

Hello-Since this is the first letterbox we searched for and found we <br>
wanted to let you know how much fun we had!  We are two sisters who <br>
decided to start this up with our children (Ages 8,3, and 5 months).  <br>
This was quite a hike but finding your box and the HitchHiker made it <br>
all worth it.  We will definitely be searching for letterboxes in the <br>
very near future.  Thanks for the fun and the exercise!!!!<br>

I visited your letterbox on June 24th (Saturday).  It was in <br>
excellent condition.  The last stamp before me was a year ago.  The <br>
park was a lovely sight.  I enjoyed my afternoon there.   I only <br>
heard about letterboxing a couple of weeks ago and went on a couple <br>
hunts and caught the bug.  It is so much fun to figure out the clues.<br>
<br>
<br>
Reports like this encourage us to continue placing boxes, even in <br>
areas that are far from our home.<br>
