                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Team Dutch Elm for hosting such a great gathering yesterday!  It was my first and I had a wonderful time!  It was great to meet all of you.<br>
<br>
I discovered over the course of the afternoon many cooties that had mysteriously found their way into my pockets and bag, but I managed to pass them all into someone else's possession before leaving - that is, I THINK I got rid of them all!<br>
<br>
I was extremely impressed (and greatly humbled) by the level of stamp carving expertise among our group.  I see I have a LOT to learn.<br>
<br>
As for the Chinese Horoscope series, I carved the ox.   I would like to place this stamp out in the wild in my area, but I'm open to any other suggestions the other carvers may come up with.<br>

I know of at least three to four people that were looking for it at the end of the day.  Ohh, to have all but one of the stamps in a series....I didn't even get a chance to stamp in Nian.  I guess I wore red underpants for no reason then.  I still missed 5 of the events series stamps, and I totally blew Fungus Woman off in helping her to get the underpants.  This being my first gathering, I too got overwelmed with all of the fun and meeting people at the event!!!  Managing time is a key thing that I learned, and showing up an hour late didn't help.<br>
<br>
Be warned that now that I know your faces, those that I didn't get to exchange with willbe hunted down like that elusive "missing" letterbox.  I promise not to tackle anyone.  I am really torn with going to the gathering in June, since we will have a 1 month old at the time.  So many other people to meet, stamps to get, fun to have.  <br>
<br>
Truly though, it was a blast this past Saturday.  I can't wait until then next one comes.<br>

p.s.  I got cootied too, but only went home with one.<br>
