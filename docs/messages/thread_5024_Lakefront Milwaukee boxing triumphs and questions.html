Series" box #1 - Lake Park Lighthouse.  It was mid-July of 2004, and I<br/>
had no clue what I was doing, so imagine my excitement when I opened<br/>
the box (after brushing the mushrooms off the top) and then my<br/>
surprise and chagrin when I realized that most letterboxes do not come<br/>
with their own ink pad.  :-)  I returned a week later and logged in,<br/>
inkpad and handcarved stamp in hand.<br/>
<br/>
(I hope that box is still there; some of the logs I saw today<br/>
indicated that it's gone).<br/>
<br/>
I was never able to find the second box of that series, and about a<br/>
month ago, still staring at the space left for the Water Tower stamp,<br/>
on a page in my logbook that last saw ink nearly 4 years ago, I logged<br/>
on to Google Earth and tried to re-work the directions using my<br/>
computer.  Turns out the directions were fine -- it was my math that<br/>
was off.  I had been looking for this box for FOUR YEARS in the wrong<br/>
park, half a mile down the street from the right park (I walked 1000+<br/>
paces instead of 26.  Duh).<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I found the second box today, 46 months after I started<br/>
letterboxing (and before I had the husband), and he amusedly scraped<br/>
cobwebs and spiders off the box while I yammered on excitedly and our<br/>
dog napped in a shady spot under the tree.<br/>
<br/>
In a funny way, I feel like I can move on with letterboxing now --<br/>
that blank space in my logbook no longer mocks me as a quasi-competent<br/>
boxer, mostly unable to add.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow.  That's the triumph.  Now the questions.<br/>
<br/>
1) Milwaukee-area boxers -- has anyone tried for the Cambridge Parkway<br/>
series recently?  I have found 8 of the 10 boxes in the series -- I<br/>
cannot find "Out of Water" or "The Bridges of Cambridge Parkway."<br/>
Does anyone know if these two are officially missing?<br/>
<br/>
2) My husband and I are heading to Hawaii for a belated honeymoon --<br/>
we leave in about two weeks.  I am taking a HH that I pulled from the<br/>
Dragon's HH Hostel, as well as one of my own boxes for placement.<br/>
Would anyone else like to send a HH or a box to paradise?  We will be<br/>
spending a week on O'ahu.  I would be happy to take Wisconsin<br/>
letterboxes with me.  Just let me know.<br/>

[Addendum -- My husband, patient and kind soul that he is, knew<br/>
nothing about letterboxing until he saddled himself with me and I<br/>
began dragging him along on the hunts.  When we visited Moab, Utah, he<br/>
read a book in the hotel room on the first night while I sat with<br/>
printouts of clues surrounding me and mapped them out for finding the<br/>
following day.  I've already done the same with the O'ahu map.  When<br/>
we thought about buying the tickets, I said, "I don't know if we can<br/>
really afford this," and he, wanting to also visit his old Navy<br/>
buddies in Pearl Harbor, countered with "If we go, I'll let you have<br/>
two entire days to go letterboxing."<br/>
<br/>
I responded to this by immediately handing over my Visa card.  :-)  ]<br/>

<br/>
Regarding Cambridge Parkway, I also was unable to find "Out of Water"... but then again I can't seem to find the prior box, "Oak Leaf," either, so I may not be the best advisor on the topic.<br/>

<br/>
I made two attempts last year at "Out of Water" with two different <br/>
letterboxers each time.  We could not find it.  There was some erosion <br/>
along the trail there and the second time looking for it, I almost went <br/>
over the edge and it could have been a nasty fall, and almost took the <br/>
boxer with me over.  Be careful on that section of trail, I can't <br/>
imagine it has gotten better since last summer!!<br/>
