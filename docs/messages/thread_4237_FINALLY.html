<br>
I've finally got it done! I had a few of you guys ask me to let you <br>
know when I did get it done, so here is the announcement;<br>
<br>
My Vietnam Series is now out and in place, with clues on both LBNA and <br>
AQ. The official title is "To Those That Served in Vietnam" <br>
<br>
I carved these stamps back on December 1st and December 3rd of last <br>
year. They are the 4th - 7th stamps I ever carved. <br>
<br>
They've sat there long enough and today, during my lunch break got them <br>
in place. Hope you all can get a chance to come out and enjoy all the <br>
Quad Cities has to offer :-)<br>

I just checked out your listing for the Vietnam Veterans. Thank you. <br>
This is quite a tribute. I graduated from high school in 1968.We had a <br>
large class of 575 students. 28 of my classmates died in Vietnam. I <br>
lost my brother-in-law to Vietnam and my fiance was MIA for a few <br>
years. This was a hard war on everyone. I for one want to thank all of <br>
who served to keep us safe and free. God bless you all.<br>

of thought and care into every word and it shows!  This is an <br>
outstanding tribute to our Vietnam Vets!  I really hope I get to Iowa at <br>
some point---but if not, and you CAN make it to the All-Military Event <br>
on November 10th (OH)---I'd LOVE to have you bring those stamps with <br>
you!!  (shameless hint!)  =)<br>
<br>
God bless from me as well!<br>
