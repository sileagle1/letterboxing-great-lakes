So sorry we weren't able to meet this time, but maybe in the future!  We went looking for the 2 Narnia boxes this past Saturday and saw your stamp in the log books.  Believe it or not, I think 2 other people/groups found those stamps before we made it there Saturday afternoon.<br>
<br>
Hope the rest of your trip is smooth & safe!<br>
