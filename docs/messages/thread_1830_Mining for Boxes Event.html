We really couldn't have done it without you.  It was a great bunch of people and we really couldn't have asked for better weather.  Unfortunately, not everyone remembered to stamp into the gathering logbook so I can't be 100% sure about the attendance...but according to the stamp exchanges an my memory, we had 10 adults, 4 children, and 2 dogs from Illinois and Indiana.  In addition, Sprite and Highlander from New York were unable to attend but were kind enough to send us a box for this event.  And a special thanks to Ruth of Team Red Handed for remembering to bring a camera and being our photographer.  <br/>
<br/>
There was one official event stamp, one roaming event stamp, and three absolutely awsome surprise event stamps brought by Team Red Handed.  The Blue Dog roaming event stamp raised $40 for hurricane relief at this event.  There were boxes placed by 5 different people for this event, all but two of them permenant.  Those of you who couldn't make the gathering, be on the lookout for clues to these permenant boxes sometime in the next week or two.<br/>
<br/>
This was my first experience hosting a gathering and I hope that everyone enjoyed attending as much as I enjoyed hosting!  Thanks again to all of the people who made this event a success.  I will post pictures to the pictures section as soon as Ruth sends me some.  See you on the trails!<br/>

Katy for hosting this event.  It was a wonderful time<br/>
with some great stamps, some wonderful hikes, and a<br/>

<br/>
This was my first gathering and it was everything I<br/>
hoped that it would be.  I can't wait to see everyone<br/>
again, as well as some new people at the next event I<br/>
am able to make it to.<br/>

Thanks again,<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
