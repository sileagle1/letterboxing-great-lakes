                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since the weather this year has been a bit warm, I figured it is never <br>
too early to start maintaining boxes.<br>
<br>
Continuing in the tradition of Dragon (and later Springchick), I'm <br>
sponsoring a box maintenance prize for 2013 similar to last year.<br>
<br>
The idea is that everyone should go out and check their clues and boxes <br>
to make sure that they are still accurate and in good shape. Do your <br>
part to end 'Attempted Finds!'<br>
<br>
I started a database 'Box Maintenance 2013' where you can list any box <br>
that you have recently maintained. For each box you maintain, you get <br>
one entry into a drawing that will happen sometime in April (TBD). The <br>
winner will get a great, letterboxing related, prize!<br>
<br>
For a box to qualify:<br>
<br>
1) You (or a member of your 'team') must be the person to visit a box <br>
that you own.<br>
2) You must physically check that the clue is accurate, the stamp and <br>
logbook are intact and in good shape, and that the box container is <br>
intact. If any part is incomplete, you need to fix it by March 31st to <br>
be counted.  If the box is gone, or you are not going to fix it, the box <br>
can be counted if the status is changed to 'Retired' or 'Unknown.'<br>
3) You must do maintenance between 1/1/13 and 3/31/13.<br>
4) A box must have been plated before 1/1/13 to be counted.<br>
5) Like most letterboxing finds, finds are recorded on the honor system.<br>
<br>
Go find YOUR boxes!<br>
<br>
On a personal note, team Atomic Beans was out this past weekend doing <br>
maintenance on our 2006 series 'Singing and Boxing.'  I'm happy to <br>
report that 3 were fine, 1 was replanted, and only one was missing.<br>
