He has only visited one Great Lakes state so far.  Here is his Indiana entry for those that may have missed it:<br>
<br>
My Fellow Letterboxers,<br>
<br>
Arriving at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, I turned in the brand new not so shiny silver Lincoln Towncar and boarded US Airways to Indianapolis. Picking out a nice sensible Ford Taurus, I drove across town and checked into the local Motel 6. Unfortunately, being so close to the New Year, it was the only place available. I only have one word to say on the matter. Dive.<br>
<br>
New Years Eve I partied in true style at the Blu Martini. The highlights of the evening were the psychic, sushi and the martinis, not necessarily in that order.<br>
<br>
Two days later I headed on over to Bloomington, home of the Elizabeth Sage Historic Costume Collection. Poison Ivy was there, slinking around in (what he called) disguise. Wearing K-Mart specials, I almost did not recognize him. Der Mad Stamper had sent him on a mission to obtain, by hook or crook, the tip-toez gold glitter and vinyl sandals. Poison Ivy was more interested in the silk Garden Coat. Said his dear sister would look divine in it. Neither was for sale and the last I saw he was being dragged, sobbing, out the door by the security guards.<br>
<br>
Shaking the image of Poison Ivy and his poor taste of clothing out of my mind, I made tracks for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Snowshoeing through six miles of trail was an invigorating experience. The Dunes include forests, marsh, river, bog, and shifting sands, making for interesting terrain.<br>
<br>
The Hoosier Uplands is a land of rolling hills; it is also the home of wineries. It is also time for the Third Annual Winter With the Wineries. Visiting all eight wineries on the list, taking full advantage of their free samples, and collecting my free gifts made for a jolly good time. But, I did not come here to talk about sushi, sandals, dunes or wine; I came to talk letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Pathetic, Indiana, pathetic. Over 600 letterboxes in the state and only 25 are mysteries. That is not even worth talking percentages. On the brighter side, there are some very conscientious boxers in this state. The boxes are well-maintained and well-hidden, with good containers. Keep up the good work. Add more mysteries and you will be in excellent shape. Hiking Indiana in the summer requires some good insect repellent; the mosquitoes are fierce. In the winter months, stay away from the shelf ice; it is extremely dangerous. When<br>
walking the shores always stay on solid ground. Any time of year wear<br>
appropriate footwear. Boots are good for hiking around quarries and rough trails. Keep your ankles safe.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br>
<br>
The states he has visited so far are:  HI, NC, UT, AZ, NM, CO , TX, FL, VA, IN, WV, KY.  If you'd like to see all the posts and perhaps make some sense of them, you can see them on the "big board":<br>

Yes, but he hasn't posted a TRIP REPORT from that state, only from the states I listed.  The states that he planted mystery boxes in don't necessarily correspond to the states he is reporting from.  I've solved a few from other states and they are also states he hasn't mentioned in his travel diary yet....<br>
<br>

<br>
P.S. At least 2 of his mystery boxes are in IL.<br>

I see you have done your research. Amazing. As I am sure you have heard, I am out a secretary. Interested in the job? <br>
 <br>
Has anyone ever made sense of the big board posts? If you have, let me be the first to congratulate you.  I would agree with Wisconsin Hiker on this one; read the posts on the big board. If that is too intimidating for you, there is the Newboxers List and the Atlas Quest Mysterious Capers and Sneaky Stuff Board. <br>
 <br>
I aim to please and mystify. <br>

<br>
Speaking of this region, today he posted another missive from a GREAT Lakes<br>
state.  Here's his report from Illinois:<br>
<br>
My Fellow Letterboxers,<br>
<br>
I arrived at Kickapoo State Park on a chilly March afternoon. In 1939 this<br>
was nothing but ugly, strip-mined land for the past 90 years. Today it is<br>
one of the state's most popular, not to mention interesting, state parks.<br>
You can hike, fish, ski, and scuba dive here. I highly recommend the Out &<br>
Back.<br>
<br>
April 7th found me in The Windy City, U.S. Cellular Field to be exact. Home<br>
opener day for the Chicago White Sox against their division rival Minnesota<br>
Twins. Excitement built during the third inning when the White Sox manager,<br>
Ozzie Guillen, was ejected from the game. Umpires don't like being argued<br>
with. To Guillen's credit, this made the 13th time he had been ejected from<br>
a game. White Sox won the game, 7-4, thanks to a seventh inning grand slam<br>
from Joe Crede. Treating myself to an after game celebration, I dined at the<br>
Les Nomades. I could have bought a McDonalds for what I paid for that meal.<br>
<br>
Olney is proud town; proud of their white squirrels. So proud that they have<br>
city ordinances making it illegal to hunt, shoot, pursue, lure, kill,<br>
destroy, capture, spear, trap, harass, attempt to harass, or kidnap any of<br>
the squirrels. Well, I went on down to Olney to check out the monument<br>
honoring these white squirrels. What I found was the Olney police were<br>
proud; proud they had arrested Dragonrider for harassing the squirrels. Now<br>
the story, as I heard it, was that Dragonrider was trying to get the<br>
squirrels to show him where the letterboxes were hidden. Figured if a<br>
squirrel could find them, so could he. I must add that neither the police<br>
nor the squirrels were impressed with his manners that day. By the way,<br>
Dragonrider, you still owe me that bail money.<br>
<br>
You have not danced until you have polkaed. You don't know polka until you<br>
know Danny Krausz, Polka King of Southern Illinois. I have danced, and I<br>
know Danny. Heard he was playing in Riverton so I put on my dancing shoes<br>
and headed in that direction. German beer, German polka, and German women<br>
were on the agenda. The night lived up to its expectation, good music, fine<br>
dancing, and lovely women. As they say, "Polka people are happy people."<br>
But, I did not come here to talk about scuba diving, umpires, squirrels or<br>
polka; I came to talk letterboxing.<br>
<br>
There are enough Letterboxes in Illinois to keep you going for a while,<br>
around 550 - unless you are looking for mysteries, around 45. A fair number,<br>
but not nearly enough. Illinois, keep up the good work in the planting.<br>
Better find those letterboxes while they are still there; seems the cheap<br>
containers are taking over. Use a good sturdy container, such as lock n<br>
lock, and you can't go wrong. Camo is another good idea, tape or paint. As<br>
always, when hiking, be aware of your environment. Use a stick to poke<br>
around in holes before placing your hand. There are four poisonous snakes in<br>
Illinois: the Copperhead, the Water Moccasin, the Timber Rattlesnake, and<br>
the Swamp Rattler. Although they are rare, it is still wise to play it safe.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br>

I *wish* I got around more...if I was out on the trails, I'd have less time to hang around yahoo lists.  <sigh><br>
<br>
I am going to WI this weekend with Mr. FW to attend a wedding, but alas, have been informed there is no time for letterboxing.  Or so he thinks.  I may not have time to find one, but I will make time to place one...at least temporarily.  In cooperation with WiHi and MM, I'm leaving a box for them to rehide in a better location than where I leave it.  Who knows, maybe it will even become a mystery?<br>

No time for letterboxing? You must surely jest! Does this Mr. FW need an attitude adjustment?<br>

Maybe it will even become a mystery? Are you always this indecisive? Try this Fungus Woman: It will become a mystery. Now, doesn't that feel better?<br>
