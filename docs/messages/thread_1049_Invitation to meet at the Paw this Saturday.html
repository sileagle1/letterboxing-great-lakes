Remember, all you Wisconsinians.you can pick up the train in Kenosha, take<br>
it down to Chicago, get over to Union Station and head out to Brookfield for<br>
$5.00 (and it's good all weekend).  We're just a few blocks from the zoo,<br>
too!<br>

The Metra IS a great deal and I'm hoping they follow through with the idea<br>
to extend the line to Milwaukee.  However we won't be able to join you<br>
Saturday since we'll be heading out to plant a box in Mexico.  It should be<br>
interesting and we'll include a "Do not Remove" note in two languages.<br>

P.S.  We're looking forward to some boxing weekends in IL this spring.<br>

OH!  If you have time, swing down to central IL...we should have plenty of boxes for you by then.  I hope to plant my fish series soon.  That's 11 boxes right there plus one already in the park I'm planting them at.<br>
