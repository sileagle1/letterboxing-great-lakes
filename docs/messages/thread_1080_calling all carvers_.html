Hi<br>
<br>
We're in Houston, TX this weekend hoping to hit a few boxes tomorrow <br>
near Zube Park (just north of Houston). I had the chance to go on <br>
line and check out the lbglk site for recent posts. <br>
<br>
Anyway, this post is directed to all of you boxers looking for some <br>
good places to hide boxes. The northern suburbs north of chicago <br>
could REALLY could use some more letterboxes. We have some really <br>
great nature trails just waiting to have boxes planted along them. <br>
<br>
So, if you're looking for suggestions, recommendations of where to <br>
hide some boxes and feel like traveling to the "northern suburbs" e-<br>
mail me and I can give you some suggestions, ideas and even <br>
directions to places that you could plant them.<br>
<br>
You may be asking yourselves - why we don't just plant some <br>
ourselves - the answer is - we're new to this hobby and our kids are <br>
still little, but I'd love to plant at least one this year - that's <br>
my "realistic" goal. <br>
<br>
The Honor Guard :)<br>
