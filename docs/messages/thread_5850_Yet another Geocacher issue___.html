I am mostly posting this here to let those of you with boxes in the Winnebago Lake area to watch out, since at least one geocacher up there thinks it is okay to take over another person's boxes.  I get the impression that he thinks a box is "abandoned" if it has not been logged into for about 6 months (which is pretty typical for the winter months if you think about it...).<br>

My heart goes out to you.  For a long time I've had the suspicion that you are out numbered in an area that is more heavily populated with more geocachers than letterboxers, and this might account for the problems you continue to have.  I hope you can convince this person to leave the letterboxes alone.  Maybe BIG labels that say..."This is NOT a geocach" could help. It would be nice if this geocach gathering coordinator would ask guests to be respectful of any letterboxes they happen to find.  You certainly don't want to give them the box locations, but some seekers might print clues prior to the event anyway if they do both hobbies.  <br>

Good luck buddy! <br>

It just so happens I recieved another geocacher email today (the 5th that I can remember, but all were in regards to totally different boxes).  Here's the note:<br>

Message: <br>
While out geocaching today I stumbled upon one of your boxes..(Holly)  Was in good shape and contents were dry.. I've never looked into letterboxing before and this may just be the start...  A nice way to play the same type of game we do...<br>
