Depending on what else you like to do when letterboxing, I can suggest Milford area for cemetery drive-bys, window-shopping and easy access to the Little Miami Bike Path.  We loved California Woods for the hilly hiking, and if you are near Hamilton (Butler County), Pyramid Sculpture Park is a great place to visit.  Indian Hill has some great parks and preserves too.  There are plenty of quirky letterbox locations in the mix as well if you like Griswold stops.  Be sure to check the larger parks for box availability.  It's been a long time, but they may still be available.  I highly recommend visiting the Conservatory in Eden Park.  Kentucky is a stone's throw, so if getting "another state" is important, you can easily manage to find some there.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just 75 miles NW of Cincinnati and I visit often.  Still have a few to get in Loveland and French Park.  I expect those to be good outings.<br/>
<br/>
I won't call out the Ohio boxers, but rest assured, there are some INKY boxers that would show up from time to time.<br/>
