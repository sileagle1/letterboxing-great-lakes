patiently waited for Martini Man to get home before we opened the "booty"<br>
box.  SpringChick had placed two bags of goodies inside, one labeled with my<br>
name (for the perimeter) and the other with Martini Man's name (for full<br>
card).<br>
<br>
My bag included a nice assortment of ink pads & logbooks, some small LnL's<br>
and another cylindrical container for a small box.  It also included a cool<br>
handmade zipper pull/key ring that included macram twine, beads that<br>
spelled out LBNA and some other colorful beads.  (I already put this on my<br>
pack! ) Other useful items included carving material, a small first aid kit,<br>
some "wet wipe" type cloths to clean our inky hands, and some clips that we<br>
are guessing could be used for cooties.  Watch out at the next gathering!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks to SpringChick for organizing the game and thanks to all the players<br>
who donated such nice prizes!<br>

We suppose we have to soften our disappointment in not getting the socks due to the fact <br>
that you had a particularly grueling and disappointing day!  We're all for whatever it takes <br>
to get MM out of a funk...But the socks must have catapulted him clear out of the <br>
doldrums and into the euphoric!  All we can say is, "TAKE A HIKE!"<br>
<br>
Actually, We've been waiting for all the winners to get their booty before posting.  Spring <br>
Chick hand delivered our bag of goodies to us at the Forest Fairies:Spring Awakening <br>
Gathering.  As she handed over the beautiful gift bag packed with all sorts of wonderful <br>
letterboxing stuff, she carefully explained that the package did not have the SOCKS <br>
included....that it was TRADITION for the full card winner to get the socks, and we were in <br>
fact the second place winners.  We all know you don't mess with the Chick and Tradition!<br>
<br>
I immediately knew that Martini Man was on my hit list and I was going to have to <br>
challenge him on the coveted socks.  But, as I peered into the bag my disappointment <br>
quickly melted with the sight of the cutest handmade knit hat by Maid Marion of the Robin <br>
Hood & Merry Men clan! How easily we change affection! <br>
<br>
And as luck would have it, Mrs Doglvrs was on the trail with us and asked if we would be <br>
willing to barter something for another pair of socks...Tiptoe contemplated trading in <br>
Tonto who wasn't doing a very good job finding boxes that day, but reconsidered after <br>
thinking she would have to drive home alone that evening. It was established that Tiptoe <br>
would come up with an art piece for her.  Mr. Doglvrs assured us she can whip knit those <br>
babies out pretty quick...Tonto knowing Tiptoe's speed at getting anything <br>
done...remarked under his breath..Take your time!<br>
<br>
We thank all of you who contributed such wonderful gifts..who could think that there <br>
would be so many different things...lock n'locks, PZCut, gift card, markers, papers, <br>
logbooks, ink stamps, compass, an Atlas Quest patch, camo tape..Oh boy was it great!  We <br>
loved it all!  It almost makes one wish for winter again just so we can get back to BINGO! <br>
And, I really want to wear that hat!<br>
Tiptoe....and Tonto<br>

I immediately knew that Martini Man was on my hit list and I was going to have to <br>
challenge him on the coveted socks. But, as I peered into the bag my disappointment <br>
quickly melted with the sight of the cutest handmade knit hat by Maid Marion of the Robin <br>
Hood & Merry Men clan! How easily we change affection! <br>
<br>
And as luck would have it, Mrs Doglvrs was on the trail with us and asked if we would be <br>
willing to barter something for another pair of socks...Tiptoe contemplated trading in <br>
Tonto who wasn't doing a very good job finding boxes that day, but reconsidered after <br>
thinking she would have to drive home alone that evening. It was established that Tiptoe <br>
would come up with an art piece for her. Mr. Doglvrs assured us she can whip knit those <br>
babies out pretty quick...Tonto knowing Tiptoe's speed at getting anything <br>
done...remarked under his breath..Take your time!<br>
<br>
We thank all of you who contributed such wonderful gifts..who could think that there <br>
would be so many different things...lock n'locks, PZCut, gift card, markers, papers, <br>
logbooks, ink stamps, compass, an Atlas Quest patch, camo tape..Oh boy was it great! We <br>
loved it all! It almost makes one wish for winter again just so we can get back to BINGO! <br>
And, I really want to wear that hat!<br>
Tiptoe....and Tonto<br>

We suppose we have to soften our disappointment in not getting the socks due<br>
to the fact <br>
that you had a particularly grueling and disappointing day! We're all for<br>
whatever it takes <br>
to get MM out of a funk...But the socks must have catapulted him clear out<br>
of the <br>
doldrums and into the euphoric! All we can say is, "TAKE A HIKE!"<br>
<br>
Actually, We've been waiting for all the winners to get their booty before<br>
posting. Spring <br>
Chick hand delivered our bag of goodies to us at the Forest Fairies:Spring<br>
Awakening <br>
Gathering. As she handed over the beautiful gift bag packed with all sorts<br>
of wonderful <br>
letterboxing stuff, she carefully explained that the package did not have<br>
the SOCKS <br>
included....that it was TRADITION for the full card winner to get the socks,<br>
and we were in <br>
fact the second place winners. We all know you don't mess with the Chick and<br>
Tradition!<br>
<br>
I immediately knew that Martini Man was on my hit list and I was going to<br>
have to <br>
challenge him on the coveted socks. But, as I peered into the bag my<br>

Oh, we know what you can do!...Tonto is a whopping size 13...I'm sure they will fit without <br>
washing.  But, better yet, wash them in VERY hot water, put them in a VERY hot dryer and they <br>
just might shrink enough to fit Tiptoe's size 6! <br>

The hat is AWESOME!  I really, really do love it!  It has to become a tradition in it's own right!<br>
Thanks so much for sharing your incredible handiwork.  Also, I forgot to mention how much  <br>
I appreciated the cute LBNA macrame key bob that was handmade by the Bingo Queen <br>
herself!  Homemade things are the best!<br>
