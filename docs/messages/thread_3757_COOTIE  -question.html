Hi there!<br>
I've never been to a gathering,s o I've not been infected with one of <br>
these things.  I understand what it is.  But, just out of curiosity, <br>
is there a log that goes with it?  Can you tell where it originated <br>
from?  Do you log your "finds"?<br>

to stamp in with a finger or thumb print, then make a little artwork <br>

the name of the original creator at the front.  In my opinion they <br>
are a "miscellaneous" stamp, not something you would count as <br>
a "find".<br>
<br>
Here are the definitions from the Glossary on the LBNA site and <br>
AtlasQuest:<br>
<br>
Cootie: A small letterbox that is passed surreptitously from <br>
letterboxer to letterboxer. As created by Pandora and Camp Fire Lady, <br>
cooties originally began as an activity for kids at letterboxing <br>
gatherings, in which kids recorded their thumbprints in a cootie and <br>
secretly passed it along to another child or adult. Cooties have <br>
evolved into a very small letterbox that can be hidden in a pocket or <br>
backpack of another letterboxer, and thus travel from individual to <br>
individual. <br>
<br>
Cootie: A relatively new type of letterbox where one tries to sneak <br>
around hiding the box on another personperhaps in an open backpack <br>
or jacket pocket. Once you 'catch a cootie', you stamp in and try to <br>
pawn it off onto another unsuspecting letterboxer. Cooties are often <br>
signed into with the stamp of your thumb or fingers that you draw on <br>
to embellish instead of the traditional signature stamp, though many <br>
people use signature stamps as well.<br>

P.S.  As I posted in my earlier report about the weekend, we ended up <br>
going home with SIX of these guys!  We're hoping to get to an event <br>
in San Diego next month, so plan to release them then...<br>
