early '70s and before; Janis Joplin, Elvis, Buddy Holly, The Beatles, <br>
the list goes on.<br>
<br>
I'm having trouble drumming up "business" for this ring so figured I'd <br>
present you all with an opportunity to join. Please let me know who <br>
you're going to carve so that there are no duplicates. <br>

P.S. Just to brag on my son a little, there's the cutest picture EVER <br>
of him on our blog (second one down, beneath my funny faced hand <br>
wound). http://www.hartx6.blogspot.com/<br>

LOL, yeah right!<br>
<br>
Actually I looked at your blog a couple of days ago and thought that Maddie<br>
getting her pants on all by herself was the cutest thing.  Since a talented<br>
little cutie!  Pretty soon she'll be telling you she wants her own trailname<br>
like her big sisters.<br>
