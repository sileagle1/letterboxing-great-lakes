Yes, they have ridges and the "wings" snap over all four sides of the box.  The lid fits firmly in place because the bottom of the box fits into a groove in the lid where the seal is located.  <br>
<br>
I have a basic method for 'testing' boxes before I buy them.  I seal them and then squeeze them and listen if any air escapes.  Some food storage containers don't seal well.  I did not hear any air escaping from these boxes, so I bought some....well, actually I bought a dozen.  The boxes are crystal clear and the top of the lid is relatively flat - good for attaching identification labels. <br>

I have on favorite Dollar Tree in Wauconda/Island Lake area in Illinois because it's always well stocked to the ceiling.  I haven't been there recently.  The best thing about these boxes is the design.  It's virtually impossible to leave a corner open for water to seep in.  Some boxes are difficult to open and therefore the boxes don't always get sealed properly.  Not the fault of the finders, as a placer I feel it's in my own best interest to use a securely sealing container.  <br>

Checked at lunch and unfortunately none to be found at the Dollar Tree <br>
near my office.  It isn't a very big store and they only had a small <br>
supply of a different type of container that didn't looked like it <br>
sealed very well.<br>

<br>
I went to the Dollar Tree store here and was disappointed that they <br>
didn't have any of these.  However, I did try "Dollar General" and they <br>
had some Farberware brand containers (1.9 cup size).  Like lock-n-locks, <br>
the lids have flaps with slots on 4 sides that go over the tabs sticking <br>
out from the base container.<br>
<br>
Has anyone tested Farberware brand containers?<br>
