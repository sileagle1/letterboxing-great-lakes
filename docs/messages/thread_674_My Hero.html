                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I get this e-mail on Sunday from Agent Ink and Z-fan saying that <br>
my Creatures of Blackhawk #1 boxes have gone missing. Taking their <br>
place, scattered around the area, are beer bottles. Well, it was my <br>
first box gone missing, so I was a little upset, but at the same time <br>
I realized that it would have happened eventually. Isn't that how it <br>
usually works? You make a few successful ones, and some go missing? <br>
Anyway, I told my boyfriend (who recently became a letterboxer <br>
too...Manic Mechanic) about it that night when I talked to him on the <br>
phone. Well, yesterday I get a call from him telling me that he has <br>
good news. Guess what!? He found one of the boxes! He found the first <br>
of the two boxes thrown quite a ways from where it was supposed to <br>
be. The second of the two, which was a micro-box, is still missing. <br>
So now, for finding one of my boxes, he is my letterboxing hero. :) <br>
(insert Awwwwww... here) Because of the telltale clothing items left <br>
in the area, I'm not too sure if I want the micro-box back. ;) <br>
Whoever has that one, can keep it. I can make a new one.<br>
