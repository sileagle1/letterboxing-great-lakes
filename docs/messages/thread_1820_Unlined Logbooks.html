                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been finding all kinds of very cool - big to tiny unlined log <br/>
books at my favorite book store BAMM (Books a millsion).  I also found <br/>
some with plastic covers at Borders - look carefully as some there are <br/>
lined and some unlined in the Paperchase section.<br/>
<br/>
But BAMM has all kinds - I'm using a leather covered one with beige <br/>
pages for my personal logbook.  <br/>
<br/>
Another place or spot I should say that I have found them is at the <br/>
Target 1 Spot as you walk in.  I found some in RI at Christmas Time and <br/>
Toledo in March.  Again, all sizes.<br/>

Ha!  I bought both of those items at Meijer last week.  Those unlined books are great.  When I <br/>
refitted Giant Coaster, I was able to easily but snugly fit one of those books, an ink pad, and <br/>
the stamp into one of the small square Lock'n'Locks.  It works so well.<br/>
