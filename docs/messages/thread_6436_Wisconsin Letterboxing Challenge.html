<br>
Here's the story - last summer we planted 5 letterboxes along the East River Trail in Wisconsin between Green Bay and DePere.  They cover approximately 6 miles of the trail. I took notes, but they didn't make any sense when I went to write the clues.    We went out this weekend and now we can't find them, can't even remember where we put them!<br>
<br>
Here's the challenge - Find our missing letterboxes and help me figure out my notes!  I'll send you the typed up version of my obscure notes as a guide.<br>
<br>
Anybody up for the challenge???<br>
