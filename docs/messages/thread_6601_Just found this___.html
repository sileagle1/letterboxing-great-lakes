Clues are fairly old and we will need to rely on Google translation (I love that automatic language translation feature but it doesn't get all the words), but we may try a few.  Anybody out there know Finnish???<br/>

when trolls were: measuring over 73 feet! Ummoinen fish very fortunate not<br/>

sunny day rose into the sky suddenly a large black thundercloud. Sauli and<br/>
Taina htkhtneet are tiny, but continued quietly angling, although the<br/>
thunder jyrhteli quite close. But then the cloud began to vihmomaan<br/>

Trolls meloivat wildly in the west end of Lake soukkaan, ruuhen pulled<br/>
