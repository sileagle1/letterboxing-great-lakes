                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fall in many parts of the country, the Great Lakes area included <br>
means color touring.  I remember as a kid my parents loading us in <br>
the car and heading north for the weekend, following two-tracks and <br>
what my dad used to call "fire trails" through the woods of northern <br>
Michigan collecting leaves and enjoying those last few days of <br>
sunshine before winter set in.<br>
<br>
I continued the tradition as I went each fall camping in Michigan's <br>
Upper Peninsula on what I called my "hike and write" trip.  For many <br>
years I went for 4-5 days alone and spent my days hiking to <br>
waterfalls, lighthouses, lakes and babbling brooks, and the evenings <br>
writing by the light of the campfire.  Over the years I have met <br>
some really interesting people and learned a lot about myself and my <br>
world on these trips.  The past few years OldShoe has come with me <br>
and letterboxing has been a big part of the trip.  Regardless if I <br>
am alone or with a friend, the U.P. is my autumn place -- my place <br>
to enjoy the halcyon days.<br>
<br>
So where is your autumn place?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My autumn place is anyplace north of where I'm at (SE Wisconsin).  In <br>
past years it's been Michigan's upper peninsula, our family cabin <br>
near Hayward, Minoqua, Devil's Lake (near Madison) and other closer <br>
locations for quick weekend trips.  This year it looks like a trip to <br>
Door County with my husband (the non-boxer) and kids (the on/off <br>
boxers).  I'm planning the trip out now and will attempt to include <br>
as many letterboxes as my companions will allow.  <br>
<br>
Fall is an awesome time of year - I've always loved it (I'm a <br>
sweatshirt person at heart), but since becoming an adult I've had <br>
some pretty awful experiences in the fall of the year.  You know, <br>
despite them, the beauty of the season still comes shining through.  <br>
Isn't that amazing?<br>
