called 17th Street north of Brookfield, in North Riverside and <br>
Broadview.<br>
<br>
Probably the easiest way to find it is to come from Ogden Avenue (US <br>
34)(west of First Ave/ IL Rt 171),  Take Maple north, over the <br>
Burlington tracks to the Circle - maybe about a mile north of Ogden.<br>
