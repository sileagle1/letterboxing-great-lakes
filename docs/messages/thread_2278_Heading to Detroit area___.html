                    <div class="plaintext-content">  We'll be heading to Warren, MI from NW Indiana hopefully Friday <br>
evening. We're going to pick up a fish tank and are planning on <br>
spending the night somewhere along the way.<br>
<br>
  I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on boxes to attempt <br>
on the way. We have 2 children ages 5 and 2 so please keep that in <br>
mind although they are very adventurous. LOL Obviously weather could <br>
also be a factor but we're hopeful that we can get some boxing in <br>
this coming weekend.<br>
<br>
 Things here are still quite crazy and we're still working on <br>
getting everything returned to order from the fire so I don't know <br>
how much time I'll have to look for box clues before we go.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any suggestions and if you are somewhere along <br>
the way and would be interested in meeting up we'd love to hear from <br>
you. We're not quite set on our schedule yet we're still working out <br>
the details of picking up the tank. I'm hoping to just enjoy the <br>
weekend boxing. <br>

miles north of Warren).  I just checked up on them last Thursday, and <br>
they were all hibernating peacefully!<br>
