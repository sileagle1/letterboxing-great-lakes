 I think you should absolutely contact them.  Explain that this isn't <br>
 the spirit of letterboxing and that it takes out most of the fun, as <br>
 well as endangers the boxes.  Contact the main number of the <br>
 organizers, but also, I'd email all of the finders that you know of <br>
 within this group to explain it, too.  Maybe if you reach enough of <br>
 them, it'll sink in and the word will spread among them.<br>
 <br>
 Also, please let us know which town this is originating from and post <br>
 links to the newspaper article you mentioned and to whatever else <br>
 they've posted.  Maybe others here are interested in contacting them as well.<br>
 <br>
 I have one box in Mid-Michigan that concerns me.  It's technically a <br>
 mystery box, but if someone figures out where it is and just posts <br>
 the exact location to the box, it'll be in jeopardy, too.  Plus, I'm <br>
 only a couple hours from you, so when they run out of boxes in your <br>
 area, it's conceivable that they'll head this way.<br>
 <br>
 I found one of your boxes recently and the stamp was awesome.  I plan <br>
 on coming back over there to find the rest sometime, so I'd hate to <br>
 see them be destroyed.  I was pretty surprised at the number of <br>
 log-ins in the log book when I was there, but now that you mention <br>
 this, that explains a lot!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know all the rest of us in the GLK region are reading these messages <br>
and just shaking our heads with you.  This is just hard to comprehend <br>
and it sounds like this has been happening without any advance contact <br>
or communication. <br>
<br>
Bali---Your thoughts about what to do at this point sound very <br>
reasonable and well-thought out. These folks just might not realize the <br>
effects of what they are doing.  Having it "sink in" is a great way to <br>
think about passing on some education!<br>
<br>
I saw the next post of asking if phone numbers should be posted <br>
here---and even though what they are doing is not right---I don't think <br>
those phone number should be posted.  Private email would be <br>
better---otherwise as any of you are talking to these folks---you won't <br>
have a foot to stand on---or at least that is the way they might see <br>
it.  Personally, I do think trailnames would be more than fair game. <br>
<br>
I hope you all can put the brakes on this before the damage becomes even <br>
worse!  Please keep the rest of us updated!  Lots of crazy things are <br>
happening!!  Good luck!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you have their "hotline" number (and if it has been posted publicly in other locations such as the article you mentioned) I would think that would be fair game for posting to this list.  Any other, private, phone numbers I don't think are appropriate for this list.  I don't think anyone should post someone else's personal information on the internet without their permission.  I don't think trail names are personal information as they are "posted" in logbooks and often online, but real names are.  If they have a website, I would think that would be fair game too.<br>
