It was quickly picked up by some veteran Michigan boxers, Soleil &amp; Odenate, and moved on to another west Michigan box where it wintered-over and was found in the spring, by SpringChick!.<br/>
<br/>
The next few months were hectic, but it finally found itself in the hands of well known CT boxers, Mark &amp; Sue Pepe. A number of east coasters moved the little guy along, including at stop at the Mansfield Monster Mash Gathering of 2004.<br/>
Then it experienced a few hand-offs in NY before it again made a Great Lakes appearance (via a TrailTroll connection).<br/>
It next traveled to Florida where it was placed in a mystery box.<br/>
There it sat. <br/>
And sat. <br/>
And sat.<br/>
It apparently rested for SEVEN years before it was found!<br/>
<br/>
I recently had a report from Candy Girl (from GA) that she had found it.<br/>
I asked to have it returned to me so I could review the logbook. I had no idea that I'd find such an interesting history.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: don't give up on those mystery boxes that never get found, or your wayward hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
And, BTW, the stamp and logbook were in pristine condition.<br/>
For old-timers on this list, it was the same type of container that was used for "Around the World in 80 Days".<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's great to hear! We still have several boxes of ours that have never been found and some contain a HH, just waiting for someone to venture out on a hike.<br/>
<br/>
We also are doing some mystery boxes in AX this week.  We enjoy the challenge of a good clue as much as the challenge of a good hike!<br/>
<br/>
We hope we might see you at the GLG this year!<br/>
