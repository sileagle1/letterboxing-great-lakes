Also, the Birds of a Feather CD of bird songs arrived safe and sound.  <br/>
The CD was a special treat!  And, tucked deeply in the envelope was a <br/>
tiny container....September Cootie!  How sweet of you to send me an <br/>
extra little present.  When cooties travel through the mail they are <br/>
called FLEAS.  Well, it's just another Lb term.  A cootie is a cootie <br/>
is a cootie. LOL!<br/>
