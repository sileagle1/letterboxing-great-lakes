I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the response given by <br>
BindleBabe in regards to listing HH's, unlisted letterboxes and <br>
online logging.<br>
<br>
As for AtlasQuest...  I think there are fewer users from our area on <br>
AQ than from the PNW and the East Coast, in part because there are <br>
fewer letterboxers in the this region than those, but also perhaps <br>
because we have this talk list and don't feel the need for the <br>
message boards provided there.<br>
<br>
As for listing boxes at AQ, at one time I had my boxes listed there <br>
but have recently removed them because I simply do not have the time <br>
to maintain clues in multiple places and prefer to use <br>
letterboxing.org as it is the original/official LbNA clue site.  I <br>
think that Ryan has done a fantastic job with the AQ site and <br>
applaud his generous contribution of time and talent to the <br>
letterboxing community.  I maintain my membership at AQ and peek in <br>
from time to time, but I am not a regular user.  To me AQ is like <br>
some of the new features on letterboxing.org -- not really necessary <br>
to play the game, just nice-to-haves, and a person can take them or <br>
leave them and use them as suits their needs.<br>
