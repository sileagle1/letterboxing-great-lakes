<br>
We are writing to fill you all in on some maintenance for our boxes.<br>
We temporarily pulled "Illinois State Bird," since it has become water-<br>
logged and desperately needs a new box and logbook.<br>
<br>
We also checked on "Ceci n'est pas une boite de lettre" and discovered<br>
that the cemetary has trimmed the bush, for the first time it at least<br>
3 years. Anyway, the box suffered the same fate as the extra branches<br>
and will need to be recarved and replanted...in a new spot since<br>
the cover of the bush is now gone. Bummer, it had just been found on <br>
Sunday last weekend and was fine.  What a difference a week makes!  We <br>
will let you all know when this box is operational again.<br>
<br>
We have been getting conflicting reports about our "I Heart Haring"<br>
series, but have not yet had a chance to check on this series.<br>
Hopefully we'll get out there this week.<br>
<br>
"Stick a Fork in Me" is also missing and will need to be recarved and <br>
replanted.<br>
<br>
We'll keep you posted.<br>
