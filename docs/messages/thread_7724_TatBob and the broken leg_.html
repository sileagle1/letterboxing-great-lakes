   Just wanted to let everyone know how he is doing.  Surgery went very <br>
well.  We have been to 2 post op appointments.  The X-rays show the bone is <br>
healing very nicely.  He is now able to start range of motion physical <br>
therapy.  Still can not put weight on his leg but just being able to bend it <br>
is making a world of difference in his outlook.  The nice weather is doing <br>
wonders too.  He has figured out how to do almost everything, getting on and <br>
off the bed and sofa, up and down the stairs, and getting dressed, by <br>
himself.  He just can’t put his sock and shoe on that side.  No driving <br>
either.  He is still going a bit stir crazy, but doing much better.  Thank <br>
you for all the great cards, emails and texts.  All the good vibes make him <br>
feel loved.  His next appointment is in a month, I will let ya’ll know how <br>
it goes.<br>
