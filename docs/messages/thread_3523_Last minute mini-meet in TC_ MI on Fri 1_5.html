in the area by late afternoon tomorrow (Fri 1/5):<br>
<br>
You're invited to join Webfoot (owner of Stampeaz - the PZkut place)<br>
and myself at Horizon Books (downstairs) around 5pm.  <br>
<br>
Paula in Interlochen ... are you out there? (grin)<br>
<br>
Webfoot is visiting family in the area, we're meeting for an exchange<br>
and thought it would be fun to see if we could get a last-minute<br>
mini-meet together. We might leave the book store and go for some<br>
noshing, who knows.  Sorry for no advanced notice, sometimes that's<br>
just how things work out ... still hope you can join us. Bring your<br>
signature stamp and logbook!<br>
<br>
Here is the info for Horizon Books, in downtown Traverse City:<br>
243 E. Front St. phone: (231) 946-7290 or 800-587-2147<br>
