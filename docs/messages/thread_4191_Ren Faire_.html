A reminder that I have special permission to plant boxes on the Ren<br>

We are getting ready to plan our Renn Faire trip for the year and I <br>
think that it would be cool to put the first year stamps back out <br>
again.  Were those the food stamps?  I missed them the first time <br>
around and would love a second chance at them.  <br>
<br>
So do you know approximately when the letterboxes will be planted?  I <br>
was thinking about going opening weekend, but I will wait a few more <br>
weeks if you need more time to get them out there.<br>
<br>
Thanks so much for handling these boxes every year.  We love the <br>
Faire and getting to box there makes it that much better :)<br>

I've been thinking about this since I had my meeting with Management. <br>
They are really trying to bring out the "fun and games" this season <br>
with the theme of "Feaste of Fooles" for the 20th anniversary!<br>
<br>
I have a really neat idea that popped into my head last night. How <br>
about things one might need to be a Foole? I'll send you a message by <br>
email with more details!<br>

You'll be in our neck of the woods, if your scheme goes as planned.  <br>
Let us know when you'll be here, and maybe we can meet up somewhere--<br>
