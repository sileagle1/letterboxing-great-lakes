                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am Marci of the 3 "MO's" and the other two "mo's" would be my sons <br/>
Max and Madison.  We live in Northern Illinois, and are gearing up <br/>
for a trip to NC where we have already planned our LB day.  3 more <br/>
were just placed in the area we are going to be.  <br/>
<br/>
We were introduced to letterboxing by good friends of ours about a <br/>
year ago and on our very first find we found a HH - we were hooked.  <br/>
Since then we have found almost 100, and have 2 of 5 stamps carved <br/>
for a series we would like to place this fall.  Occasionally you will <br/>
see when we stamp in that we are the 3 "MO's" plus Dad or plus EM.  <br/>
My husband, not a huge fan of trapsing around the woods for hours at <br/>
a time, actually was disappointed that he couldn't go with us this <br/>
weekend.  We are slowly but surely bringing him into the LB world.  <br/>
EM would be short for Emily - our dog.  We try to take her along when <br/>
the car ride isn't too long.  I have found that letterboxing is a <br/>
great way to stay connected to the oldest son (about to be a <br/>
teenager) I can get him talking about most anything while on the <br/>
trail.  The younger one just likes keeping up with big brother and <br/>
searching for the next stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't tend to chime in very often on the posts, but enjoy reading <br/>
all about what is going on around the great lakes area.  Thanks to <br/>
everyone for the wealth of information, otherwise I may have been <br/>
afraid to try my hand at carving stamps!!<br/>
