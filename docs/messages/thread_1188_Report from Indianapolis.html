                    <div class="plaintext-content">I returned yesterday from a great trip to Indianapolis! Here's a report:<br>
<br>
On Thursday, I met up with Speedsquare & Artdog (& Leopard JJ) and had a <br>
great Mexican dinner, and got to exchange personal stamps and travellers. I <br>
had a lot of fun, so thanks to you both for coming out to meet me!<br>
<br>
On Friday, I took a cab from my hotel to Ft. Harrison, and then hiked a <br>
couple of trails to successfully find:<br>
	Independence Day 2004 (Artdog)<br>
	More Than Corn & Morning Glory (Racing Family)<br>
	Crosscountry Crossroads (Formidable Donuts)<br>
	Cicada Land (Leopard JJ)<br>
	Hoosier Hostel - Shady Rest (Speedsquare)<br>
<br>
I didn't find Picnic in the Park, but the groundskeepers were mowing the <br>
area and there were two schoolbuses of kids having a picnic lunch, so <br>
combined with the regular dog walkers I just didn't have the opportunity to <br>
poke around.<br>
<br>
Then, I hiked over to another nearby park and logged these two finds:<br>
	2005 Great Lakes Exchange - Hoffman Tower (Artdog/Fungus Woman)<br>
	Power of the Force (Armadillo Jo)<br>
<br>
I overshot Power of the Force by a mile and hiked clear to the other end of <br>
the park, but it was such a nice day and I had time on my hands so it <br>
wasn't a disaster.<br>
<br>
Then I hiked back to 56th St and Post Rd where I got some refreshment and <br>
caught a cab back to my hotel. I think I hiked 9 or 10 miles for the day, <br>
so I got a pretty good workout (and a bit of sunburn on my neck and arms, <br>
too!).<br>

Glad you had a nice time, Silent Doug.  Without giving away too much, did you find that <br>
amusing and unusual little HH we talked about?  I mean to check out its logbook, but I <br>
keep forgetting.  It's been a beautiful April in Indianapolis, folks!<br>

PS - thanks for the decals ... now, where to put them?!?<br>

No -- I didn't find any hitchhikers!  I also didn't bring any with me,<br>
so I didn't take any out of the hostel when I got to it, either. I had<br>
saved it for last in Ft. Harrison, hoping that I might pick up a HH<br>
along the way, to no avail. There are now 5 in it, though!<br>

"Without <br>

about? "<br>
<br>
I think speedsquare is referring to the amusing HH I found in Ohio <br>
and brought back to Indiana and was last seen at the hostel. <br>
Remember the one that got us all laughing??<br>
<br>
BTW, are neither one of you going to post the humorous story of <br>
trying to meet-up? Leave it to me to coordinate things. I do a <br>
Mapquest search for Mexican restaurants near Silent Doug's hotel and <br>
come up with an address which I forward on to Doug and speedsquare. <br>
We come to find out there is no such restaurant at this address. I <br>
do a drive-by, notice someone standing near the parking lot and <br>
almost stop to ask directions. Instead, I head down the street to <br>
another little Mexican place, assuming I've made a mistake. After <br>
sitting down and feeling a little bummed, it dawns on me that the <br>
person standing near the parking lot was probably Silent Doug!!! I <br>
head back and sure enough, find Doug and speedsquare trying to <br>
figure out what to do. Later in the evening Doug admits that he <br>
started to leave, after he couldn't find the restaurant, only to <br>
think, "Wait a minute, I'll go back...maybe there's a clue!"<br>
<br>
It was a fun night, thanks for meeting up!<br>

--- yes, that's the one, do you remember who started that one?  I want to take a good <br>
look at the logbook if it is still there.<br>

That was pretty funny, but I'm not sure I would have thought it too funny if I had travelled <br>
a distance only to find a ghost town with no sign of civilization.  But that's one of the <br>
aspects of letterboxing I love -- trusting in the goodness of others.<br>
<br>
> it dawns on me that the  person standing near the parking lot was probably Silent <br>
Doug!!! <br>
<br>
Well, I was smart enough to try to find a picture of Silent Doug on his website before I <br>
headed out.  But dummy me, forgot to see how many travellers I could exchange.  But 2 <br>
exchanges are great, especially from a famous letterboxer.<br>
