                    <div class="plaintext-content">My son found the logbook for the "Outlaw Cootie" in his backpack at <br/>
the end of the day on Saturday. But there was no stamp with it. I <br/>
contacted Kiddy Writer and Private Pilot, who had stamped in last, but <br/>
they do not have it. All they received was the logbook and they <br/>
thought that was all it was to it.<br/>
<br/>
Tabby Tales, Boxer-in-Training, KissMeKate and Barefoot Ankh were the <br/>
4 stamps right before Kiddy Writer. So I'm hoping one of you may have <br/>
the stamp for the "Outlaw Cootie". From what I was told, by Wisconsin <br/>
Hiker before we left the park, this stamp is attached to a pink <br/>
carrabinerand approx. 1" square. Please check your things and let me <br/>
know if you have it. If not, I will try to get ahold of the next LB's <br/>
on the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
I will be contacting the originator of this cootie to find out what <br/>
they wish to do if this has escaped us all.<br/>
