                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had planned on posting Friday about how we were thrilled to attempt <br/>
6 of the "around the world in 80 days" LB's.  And our first mini-<br/>
vacation dedicated to LB.  <br/>
Instead we had to stay home with a sick kitty. (We took him to the <br/>
vet and he came home with an unexplained leg injury in <br/>
addition to his original ailment)<br/>
My DH sensing I needed a pick me up, suggested we find the LB's<br/>
in West Bloomfield, Mi.  So, thanks to TrailTroll we found 4 <br/>
wonderful LB's and had a great weekend albeit having a cat that can't <br/>
walk at home.<br/>
