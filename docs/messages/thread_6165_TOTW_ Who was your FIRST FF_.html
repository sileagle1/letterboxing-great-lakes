carved the bonus box, we both scoped out the spot and brainstormed the<br/>
clues, she wrote them up, and I revised, then she posted. :) So I think it's<br/>
listed under her name on LBNA. It's called Our New Beginning. (aaawww...) I<br/>
believe our first finder was TJ Mich! I don't know how they do it, but they<br/>
seem to get EVERYWHERE and FAST! lol. It was such a pleasure to meet the<br/>
dynamic duo (+ some) at our first gathering... the very recent SciFi<br/>
boxacon. :)<br/>
<br/>
My first totally solo plant was the "For the love of Starbucks" box... and<br/>
Sunny was my first finder! I was even lucky enough to be working the day she<br/>
came for it! What an honor to have one of my first met fellow letterboxers<br/>
find my first box! Sunny, you're hard core!<br/>
<br/>
Love to all, in sincere celebration of this hobby (and honest<br/>
procrastination of a research paper),<br/>

&gt; Just checked my first plant - my first finder was from out of the region -<br/>
&gt; Front Range Hiker from Colorado. I met her at my first meet-n-greet, a<br/>
&gt; dinner out in honor of her visit to Milwuakee's Irish Fest. Meeting her and<br/>
&gt; many local boxers really reeled me into this hobby hardcore!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This first plant - Magic School Bus Hops Home (Parade of Books) - was also<br/>
&gt; my first carve - it's um, shall we say "crude" or "primitive"? I thought<br/>
&gt; about replacing it, but it is such a contrast to my later carves that it<br/>
&gt; shows how we improve in our skills rather quickly. In the same town<br/>
&gt; (tee-hee) is the stamp I get the most compliments on. The pair are a nice<br/>
&gt; contrast!<br/>
