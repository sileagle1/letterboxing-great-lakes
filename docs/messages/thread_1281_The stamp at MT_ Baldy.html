When you plant a letterbox, you have to be willing to make the trek to the hiding spot now and then to check on the box.  I remember whining to OldShoe shortly after I placed a letterbox at the top of one of those huge sand dunes at Hoffmaster SP.  Somebody had reported that they couldn't find it, so one summer afternoon we shored the boat up and climbed the dune looking for the box.  It was there, just very well hidden.  I made him swear never to let me place another box at the top of a huge sand dune.  I ended up having to check that box on a regular basis over the past two years due to frequent missing reports -- the tiring part was that it was always there when I went to check on it -- until this past time.  I checked just a couple of weeks ago and confirmed that this time the box does seem to be missing.  I won't be replacing that one.<br>

Truthfully, I guess we only made two trips up.....but then found the<br>

I know we would have been really disappointed to find stickers.<br>
As I recall, the placer is a 'summer' person who just gets to the area<br>

Maybe it's a box seeking adoption? Or at least foster placers?<br>

But a letterbox is supposed to have a stamp and I would be<br>
disappointed if I got to the box and found stickers instead of a<br>
