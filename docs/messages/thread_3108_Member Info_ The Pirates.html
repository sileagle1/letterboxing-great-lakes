                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, We go by the trail name "The Pirates" and live in the Parma, Ohio area. We have only been letterboxing since mid August 2006. There are 4 of us: my wife and I and 2 sons. We found out about letterboxing by accident. We were looking for a fun day at our local park and visited the website to see if there were any events. We saw a link on the website to "Geocaching" and thought how cool it sounded. We do not have a GPS unit but I Googled the co-ordinates and thought I could find one in a nearby park. I found out The "little park" is huge when you don't know where to look, but in the search we found a letterbox totally by accident in a tree. Well that led us the letterboxing.org and we got some clues and headed out that evening for our first hunt (with clues). Since then we have placed 4 letterboxes of our own and found probably 10 others. We are still working on our carving skills and our first boxes were store bought stamps. <br>
Hope to see some of you on the trails!<br>
