                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for asking.  To clarify any misconceptions and to spark your creativity, the letterbox floats will be on the tabletops and they should be actual letterboxes; with stamps and logbooks.  <br>
<br>
Lock's idea was that we each start with a Lock N Lock box approximately 5x8 inches in size.  The box can hold the logbook and the stamp.  Decorate the top of the box to look like a three dimension Mardi Gras float, only smaller.  Wheels and a motorized radio controlled car to pull the float is optional....OK, it's not an option at all.  Let's not go overboard.  LOL!  <br>
<br>
Hints:  I looked at some photos of actual Mardi Gras and Rose Bowl Parade floats for some ideas to decorate the top of my float letterbox.  There are some photo gallery web sites from these past events.  <br>
<br>
Some of the 'stuff' decorating the top of my letterbox float actually created hiding spots for additional stamps, so my float is a series of stamps.  Good luck finding all of the stamps.  <br>
<br>
Here are some off the top of my head ideas:  <br>
Think - Mardi Gras colors: green, purple, gold. <br>
Use - flowers, fringe, glitter, tinsel, crepe paper, tissue paper, hot glue, film canisters, small boxes, cardboard tubes, Lego Blocks, Lincoln Logs, Tinker Toys, Fimo Clay, corrugated cardboard, mat board, feathers, sequins, buttons, yarn, camo tape, just look around and find 'stuff' that lends itself to your float theme.   Food items not recommended.  <br>
<br>
Of course, a float has a theme so include 'things' that reflect your letterbox float theme....like stamped cardboard signs, trinkets, beads, doubloons, toys, rubber dinosaurs (? ), McD Happy Meal toys, or cake decoration items.  Add other boxes or containers to the top, sides, front, back, or your float to create additional hiding spots for multiple stamps.  <br>
<br>
If you're really stumped or this winter weather has frozen your creative juices, email me or Lock (Lock, Shock, and Barrel) outside of the group and maybe we can help to motivate you.  <br>
<br>
I plan to photograph my float and include the photo in my logbook.  My float can be disassembled and reassembled, so the photo will serve to show what it looked like before everyone attacks.  LOL!<br>

  Beetle - <br>
  There is some confusion...are these "floats" to have a stamp/log inside or just the icing on <br>
  the cake so to speak?<br>

If you want to design your Lock N Lock box to be a floating ship Mardi Gras float actually floating in a small pan of water in the center of a table...go for it!  Could be a bit sloppy however.  And you're decorations would have to be plastic or at least waterproof.   Yes, if the Welsh were to enter a float in the New Orleans Mardi Gras, what would it look like?  Gotta be a sight!  <br>
There's no rules.  No limits.  These letterbox floats will be some creative indoor table decorations that are sure to guarantee some laughter and stamp hunting challenges.  <br>
<br>
Don't wait for all our cylinders to be firing....some of the best ideas are sparked when your cylinders are misfiring. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, the Lock N Lock box was suppose to be decorated but also serve as a tabletop decoration that contained a stamp and a logbook.  Maybe this wasn't clear in the event listing.  If you absolutely can't include a stamp and a logbook of any size on your float, then maybe you can add a Cockcoo Clue slip of paper to your float that directs people to another location.  Just a thought.  We're hoping that people will still bring event stamps, although I know that many letterboxers are looking forward to Lock's carving tutorial workshop.  <br>
