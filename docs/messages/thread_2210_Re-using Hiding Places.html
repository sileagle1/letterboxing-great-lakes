                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is there any sort of "letterboxing ethic" on re-using a hiding place.  <br>
The reasons I ask is this:  As we were removing our temporary <br>
Christmas series, my husband was wondering if we could use some of <br>
these spots next year, if we decide to do another Christmas series.  I <br>
didn't think it would be much fun to put a whole new series in the <br>
exact same hiding spots, but it did get me to thinking.  Is it "OK" to <br>
use the same hiding spot for a different letterbox--with a different <br>
stamp and perhaps even different clues.<br>
<br>
Just wondering.<br>
