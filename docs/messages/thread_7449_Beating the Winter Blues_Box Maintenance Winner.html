had some wonderful snacks, and had a chance to chat with some boxing<br/>
friends.  The baby REALLY enjoyed the added bonus of the small playground<br/>
that the Boston Terrorists positioned so close to the shelter!  It was a<br/>
nice warm up (although it was still a bit chilly) for the heart of boxing<br/>
season.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Maintenance winners...Tiptoe had the honor of pulling names from<br/>
the MANY entries.<br/>
<br/>
Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man won the 1st prize, and Shorty managed to<br/>
win the runner up prize.  On behalf of everyone, I thank you for checking<br/>
your boxes/clues to hopefully make everyone's hunts end a bit happier.<br/>

We second the thanks for a fun event! The VERY tasty hot sandwiches helped<br/>
warm us up from the cold winds (as did the yummy mac &amp; cheese that Tiptoe<br/>
brought). And the ever-popular Revel bars gave us a good sugar surge. The<br/>
BLUE tarps that were hastily hung at the shelter to block some of the wind<br/>
did indeed help us "Beat the Winter Blues". Although it was quite chilly<br/>
today, we were all thankful that there was NO rain. This meant we could get<br/>
out to find the numerous boxes. The Nature Trail at the library was my<br/>
personal favorite since the trees proved to be an excellent wind block.<br/>
<br/>
It was nice to see several of our long time letterboxing friends and we<br/>
also got to make 7 new exchanges. We're looking forward to seeing even more<br/>
people at the 10th Annual Great Lakes Event in Wisconsin on June 9!<br/>

all of the old faces very well...and it was good to meet a few new<br/>
folks..who blew in from MO!<br/>
&gt; However, we're not sure we "beat the winter blues" with the cold wind and<br/>
temps today...we might have finally conjured them up for the year!<br/>
Thankfully the great food sustained our energy level lost from<br/>
shivering...BTW...the pulled pork sandwiches were fabulous! We wish there<br/>
had been 'doggie bags"!<br/>
