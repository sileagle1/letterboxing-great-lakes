Ummmm,  yeah, that must be it...<br>

Like ArtGekko, I first heard the FIB term used related to IL visitors driving and vacationing "up north" in WI.<br>

Re: a previous subject - sorry to hear you guys haven't been able to get out boxing. But I'm sure the wedding plans must be coming along nicely.   I think the only boxes we found in January were on New Year's Day in Texas.  We hid 3 in January in WI, but to my knowledge no brave souls have ventured out yet to find them.  If there isn't TOO much snow, and temperatures aren't TOO frigid this weekend, I hope to plant 2 more this weekend.  Winter is our prime planting time.<br>
<br>
It looks like we WILL be able to make it down for the SILO event and we're looking forward to getting out on the trails Saturday morning to hunt boxes before the event.  Who's in charge of weather down there?  Can you make sure we have some reasonable temperatures that day?  Thanks!<br>
