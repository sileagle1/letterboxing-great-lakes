                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry about your box...  it is hard to lose one, especially a favorite.  I think you bring up some really good points:<br/>
<br/>
The hiding spot wasn't "that great" -- not necessarily the reason the box is missing, but we've all been there...  having a place in mind for the box and getting there and not really being able to find a "great" spot so you just take what you can find and sometimes it works fine and other times it bites you.<br/>
<br/>
But more importantly...<br/>
<br/>
Your comments about finders not being discreet, boxes exposed and paths being worn to the box, etc.  I have seen this so often and it seems increasingly more and more.  I don't want to point the finger at *new* boxers because I know there are some very conscientious new boxers, just as there are careless boxers who have been at it long enough to know better.  <br/>
<br/>
We did some boxing in the U.P. the past week and a half and I really had to shake my head at some of the things we found.  At one of my boxes, there was a well-worn path straight to the box, even though the hiding spot would have been accessible from many other routes.  I am frankly surprised the box was still there.  At a couple of boxes (not mine) that were hidden behind trees with the telltale pile of sticks, the sticks had been carelessly tossed in the general direction of the boxes, but no care had been taken to actually cover the boxes and they were laying completely exposed.  A couple of my boxes had been placed inside large outer plastic bags (for no apparent reason -- the container was intact) and were completely soggy inside.  One box we found inside a clump of stumps had been just set back in place with nothing placed over it, even though the clues very specifically indicated to be sure and cover the box well and there was plenty of appropriate covering material (bark, leaves, etc.) nearby.  And the most unbelievable (get this) -- at one box a finder had stamped with fruity ink (it was very obvious from the smell -- blueberry maybe) and surprise!! the smell attracted a critter and the box had been chewed and what was left of the stamp was in crumbles.  <br/>
<br/>
At one time I was convinced it was just a matter of education and if we really put effort into educating people about letterboxing practices, then we would help to create more contientious boxers.  But letterboxing has grown so quickly and so out of control -- more people letterbox who do not frequent the talk lists than those who do.  Many people who access LbNA and AQ for clues don't ever take the time to visit any of the other informative pages on those sites, or even realize the information is available.  I'm not sure that education is possible -- you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do notice though is that the boxes that most often are found is disarray, at least for me, tend to be the easier boxes -- clues and/or hikes, and boxes in high-traffic areas where perhaps finders do not have ample time to discreetly cover the box when they put it back.  So is the answer perhaps boxes in less accessible areas, longer hikes, more difficult clues?  Of course, it stands to reason that a box with more difficult clues and a longer hike is *probably* going to see fewer visitors and thus the probability of being left exposed or having a worn path is far less likely.  I know that some people don't have the time, inclination or ability to do longer hikes or tougher clues, etc.  But for me it has become a matter or priorities.  I would rather have fewer quality finders and increase the chances of my boxes surviving longer than tons of finders who have no clue what the word *discreet* means.  I said to OldShoe just a couple of weeks ago that I am making my boxes much more difficult, both in terms of clues and hikes.  Just ask him -- a couple that were planted last week are really tough.  I realize that many people will pass these boxes by, or not even take the time to figure out the clues, because they require more time and effort than some want to put in -- seems like everyone wants instant gratification these days.  But I am confident that there are enough true boxers out there who will look for and appreciate these boxes -- not to mention, the stamps are well worth the effort.  I am also confident the chances of these boxes surviving are pretty darn good.  I am even considering reclueing some of my existing boxes to use codes and puzzles rather than just straight-out clues.<br/>
<br/>
I really don't know what the answer is, and what works for one person may not work for another.  I certainly feel your frustration though.<br/>

  I think I suffered my first loss today! I've been told that my <br/>

<br/>
I agree that education is the key.  I've said repeatedly that I think <br/>
that on both AQ and LbNA, it should be harder to get to the clues.  I <br/>
think everyone should be required to register before they can view <br/>
any clues.   And I think that at the time of registration, the <br/>
education materials must be forced in front of people to read.  They <br/>
may or may not read it, and they may just click through it to get to <br/>
the registration and clues.  But, if it's forced in front of them <br/>
before they can register or get to the clues, a much larger <br/>
percentage of people will read it, than currently reads it.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with you that harder clues are a deterrent and most of <br/>
my boxes are harder or require some work ahead of time (not as hard <br/>
as yours).  This one wasn't as hard and was really straight forward, <br/>
mainly because it was only going to be in place for less than 3 <br/>
months.  I intentionally didn't make it as hard so more people would <br/>
have a chance to visit in that short period of time... again, that's <br/>
my part of the blame for the missing gnome.<br/>
<br/>
(Still hoping it's there and just not in the exact right place... <br/>
that camo tape works really well sometimes!  Maybe she just couldn't find it!)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today is a sad day for me, for other reasons.  I was contacted through<br/>
LbNA by a Muncie, IN (Delaware Co) news reporter who is planning to write<br/>
a piece on letterboxing and wants to know if I would be interested in<br/>
helping.  I responded I might consider it if I could remain anonymous and<br/>
that no letterboxes would be exposed without owner's prior permission.<br/>
<br/>
She responded today that she could not grant me that privilege (only<br/>
victims and special cases warrant that special treatment).<br/>
<br/>
Given the fact that Muncie is the home of Ball State and the few boxes<br/>
that have been placed are now retired/missing/unknown, the likelihood that<br/>
new exposure would bring would endanger any new placements.  This is also<br/>
the town were a geocacher placed something behind a downtown business near<br/>
a dumpster.  A worried citizen called the police and the geocache was<br/>
detonated.<br/>
<br/>
The box through which she made contact is Pickle Chiffon Pie.  Probably,<br/>
geographically closest to Delaware County.  If I don't participate, she'll<br/>
likely find someone else, and I can't think of many others that would have<br/>
the interest and longevity in our area to make sure the article doesn't do<br/>
more damage than good.<br/>
<br/>
What do I do?  If I agree, I may ask that my trail name not be associated<br/>
with my "real name."  Maybe I ask her to solve SNICKERS, and then, and<br/>
only then, will I help.   I think I'll ask her to check out the<br/>
Letterboxing Dissertation by 2bentriders.  After all, it was done through<br/>
BSU.<br/>
<br/>
Please post your comments.  I am so conflicted.<br/>

almost seals the deal in opposition to a cooperative venture.<br/>
<br/>
There are more and more of these situations coming up. <br/>
<br/>
At least two other boxes in the GL region are facing exactly the same<br/>
dilemma right now.<br/>
<br/>
Can you talk with the writer "off the record"? (make SURE she agrees<br/>
that your comments are not for attribution!)Meet with her at some<br/>
coffee place and double check your instincts.<br/>
Tell her that you'd like to talk with her about letterboxing and that<br/>
you can both see where the story might go from there.<br/>
Perhaps during that conversation you can make the points about stealth<br/>
and mystery and then steer her to another boxer who is willing to be<br/>
outed.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of well worn trails to boxes...my series in<br/>
Hemlock Crossings..."Welcome to the DSR" has nearly<br/>
full logbooks and from the look of them, people have<br/>
really enjoyed them...which is great...and yes there<br/>
are well warn paths to each box...<br/>
However -- this is not my greatest concern.  While<br/>
hunting another series in the same park, we passed by<br/>
one of the boxes in my series and something white and<br/>
large caught my eye...someone had used my clues and<br/>
placed a large (6x6x4) box in the same location at<br/>
each of my boxes with paper tags in them...the papers<br/>
had the titles of each of my boxes on them.<br/>
This is more than a little disconcerting...some folks<br/>
that hunted my series even emailed me to find out what<br/>
the "new" game was with this series....even more<br/>
upsetting is when I returned to the park this past<br/>
weekend, with garbage bag in tow to remove those<br/>
boxes...some of my box items (stamp/logbook) had been<br/>
intermingled between the two boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all the great comments I've received<br/>
about this series, and to be honest, I placed it for<br/>
the fun of the game...and for those guys who might not<br/>
always like to box with their wives.  But dang it! <br/>
This really ticked me off!<br/>
Currently, the clues have been removed from the<br/>
website...although I will have them available in hard<br/>
copy at the gathering this weekend.  Right now I'm<br/>
wondering if I want to leave them out there and<br/>
replace the logbooks...or just pick them up and avoid<br/>
any further troubles.  Opinions are welcome...off list<br/>
if you don't mind.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening!<br/>

I'm getting more frustrated by the day reading all the trouble people  <br/>

point and then, perhaps when EVERYONE knows about it, will it become  <br/>

<br/>
Then maybe the rest of us -- well at least the boxers who have the  <br/>
fortitude to hold out through repeated stolen/vandalized boxes -- can  <br/>
go back to our quiet, under-the-radar hobby that we used to know and  <br/>

I'm sorry to hear about Jerome too, I never got to visit him, but he may yet turn up.  I lost my Island Lake letterbox (the whole thing was gone) and two weeks later I returned home from a camping trip up north and there it was on my front porch.  Apparently, unknown to me a buddy of mine went out boxing with his neighbor and they went to look for my island lake box not knowing it was missing.  They found it floating in the lake and dropped it off at my house.  The log book was ruined but the stamp survived!  <br/>

  Penny, don't be bummed this phase will pass and boxing will be fun again!  Take heart.<br/>

 ... or maybe a geocacher will find it and email you to let you know where<br/>
it is!  That's what happened to us when I thought I lost a box.  We were<br/>
able to find it after the geocachers told us where they had found it (and<br/>
left it).  It is now ready to go back out this weekend with some camo tape<br/>
on the box.  Everything else was in fine shape.<br/>

<br/>
  Speaking of well worn trails to boxes...my series in<br/>
  Hemlock Crossings..."Welcome to the DSR" has nearly<br/>
  full logbooks and from the look of them, people have<br/>
  really enjoyed them...which is great...and yes there<br/>
  are well warn paths to each box...<br/>
  However -- this is not my greatest concern. While<br/>
  hunting another series in the same park, we passed by<br/>
  one of the boxes in my series and something white and<br/>
  large caught my eye...someone had used my clues and<br/>
  placed a large (6x6x4) box in the same location at<br/>
  each of my boxes with paper tags in them...the papers<br/>
  had the titles of each of my boxes on them.<br/>
  This is more than a little disconcerting...some folks<br/>
  that hunted my series even emailed me to find out what<br/>
  the "new" game was with this series....even more<br/>
  upsetting is when I returned to the park this past<br/>
  weekend, with garbage bag in tow to remove those<br/>
  boxes...some of my box items (stamp/logbook) had been<br/>
  intermingled between the two boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  I appreciate all the great comments I've received<br/>
  about this series, and to be honest, I placed it for<br/>
  the fun of the game...and for those guys who might not<br/>
  always like to box with their wives. But dang it! <br/>
  This really ticked me off!<br/>
  Currently, the clues have been removed from the<br/>
  website...although I will have them available in hard<br/>
  copy at the gathering this weekend. Right now I'm<br/>
  wondering if I want to leave them out there and<br/>
  replace the logbooks...or just pick them up and avoid<br/>
  any further troubles. Opinions are welcome...off list<br/>
  if you don't mind.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for listening!<br/>

Publicity is such a dilemma, but try as we might to "do it right", experience speaks for itself and I think we are repeatedly seeing that manifested in missing boxes and new letterboxers who may know where to go get their clues, but do not really have a clue what the game is about.  <br/>
<br/>
I do like the way that Bookcrossing handles it, thanks for sharing that.  There is a link on the LbNA homepage for publicity/media.  The webmasters forward these requests to veteran letterboxers based on the area the request is coming from.  The problem is getting the press and letterboxers to funnel media coverage through this channel.  Unfortunately, the "contact the placer" option on each letterbox listing has given the press direct access to placers and for every reporter who thinks they can get a more interesting story straight from the horse's mouth (yes, it was tempting to use another body part here), there are usually several letterboxers looking to grab a couple minutes of fame. <br/>
<br/>
Controlling the press is nigh unto impossible and the intentionally unorganized structure of letterboxing only makes that more difficult. <br/>

  I am in the same predicament, speedsquare. I too have been recently<br/>
  contacted by a reporter for "The Doings" (I am not familiar with that<br/>
  publication. She told me it is headquartered in Hinsdale, but covers<br/>
  Darien, Burr Ridge, Willowbrook, Indian Head Park, Western Springs,<br/>
  LaGrange, La Grange Park, Hinsdale, Clarendon Hills, Oak Brook, Oakbrook<br/>
  Terrace and Elmhurst.) Here's the message I sent her. (She first<br/>
  contacted me via LbNA's "contact the placer" for "On my Honor", a<br/>
  LaGrange, IL box.) "Would it be possible to see what you end up<br/>
  writing to verify the accuracy of your article? No offense intended,<br/>
  but the amount of press letterboxing has gotten recently has introduced<br/>
  a lot of people to the activity. While that is not a bad thing in<br/>
  itself, many articles do not stress the need for researching the<br/>
  protocols and conventions. As a result, people go out and misunderstand<br/>
  what they are to do. Boxes are damaged from improper handing, or worse,<br/>
  lost to vandals when not hidden as they were intended, ruining things<br/>
  for all. Much of the press presents letterboxing as a "game" to be<br/>
  played by parents and children, when in actuality, it is more of an<br/>
  adult activity that children can participate in under the supervision of<br/>
  letterboxing-knowledgable adults. For these reasons, I'm willing to<br/>
  work with you on your article, but ask you be cautious of what you say. <br/>
  Please do not show any letterbox hiding places in any photos you may<br/>
  include, or mention where any boxes are hidden or even the titles of the<br/>
  boxes. Do not show stamp images without the permission of the person<br/>
  who carved it (a letterboxing etiquette thing - some people do not want<br/>
  their images seen by anyone but those who have found the box). If<br/>
  someone is interested in pursuing letterboxing, they need to find out<br/>
  that information via the websites where they will first learn the<br/>
  correct way to participate. That being said, if you have not already<br/>
  done so, besides looking up letterboxing.org, I suggest you read up at<br/>
  atlasquest.com. (check out "about letterboxing" and "code of conduct"<br/>
  in particular under the "home" dropdown) There's a lot of excellent<br/>
  information to be had. Let me know how else I may be of assistance. <br/>
  --FungusWoman (oh, and please don't use my real name in your article,<br/>
  just my trailname)"<br/>
  I have not yet heard back from her (message was sent on the 6th).<br/>
<br/>
  ============================<br/>
<br/>
  I know Ryan has some links directed towards press on AQ, but perhaps<br/>
  what letterboxing needs is something similar to what I noticed<br/>
  Bookcrossing does (this is off their October 4th "News and Whatnot"<br/>
  e-newsletter). We need an official Letterboxing Press Secretary! (-:<br/>
<br/>
  "What To Do When The Media Comes Calling<br/>
<br/>
  As BookCrossing grows in size and becomes a bigger player in the world,<br/>
  we'd like to try to channel interview requests through our headquarters,<br/>
  so that consistent information is being given to the press. If you are<br/>
  contacted by a member of the media, please encourage them to contact<br/>
  Scott Sorochak, our CEO at scott AT bookcrossing.com or via a private<br/>
  message through his BookCrossing shelf (redsoxbookguy<br/>

  our members are so excited to share the word, but want to make sure that<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi alls,  I'm from Milwaukee and new(ish) to letterboxing.  My take on it is this:<br/>
<br/>
I read about letterboxing in a local magazine.  How else would I have found out about it?  <br/>
Letterboxing needs exposure.  It doesn't have to be a tight little ball of hardcore boxers <br/>
hellbent on keeping it "pure" somehow.  There's nothing to "get" about it.  It's really fun.  <br/>
It's a past time.  More people reading about it means more new letterboxers and <br/>
eventually more letterboxers that may even pass whatever standards makes them good <br/>
enough to be in the in group.  Some boxes will get ruined.  Just like some boxes get eaten <br/>
by squirrels or thrown out by random nonletterboxers.  It's a hazardous hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, everything gets "ruined" eventually if you have that perspective on it...its like that <br/>
music band that you really loved when they were underground and then, ut oh, they "sold <br/>
out," became popular and now the new fans aren't good enough somehow or weren't there <br/>
for the beginning so they must not get it.<br/>
<br/>
At some level this all just becomes elitism.<br/>

This series has 6 boxes.  At each of the boxes hiding<br/>
places there was one of these big boxes with multiple<br/>
papers (that looked like arm bands, or coffee cup<br/>
rings) in them - the papers had the name of my box<br/>
written on them (6 boxes, 6 box names, multiple paper<br/>
in each).  When I went to remove these boxes (they<br/>
were out in the open, usually on top of my<br/>
letterboxes) in one I found my stamp, in one I found<br/>
the logbook, in one I found all the "about LBing"<br/>
sheets, and in another I found a stamp pad that I did<br/>
not include in my box.<br/>
I will have the boxes with me at the gathering this<br/>
weekend...so if you'd like to have a look...or I might<br/>
be able to post a photo.<br/>

&gt; your box on it? Was <br/>
&gt; it placed there to expand the full log book? What<br/>

          Hi alls, I'm from Milwaukee and new(ish) to letterboxing. My take on it is this:<br/>
<br/>
I read about letterboxing in a local magazine. How else would I have found out about it? <br/>
Letterboxing needs exposure. It doesn't have to be a tight little ball of hardcore boxers <br/>
hellbent on keeping it "pure" somehow. There's nothing to "get" about it. It's really fun. <br/>
It's a past time. More people reading about it means more new letterboxers and <br/>
eventually more letterboxers that may even pass whatever standards makes them good <br/>
enough to be in the in group. Some boxes will get ruined. Just like some boxes get eaten <br/>
by squirrels or thrown out by random nonletterboxers. It's a hazardous hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, everything gets "ruined" eventually if you have that perspective on it...its like that <br/>
music band that you really loved when they were underground and then, ut oh, they "sold <br/>
out," became popular and now the new fans aren't good enough somehow or weren't there <br/>
for the beginning so they must not get it.<br/>
<br/>
At some level this all just becomes elitism.<br/>

&gt; Another excellent response SpeedSquare. I loved how you pointed out how publicity <br/>
undermines the secrecy/discretion aspect of the game even though you chose not to <br/>
participate in the article.<br/>

&gt; Letterboxing must have come to the attention of Gannet news. There has<br/>
&gt; been another in the Indy area looking for letterboxers. Our town paper is<br/>
&gt; owned by Gannet so I expect my contact with Muncie probably won't be the<br/>
&gt; last. Loved your response, FungusWoman. Here is my reply:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Colleen:<br/>
&gt; I've given this great thought and I will decline the offer to participate<br/>
&gt; in your letterboxing article. My reasons for declining are based upon<br/>
&gt; your media counterparts' prior coverage and the ill effects upon my<br/>
&gt; beloved hobby. Trying to ask someone to explain the multi-facets of this<br/>
&gt; hobby with limited print space often results in omitting fundamental<br/>
&gt; practices of letterboxing. Desirable elements of letterboxing include<br/>
&gt; secrecy and discretion, and any publicity negates those aspects. Too <br/>
&gt; many articles have already been written that describe this as great family<br/>
&gt; activity. While that is not entirely false, new letterboxers often do not<br/>
&gt; know or understand many seasoned letterboxers play at a higher level and<br/>
&gt; continue to challenge one another to create increasingly difficult<br/>
&gt; letterboxes to solve and find. If you haven't already done research to<br/>
&gt; get a sense of what I'm saying, please continue to hunt. Promote the<br/>
&gt; mental challenge aspect. If you haven't already discovered the BSU<br/>
&gt; dissertation by Dr. Marisa Fuoti-Fink, you might read that. There is a<br/>
&gt; wealth of information already present on the internet for those willing to<br/>
&gt; do some research. The best advice I can offer is to go and participate on<br/>
&gt; several letterbox hunts by different letterboxers before you write your<br/>
&gt; article. Your work will be much richer with that perspective. I must<br/>
&gt; caution you, though, letterboxing is addictive. Good luck, ~speedsquare"<br/>

&gt; She sent her request out to at least several others, and she said she<br/>
&gt; didn't need me after all. She has been in contact with 2bentriders, so I<br/>
&gt; am hopeful she'll get some good direction and information.<br/>

box!  I think there have only been two finders to date, and it's been <br/>
there since June.)<br/>

&gt; I think I suffered my first loss today!  I've been told that my <br/>
&gt; beloved Jerome may be missing.  What a heartbreaker!  This is my <br/>
most <br/>
&gt; favorite stamp(s)!  That little gnome was so adorable and I loved <br/>
his <br/>
&gt; fall accessories!  He was in his 4th and final home for the year <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; survived many moves and visits.   I was looking forward to his <br/>
&gt; retirement and possible transition into a hitchhiker come November, <br/>
&gt; but alas, it seems not to be.  I have to go verify it for myself <br/>
&gt; later this week.  I can't believe how sad I am about a missing box!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it's partly my fault since the hiding spot wasn't "great", <br/>
&gt; but seeing as he was only going to be there for 2 1/2 months, I <br/>
&gt; figured it was good enough.  I think a large part of the blame is <br/>
due <br/>
&gt; to some people being indiscreet and not covering the box back up, <br/>
&gt; though.  This box was in a very busy area and if a huge amount of <br/>
&gt; patience and stealth weren't practiced, it would be outed pretty <br/>
&gt; fast.  The friend that went to find him today said that there was a <br/>
&gt; huge trail leading right to the where the box was, so lots of <br/>
people <br/>
&gt; aren't even trying to not trample things, or get there from <br/>
different angles.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I checked on another of my boxes earlier in the week and it was in <br/>
&gt; place, but left completely exposed also.  I had occasion to check <br/>
&gt; that same box a month or so ago, and same thing, completely <br/>
&gt; visible.  I don't know if people think because there's camo tape on <br/>
&gt; it , they don't have to cover it up, or what.  I don't get it.  If <br/>
&gt; you find the box covered in leaves and sticks, wouldn't you put the <br/>
&gt; leaves and sticks back over it?  Several of the boxes we've found <br/>
&gt; lately have been left same way, completely visible. :(<br/>
