Been there--done that.  But not while letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I think my favorite bird poop episode was when I was a kid.  We were having a picnic lunch.  As my mom was bringing a forkful of food to her mouth........that is where the bird poop landed.  Fortunately, she stopped in time!<br/>

And you can't blame any of that bird pooping on me<br/>

It's an omen...but I'm not sure what the omen is.  <br/>
Better for the bird to poop on the letterbox clue than on the letterboxer.  <br/>
Count your blessings.  LOL<br/>
