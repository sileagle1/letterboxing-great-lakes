In reference to finding carving stuff at Michaels - it is indeed pretty hit<br/>
or miss to find it.  The store by us only carries the Speedball starter kit,<br/>
and usually only has one or two of them on hand at any time, and only<br/>
restocks very infrequently.  If they have it, it is with the fine art<br/>
supplies.  Hobby Lobby usually carries more, including a wider variety of<br/>
carving tips, and lately I've noticed if you have a Joann's nearby that they<br/>
have been stocking MasterCarve and starter kits.  Although I think their<br/>
prices run a little on the high side, if you register with their online<br/>
mailing list, they will inundate you with 40-50% off coupons.<br/>
