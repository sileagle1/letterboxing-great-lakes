  I have a box that I planted in central Ohio about this time last year. It was First Found last week end. I guess it doesn't help that I planted it in April, but didn't plan to release the clues until May. Then I lost the clues, and forgot the exact location. I tried several times to find it and couldn't. I begged my husband to try and he was never close to the box when he had some free time. But last week end we were in a near by park for my son's soccer game. Before the game my husband walked to the exact spot we had put the letterbox and said "Is this what you've been whining about for the past year?" It was still there!<br>
    So, now I'll make new clues, and release them this May (it is a themed box related to May). Hopefully I won't lose these clues. <br>
    I can only imagine the confusion of the true FF on this one. The log book says "Planted May 2005" but the clues will say 2006.<br>
