really are, we have a few updates for three of our clues.<br>
<br>
If you are doing 'Atomic Mini-Meet,' a key trail marker has disappeared, <br>
and the clue has been changed to reflect that.  One of our 'Cubs <br>
Legends' has been removed (after suffering some melting via a controlled <br>
burn), but it may eventually be replanted.  Finally, our <br>
'liveworkdineshopplay' box seems to have disappeared, and it will not be <br>
replaced.  Again, all these changes are marked on the clues so be sure <br>
you are using the most recent editions.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
