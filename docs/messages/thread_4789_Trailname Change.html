I just wanted to let you all know that we are changing our trailname <br/>
from OlsenTrio to...PackerBackers. Yes, just in time for the S.I.L.O. 2 <br/>
event, just to make more work for everyone  =)  <br/>
This name just seems to fit us better, especially since we rarely have <br/>
a "trio" anymore! <br/>
I'll use both names for a while as not to confuse anyone  ;-)<br/>

Well, let me be the first to say thank you so much for a GREAT time <br/>
at the SILO 2 Event today. Fungus Woman and Beetle did an excellent <br/>
job putting it together. The stamps were just amazing (and big), with <br/>
some very creative and funny ideas!! LOVED the "Good Cop" box, <br/>
Beetle  =)<br/>
<br/>
It was really nice seeing people that we haven't seen in a while, and <br/>
also meeting some new ones. I'm just glad the bad weather held off <br/>
long enough for us to attend. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone again at the next gathering. <br/>

Actually, the police don't eat that many donuts, but they sure drink a lot of coffee.  <br/>
