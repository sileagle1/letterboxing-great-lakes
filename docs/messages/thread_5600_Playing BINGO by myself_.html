 I was lurking on your list last year, and was so envious of all the<br>
fun you were having - but somehow, my BINGO card got lost in the<br>
Christmas card mess in the dining room and I never got around to<br>
sending it in.  So, I decided that I'd play along at home - because I<br>
was SURE that all you "experts" would win anyhoo.  I have 8 words so<br>
far - and 2 possible Bingos that only need one word.  (Of course that<br>
could take forever)<br>
Next year, I'm playing FOR SURE.  <br>
Mom of JeffersClan, kicking herself for not sending in.  <br>
