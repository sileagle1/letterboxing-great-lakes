<br>
I'm PennyPenny from South Lyon, MI ... and I'm relatively new to <br>
letterboxing!<br>
<br>
I found the hobby too irresistible to pass up when I read the little <br>
article in Time Magazine. That was early in the summer of '04, I <br>
believe.<br>
<br>
After reading Randy Hall's book I quickly carved my first stamp (my <br>
signature stamp, "PennyPenny," which I created from a photo of my cat, <br>
Penny.)<br>
<br>
The kids and I hunted down a couple of local boxes soon after. I've <br>
placed two boxes myself recently... and I'm finding I really, really <br>
like placing better than finding -- at least for the time being!  I've <br>
monitored the lists since last summer, and am soaking up the info and <br>
nuances of the sport (can I call it that?!) I don't post too much <br>
really... as I feel I'm such a "newbie" that I don't have much to offer <br>
yet!<br>
<br>
I've got 3 sons; one of whom is not in school yet, so my busy life <br>
curtails the time I spend doing letterboxing. I'm counting on doing <br>
much more of it in the future! I'll eventually pull my hubby into it <br>
too -- somehow -- although his work keeps him occupied all-too-many <br>
hours of the day to bring him onboard right now. (I do know he's <br>
intrigued, though... he really liked watching me create my first two <br>
boxes!)<br>
<br>
So for now I'm doing this alone... although I almost met some local <br>
boxers a few weeks back... (namely, The 7 Huckaby's!) but alas, <br>
Schedules ultimately nixed our meeting. I'm sure we'll get together <br>
another time... there aren't a whole lot in our area!<br>
<br>
So a big HELLO to all and I look forward to meeting some of you in the <br>
future! Have fun boxing!!<br>
<br>
PennyPenny<br>

relate when you say you enjoy placing more than finding.  I enjoy <br>
both, but if I had to choose...  planting would win for me also.  <br>
We're glad you feel that way because it is more boxes for us to <br>
find!  Don't feel because you are relatively new that you have <br>
little to offer because new letterboxers and new group members bring <br>
something very valuable -- a fresh perspective.  So I hope you make <br>
yourself at home and feel free to join in the discussion here.<br>
