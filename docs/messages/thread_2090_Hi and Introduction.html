I'm PennyPenny from South Lyon, MI ... and I'm relatively new to <br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
I found the hobby too irresistible to pass up when I read the little <br/>
article in Time Magazine. That was early in the summer of '04, I <br/>
believe.<br/>
<br/>
After reading Randy Hall's book I quickly carved my first stamp (my <br/>
signature stamp, "PennyPenny," which I created from a photo of my cat, <br/>
Penny.)<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I hunted down a couple of local boxes soon after. I've <br/>
placed two boxes myself recently... and I'm finding I really, really <br/>
like placing better than finding -- at least for the time being!  I've <br/>
monitored the lists since last summer, and am soaking up the info and <br/>
nuances of the sport (can I call it that?!) I don't post too much <br/>
really... as I feel I'm such a "newbie" that I don't have much to offer <br/>
yet!<br/>
<br/>
I've got 3 sons; one of whom is not in school yet, so my busy life <br/>
curtails the time I spend doing letterboxing. I'm counting on doing <br/>
much more of it in the future! I'll eventually pull my hubby into it <br/>
too -- somehow -- although his work keeps him occupied all-too-many <br/>
hours of the day to bring him onboard right now. (I do know he's <br/>
intrigued, though... he really liked watching me create my first two <br/>
boxes!)<br/>
<br/>
So for now I'm doing this alone... although I almost met some local <br/>
boxers a few weeks back... (namely, The 7 Huckaby's!) but alas, <br/>
Schedules ultimately nixed our meeting. I'm sure we'll get together <br/>
another time... there aren't a whole lot in our area!<br/>
<br/>
So a big HELLO to all and I look forward to meeting some of you in the <br/>
future! Have fun boxing!!<br/>

relate when you say you enjoy placing more than finding.  I enjoy <br/>
both, but if I had to choose...  planting would win for me also.  <br/>
We're glad you feel that way because it is more boxes for us to <br/>
find!  Don't feel because you are relatively new that you have <br/>
little to offer because new letterboxers and new group members bring <br/>
something very valuable -- a fresh perspective.  So I hope you make <br/>
yourself at home and feel free to join in the discussion here.<br/>
