Also hoping that everyone in the affected areas is OK.  If your home was directly affected by the flooding or tornadoes, those area local Red Cross Chapters should be working with those families to offer assistance if needed - if you fall into that category, contact your local Red Cross.  (And that's the end of my PSA as a Cleveland Red Cross Disaster Services volunteer)<br/>

much for the flowers anyone planted! My cousins in Charles City Iowa <br/>

dry up, including many peoples basements.<br/>

Turns out that the village did not renew its flood insurance, and because of that, those houses were uninsured. Also, the sandbagging of the dam may have contributed to the unplanned breach. <br/>
Once they fix the breach across the highway, it should take just two weeks to refill the lake from the Wisconsin River. I hope they will show footage of that when it happens as well.<br/>

floating down the river over and over and over and over and over and over<br/>
again on TV here in the Chicago area.  Every time I watch it I feel worse<br/>
and worse and worse for the people.<br/>
<br/>
The front page and inside pages of the Chicago Tribune had lots of photos<br/>
today, including one that showed a farm from an aerial view -- the house,<br/>
silos, all the outbuildings, trees, etc, under water.  Surreal, like an<br/>
exceptionally bad nightmare.  Subject line actually should say "Rain, pain,<br/>
go away!"<br/>
<br/>
Much as I wanted to build a house on a river in Wisconsin, I picked which<br/>
river verrrrry carefully, with much thought even tho it was only a very<br/>
small home just for summer, winter skiing long weekends, etc.  Even at that<br/>
though, if there'd been the rain in northwest Wisconsin that there was<br/>
elsewhere in Wisconsin, I don't even know if that house would've survived<br/>
since it's neither an ark nor a houseboat.  There's something to be said for<br/>
living on a houseboat I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Talking about kayaking, a few years back our house here made the front page<br/>
of the local paper when one of the paper's photographers took a photo of<br/>
kids canoeing down our street when this area of Illinois got hit bad.<br/>
Unfortunately, the kids in the canoes were right in front of our house when<br/>
he snapped the photo.  What a way to make the front page.<br/>
