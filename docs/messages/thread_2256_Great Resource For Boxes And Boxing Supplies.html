                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just to let everyone know, I recently scored 40 boxes at the dollar stores in my area. They are about 6" in diameter, or 6" across ( both circular and square varieties ) and 3.5" tall. They have heavy duty rubber seals ( no cheap gladware that breaks in the cold or doesn't seal well ). At only $1 each they were a steal and I had to buy them all up. Just a thought for those of you who hadn't considered the dollar stores for your boxing supplies. Also, they had packs of 250 recipe type cards with blank backs for, you guessed it, $1. The perfect size for the containers and a very cost effective way to make your own logbooks. Couple that with packs of ten pens for a dollar for the boxes and you can save some good money for other boxing necessities ( liks gas to get to the boxes ). At Target today they had rainbow stamp pads for $1, five color and looked quite nice. I wish they had a set of inking pens for $1 as well. I'm always looking for boxing supplies at every place I go to. Can you<br>
 say ADDICTION : )? Anywho, just thought you'd all like to know that there are inexpensive ways to supply yourself with great products for letterboxing. It makes it a more affordable ADDICTION and I'm sure we could all use a little more of that. <br>

  Take Care everyone, winter will be over soon and then it's GAME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

  I too have found the dollar stores to provide an endless supply of "stuff" for all my hobbies including letterboxing  :-)<br>
  They're great for stickers and trinkets to put in postal boxes too!<br>
