                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been in contact with some new letterboxers from IA, Team Vermeys.  They live in Spirit Lake, IA close to where the ancient and mysterious "Hospers Letterbox" is/was located (see http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/message/244).  I asked her to pop over and check on its status.  Here is what Tess from the Team wrote back (slightly edited):<br/>
<br/>
"I went to Hospers today.... Yes there was a letterbox there, that he <store owner=""> hasn't heard about it in a very long time, his brother in law who lives in Kansas asked him if he could put it there. He said that there hasn't been any activity with it for over two years. That he had two people right away and then nothing after that for two years so he threw it away.... something about 2 years being a long time to have it around and that if no came looking in that amount of time he didn't feel it was worth it...  I tried to be friendly and explained it just isn't real well known around this area yet and that I was trying in Spirit Lake and there are others looking and placing boxes trying to get it more active around this part of Iowa. He didn't look like he cared but he did listen and said ok. So then I thanked him and told him that if his brother in law wanted to try again there are people who are interested and would come.<br/>
<br/>
When we first got there and asked about it he kinda rolled his eyes and sighed real heavy. Afterwords we wondered if it was like one of those things when you finally decide to throw it away someone comes wanting it.<br/>
<br/>
Well at least we know about it, there is no longer a letterbox in the furniture store in Hospers, Ia. Although they have a nice library park that we thought would be a good place to hide one. Haha!<br/>

So yet another mystery about a basement letterbox solved!<br/>
