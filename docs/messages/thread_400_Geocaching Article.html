Well, I see that the Milwaukee paper did a big story on geocaching<br/>
today.  It even features friends of mine - Tami and Wade and their<br/>
kids. (BTW, those were the geocachers I met while looking for the Lake<br/>
Park series, just before meeting WI Hiker and Martini Man for the<br/>
first time.  the geocache is about 30 ft from the first letterbox.)<br/>
<br/>
I hope we don't get a rash of new geocachers that are ignorant of<br/>
letterboxing and start destroying our boxes!  Czeltic Girl made some<br/>
new letterbox labels recently (for her upcoming boxes) that state that<br/>
they are not geocaches.  Guess we'll see shat happens.<br/>

me into Letterboxing - well, that and my moldy buddy!)  Most of us <br/>
(at least most of the ones I know) are considerate enough not to <br/>
disturb that which we did not come looking for, and all the <br/>
Geocaching sites preach the same message.<br/>
<br/>
I will admit though, there seems to be a rash of caches going <br/>
missing or being destroyed too, so it appears there might be some <br/>
underworld or muggle conspiracy going on ...<br/>
<br/>
By the way, glad to hear you found the Pippins stamp ... I'd have <br/>
been TOTALLY bummed if I'd gone to RenFaire and it was gone!<br/>
