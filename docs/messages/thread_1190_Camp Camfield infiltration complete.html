And I really want to plant 2 more in this park but first I have to come up with stamp designs.  If you do stop by for a visit, be double sure to do a thorough tick check when you're done (I strongly recomend bug spray)!  Last weekend I picked up one tick and this weekend I managed to pick up TWO ticks which were overlooked when I did a tick check at the end of the hike...plus I brushed a tick off of Aina on the trail.  Other than creepy 8-legged terrors, I think the hike is a good one and hopefully a nice challenge.  <br/>
