since I was the one that left "O the Places You'll Go!" at Little <br>
Bear.  I seem to recall the logbook missing at that time though, now <br>
that you mention it.  That would be 7/23/04.  I know I didn't take <br>
the logbook - at least I don't have it in my LB stuff from MI here.<br>

BTW - was that a sacastic remark to Ryan on the other list? Wait, is <br>
this a sacastic remark? Hmmm, ARGHHH!  I'm so confused! :-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tim, you were the last one at Little Bear (well, actually a local geocacher<br>
was there after you but he left the HH), but there were several people who<br>
had been to North Start after you, so I think some must have gotten stumped<br>
on Little Bear.  I figure if they were at North Star, they had to have been<br>
at Big Bear or how else would they have gotten the clue?<br>
<br>
Anyway, it is possible that the box was upset and somebody who came after<br>
put it all back together -- at least what was left of it -- the contents did<br>
seem a bit sandy, which would explain why I found it all neat and tidy in<br>
the container.  It is odd though that nobody mentioned the missing book in<br>
the log of North Star, or left a slip of paper with their stamp at Big<br>
Bear -- I have done that before when a logbook was missing, damaged or full.<br>
<br>
I was so glad I had thrown a spare log book in my pack before I headed out,<br>
otherwise I would have had to go back and climb those sand dunes again!<br>
<br>
I really had no intention of responding to Ryan...  but could not contain<br>
myself when he (sarcastically, I am assuming) called himself cute and<br>
loveable AFTER referring to himself as a softie...  it made me want to barf<br>
and I just needed to get rid of the bad taste.  But that is my final word on<br>
that whole subject over there.  Hopefully it is the final word from the two<br>
of them also.<br>
