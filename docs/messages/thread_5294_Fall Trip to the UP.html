there!) on the entrance road to the Porkies.  My mother stayed last <br/>
weekend at the Konteka in White Pine (restaurant, bar, bowling and <br/>
maybe sauna).  Sometimes at the Konteka you can watch from the large <br/>
windows in the dining room as bears visit the garbage food pile.  Don't <br/>
know how they compare price wise, but various members of my family and <br/>
extended family have been happy with these two places.  HTH.  - Mary<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned from a week in the Porkies.  We found all 10 of the boxes <br/>
planted by the park -- they are in a nice variety of places within the park and <br/>
all easy hikes.  I have a couple of boxes in the Porcupine Mts. that are a bit <br/>
longer hikes, but exceptionally scenic so worth the time and distance.<br/>
<br/>
We camp so I can't recommend a place to stay based on personal experience, <br/>
although we did eat at Konteka in White Pine one day (one of the few places in <br/>
the area with wireless Internet access) -- the food, the view and the service <br/>
were wonderful -- it seems like a really nice place.  The other place somebody <br/>
had mentioned the Americ-Inn is always busy (judging by the number of cars in <br/>
the lot), but we were not real impressed with the restaurant there.<br/>
<br/>
One of the park letterboxes is along the Presque Isle River at the west end of <br/>
the park.  Even though this one is a little farther away, don't skip it.  The <br/>
Presque Isle River area is one of the prettiest areas of the park -- there are <br/>
several waterfalls and rapids along the river here within the stretch of a mile. <br/>
<br/>
Bond Falls, which is one of the most scenic falls in the U.P., is located near <br/>
Paulding which is within easy driving distance from the Porkies, and has a <br/>
couple of letterboxes.  Just down the road from there is a new box planted by <br/>
Turtle's Mom at Imp Lake which was a really nice trail.  Nearby is Agate Falls, <br/>
also a beautiful waterfall, but no letterbox there.  Heading west, somebody had <br/>
mentioned Superior Falls, which has an amazing canyon wall along the mouth of <br/>
the river -- I have a letterbox there and it sounds like there may be a couple <br/>
others available shortly.  I also have a box on Lake Gogebic, which could easily <br/>
be a stop on the way to/from Bond Falls.<br/>
<br/>
If you head into Ontonagan (the closest city to the Porkies with a real grocery <br/>
store), make time to eat at Roxey's Lounge...  it is kind of a dive bar, but <br/>
they have the best burgers in the world!<br/>
<br/>
You should see some great fall color.  We usually go at the end of <br/>
September/beginning of October and hit the color right on, although we have run <br/>
into snow a couple of times also.  This year we went earlier than usual because <br/>
of the event they were having at the park, but I much prefer the fall color <br/>
season!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent nearly a week in the U.P. this summer.  A great hotel was <br/>
the Super 8 in Houghton.  I was astounded!  It's right on Portage <br/>
Lake and for $75/night we got the Lake side of the hotel with a <br/>
GORGEOUS view! <br/>
<br/>
We also stayed at the Laurium Manor Inn B &amp; B in Laurium.  Our first <br/>
time at a B &amp; B -- never thought we'd be able to afford one.  But our <br/>
room was just under $100.<br/>
<br/>
We had a lot of "couldn't finds" for letterboxing on our trip...that <br/>
was probably our error.  But a few of our favorites were "Shanty Boy" <br/>
near Crystal Falls, "Bear Lake" near McClain State Park, and "Flying <br/>
Fish" at the Houghton Co. Historical Museum.  We also had a great <br/>
time touring the Ghost Town of Central.  We will definitely be hiding <br/>
a lb there if and when we go that way again.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great trip!  We love the U.P.!  --Papeseed <br/>

everyone who gave us suggestions!  We spent our time in the Porkies<br/>
and the Keweenaw Peninsula area. The fall colors were incredible!  One<br/>
of the great things about letterboxing is that people usually hide<br/>
boxes in interesting places.  So if there's a box there, the area is<br/>
probably worth visiting. Plus, we learned a lot of background<br/>
information about the U.P. just from reading clues! If you want to<br/>
experience the highlights of the Porcupine Mountains, all you have to<br/>
do is find the series of letterboxes planted there by the park<br/>
rangers. (I still can't believe RANGERS actually PLANTED letterboxes!)<br/>
