When we try to go into the LbNA "What's New" site this A.M. We get an <br>
error message on a white screen.  Does anyone know what's going on?   <br>

apparently still down.  If you try the site again, it looks like Choi <br>
has at least been able to change something so you get an explanation <br>
message instead of the error text.<br>
<br>
If anyone has new regional clues, they could post them to this list or <br>
add them to the LbGLK Files section until the LBNA site is back up.<br>
<br>
There is a way to access some LBNA clues if they are also listed on <br>
AtlasQuest.<br>
