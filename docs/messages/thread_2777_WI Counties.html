                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm happy to report that Martini Man and I did manage to get boxes <br/>
planted in two new counties (Waupaca and Oconto) in WI recently.  I <br/>
also noticed that The Dragon Clan planted a box in Juneau county so <br/>
that means there are now letterboxes in 45 Wisconsin counties.  That <br/>
also means there are 27 counties remaining that still need boxes.  If <br/>
you'd like to see a map of the counties that have boxes, and those <br/>
that don't, you can see a map here:<br/>
<br/>
http://letterboxing.homestead.com/WIcounties.html<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be great to have a box in every county in WI, so <br/>
please consider planting a box in one of these counties if you are <br/>
traveling through the state.  Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hooray!  In the last few weeks, 2 more Wisconsin counties now have <br/>
letterboxes.  Thanks to a traveling Arizonian (I think), the far <br/>
northwest county now has a box and the Y's Guys planted one in <br/>
Richland county in their recent planting spree. That means there are <br/>
now boxes in 51 counties, with only 21 still waiting for a box.  I'm <br/>
hoping to plant one in Marquette county before the end of the month <br/>
and Martini Man might also get something planted somewhere in the <br/>
middle of the state.<br/>
<br/>
The updated map can be seen at:<br/>
http://letterboxing.homestead.com/WIcounties.html<br/>
<br/>
I was very pleasantly surprised to see that the LBNA website has <br/>
recently been updated to show the counties that received boxes this <br/>
year also colored in on the map there.  Thanks to the webmasters <br/>

now have a box:  Ashland, Forest and Marqeutte!<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to ChickenNStars (Ashland county) and The Fellowship <br/>
(Forest county)!  I'll be posting clues soon for the box I placed in <br/>
Marqwette county this weekend (am currently on a business trip to CA, <br/>
so am limited in access to maps, etc).  However the good news is that <br/>
we have 3 more counties with boxes which only leaves 18 to go in <br/>
Wisconsin.  When I get back home this weekend I'll update the map and <br/>
post another message.<br/>
