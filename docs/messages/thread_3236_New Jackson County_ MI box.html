Hi there!<br>
I just planted a box in Jackson County, MI!  For some reason that I <br>
don't fully understand, when it was sent through the announce list, <br>
it said "QUE Canada".  Not sure why that would be.  But, it's <br>
definitely in Jackson.<br>
<br>
Here's a link if your interested. <br>

<br>
If you're into birds, I'd suggest going sometime in the next 2 weeks <br>
for optimum sandhill crane viewing!<br>
