them and hardly ever do I forward them.<br/>
<br/>
I have 3 that are all of military related matters and I know there are <br/>
a few out there that would really appreciate what they have to say <br/>
(I've never seen these ones before).<br/>
<br/>
But you have to Email me OFF LIST and I will forward... I don't want to <br/>
clog up this board with such matters so please keep it off list. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
