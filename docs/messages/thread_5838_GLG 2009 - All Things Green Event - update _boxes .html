I am happy to report a great number of event boxes have been received.  I expect a handful to arrive within the week as well.  I had hoped for a few more shelter boxes - Our favorite State Parks - is not quite represented by all Great Lakes States.  If you want to contribute a stamp to fill the needs listed below, let me know.  No need to make a logbook or send a container.  I can do the rest.  I will need to have them in my hands by May 15th.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I would like to add to the collection:<br/>
<br/>
IL - State Park Box #2; I have received #1 Kickapoo SP<br/>
IN - Will be receiving Dunes SP shortly; I thought I'd carve one for Pokagon that will be permitted for planting when a permit opens up in the future, but at this point I am flexible and will take ANY Indiana State Parks you want to contribute.<br/>
MN - State Park Box #2; I have received #1 Split Rock SP<br/>
MI - Received #1 Silver Lake SP, waiting for the rest this week.<br/>
<br/>
I may have overestimated the number of shelter boxes we need, so I will be removing the request for 1920's era/Conservation Movement/and Resourceful Ancestors - as box series - from the database.  You are more than welcome to bring themed personal travellers from these suggestions.  I only ask that you list them as Personal Travellers at AQ, and not event boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I will prepare event packets for everyone signed up at AQ and LbGLK.  I will be using the information that is available on May 20th.  I will be in Steuben County (Clear Lake) the weekend before the event, and there is no internet at the house.  I plan to visit the library in Fremont or Angola, if necessary, on Thursday to answer any last minute questions.<br/>
<br/>
PLANTING BOXES<br/>
I am currently battling another sinus infection.  I plan for it to be gone soon.  I plan to plant the event boxes Tuesday and Wednesday after the Labor Day holiday.  I haven't had anyone confirm whether they can assist me in planting these boxes, so here's your chance!  The trails are moderate at Pokagon.  I am allowing myself 2 days to plant ca. 12 boxes on pre-approved trails.  I will buy lunch for the volunteers and you can hang out at Clear Lake if you desire afterwards.  By Thursday, I will print the clues for the packets.<br/>
<br/>
LbGLK DATABASE<br/>
Please do not be alarmed when you see a major change in the All Things Green database here.  In order to get an accurate count, I am trying to consolidate information.  If you have signed up at AQ and are listed in  LbGLK, I will likely delete your entry at LbGLK.  I've prepared a separate spreadsheet here combining both lists to be used for labels and other event items.  You will not be forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
LODGING<br/>
If you have reservations at the Inn or campground, please make sure you list them in the database created by Wisconsin Hiker.  Depending on Friday arrival times, I will see what's available for a pre-event gathering.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't made any lodging reservations, I know there are hotels along I-69.  I don't have any experience to give recommendations, but check in Michigan, as well.<br/>
<br/>
PARKING<br/>
Here's a little dilemma.  The Apple Orchard shelter maximum is 150 persons.  I'm not concerned about that as much as I am the number of parking spaces.  Fifty (50).  At AQ there are 60+ listings.  If you are camping, I encourage you to bring your stuff to the shelter and re-park at the campground.  Same for Potowatomi Inn.  And carpool back to the shelter.  It will be tight, so the earlier you get to the event, the better chance of getting a spot.<br/>
<br/>
OTHER EVENT ACTIVITIES<br/>
I've tried to make this event a low-key/inexpensive affair.  I haven't asked for raffle prizes and the like.  I have some small door prizes, but you needn't  worry about getting items at the last minute.  I will have a box for freewill donations to defray the costs of the event - shelter rental and supplies, printing,  etc.  I will be contacting Pale Puppy Posse shortly to see what our Potluck needs are and will post afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
There are other activities your family may enjoy at Pokagon.  The day will be fairly unstructured after the opening.  If you want to bring lawn games, there are grassy areas surrounding the shelter.<br/>
<br/>
--- Finally ---<br/>
If you find you need to drop off the list at AQ, please notify me before you do.  I need to increase the attendee numbers on my listing to account for LbGLK members not counted in the AQ maximum.  <br/>
<br/>
If there is something I haven't covered at this point that you feel needs attention, please do not hesitate to ask.  I want this to be fun for all.<br/>
