days.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Meet us at the Brookfield Zoo to celebrate Emily Cottontail and <br>
Hudson the polar bear's first birthdays and stay for Holiday Magic.  <br>
We will have a birthday-themed box with us for anyone who comes to <br>
see us.<br>
 <br>
Arrive any time you'd like, but we'll meet around 3:00.  If the <br>
weather isn't too bad, we'll be at the outside picnic tables behind <br>
the Safari Grill.  Or check inside...FW is going to try to nab the <br>
south wing inside the building.  This is very informal, more of a <br>
social event than a real letterboxing gathering, but if you have any <br>
winter/holiday stamps already carved, feel free to bring them along.<br>
 <br>
(Note:  If it looks like there will be a big turnout FW will pull <br>
the "Remembering Boxer" boxes and just have them available at 3:00, <br>
rather than risk too many people drawing too much attention to the <br>
hiding places and possibly social damage.  Check Friday night for any <br>
updates.)<br>
<br>
Hope to see you there!  Please RSVP on AtlasQuest.<br>
The Cottontails<br>
