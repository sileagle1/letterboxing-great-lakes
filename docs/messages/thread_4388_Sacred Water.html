I am sending this message out to all those that have gotten the Sacred <br/>
Water stamp and expressed interest in following my dad's sailboating <br/>
journey.  If you have no idea what I am talking about, his story is in <br/>
the Sacred Water clue on AQ, <br/>

<br/>
We are headed to his bon voyage party today and he has his blog spot <br/>
up.  Here is the link.  http://www.sailblogs.com/member/svtevai/<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who stamped in to his book.<br/>
