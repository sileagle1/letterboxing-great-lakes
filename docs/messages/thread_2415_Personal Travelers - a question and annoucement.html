<br>
Its been a while since I last posted on this board.  I became quite <br>
involved with PLBs over the winter but now that spring is here I am <br>
quite ready to get back out into the wilderness and find some <br>
letterboxes!!<br>
<br>
So onto my question: do personal traveler stamps traditionally have <br>
a <br>
logbook?  The reason I ask is that Jason's new personal traveler <br>
will be making its debut at the June gathering.  <br>
<br>
To receive this stamp you will have to provide Jason with the answer <br>
to this question: Who is Frank Castle?<br>
<br>
Thanks for any thoughts you may have on my PT question and I hope <br>
everyone is out there enjoying the nice weather and finding some <br>
boxes :)<br>

<br>
My 2 oldest PT's have no logbook.  My preference.  When I get another's<br>
PT, I just stamp it into my regular logbook.  My newest PT has a logbook,<br>
because I may turn it into a full-fledged letterbox after the GL<br>
Gathering.  I haven't decided yet.<br>
<br>
See ya in June with the Answer!<br>

I think one of the reasons I like letterboxing and continue to do it <br>
is the "there is no wrong or right way" mentality. :) How great is <br>
that?<br>
