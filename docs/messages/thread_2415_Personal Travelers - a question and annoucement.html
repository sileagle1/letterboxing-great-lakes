<br/>
Its been a while since I last posted on this board.  I became quite <br/>
involved with PLBs over the winter but now that spring is here I am <br/>
quite ready to get back out into the wilderness and find some <br/>
letterboxes!!<br/>
<br/>
So onto my question: do personal traveler stamps traditionally have <br/>
a <br/>
logbook?  The reason I ask is that Jason's new personal traveler <br/>
will be making its debut at the June gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
To receive this stamp you will have to provide Jason with the answer <br/>
to this question: Who is Frank Castle?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any thoughts you may have on my PT question and I hope <br/>
everyone is out there enjoying the nice weather and finding some <br/>
boxes :)<br/>

My 2 oldest PT's have no logbook.  My preference.  When I get another's<br/>
PT, I just stamp it into my regular logbook.  My newest PT has a logbook,<br/>
because I may turn it into a full-fledged letterbox after the GL<br/>
Gathering.  I haven't decided yet.<br/>
<br/>
See ya in June with the Answer!<br/>

I think one of the reasons I like letterboxing and continue to do it <br/>
is the "there is no wrong or right way" mentality. :) How great is <br/>
