If I admit this, I have no one to blame but myself. Secretly, I love cooties! There, I've said it. <br>
<br>
When the Brat Pack came to S.I.L.O. #1 and unleashed about 50 cooties, I thought it was the greatest thing ever. <br>
<br>
Don't think of cooties as a infectious plague, think of them as 'love bugs.' LOL!<br>

AQ says "A type of letterbox where one tries to sneak around hiding the <br>
box on another personperhaps in an open backpack or jacket pocket. Once <br>
you 'catch a cootie', you stamp in and try to pawn it off onto another <br>
unsuspecting letterboxer. Cooties are often signed into with the stamp <br>
of your thumb or fingers that you draw on to embellish instead of the <br>
traditional signature stamp, although many people prefer to use their <br>
signature stamp instead. For more cootie talk, visit our Cooties board."<br>

Now I'm going to be bombarded with those little cooties, but that's OK.  More stamps for me!  But with this said, now people will avoid me because they will think I'm a walking 'carrier' of a cootie epidemic.  <br>
<br>
Recently, I read something on line about cooties and I saw the word 'flees.'  What's a flee?  It's like a cootie, but I think that flees hop from box to box or from person to person.  So there are all sorts of bugs out there.<br>

<br>
Oh, we can always count on this friendly local bunch of letterboxers to 'share.'  The generosity knows no limits.  I went home from a gathering and 3 weeks later I was still finding cooties that had been slipped into the pockets of the removable inner lining of my coat.  I couldn't figure out what that hard lump was.  I burst out laughing!  <br>
<br>
I think the reason this group has frequent gatherings is just to unload cooties.  But whatever the reason, I love you all, and I'm sorry I missed out on all the fun at BofaF.<br>
