                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know almost everyone on this message board already has a patch (500 sold over the past years!), but I think there are a few newer members that might be interested in a patch.<br>
<br>
After being out of stock for quite a while, I recently reordered and the patches arrived today.  The image is the main image on this message board and the cost is $2/patch.  I'll bring some to the SILO event later this month and will also have them at the annual Great Lakes Gathering in June.<br>
<br>
However if you won't be at those events, or would like a patch sooner, ordering details can be found here: <br>
