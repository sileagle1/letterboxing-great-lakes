<br>
The map puzzle pieces (stamps) are located along the<br>

Note: there are no logbooks with the stamps, so just<br>
stamp the puzzle piece into your logbook and complete the<br>

A good start begins with a good breakfast so begin at<br>
Kellogg's Cereal City, downtown Battle Creek.<br>
Driving Directions:<br>
<br>
 Take I-94 between Detroit and Chicago<br>
 Get off at exit 98B<br>
 Now you will be on M66/I-194<br>
 This will take you to downtown Battle Creek<br>
 Turn left onto Michigan Ave.<br>
 Go down Michigan Ave. about four or five longish<br>
blocks, past  McCamley. You'll cross the river.<br>
 Kellogg's Cereal City USA is the red brick building<br>
located on the left side of the street just across the<br>
river.<br>
Turn left into the parking area.<br>

These boxes (baggies) do not have to be done in any<br>
particular order.<br>
The map pieces will not be in place until Friday<br>
evening, late.<br>
