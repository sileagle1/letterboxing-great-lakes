Does anyone still have this HH in their posession?  If so, could you send it to me?  Or if you find it, please snag it.  I know this is not really appropriate, but it was last reported found in "The Old Trunk in the Attic" in Groveport, Ohio.<br>
<br>
It was supposed to remain within a particular postal which to my knowledge had never materialized.  I had sent it to the originator but never heard from her about it - apparently she must have released it as a regular HH without my knowledge.  I didn't mean it to go that route.<br>
<br>
If you find it, please contact me offlist for my address.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
