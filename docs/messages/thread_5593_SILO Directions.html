  I forgot where the SILO event located. Can someone remind me, please? It<br/>
  sounds like so much fun, though I think I remember it being a bit far for me<br/>
  On a different note, just for a bit of Mardi Gras historical trivia, below<br/>
  I'll paste a portion of an article I once wrote about a fundraiser party to<br/>
  benefit a pregnancy center.... <br/>
<br/>
  "Upon entering the gymnasium, party-goers walked through a tinsel curtain<br/>
  and were greeted with metallic beads of purple, green and gold. These<br/>
  triune colors traditionally representing justice, faith and power, could be<br/>
  seen throughout the crowd's festive attire. <br/>
  A long line of hungry participants awaited the Creole dishes similar to<br/>
  those served when Mardi Gras found it's way into America via French<br/>
  Catholics in the deep south. Gumbo, jambalaya, barbeque chicken and much<br/>
  more filled the plates of many." <br/>
