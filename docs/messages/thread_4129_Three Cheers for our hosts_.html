                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great job guys! You really were organized! We loved that the gathering <br/>
meal was at dinner rather than luch. Gave us more time to crunch in <br/>
those boxes. 37 boxes total for the weekend! We are really close to <br/>
F100! We had a great time with Azobox and the Rabbits! The park was <br/>
sooo BIG that you hardly had any log in back ups. Thanks for <br/>
everything! Can't wait for the next one!<br/>

I'm still giggling over that Macro box stamp, logbook and pencil. Too <br/>
funny. Such great thinking and creativity. <br/>

Thanks to everyone I met at the picnic area and on the trail, you made <br/>
the event!<br/>

I did post a bunch of other pics.<br/>
