                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a couple of reminders as we near the gathering:<br/>
<br/>
1) If you are bringing hitchhikers to the gathering, please do not<br/>
place them out "for everyone to stamp into" unless this has been<br/>
specifically requested by the owner of the HH.  Hitchhikers may be<br/>
placed in the various boxes at the gathering for others to find and<br/>
move on as normal.<br/>
<br/>
2) If there is anything on the "Show Your Stuff" table, it is there<br/>
for viewing only.  Do not stamp any letterboxes on that table - you<br/>
must find them when they are placed if you want to record them as a<br/>
find and get their stamp image.<br/>
<br/>
3) There is a specific time set aside for exchanges.  Although there<br/>
will be letterboxers arriving late, leaving early, etc., as much as<br/>
possible, leave all exchanging to that time frame and be there for<br/>
others to exchange with you at that time.  Exchanges can be made at<br/>
any time, but if it is left "willy nilly" as last year, everyone finds<br/>
themselves exchanging all day with no time to box!<br/>
<br/>
4) It is not really proper to ask someone if they have a WOM box.  You<br/>
might ask if they have a clue to share, but even that is borderline. <br/>
Just keep your eyes and ears peeled when you are at the gathering, and<br/>
on this talk list.  BTW, I think some people may be leaving for MI<br/>
soon, so some people might want to make certain post no later than<br/>
this weekend ;-)<br/>
<br/>
5) If you are in to collecting personal travellers, don't forget to<br/>
check for their clues.<br/>

about all this "higher level" letterboxing - maybe I should stick to <br/>
just finding letterboxes - I wouldn't get in trouble that way!  <br/>
Honestly, with this being our first gathering event this coming <br/>
weekend in MI, I'm a little bit nervous about what to expect.  I've <br/>
had second thoughts about coming, but my curiosity and excitement <br/>
keep winning out over my fears.  After reading the past posts, it <br/>
sounds like so much fun!  And for the most part, (I wasn't sure about <br/>
the discussion re: duct tape..smelling like chocolate!) you all sound <br/>
like a great bunch of people - what else would we expect from others <br/>
that enjoy this addicting, nature-loving, history-loving, adventure-<br/>
loving, mystery-loving, clue-solving pastime!<br/>
<br/>
I hope I won't break anymore rules unintentionally...if I do, we'll <br/>
just change our trail name to "Makes Mistakes Often" or "Old FootIn <br/>
Mouth."  I hope as newbies we are still welcomed....<br/>

Don't worry about it.  Most of us broke this "etiquette" last year and<br/>
at other gatherings, including me.  Also, remember, there are no<br/>
rules! ;-)<br/>

&gt; You<br/>
&gt; &gt; might ask if they have a clue to share, but even that is <br/>

<br/>
Please allow me to clarify something on this note.  It is improper for<br/>
you to ask someone you know that has a WOM box for their WOM clue.  It<br/>
is okay to ask each other for or to plain simply pass on another<br/>
boxer's WOM clues unless the owner of the WOM box has stated<br/>
restrictions on how the WOM clues are to be passed on.  So, even if<br/>
you asked someone in the morning if they have heard of any WOM clues<br/>
and they didn't have any to pass on then, doesn't mean they won't have<br/>
some in the afternoon....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One idea might be a separate "EB" count for all the interesting boxes that are<br/>
available at an event, but require no problem-solving to find.  I'd use it for<br/>
boxes like these, and others that are too fancy to hide, and are just <br/>
available<br/>
on a table to stamp into.   We've only been to one event so far (the 2003 GLG)<br/>
and there was only one box that fit that criteria -- one of the "K-Martha"s --<br/>
so just counted it as "F" since we had no other category.<br/>
<br/>
I think it does make sense to keep this type of box separate from:<br/>
- the "E" count, which shows how many events you've attended.<br/>
- the "F" count, which seems best for boxes that you truly have to find...<br/>
whether by word-of-mouth clues, or published clues distributed at the <br/>
event, or<br/>
so on.<br/>
<br/>
Will be interested to hear others' ideas on this topic.  I certainly <br/>
don't worry<br/>
too much about how we count our boxes, but it's nice to have a <br/>
consistent method<br/>
to use.<br/>
