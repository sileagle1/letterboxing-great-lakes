                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a couple of reminders as we near the gathering:<br>
<br>
1) If you are bringing hitchhikers to the gathering, please do not<br>
place them out "for everyone to stamp into" unless this has been<br>
specifically requested by the owner of the HH.  Hitchhikers may be<br>
placed in the various boxes at the gathering for others to find and<br>
move on as normal.<br>
<br>
2) If there is anything on the "Show Your Stuff" table, it is there<br>
for viewing only.  Do not stamp any letterboxes on that table - you<br>
must find them when they are placed if you want to record them as a<br>
find and get their stamp image.<br>
<br>
3) There is a specific time set aside for exchanges.  Although there<br>
will be letterboxers arriving late, leaving early, etc., as much as<br>
possible, leave all exchanging to that time frame and be there for<br>
others to exchange with you at that time.  Exchanges can be made at<br>
any time, but if it is left "willy nilly" as last year, everyone finds<br>
themselves exchanging all day with no time to box!<br>
<br>
4) It is not really proper to ask someone if they have a WOM box.  You<br>
might ask if they have a clue to share, but even that is borderline. <br>
Just keep your eyes and ears peeled when you are at the gathering, and<br>
on this talk list.  BTW, I think some people may be leaving for MI<br>
soon, so some people might want to make certain post no later than<br>
this weekend ;-)<br>
<br>
5) If you are in to collecting personal travellers, don't forget to<br>
check for their clues.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
See you at the gathering!<br>

about all this "higher level" letterboxing - maybe I should stick to <br>
just finding letterboxes - I wouldn't get in trouble that way!  <br>
Honestly, with this being our first gathering event this coming <br>
weekend in MI, I'm a little bit nervous about what to expect.  I've <br>
had second thoughts about coming, but my curiosity and excitement <br>
keep winning out over my fears.  After reading the past posts, it <br>
sounds like so much fun!  And for the most part, (I wasn't sure about <br>
the discussion re: duct tape..smelling like chocolate!) you all sound <br>
like a great bunch of people - what else would we expect from others <br>
that enjoy this addicting, nature-loving, history-loving, adventure-<br>
loving, mystery-loving, clue-solving pastime!<br>
<br>
I hope I won't break anymore rules unintentionally...if I do, we'll <br>
just change our trail name to "Makes Mistakes Often" or "Old FootIn <br>
Mouth."  I hope as newbies we are still welcomed....<br>

Don't worry about it.  Most of us broke this "etiquette" last year and<br>
at other gatherings, including me.  Also, remember, there are no<br>
rules! ;-)<br>

<br>
Please allow me to clarify something on this note.  It is improper for<br>
you to ask someone you know that has a WOM box for their WOM clue.  It<br>
is okay to ask each other for or to plain simply pass on another<br>
boxer's WOM clues unless the owner of the WOM box has stated<br>
restrictions on how the WOM clues are to be passed on.  So, even if<br>
you asked someone in the morning if they have heard of any WOM clues<br>
and they didn't have any to pass on then, doesn't mean they won't have<br>
some in the afternoon....<br>

Boch's Circus arrived at our home on Friday. Be prepared for some awesome boxes. With our late arrival in Michigan on Friday evening, the Circus will be on the Events table since there will not be time to hide them. So . . .<br>
<br>
Not to start a controversy, but, how will you count the stamps, if at all? <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One idea might be a separate "EB" count for all the interesting boxes that are<br>
available at an event, but require no problem-solving to find.  I'd use it for<br>
boxes like these, and others that are too fancy to hide, and are just <br>
available<br>
on a table to stamp into.   We've only been to one event so far (the 2003 GLG)<br>
and there was only one box that fit that criteria -- one of the "K-Martha"s --<br>
so just counted it as "F" since we had no other category.<br>
<br>
I think it does make sense to keep this type of box separate from:<br>
- the "E" count, which shows how many events you've attended.<br>
- the "F" count, which seems best for boxes that you truly have to find...<br>
whether by word-of-mouth clues, or published clues distributed at the <br>
event, or<br>
so on.<br>
<br>
Will be interested to hear others' ideas on this topic.  I certainly <br>
don't worry<br>
too much about how we count our boxes, but it's nice to have a <br>
consistent method<br>
to use.<br>

photo album.  We don't have anything elaborate (some of the journals <br>
we've seen are AMAZING!) but we do enjoy revisiting the images.  When <br>
our nieces and nephews are riding in the car with us, they often ask if <br>
they can look through our books since they also enjoy looking at the <br>
variety of stamps.<br>
