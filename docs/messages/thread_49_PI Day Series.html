                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found the 6 boxes in Dragon's PI series today (only 3 days left <br>
for this "limited time" series).  Very colorful and amusing - We <br>
especially liked the Moon PI box!  There were intermittant showers so <br>
we did get a bit wet retrieving and replacing some of the boxes.  <br>
Luckily this is a mostly "urban" series so we could do our stamping <br>
in the comfort of our dry car.  We were the 5th couple to stamp in <br>
since "PI Day", March 14.<br>
<br>
This brings us to F76, so we're closing in on the F100 milestone.  <br>
Unfortunately Martini Man is having foot problems, so that may <br>
curtail searching for boxes on longer hikes, at least for a while.<br>
