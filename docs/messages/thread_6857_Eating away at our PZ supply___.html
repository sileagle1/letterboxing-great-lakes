Yes, we love our PZ Kut.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night, I was carving another event stamp for Dead Of Winter II too.  I save every scrap of PZ Kut because once my stash is gone, it's gone.  I only have 19 slabs left...plus scraps in a baggie.   Most is Grade A White, some is Grade B White, and some orange too.  But it's all that good 'old' PZ Kut.  <br/>

Yeah, I didn't even realize I had that much PZ Kut.  Today, I was cleaning up my work area and I found 3 more slabs of White Grade A in an mailing envelope.  I use to order 5 or 10 slabs at a time.  I placed a large order for a carving workshop which was cancelled just before the company stopped making the good old stuff.  And then my husband ordered more PZ Kut for me for a Christmas present a while ago.  Santa was very good to me that year.  My husband never knows what to buy me so PZ Kut is his ace in the hole.  Some women want diamonds, but not me.   What more can I say.....but when it's gone, it's gone.  <br/>

Now I know how lottery winners feel.  Suddenly, everyone wants to be your friend.  But I'd give it ALL away in trade for an arranged audience with Sir Paul.  Does anyone have connections?  (sigh) <br/>
