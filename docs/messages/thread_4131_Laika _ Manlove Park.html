Ok!  Same question, different stamps..<br>

The Laika stamp.... Kimono Girl was walking around asking for good <br>
dog stories to get this stamp.  I think she said she didn't carve <br>
it.  But, does anyone know who did?<br>

Also, the Manlove Park stamp?  Who's was that?<br>

<br>
Yeah, its not your Laika.  We found that one!<br>
<br>
This was a special dog event stamp made especially for the Cluez-In <br>
event.  I think you had to have a dog or tell a dog story to get the stamp.<br>

Thanks!  I checked all over AQ and LBNA under different types of <br>
boxes, different names.  No luck!  It never occurred to me to check <br>
that database listing!  I didn't know the real name of the box, so I <br>
was having a hard time.<br>
