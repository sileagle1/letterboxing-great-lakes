I've been watching the news reports and reading the newspapers about the<br>
rain, flooding, and dam conditions in WI, especially the Mukwonago area. I'm<br>
signed up to participate in the Mukwonago Relay For Life on June 20-21. If<br>
that dam breaks, or the water seeks another route and cuts a new channel, or<br>
if it just continues to rain and rain and rain, I am concerned that the<br>
event may not be canceled, but we could be in an area when the dam could<br>
break later due to prior stress on the structure. Houses under water. Some<br>
houses are in the river and floating down stream. Scary!!!<br>

Tornado warnings here today also.  We were advised to go to the stairwells<br>
in our office, but after 10-15 minutes the warning was over (very few<br>
actually went to the stairwells).  My sister and brother-in-law work<br>
downtown and they also were all told to go to certain areas (they all did,<br>
but working in a 10-story building, perhaps they felt more at risk).<br>
However it didn't really seem too bad, so we picked up my mom and we had a<br>
party of 7 at a  happy-hour at a local restaurant to celebrate her b-day.<br>
Luckily none of us has had any real issues so far, so we are able to just<br>
continue on with our normal activities (other than a few road detours along<br>
the way).<br>

We'll let you know when we plan to head down your way - maybe late July or<br>
August...<br>

The road from Baraboo to Sauk City coming down from the Baraboo ridge near Devil's Lake is washing out along the sides. The intersection of I 39 and I 94 is under water. Many of the roads inBaraboo are closed and the local gendarme called in the Wisconsin Ducks to help evacuate folks. I suspect it will be awhile at the rate things are going.I would love to say I would check on them for you, but I think they are beyond my physical capability (need a knee replacement, but am putting it off as long as possible).

We had a heck of a lot of flooding spring a year ago - although our rains<br>
came in smaller quantities over a period of several weeks.  It sure has<br>
changed our landscape though!<br>
<br>
Let me offer a word of encouragement box-wise - we had quite a few boxes<br>
planted near and around lakes and bodies of water.  Many of them washed<br>
away, many of them were underwater for months.  We are finally sorting them<br>
out and many of the submerged boxes have survived!  Unbelievably - they've<br>
survived!  A few were soggy, but many were unharmed.  We can hope y'all are<br>
as lucky.  The whole experience has been a textbook for good planting...but<br>
that comes later.<br>
<br>
Stay dry y'all, and take care!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Iowa is seriously in trouble. I-80 is underwater at the Cedar river between  <br>
us and Iowa City.<br>
 <br>
Iowa City is only an hours drive from Moline, on I-80.<br>
 <br>
They are diverting ALL traffic who needs to get to Des Moines or Iowa City  <br>
up through Dubuque, then Hwy 20 across to Hwy 35 down to I-80.<br>
 <br>
To give you an idea, now instead of an hours drive we are detoured 1:15 up  <br>
to Dubuque, then 2:30 minutes to Hwy 35 then 1:15 to Des Moines then 1:45 to  <br>
Iowa City . . . . . total detour time . . . 6 hours 45 minutes!!!<br>
 <br>
We have oxygen patients who live out near Iowa City -- if we have to go out  <br>
there it may be a near 14 hour day drive time alone... unless there is an  <br>
alternate (of which I haven't heard yet).<br>

I had a box ready to plant at one of my favorite bridges, Sutlif Bridge.<br>
