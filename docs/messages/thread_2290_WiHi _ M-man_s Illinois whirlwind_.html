We actually got to meet Old Hounder and Siamese in Florida at the SSS <br>
Gathering in Florida and couldn't believe they'd found 800 boxes in <br>
less than a year - pretty impressive!  I bet they could have added to <br>
our old TOTW  - "You know you are obsessed when...!"  That factor <br>
aside, they proved to be delightful letterboxers just like our own big <br>
finders Wisconsin Hiker & Martini Man!  Congratulations on your 1200th!<br>

Hey, remember that it was really pretty nice on Saturday and there were lots<br>
of people out!  It didn't snow until Sunday....<br>
<br>
We got lots of boxes (won't say exactly how many since we wouldn't want to<br>
give away any surprises) and 5 new exchanges.  We were somewhat surprised<br>
that we didn't find any hitchhikers, and  also didn't find any during our IL<br>
trip at the end of December.  I hope they haven't all been collected and<br>
placed in HH Hostels....  (We really like the random surprise of finding a<br>
HH in a regular box, so don't go to hostels for "planned trades".)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny you did not find any HH's - we went out this week specifically <br>
to send one on its way and ended up with another in our possession, <br>
LOL!  The little Cat Herders thought this was VERY funny!<br>
<br>
Speaking of checking on boxes (Dragon's email) - Wisconsin Hiker - I <br>
was going to do a quick check on the Winter Fun #1 since we were out <br>
"hiking" there in the snow, slush and mud at another time this week <br>
and were going right by it - but the location was so nicely covered <br>
with snow, any checking would have been too obvious, LOL!  I did show <br>
my husband the spot where we did finally find it (he was not with on <br>
that triumphant day, LOL) when we were out there again on <br>
Saturday.  I would have checked again then, but there were too many <br>
muggles - everyone just had to be out when it was so beautiful <br>
yesterday, LOL!  I would assume it was safe and sound since there was <br>
absolutely no disturbance in the snow on it or around it.<br>
<br>
Hiking in a familiar place before things green up certainly gives a <br>
different perspective on how clues might be seen!  For the Winter Fun <br>
#1, it was so obvious where the clues were sending you vs when we <br>
started looking for it last summer and all the foliage and plants <br>
were in place!<br>
<br>
We went looking for a box that has eluded us (3 times and yet we know <br>
of one other letterboxer that could not find it and someone else <br>
found it afterwards, LOL).  The terrain was totally different in the <br>
winter (the box was planted in the early spring) than when we had <br>
been looking in the summer!  However, there were numerous trees that <br>
were down (storms and looked like some park planned cuttings) and we <br>
STILL could not find that box!  My husband says we are not looking <br>
for it anymore, LOL - it is driving him buggy that we cannot find it!<br>
<br>
Anyway, happy Letterboxing and enjoy slogging through the mud - I <br>
know my son did, heehee!<br>
