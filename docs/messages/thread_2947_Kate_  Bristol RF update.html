<br/>
  I'm sorry I missed everyone at the Faire this weekend! I did see <br/>
  Beetle for a moment or two during our Wench Walk, but retired behind <br/>
  the scenes to overcome a bout of illness (which turned out to be <br/>
  caused by my outfit not being properly adjusted - oops). Barefoot <br/>
  Ankh enjoyed meeting and exchanging with the Brat Pack and seeing the <br/>
  Cottontails, even though he couldn't get out of the shop. I was out <br/>
  and about all day on Sunday as well, so I've been particularly <br/>
  difficult to find, although I ran into RaqsEnigma and DerMadStamper <br/>
  briefly! <br/>
<br/>
  After taking nearly 2 weeks to get William Shakespeare replaced, I <br/>
  was lucky enough to find RaqsEnigma and ask her about where she found <br/>
  William. Turns out he was lost in the high landscaping in another <br/>
  nearby area, so Dragon's original is back where he belongs and my <br/>
  replacement has been pulled unless he's needed again. Huzzah! I will <br/>
  combine the logbooks as well, so there's no need to make another trip <br/>
  unless you really want to see if there's a difference in the stamps!<br/>
<br/>
  I'm considering an addition to my costume to make me a little more <br/>
  obvious to visiting boxers. I was thinking of making a sash with a <br/>
  6" or 7"-square LB NA logo on each end, either quilted or <br/>
  embroidered. This might be easier to spot me at the Faire, since I'm <br/>
  not as obvious to spot as the other letterpeople, I'm not usually at <br/>
  the shop, and my outfit changes depending on the weather and my <br/>
  activities. Would that help?<br/>
<br/>
  Hope to see more boxers this season!<br/>
<br/>
