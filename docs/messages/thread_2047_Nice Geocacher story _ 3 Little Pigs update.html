                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, when we returned home from the Twin Cities from Thanksgiving weekend, there was a message on our answering machine from a woman who identified herself as a geocacher.  She said she was walking her dog down in the nature area where Three Little Pigs: House of Sticks is hidden, and she found the logbook just lying out in the open!  I am lucky she was a geocacher and she recognized it as a logbook and took it home and dried it out.  And then she looked me up in the phone book, left a message and offered to drop it off at my house tomorrow!  She said she had never heard of letterboxing before until she posted a message on her geocaching board asking what to do with the logbook.  Several people responded that it sounded like a letterboxing logbook, not geocaching. <br/>

<br/>
Just thought I should spread the word about some friendly and helpful cachers!  Also, don't go looking for the 3 Pigs House of Sticks box just yet...I'm going to have to go check on it and see if the rest of the box is even still there.  --Papeseed<br/>

<br/>
To add to the nice geocacher story, not only was the logbook in my mailbox when I got home as promised, but the box and stamp itself were in between my front doors with this note on a napkin:  "After I put your logbook in your mailbox, I went back out there with my dog to pick up garbage.  Guess what I found!  I don't know why I didn't see it before.  It was laying in the marsh, open.  I found the cover several feet away.  Maybe an animal got into it??"  I can't believe a total stranger was so nice as to deliver my poor box parts to my house...not once, but TWICE.  And I can't believe my luck that THE SAME PERSON stumbled upon the scattered contents of my box at different times and places and KNEW THEY WENT TOGETHER!!!  I feel like one LUCKY PIG today!  :-)<br/>

BTW, it was the House of Straw that got blown down, not the House of Sticks like I first said.  --Papeseed<br/>
