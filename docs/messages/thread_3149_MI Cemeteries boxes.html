Hi there!  I'm looking for boxes hidden in cemeteries in SE <br>
Michigan.  I swear when I was just browsing around a bunch of random <br>
clues, I saw a whole series of them over near St. Clair, Port Huron <br>
or somewhere in that area.  But, now that I want to go out and find <br>
them, I can't find the clues on Atlas Quest or LbNA.<br>
<br>
I think there were about 6-7 boxes all planted by the same <br>
person/people.  Maybe I was redirected to a personal site and the <br>
clues weren't listed on AQ or LbNA.<br>
<br>
Do these sound familiar to anyone?  If so, could you please point me <br>
in the right direction?<br>
<br>
Or do you know of any cemetery plants within an hour or less drive of <br>
metro Detroit?  I found a bunch at the north end or far west side of <br>
Michigan, but I'm looking for some that are closer that we can get to <br>
and find without having to drive for hours first.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>

Thanks Doglvrs!  I swear the boxes I thought I meant were on the far <br>
east side of the state.  Yours are on the far west side.  But, I just <br>
looked at your clues again, and I think these were the boxes I was <br>
thinking about.  I don't know why I thought they were in St, Clair or <br>
Macomb counties.<br>
<br>
You boxes look really cool, but not feasible for us to drive over <br>
there, do the boxing and get back within a day.<br>
<br>
I'll keep those in mind for when we have more time.<br>
<br>
Thanks for setting me straight.<br>
