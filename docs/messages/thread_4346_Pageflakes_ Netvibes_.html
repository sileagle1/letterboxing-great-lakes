switched because the array of stuff you can put on your page with<br/>
Pageflakes and/or Netvibes is leaps and bounds ahead of My Yahoo. <br/>

Pageflakes and Netvibes allow you to make a page and publish it for<br/>
other users to add to their set of pages.  I have created a<br/>
"Letterboxing Resources" page that contains links to clue sites, yahoo<br/>
groups and informational sites about the hobby, as well as RSS feeds<br/>
from Mark &amp; Sue Pepe's blog and the AQ Event calendar.  All episodes<br/>
of Choi's Letterpod podcast are also there.  It is basically<br/>
everything letterboxing all in one place.  I plan to add some<br/>
additional blogs or links to blogs yet, but want to get permission<br/>
from the authors first.  I have the Pageflakes edition published and<br/>
publicly available -- just search the Pagecasts section for<br/>
"letterboxing" and you should find it.  I'm finishing up on the<br/>
Netvibes edition and should have that publicly available by the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
The really cool thing I foresee is individual letterboxers using this<br/>
as a kind of homepage, where they can place box information, reports<br/>
and/or clues and then publish their page for other letterboxers to<br/>
access...  I envision having a whole collection of pages from<br/>
different users, each being dynamically updated by that user with new<br/>
box clues and letterboxing information they wish to share with the<br/>
community.  I am working on a SpringChick page to make publicly<br/>
available -- some exclusive clues, other letterboxing things of<br/>
interest, but can't decide if I want to commit to Pageflakes or<br/>
Netvibes or offer both editions.<br/>

I like the Pageflakes page! Very useful. My question is, can this be <br/>
found with a google search? Or do you have to go to PageFlakes and <br/>
search from there (which is what I had to do to find it, but I am not <br/>
