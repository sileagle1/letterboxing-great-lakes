                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is there anyone using Pageflakes (http://www.pageflakes.com/) or<br>
Netvibes (http://www.netvibes.com/)?  In case you aren't familiar with<br>
either of these, they are web 2.0 personal portal applications.  The<br>
idea is a lot like "My Yahoo" where you build your own page or set of<br>
pages using modules that contain small applications, RSS feeds or<br>
podcasts.  I've been using My Yahoo for several years, but recently<br>
switched because the array of stuff you can put on your page with<br>
Pageflakes and/or Netvibes is leaps and bounds ahead of My Yahoo. <br>
Each of these two has its merits and drawbacks.  I'm using Netvibes,<br>
but lately have been flirting with Pageflakes and like what I see<br>
there too.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I won't bore you with my geekiness, if you are interested go<br>
and check them out for yourself. They are both free.  Feel free to<br>
e-mail me if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
So you may be wondering, how does this pertain to letterboxing?  Well<br>
Pageflakes and Netvibes allow you to make a page and publish it for<br>
other users to add to their set of pages.  I have created a<br>
"Letterboxing Resources" page that contains links to clue sites, yahoo<br>
groups and informational sites about the hobby, as well as RSS feeds<br>
from Mark & Sue Pepe's blog and the AQ Event calendar.  All episodes<br>
of Choi's Letterpod podcast are also there.  It is basically<br>
everything letterboxing all in one place.  I plan to add some<br>
additional blogs or links to blogs yet, but want to get permission<br>
from the authors first.  I have the Pageflakes edition published and<br>
publicly available -- just search the Pagecasts section for<br>
"letterboxing" and you should find it.  I'm finishing up on the<br>
Netvibes edition and should have that publicly available by the weekend.<br>
<br>
The really cool thing I foresee is individual letterboxers using this<br>
as a kind of homepage, where they can place box information, reports<br>
and/or clues and then publish their page for other letterboxers to<br>
access...  I envision having a whole collection of pages from<br>
different users, each being dynamically updated by that user with new<br>
box clues and letterboxing information they wish to share with the<br>
community.  I am working on a SpringChick page to make publicly<br>
available -- some exclusive clues, other letterboxing things of<br>
interest, but can't decide if I want to commit to Pageflakes or<br>
Netvibes or offer both editions.<br>

I like the Pageflakes page! Very useful. My question is, can this be <br>
found with a google search? Or do you have to go to PageFlakes and <br>
search from there (which is what I had to do to find it, but I am not <br>
exactly a web wizard)?<br>

Everything that is on this page is publicly available information and links so that isn't too concerning for me.  But when I make a page that is mine, with clues, letterbox tidbits, etc. to share with other letterboxers I think I will make it invite only and e-mail people the link who are interested.<br>
