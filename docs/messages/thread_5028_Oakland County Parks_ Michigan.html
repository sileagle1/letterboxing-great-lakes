I contacted them to find out, if we had an event at those parks could <br/>
we plant boxes.  The rules on their website state you have to get a <br/>
permit, and be a member of the Michigan Geocaching Organization to <br/>
plant a cache.<br/>
<br/>
They called me back today and told me that they were very interested <br/>
in letterboxing and were looking for someone to talk to them about it. <br/>
So I set a meeting up with them for Monday 10am.<br/>
Hopefully I can answer all their questions and we'll be able to <br/>
letterbox at Oakland County Parks!<br/>
<br/>
They have a link on their website.<br/>

<br/>
If any of you have experience dealing with your county/state advice <br/>
would be helpful.<br/>
