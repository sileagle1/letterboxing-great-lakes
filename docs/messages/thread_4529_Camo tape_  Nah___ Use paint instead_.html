<br/>
I personally prefer to camo PAINT my boxes: I've had 3 cans of<br/>
camo-colored spray paint and although at first the cans are a little<br/>
pricey; they'll last forever. Quick and easy with amazing results.<br/>
Sticks to plastic containers... dries quickly (geez I sound like a<br/>
commercial.) <br/>
<br/>
The stuff really does work good though; and I save my little Jo-Ann's<br/>
coupons so it doesn't cost as much. If I recall I think they're like<br/>
$6 a can maybe? (Krylon camouflage ultra-flat; bought at Jo-Ann's or<br/>
Michael's with 40% off coupon) I've done in full camo for one box,<br/>
while others I've used flat brown on one and flat black on another<br/>
(depending of course on where the box will be hidden.)<br/>

&gt; WOW!  I never expected to have as many or as varied of responses on <br/>
&gt; this topic!  I think I will stop by the army store tomorrow and<br/>
maybe wal-mart.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks so much for the advice everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To think, a year ago, I never knew camo tape existed, much less that <br/>
&gt; there were so many textures, colors, patterns, varieties of<br/>
tackiness, etc!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I like the cloth-type ones I've seen in use, because they seem like <br/>
&gt; the mold to the boxes better and blend in better.  I'll be on the <br/>
&gt; hunt for these!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My only real concern with the clothy type tapes is wether they absorb <br/>
&gt; water and get moldy or anything like that.  Has anyone had a problem<br/>
&gt; with that?<br/>
