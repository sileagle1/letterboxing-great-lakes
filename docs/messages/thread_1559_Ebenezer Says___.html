                    <div class="plaintext-content">After a report from the Puddlejumpers, I travelled out to visit my<br/>
"Ebenezer Says..." letterbox.  They had cleaned up the debris after an<br/>
animal attack, but the stamp had the bottom right side entirely gnawed<br/>
off.  I carved a new stamp, fixed the box, and replaced it.  I know<br/>
have the old, half-eaten stamp here.  I posted a picture of it in the<br/>
photos section, but I'm wondering what I should do for the stamp.  Is<br/>
there a graveyard for letterbox stamps?  Should I turn it into a<br/>
hitch-hiker or a personal traveller?  I wish I had my digital camera<br/>
with me because the stamp looks pretty cool in its half-eaten state.<br/>

All's well with "Ebenezer Says..." now so if you're ever in SW WI...<br/>

Also, I like your idea of a "stamp graveyard." I would start one in my<br/>
own yard if I thought people would send me there deceased, beloved<br/>
stamps and or logbooks!<br/>
<br/>
How Cool would that be? Rows of our little darlings laid to rest.<br/>
