I will be at the park in the Visitors Center starting<br/>
at 8:00 a.m. sharp with clue packets for all the<br/>
stamps. C'mon early birders. Come out and have a cup<br/>
of joe with me (I will not be providing heretofore<br/>
mentioned"joe" just so there's no confusion it's a<br/>
b.y.o.joe morning) and get a head start on the day.<br/>
Afton is a HUGE park and there is a lot of ground to<br/>
cover.<br/>

I have just one question for you, Gooble Gobble: after planting them,<br/>
are you poison-ivy free? It's supposed to be 80 on Saturday. I know I<br/>
should wear pants for that trek regardless.<br/>

Can't wait!<br/>

though for 2 reasons. One, I am immune to poison ivy,<br/>
just lucky I guess. Two, I never even bother to look<br/>
for poison ivy when I'm out because of reason number<br/>
one. So I can't answer your question.   : )<br/>
