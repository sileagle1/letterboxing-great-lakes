OMG ... the Celtic box has been taken hostage!? What did the note <br/>
say? Are they demanding a ransom? Or do you think it's gone for good?<br/>
<br/>
I've had one other box that went MIA but no note was left behind. <br/>
Has anyone else ever had a note left in the hiding spot saying that <br/>
the box had been taken hostage?<br/>
<br/>

Banjo Jim and I went back for the bonus stages of Fate of Easter<br/>
today, and two of the boxes are missing.  No trace of "Swirl Egg" at <br/>
all, and in place of "Celtic Knot Egg" was a note that said the box <br/>
has been taken hostage!  And we did take the note.<br/>

It is possible the Swirl Egg was really there as we found the 160 <br/>
degree reading to be off...found it at 260 degrees. (I did email <br/>
Bindle Babe re:our find)  Wonder who took the Celtic Egg hostage?  <br/>
This was a nice series of stamps!<br/>

printed the clues on the 10th.  That's no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have the note right here in front of me but it said something<br/>
like "Hi, I found your thing and am holding it hostage."  No signature<br/>
or mention of ransom.  Probably just a silly prank that isn't quite funny.<br/>
