Criminal Intent on Bravo, our typical Sunday night<br>
gearing-up-for-another-workweek activity.  In the one<br>
episode, the detectives had a search warrant for the<br>
murder suspect's car and were searching a backpack in<br>
the trunk, which had a bunch of Nemo-looking fish<br>
keyrings, along with some other miscellaneous<br>
trinkets.  He then pulled out some electronic device,<br>
and as he pulled out a notebook I realized the<br>
electronic device was a GPS unit.  I looked at Deedle,<br>
wide-eyed, and he had the same expression on his face.<br>
 We both cried out, "She's a geocacher!!!!"<br>
<br>
Sure enough, in the next scene, back at the police<br>
station, the detective had pulled up a webpage talking<br>
about geocaching (I don't think it was the official<br>
geocaching webpage, rather one made for the TV show's<br>
use).  Since the squad was looking for the murder<br>
weapon, they got the idea that the suspect had hid it<br>
in the park where she'd found her last cache.  So the<br>
next scene is a bunch of police searching this park. <br>
Of course, when they found the cache, it was buried in<br>
the ground, which I'm pretty sure is a geocaching<br>
no-no as it is in letterboxing.<br>
<br>
As Deedle & I said to each other, least she wasn't a<br>
letterboxer!!!<br>
