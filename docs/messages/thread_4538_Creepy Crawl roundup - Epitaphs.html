Dragon for a great event.  It was well-organized, good clues, the <br>
stamps were fabulous, and it was a great after-party.  I had a blast <br>
with PoPoBullyGrl and Crystal Skydancer, even if we weren't the <br>
speediest team. And thanks again to SunFleur and MIPatriot for <br>
retrieving the beeper that I lost in the Novi cemetery (doh!) <br>
<br>
For those who are interested, I uploaded the complete text of the <br>
epitaphs that were on the graveyard cake.  They're in the files <br>
section under "Gatherings".  I hope I didn't creep anybody out by <br>
burying them!  (And SpartanFans, sorry about that Wolverine - I just <br>
couldn't resist.)<br>
<br>
So, who's up for the mini-meet in Fenton on Nov. 10???  Check out AQ <br>
for details.<br>

Those are so great!  Thanks for sharing the complete list, TT.  I <br>
didn't get a chance to read most of them!  Very clever!<br>
