                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Yep, I think the vacations have something to do with it", she laments, as<br>
she thinks ahead to another summer of a short-staffed lab with many hours of<br>
time spent NOT letterboxing.  Okay, everyone together now, "Oh, momma, don't<br>
let your babies grow up to be Med Techs....".<br>
<br>
Enough of the pity party!<br>
<br>
I've got two weekends at camp to look forward to, where I'm hoping to get a<br>
few more boxes placed.  I'll finally be able to get my letterbook placed,<br>
and carved another stamp last night...an owl I'll be placing at the lookout<br>
where we go to listen to the owls.  Placing seems to fit better into my<br>
schedule than finding.  But I do want to get over to Starved Rock as well as<br>
looking for the other west suburban boxes.<br>
<br>
Mostly though I live vicariously through the stories you guys tell!  Keep<br>
'em coming!!<br>
