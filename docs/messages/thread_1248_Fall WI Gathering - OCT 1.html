So for those of you (like me) who like to plan ahead, please mark OCT <br/>
1 on your calendar if you're interested in attending a gathering in <br/>
Menomonee Falls, WI on Saturday OCT 1.  (Menomonee Falls is about 15 <br/>
miles northwest of Milwaukee)  The gathering will be held at <br/>
Menomonee Park which "has 394 acres of rolling field, high quality <br/>
maple woods, cattail marsh, wetlands, and a 16-acre quarry lake". <br/>
I've rented the beach house right on the shore of the quarry so we <br/>
will have an enclosed shelter with kitchen facilities.  There is also <br/>
an attached covered patio with picnic tables and a nearby playground <br/>
for the younger LBers.  There are a number of trails in the park <br/>
which should be suitable for hiding boxes.<br/>
<br/>
A limited number of camping sites are also available in the park.  <br/>
Apparently the group sites are reservable and the 33 individual sites <br/>
are "first-come, first-serve".  Here's a link to the park web site if <br/>
you want more info right away: <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I'll create a web site for the event within the next week or two, but <br/>
just wanted to give you all an early notice that things are finalized.<br/>
<br/>
I hope many of you can make it!<br/>
