                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was reading "Book Page"--a book review magazine given away at our <br>
library.  The tagline for a book called "Abomination" read:  Somewhere <br>
in a secret geocache lies the unspeakable clue.  Apparently, the book <br>
is about a serial killer who posts clues about his next victim on a <br>
geocaching website.  From reading a review, it also seems that the <br>
killer uploads the GPS coordinates of the dead body on the geocaching <br>
website as well.  Certainly wouldn't want to be looking for that <br>
geocache!  I don't like creepy/scary serial killer books, so I don't <br>
plan on looking for the book, but thought it had an interesting twist.  <br>
