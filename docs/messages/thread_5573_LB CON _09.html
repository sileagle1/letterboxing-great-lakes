will be LB CON '09.<br>
<br>
This is gaining momentum and just today has hit 300 signed up to <br>
attend. This number is already larger than the sign up for BABE & Live <br>
and Breathe!!<br>
<br>
Letterboxers from coast to coast are already signed up and there's <br>
still half a year until the gathering! <br>
<br>
Here are the links to the gathering, I hope to see a large <br>
representative of Great Lakers there.<br>

for LB Con.<br>
 <br>
There are 307 signed up. Representing 34 states & 2 countries <br>
 <br>
I didn't do a tally on how many for each state, I just crossed off the  <br>
states from the list.<br>
 <br>
There will be folks from;<br>
 <br>
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,  <br>
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,  <br>
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New  <br>
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode  <br>
Island, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia & Washington.<br>
 <br>
Countries; Montreal, Canada & Hampshire, England.<br>
 <br>
The only state missing from our Great Lakes Region is Wisconsin!!<br>
 <br>
I am not planning on finding a single letterbox all weekend....... I'll be  <br>
to busy exchanging!!!! :-)<br>
