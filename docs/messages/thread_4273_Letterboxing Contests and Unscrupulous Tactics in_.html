I think you should absolutely contact them.  Explain that this isn't <br>
the spirit of letterboxing and that it takes out most of the fun, as <br>
well as endangers the boxes.  Contact the main number of the <br>
organizers, but also, I'd email all of the finders that you know of <br>
within this group to explain it, too.  Maybe if you reach enough of <br>
them, it'll sink in and the word will spread among them.<br>
<br>
Also, please let us know which town this is originating from and post <br>
links to the newspaper article you mentioned and to whatever else <br>
they've posted.  Maybe others here are interested in contacting them as well.<br>
<br>
I have one box in Mid-Michigan that concerns me.  It's technically a <br>
mystery box, but if someone figures out where it is and just posts <br>
the exact location to the box, it'll be in jeopardy, too.  Plus, I'm <br>
only a couple hours from you, so when they run out of boxes in your <br>
area, it's conceivable that they'll head this way.<br>
<br>
I found one of your boxes recently and the stamp was awesome.  I plan <br>
on coming back over there to find the rest sometime, so I'd hate to <br>
see them be destroyed.  I was pretty surprised at the number of <br>
log-ins in the log book when I was there, but now that you mention <br>
this, that explains a lot!<br>
