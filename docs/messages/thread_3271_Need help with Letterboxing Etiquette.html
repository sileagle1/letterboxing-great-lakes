                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first question I must ask is do you have a box planted and did <br/>
you carve it yourself? It isn't that we want to exclude people from <br/>
joining in on the fun, or prevent new people from joining the LB <br/>
world. After all we were all newbies at one time or another. We just <br/>
want people to understand how much effort goes into making a box, <br/>
especially when you carve the stamp yourself. I think, at the risk <br/>
of sounding corny, we all feel that a peice of ourselves goes into <br/>
our art work that may take days to create. And when we, as the <br/>
placer, find out that our box is distroid by the carelessness of new <br/>
boxers, it hurts to know someone cares so little for our creation. <br/>
We just want people to understand that you need to rehide the boxes <br/>
well, and to understand how you would feel if you just spent three <br/>
days on a stamp just to have it go missing in 2 weeks and you have <br/>
to carve it all over again. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, since I'm on a roll...<br/>
<br/>
Gleening from recent past posts on this list, here are<br/>
some highlights:<br/>
<br/>
As I said in my previous post, resist the urge to<br/>
scream "I found it!!" if there are others around. <br/>
However, if you're alone on the trail, by all means<br/>
break out into the Happy Happy Joy Joy dance. <br/>
However, be forwarned - my husband Deedle's Rule Of<br/>
Letterboxing #1 is that no matter where you are, as<br/>
soon as you get ready to stamp in someone else will<br/>
appear.  You can be letterboxing on the top of Mt.<br/>
Everest, positive that you are the only one around,<br/>
and as soon as you have everything spread out in front<br/>
of you to begin the stamping in process, someone will<br/>
come walking by with their dog.  <br/>
<br/>
ALWAYS bring water with you.  And if these are<br/>
families with kids, especially if the family choses to<br/>
do a longer hike, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea<br/>
to bring some snacks too.  However, before grabbing<br/>
the letterbox, make sure that anyone who was touching<br/>
food wipes their hands.  The animals have good noses<br/>
and the food scent might transfer to the box.  <br/>
<br/>
The #1 Letterboxing Crime of late has been the poorly<br/>
rehidden box.  If little Johnny has been given the<br/>
duty of rehiding the box, have Mom and/or Dad watching<br/>
to make sure that no colored corners are poking out. <br/>
As much as you might think you're doing the next<br/>
letterboxer a favor by letting a corner of the plastic<br/>
baggie poke out of the hiding place (and I admit,<br/>
Deedle &amp; I used to think that way, too), it's more of<br/>
a chance for a non-boxer with ill intent to find the<br/>
box and wreak havoc instead.  After hiding a box,<br/>
Deedle &amp; I both make sure that we cannot spot it from<br/>
the trail, but that the rehiding also doesn't look<br/>
suspicious.  That pile of rocks in the middle of the<br/>
field might also perk up the interest of the non-boxer<br/>
with ill intent.<br/>
<br/>
If boxing with kids, teach them to treat the land with<br/>
respect.  They are in the animals' home, so teach them<br/>
to stay on the trail, and if they need to leave the<br/>
trail to tread lightly, try not to trample plants. <br/>
And large sticks are meant to be used as walking<br/>
sticks, not to attack every tree they pass.  And if<br/>
they're screaming as they walk, they'll miss the<br/>
opportunity to see animals in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
This goes along with searching FOR the box.  Treat the<br/>
land with respect, especially when searching for the<br/>
letterboxer.  Sometimes it's just not there, and in<br/>
these cases, try not to leave the forest looking like<br/>
you were digging up land minds in your effort to find<br/>
the letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
When logging in, since some of those logbooks don't<br/>
have much room, encourage the families to use one<br/>
family stamp or have individual stamps small enough to<br/>
fit on one page.  And with stamps, if they can't clean<br/>
the ink off the stamp (blotting on a wet paper towel<br/>
is all that's really necessary to clean it), encourage<br/>
them to wrap the stamp in a paper towel to keep ink<br/>
from spreading to the logbook and container and<br/>
baggies.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, and this is probably the most important aspect<br/>
of letterboxing with children, teach them that they<br/>
won't always find the box, but that's just part of the<br/>
game.  It's a metaphor for life.  And just because<br/>
they didn't find the box doesn't mean it wasn't worth<br/>
the hike.  Encourage parents to make it more about the<br/>
trip than it is about the outcome.  Although, when we<br/>
don't find the box, Deedle &amp; I have learned that ice<br/>
cream works wonders to console ourselves with.  :)<br/>
<br/>
As for the LbNA website, I think it's OK to share the<br/>
letterboxing.org address with your homeschoolers,<br/>
since technically that IS what the website is for. <br/>
And especially because they have a whole section on<br/>
that website dedicated to "getting started" which is<br/>
important for newer letterboxers to read.  The issue<br/>
some of us have had with this recent article is that<br/>
we didn't post our clues on letterboxing.org so that<br/>
they can be included without permission in an article<br/>
that includes pictures of what the stamp image looks<br/>
like and a shot of the hiding spot.  That's just,<br/>
well, like telling someone the ending of the movie<br/>
they're on their way to see.  <br/>
<br/>
Boy am I long-winded today!!<br/>
