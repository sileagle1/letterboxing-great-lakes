civilized lodging appeals to us after a long, often hot, day of event<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
This time, we've chosen one of the more civilized campground options.<br/>
 You'll find us in one of the 3 cedar cabins in area 2, which have<br/>
their own full plumbing.  The web site shows that there's still one<br/>
available for that weekend, as well as some of the camper cabins where<br/>
the plumbing is in the shared building.  It also indicated that there<br/>
are 2 RVs available for rent, but we didn't see a way to reserve one<br/>
on the web and we didn't see them on the map.  If an RV appeals to<br/>
you, you might want to call the park to see whether that's truly an<br/>
option or not.<br/>
<br/>
If we hadn't been able to reserve a cabin, we would have asked a hotel<br/>
if they could provide a group rate or at least reserve a block for the<br/>
Great Lakes Group.  We thought it might be a convenient way to connect<br/>
with other letterboxers who were interested in meeting for dinner<br/>
after cleaning up at the hotel.  Something for the hotel folks to<br/>
think about since you can often reserve a block without committing to<br/>
a particular number a rooms.<br/>
