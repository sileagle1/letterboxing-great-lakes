                    <div class="plaintext-content">While working on the WI LBs of Antiquities pages, I've been given and<br/>
found some information I thought I'd better pass on before the pages<br/>
go "live".<br/>
<br/>
We now know the reason for the sudden disappearance of the Wehr and<br/>
Boerner boxes (and possibly the Attack Goose box).  Capt Jim, the<br/>
owner of the first two boxes, was contacted by the grounds keeper at<br/>
the park and was told to remove the boxes as the constituted an<br/>
unacceptable activity.  Jim promptly removed the boxes and still has<br/>
them, but they are retired for good.<br/>
<br/>
Curiosity got the better of me, and I did a search for the policy of<br/>
the Mil Cty Parks that this grounds keeper seemed to be trying to<br/>
enforce.  I have found no policy for or against<br/>
geocaching/letterboxing on the Cty Parks land or in the state of WI. <br/>
I did dind out however, that the WI Geocachers Assoc. is trying to be<br/>
proactive (without our input) in establishing a policy with the DNR. <br/>
So far the DNR hasn't seemed to give them the time of day and doesn't<br/>
seem to care.  Some of the policies the geocachers are proposing to<br/>
the DNR might concern us though, such as limits on numbers and<br/>
required forms with fees.  I don't know why the geocachers are trying<br/>
to ruin something that isn't broken.  Anyway, right now they seem<br/>
content to let it lie.  In specific cases with state parks,<br/>
particularly Pike Lake and Harrington Beach, the rangers are actually<br/>
very supportive of geocaching, which is good news.<br/>
<br/>
We might want to discuss this situation at some point.<br/>
