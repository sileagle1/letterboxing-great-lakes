One idea that I'm running down, is a copy of the clues from the fall event at Grand River Park in Jenison and then planting some stamps at those locations.<br>

Maybe people have oopsie stamps or extra ones they aren't going to plant anymore.  Has anyone thought of putting together a "traveling event box" containing a bunch of stamps that a Girls Scout Group, Boys Scouts, young peoples group, could request and the leaders of that particular group could customize it for their particular venue?

Pretty positive the fall gatheirng boxes have all been picked up, right Grandvilla?<br>

I would be happy to work with you on this if you'd like ~ seeing as I'm IN the area, and this sounds fun.<br>

<br>
Since no one else has letterboxing experience, I was thinking punching holes in index cards and using one of those ring things for each teams "logbook."  Then have each team bring their own stamp pad or maybe if they don't have one, I could have a pack of crayola markers???  kind of a backup plan I guess<br>
<br>
The rental fee for the building is $70 for a resident.  Not sure if they would cut it for a non profit or maybe I could get a business to sponsor the event?<br>

See, I'm buzzing with ideas :)  <br>

As someone in the area, how wet do you think Grand River Park is in May??<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm guessing very wet. However, if the weather is good, you could get an open shelter. Also, only my opinion, but I would advise not to piggyback off of old clues. Also, I'm sure we could all help you out with this one and send stamps that are no longer being used. Keep us posted on this one. I'm sure the LB community would be glad to assist you. :)<br>

Hmmm.  Gonna need to weigh the payoff and the workload...  <br>

Thanks on the stamps offers though.  I may just need them.  I will keep you posted on my progress.  I know of a traditional camp that may let me have their facilities for the day.  So they would have a lodge and then the trails.  Most of their land should be above the water table from what I remember!  For some reason I'm nervous about writing the clues.  Maybe if I try it once, then I will get the hang of it.  <br>
<br>
Family of 6 - when you did your iditarod, remind me of the set up... there were several sets of clues that worked in individual series, right?  Then a few of them had bonuses attached.  There were some type of extra points in some of the boxes too, eh?  I liked the amount of time for that one - I remember about 3 hours.  How do you know how many boxes to make?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If it were later in the summer, I could help you out with some new-ish boxes in Grand River Park. I'm planning to plant 3-4 new ones there in late May / early June for Lulu's birthday. She wants her birthday party to be a letterboxing event. She's so excited to share her new hobby with several friends. We figured that Grand River Park would be a great location because the trails are easily identifiable by their post numbers. That way I can split the kids up into a few groups and instruct them which order to find the boxes so they don't end up crossing paths (yes, there'll be an adult with each group). After the party, I'll post the clues online to become permanent boxes.<br>
<br>
When you decide where/when to have it, please update us so I can make sure we're not both at Grand River Park on the same day. Lulu's birthday is on Memorial Day but we're out of town that weekend, so I'm guessing we'll have the party the weekend before or after (preferably later so the park dries up a little more).<br>
