What a shame. That's a hard lesson to take, whether you've been at<br/>
this for awhile or you're pretty new to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
If you suspect that the location is part of the reason you've been<br/>
hit, I'd suggest that you not replace at the same spot. If, for<br/>
example, it's a party spot for kids, they'll be back if you replant in<br/>
the same place.<br/>
<br/>
So another tactic is to find a spot that's more difficult to reach in<br/>
the same park, if possible. Partying teenagers don't generally go for<br/>
a long hike.<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand you suspect that someone is singling out your<br/>
boxes and using clues to find them, I'd not replant at all.<br/>
(Frankly, that's a rare event, but it *has* happened).<br/>
<br/>
Take your time and see what develops.<br/>

I just looked at your site to see which boxes were missing.  I've <br/>
found both of them in the past.  I think maybe they were both in too <br/>
open of areas where people could be seen too easily retrieving <br/>
them...  especially if they weren't being discreet enough.  If the <br/>
SLJL one wasn't put back far enough, it may have been visible at <br/>
other times, too, even it someone wasn't seen getting it.<br/>
<br/>
I loved the clues and location of the WHD one but, if there were any <br/>
people around when it was being retrieved, it'd look pretty <br/>
suspicious.  I really don't see how that one could have been <br/>
discovered accidentally.  Either someone saw someone getting it out <br/>
or putting it away, or it was put away wrong and fell out.<br/>
<br/>
I'd suggest, if you decide to redo them, see if you can find other <br/>
hiding places that are maybe more concealed.  Maybe somewhere in the <br/>
trees surrounding the SLJL place.  Or for the WHD, have them start at <br/>
the original place still, but have them walk somewhere else <br/>
nearby.  Or try a different hiding spot on the same ___________.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect both of your hiding spots have been compromised and boxes <br/>
will continue to be ruined if you replace them in the exact same places.<br/>

We just had to skip a box in Lancaster, WI for exactly that reason.  <br/>
Box was placed in the middle of a totally open area, near a picnic <br/>
shelter, with people playing nearby.  There's no way you could <br/>
retrieve that box without being seen.  A cold, inclement day would be <br/>
the only chance.  We ran into the same situation with another box in <br/>
LaCrosse (same planter).  We're trying to get better at reading clues <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have managed to find boxes in busy parks with no one noticing.  I think<br/>
having kids helps a lot with this.  If you walk a trail before getting to<br/>
the busy picnic area you can go to a picnic table and tell the kids the "old<br/>
folks" need to rest a bit; hand them some empty containers (box size) and<br/>
then them to see if they can find any bugs or worms to take home to the<br/>
turtle for dinner while the old folks rest.  Ours are 8 and 11 so they are<br/>
old enough to understand what it is they are to do.  They go to the location<br/>
the box should be, if they find it, they leave one of the boxes they had and<br/>
take the real one.  They then come back to the table and say they don't want<br/>
to look for bugs anymore.  So I say lets do something else then.  Take out a<br/>
coloring book and another box size container of crayons, our logbooks, etc.<br/>
Looks like we are wasting time while we rest.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing we do is toss a ball back and forth making sure one is in<br/>
front of the area where the box should be.  Overthrow it so the person can<br/>
look for the box while they are looking for the ball.  If they find it they<br/>
slip it into their backpack and come out with the ball.<br/>
<br/>
I usually take sandwiches and such in our backpack so if we need to have a<br/>
picnic to throw off onlookers we can.  When going to a busy park I usually<br/>
pack our logbook and stamps in box size containers as well as our lunch so<br/>
all the boxes just blend in to onlookers.<br/>
<br/>
Where there's a will there's a way.  LOL  We've had a "sick" kid to allow us<br/>
to be on the side of a road where a box was a couple times, as well as boys<br/>
and their "potty breaks" too.<br/>

Location is everything! <br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am working on several new letterboxes.  My plan was to create and place several new boxes this spring, but I rethought my rush to place them.  I am spending more time writing the clues and way too much time locating and evaluating the locations to place my new boxes.  But the effort will be worth it if my boxes survive and other letterboxes will appreciate finding it rather than the disappointment of a missing box.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, we rush to accuse others for our missing letterbox.  It is difficult to accept the responsibility that maybe a poor choice of a location is the reason boxes are lost.  When we place our boxes, it is wise to check the location during different times of the day and imagine the activity and weather conditions in that area during the year.  This may included a look at the terrain to determine the drainage of the land and the possibility of maintenance crews returning to an area or large crowd gatherings.  <br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to walk away from an area where a letterbox is hidden knowing that you might very well be observed and endanger the hidden box, but I applaud those who have that strength and do the right thing.  Maybe the placer of the box is unaware of the potential conditions as a result of a different time of the year and the changes at those locations.  Drop them a line and let them know the status.  <br/>
<br/>
Urban letterboxes are very difficult.  I was able to retrieve a letterbox on a busy New York street, but it took a lot of doing and creating distractions to what I was doing which included intentionally spilling out the contents of my purse on the sidewalk, and crawling around on the ground to pick up the contents...and quickly palm the letterbox at the same time.  People saw what I was allegedly doing and most likely didn't give me a second thought as the walked right past me.  LOL!  The box is still there, so I and others have been successful in preserving that urban box.  <br/>
<br/>
Recently, I received a notice from a letterboxer who found it necessary to do some minor repairs on one of my microboxes.  I plan to send her a special, handmade Random Acts Of Kindness Letterboxing Certificate  (like a first finders certificate) as a way of thanking her for her quick thinking that allowed her to repair the box, even asking for supplies from an employee, without revealing the location of my box.     <br/>

&gt; Hey pennypenny,<br/>
&gt; What a shame. That's a hard lesson to take, whether you've been at<br/>
&gt; this for awhile or you're pretty new to letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you suspect that the location is part of the reason you've been<br/>
&gt; hit, I'd suggest that you not replace at the same spot. If, for<br/>
&gt; example, it's a party spot for kids, they'll be back if you <br/>
replant in<br/>
&gt; the same place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So another tactic is to find a spot that's more difficult to reach <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the same park, if possible. Partying teenagers don't generally go <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; a long hike.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If, on the other hand you suspect that someone is singling out your<br/>
&gt; boxes and using clues to find them, I'd not replant at all.<br/>
&gt; (Frankly, that's a rare event, but it *has* happened).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take your time and see what develops.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi letterboxing friends...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Need some advice from those of you who've dealt with<br/>
&gt; missing/vandalized boxes: Two of <br/>
&gt; &gt; mine have gone missing in the past month or so... one which was <br/>
just<br/>
&gt; reported to me in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; last few days and only pieces of a few pages remained.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I can re-carve of course, and replace these boxes. But should I <br/>
wait<br/>
&gt; a while before I do so? I'm <br/>
&gt; &gt; wondering if I try to replace them too quickly the same thing <br/>
will<br/>
&gt; happen by the same person <br/>
&gt; &gt; (or people. I suspect kids considering the location of the two <br/>
boxes<br/>
&gt; that are gone.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions would be helpful.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sad in South Lyon [sniff]<br/>

These have to be some of the most cleaver ideas in being stealth, <br/>
especially with children I have ever heard!!  Your kids must have a <br/>
BLAST going letterboxing and you must be one awesome mom!  Thanks so <br/>
much for sharing.  A+!<br/>

&gt; having kids helps a lot with this. If you walk a trail before getting to<br/>
&gt; the busy picnic area you can go to a picnic table and tell the kids <br/>
&gt; the "old<br/>
&gt; folks" need to rest a bit; hand them some empty containers (box size) and<br/>
&gt; then them to see if they can find any bugs or worms to take home to the<br/>
&gt; turtle for dinner while the old folks rest. Ours are 8 and 11 so they are<br/>
&gt; old enough to understand what it is they are to do. They go to the <br/>
&gt; location<br/>
&gt; the box should be, if they find it, they leave one of the boxes they <br/>
&gt; had and<br/>
&gt; take the real one. They then come back to the table and say they don't <br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; to look for bugs anymore. So I say lets do something else then. Take out a<br/>
&gt; coloring book and another box size container of crayons, our logbooks, <br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
&gt; Looks like we are wasting time while we rest.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another thing we do is toss a ball back and forth making sure one is in<br/>
&gt; front of the area where the box should be. Overthrow it so the person can<br/>
&gt; look for the box while they are looking for the ball. If they find it they<br/>
&gt; slip it into their backpack and come out with the ball.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I usually take sandwiches and such in our backpack so if we need to have a<br/>
&gt; picnic to throw off onlookers we can. When going to a busy park I usually<br/>
&gt; pack our logbook and stamps in box size containers as well as our lunch so<br/>
&gt; all the boxes just blend in to onlookers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where there's a will there's a way. LOL We've had a "sick" kid to allow us<br/>
&gt; to be on the side of a road where a box was a couple times, as well as <br/>

&gt; &gt; Sadly, I have to agree with Bali - I found both of these wonderful<br/>

&gt; Box was placed in the middle of a totally open area, near a picnic <br/>
