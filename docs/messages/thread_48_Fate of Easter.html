wonderful account of their letterboxing vacation last fall.<br>
Because of that comnmunication, I *DO* have their address.<br>
I've sent Matt & Renee an invitation to join this list.<br>
We'll see what happens.<br>
<br>
We were also out on Sunday and checked a few boxes. I was especially <br>
pleased that the "Portage Creek Bicentennial Park" box was okay and <br>
that it had had so many visitors. It is in a high traffic area but <br>
it's well concealed -- apparently all of the seekers are being <br>
carerful about passersby.<br>
"Zoo Two" has also been busy. The logbook will need replacing within <br>
the next short time so I'm glad I checked it.<br>
<br>
I'll be checking on others soon and I'll note their status on the <br>
clues page.<br>
