                    <div class="plaintext-content">Coffee Beans and I finally got out on the trails to check on the status <br>
of our boxes post the 'Great Des Plaines Flood of 2007.'  We managed to <br>
check on a dozen of our boxes, including the ones we thought were at <br>
most risk.  We are happy to report that we found them ALL intact.  <br>
(Squash, Future Noble, Beautiful Flower, All four boxes of the HHH <br>
series, Of The Planes, Two Trees in the Forest Hostel, Wicked, and Des <br>
Plaines River). <br>
<br>
However, we did decide to retire 'A Future Noble.'  The box was in an <br>
area prone to flooding, and based on the mud on top of the log hiding <br>
it, this box must have been under 2-3 feet of water.  This was the <br>
second maintenance visit where I've had to dig the box out from under <br>
the log.  EEEK!  Plus, all the flooding has changed the trail, and you'd <br>
have to be a VERY GOOD letterboxer to be able to navigate the current <br>
trail (although I know a few of you could still probably find it).  As a <br>
result, we decided to take the box with us.  We also checked on Turtle <br>
McQ's 'Chicag-O' that was hidden nearby, and I'm sad to report that this <br>
box seems to be gone.  Here too you could see the effects of the recent <br>
flood.  This box had been hiding behind several very large logs.  Now, <br>
none of the logs were anywhere nearby.<br>
<br>
I had also gotten a report that my 'Of the Planes' had been damaged, and <br>
it was.  This box has been temporarily removed.  (Evidently the last <br>
finders found much of the contents missing/strewn on the ground.  All <br>
that remained was the stamp in the box.  I'll make an new log, and fix <br>
the box.)<br>
<br>
We also had a chance to check the final box of our HHH series.  The box <br>
was intact, but the trail might be difficult to navigate, and as much of <br>
it seemed a bit washed over.  The riverbank near the box is 3-4 feet <br>
above the river's surface.  The box is another 2-3 feet off the ground.  <br>
Given both those facts, the river sediment was another 1-2 feet ABOVE <br>
the box!  We were very impressed that With a Cherry on Top STILL managed <br>
to find the box, post flood.<br>
<br>
We might go check the rest of boxes near the river sometime soon.  Since <br>
these boxes were the ones most likely to have been washed away, we are <br>
rather confident that the others should be fine (as they are all much <br>
further away from the river).<br>

  I have confirmed that FOOW 5 and 9 are gone, but happily discovered yesterday that Biker Chicks: Carrie looks just as good as the day I placed her, quite amazingly, since I know the surrounding area flooded. My guess is that she was surrounded by water but her hidey hole was high enough to keep her out of harm's way.<br>
