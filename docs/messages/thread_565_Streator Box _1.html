<br/>
1) On August 13, 2004 I placed my first letterbox in this North <br/>
Central Illinois town. Used a local community message board and <br/>
letterboxing.org to let others know it had been placed.  I checked <br/>
it today and was surprised to find stamps from another local <br/>
letterboxer.    <br/>
<br/>
I am putting together a second box to be placed sometime next week.  <br/>
Hopefully others will follow the lead, and place some boxes around.<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
2) I belong to our local "hobby show" committee that puts together <br/>
the only known "true hobby show" to exist.  It is a show to get <br/>
together and share you hobby with other hobbyists and the public.  <br/>
It usually held in April each year.  Would anyone like to get <br/>
together as a group and display letterboxing for this event?     <br/>
