Thanks for the reply and input, SpringChick. I do believe you have <br>
placed more than half of the boxes in the Muskegon area.<br>
<br>
I understand your concerns and just wanted to let you know that the <br>
number of boxes mentioned does not include any mystery boxes at all. <br>
I only counted the boxes at letterboxing.org which had a published <br>
location that included "Muskegon" "Whitehall" or "Montague" <br>
<br>
I am very grateful for the work you have put into establishing a <br>
good relationship with the staff at the local State Parks. I <br>
personally disagree with their new policy, and have the utmost <br>
respect for the amout of effort you've expended in educating the <br>
State Park staff. Trust me, I don't want to do anything to undermine <br>
all those gains! <br>
<br>
Our little get together doesn't appear to be headed anywhere near 25 <br>
people .. lol .. maybe half a dozen if we're lucky; and hey, we're <br>
letterboxers -- we're clever, at least clever enough to come up with <br>
ways to be discreet, I'll bet. Heck, that might even become some of <br>
the funniest stuff of our whole day. However, I do appreciate the <br>
suggestions about what to do if a larger group were ever to get <br>
together.<br>
<br>
I really enjoyed the social aspect of the group boxing I was able to <br>
participate in while I was out in Portland this spring. I learned a <br>
few tips about boxing in small groups, (like keeping your mouth <br>
closed if you've been to a park or box before... lol) and I'm <br>
looking forward to the 16th so I can put some faces to the names I <br>
see on this list! <br>
<br>
So far it looks like myself, Pale Puppy Posse and Doglvrs will be <br>
the extent of our get together.  The inviation is still on for a <br>
campfire at our winter digs that evening though! I have alot of <br>
respect for your work and I'd love to swap boxing stories with <br>
someone who has as much history as you, SpringChick, and we'll all <br>
fill you in on the adventures of our day.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

there are others where bits and pieces of information are missing or <br>

familiar with the area or somebody who has previously been to the <br>
park or box, this may seem obvious, however to another person, these <br>
would be things that need to be figured out.  Although I certainly <br>
cannot stop people from collaborating to solve clues, mystery boxes <br>
are not really meant to be group projects.<br>

of the boxes in this area are in Muskegon State Park.  As many of <br>
you know, the Michigan DNR recently implemented a "pay to place" <br>
policy for geocaches and letterboxes.  Fortunately the staff at <br>
Muskegon State Park have taken a lenient stance on this policy and <br>
rather than pull the boxes or charge for their placement, they are <br>
monitoring the boxes, watching for social trails and other <br>
environmental impact.  I  have worked very hard to establish a <br>
relationship with them and to show them the positve side of <br>
letterboxing.  A handful of boxers coming through every couple of <br>
weeks or so isn't a problem; 25 people descending on a box at one <br>
time is a whole other game.  In addition to the environmental aspect <br>
of many people boxing together, I have concerns about the <br>
discretionary aspect.  How inconspicuous can a group of letterboxers <br>
really be?  It is hard enough to keep a low profile when there are <br>
2or 3 of you and a dog, let alone an entire group.  I would hate to <br>
see any of the area boxes -- mine or otherwise -- be compromised <br>
because a flurry of activity raises the curiosity of other hikers or <br>
nearby observers.<br>

> So in short, I am wondering if it is not better to provide a <br>
specified period of time for people to do some boxing in the area -- <br>
individually or as small teams, rather than as a large group, and <br>
then meet up with each other after that?  That way those who are <br>
interested in jacking up the "F" count can head off to the drive-<br>
bys, those looking for a hike can head another direction and those <br>
looking for some awesome scenery can head yet another way.  This <br>
will also allow those who want to take the time to work through some <br>
of the mystery clues the opportunity to head off to those boxes <br>
without fear of giving anything away to others in the group.  <br>
Everyone has the same access to the clues at letterboxing.org and <br>
should be able to decide what works best for them without having to <br>
create a group itinerary.<br>
