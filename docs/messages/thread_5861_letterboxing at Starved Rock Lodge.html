Subject: letterboxing at Starved Rock Lodge<br>

Kathi,<br>
 <br>
I’m not really as exciting as you made me out to be.  It is true I am the one who put those letterboxes out there.  However we have been experiencing an extremely high number of floods in the past few years.  Once a year I can handle.  But as of the past 2-3 years we have flooded more times than I can remember.<br>
 <br>
I even had one located in the Illinois Waterway Visitor Center, They even flooded many times.<br>
 <br>
I’m sorry but I just can’t keep up with them.  When someone e-mails me that it’s not there or they couldn’t find it, I just feel awful.  Especially if they came a distance.  I strongly feel that I couldn’t devote as much time to them as I would have liked.  I was also limited as to where I could put them because of the park rules on Letterboxing.  Working for the Lodge I had to respect that, even though I know there are some boxes actually off the trails.<br>
 <br>
I hope this helps.  <br>
