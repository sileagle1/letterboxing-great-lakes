for this series of LBs.  We saw the question about it on this list <br/>
awhile back, did a bit of sleuthing ourselves to find out about it <br/>
and got to several of the boxes over the weekend.<br/>
  I sent an email to the museum on Monday with our thanks and results <br/>
and got a reply saying they were pleased that "someone" was enjoying <br/>
the series. So, I volunteered "to place an ad" on the LB site.<br/>
  The museum has put a lot of work into the series.  The woman I <br/>
exchanged emails with said she got the idea when she was in England <br/>
and was taken along on an LB trip to Dartmoor (sigh!).  The <br/>
little "passbook" is commercially printed, the clues are interesting, <br/>
the stamps depict something of the site and are made commercially <br/>
(they remind me of pictures of stamps I've seen from the UK), the <br/>
sites all have some historical and/or natural theme, the logbooks are <br/>
commercially made with embossed covers, and the boxes we found were <br/>
all ammo cans.<br/>
  There were 12 LBs but one has been abandoned due to repeated <br/>
vandalism.  Too bad, as the site, a stone arch bridge, is really <br/>
neat.  If you try the series you should have a look at it anyway. <br/>
It's not far out of the way.<br/>
  We really enjoyed it and hope to get back before too long to finish <br/>
the series.<br/>
