Mathman 6 - Remember the Veterans is ow available for the hunting!  <br/>
Look for it in the "New Boxes" or S WI lists on the main site.<br/>
<br/>
Mathman 7 - 11 should be going up soon too.<br/>

That reminds me -- I'm halfway through making up an urban microbox<br/>
series for Milwaukee. (My first placed boxes!) I've got two more<br/>
stamps to carve and I need to get the boxes all ready to adhere to the<br/>
things they're hiding on/behind/in. (Gorilla Glue and magnets, anyone?<br/>
Yay!)<br/>
<br/>
I meant to have them out already, but work deadlines have kind of<br/>
gotten in the way. Soon, though. Hopefully within the next week or so.<br/>
I'll send up a flag when they're ready.<br/>
<br/>
Also, with regards to the gathering on June 12: I don't know now if<br/>
I'll be able to make it. I'd love to, but our local hockey team (for<br/>
which I am a season ticket holder) made it to the league finals, which<br/>
start next week. The weekend of June 12 will likely be spent at away<br/>
games in either Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, PA or Hartford, CT (depending<br/>
on who wins their series this weekend), cheering on the team. I'm<br/>
bummed I'll miss meeting you all, but I can't pass up the chance to<br/>
see the team in the finals.<br/>
<br/>
I'm torn on who I want them to play against. Hartford means excellent<br/>
letterboxing opportunities while on the trip, but W-B/S has my<br/>
favorite player in the league on their team. Oh, the conundrums when<br/>
hobbies collide! :)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all have a fabulous Memorial Day weekend.<br/>
