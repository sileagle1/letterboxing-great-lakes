Treasure among the trees<br/>
<br/>
Group enjoys art of 'letterboxing'<br/>
<br/>
By JANE NORDBERG<br/>
Gazette Writer<br/>
COPPER HARBOR  Barbara Oxford takes a reading of 41 degrees, walks <br/>
41 paces into a forest, submerges her hand into the hole of a dead <br/>
log and gingerly removes her quarry, a plastic box.<br/>
The box contains a rubber stamp, an ink pad, and a notebook filled <br/>
with imprinted marks and messages from residents as far away as <br/>
Chicago and as close as Torch Lake.<br/>
"That was easy," she says, spreading the box's contents on the <br/>
forest floor before making her own stamp in the box's notebook, and <br/>
using the stamp in the box to document her discovery in her own <br/>
notebook. "Sometimes it takes me an hour or more to find it," she <br/>
says.<br/>
Oxford is a letterboxer, part of a growing breed in the U.S. Part <br/>
sport, part treasure hunt, letterboxing is said to have started in <br/>
England 150 years ago when a Victorian hiker inserted his calling <br/>
card in a bottle, threw it into a Devon pool and issued an <br/>
invitation to those who found the bottle to add their own card. <br/>
Recent articles in "Time" and "Smithsonian" magazines have spurred <br/>
the hobby's popularity. Since 1998, over 9,000 letterboxes have been <br/>
deposited in public places throughout the U.S. There are also <br/>
documented letterboxes in Africa and Central America.<br/>
According to the main letterboxing Web site, Letterboxing.org, there <br/>
are 46 letterboxes hidden in the Upper Peninsula, including four in <br/>
the Copper Country: two in Keweenaw County, and one each in Baraga <br/>
and Houghton counties. <br/>
Lured by the "Hwy 41 Letterbox" in Copper Harbor, Oxford followed <br/>
the directions on the Web site given by Tim Kuehl, also known <br/>
as "The Dragon."<br/>
Kuehl, who resides in Wisconsin, has placed 68 boxes around the <br/>
Midwest. During a trip last year to Michigan, Kuehl placed boxes at <br/>
Canyon Falls in Baraga County and two at Copper Harbor.<br/>
Anonymity is key; letterboxers take great pains to avoid being seen <br/>
discovering the boxes, and they carefully hide it again for the next <br/>
person to find.<br/>
Many, like Kuehl, take on personas to hide their real names. <br/>
Yooperann and Funguswoman are just two letterboxers who may have <br/>
Michigan connections.<br/>
Although the instructions Oxford followed were fairly <br/>
straightforward, she also likes the challenge of the solving more <br/>
difficult clues. <br/>
<br/>
[The Mining Gazette online version ends here, but from our <br/>
EagleHerald print copy, I'm including the following additional <br/>
text.  There may be more text in the Mining Gazette print copy.]<br/>
<br/>
"Some people make you do math, word puzzles, or figure out lyrics <br/>
from certain songs," she said.<br/>
The inexpensive, accessible nature of the sport encourages a diverse <br/>
following.  Its combination of solving puzzels while being outdoors <br/>
is attractive to families.<br/>
Other than a stamp, a notebook, and a compass, letterboxing requires <br/>
no equipment to start out.<br/>

Well, no, actually this is quite a surprize.  It seems strange that a<br/>
reporter can use all the information they did on me without my<br/>
approval, especially since they said themselves "Many, like Kuehl,<br/>
take on personas to hide their real names."  Anybody have any<br/>
perspective on this?<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is that at school orientation the other night, I had to<br/>
give a mom her daughter's textbooks early since they were going on<br/>
vacation the first three days of school.  I discovered they were going<br/>
up to Copper Harbor, and I told her I'd appeciate them looking in on<br/>
my Hwy 41 box for me (since I haven't heard about it since I planted<br/>
it), which led to a little discussion about letterboxing.  Last night<br/>
I got an email from the student saying they found the box in good<br/>
condition.  Seems like we might have some new letterboxers in WI!  I<br/>
had just received a report on my Canyon Falls box, but I hope they go<br/>
find that one too!<br/>
<br/>
-and-<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Kuehl, who resides in Wisconsin, has placed 68 boxes around the <br/>

Seems I'm closer to 100...<br/>

So, Fun-Gal, what is your MI connection???!!!<br/>

In answer to your question, Dragon, I *DID* have an ex-boyfriend back<br/>
in the late 70's who went to school in Houghton...!!! And I know a<br/>
couple of people who work in the lab at the VA in Iron Mountain, but<br/>
that's about it!<br/>

Wierd!<br/>

I'll see if I can get a hard copy of the article by calling the <br/>
