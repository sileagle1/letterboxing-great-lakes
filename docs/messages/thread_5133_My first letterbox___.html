letterboxing until I was talking to my neighbor about it the other <br/>
day. Can't say I really missed the mosquitoes though...ouch!! I went <br/>
out on Saturday and found a box that we just happened to be going by <br/>
on the way to dinner. :) Worked out well.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess it is my luck that the day I chose to come back to this <br/>
wonderful hobby, there was a gathering not too far away. Argh... ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just as an update on how things have been on my end (and why I've <br/>
been gone so long), I've been pretty busy. First off, I took a break <br/>
from the LB world because I was kind of tired of hearing all the <br/>
bickering on the lists online (does that really ever happen? lol). It <br/>
kind of put me off for a while. I'm not going to let it get to me <br/>
this time. Then Manic Mechanic (Nick) and I bought a house a year ago <br/>
and got engaged in November at Devil's Lake. I started teaching <br/>
(FINALLY...I never thought this would be such a hard profession to <br/>
get into!) last year as well. I have been working like crazy with my <br/>
jewelry as well; I plan on getting my business name and tax number at <br/>
the end of the summer so I can get my dot com name online. Nick and I <br/>
also recently welcomed a new addition to our family...a beagle pup <br/>
named Mugsy. :) So...there's my explanation...don't hate me for <br/>
leaving!!! ::BIG HUGS::<br/>
<br/>
So people, fill me in on the details. What's been going on in the <br/>
wonderful world of letterboxing lately? Anybody have any great new <br/>
news they'd like to share? I'd love to hear it!<br/>

morning logging into the same box you found yesterday.  We were surprised &amp;<br/>
happy to see it, and wondered if you knew there had been an event yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about those MOSQUITOES!!  They were fierce almost<br/>
everywhere we went today.  The regular spray didn't work - we had to break<br/>
out the Deet.<br/>
<br/>
Happy to hear about the puppy, job &amp; engagement!  Have you set a date?<br/>
