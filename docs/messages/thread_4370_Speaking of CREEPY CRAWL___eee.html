Anyone else getting eatin' alive by the mystery "itching mite" that has<br/>
invaded Chicagoland? Poor Tonto mowed the grass and looks like someone<br/>
took aim at him for target practice! We haven't had a chance to go<br/>

Poor Tonto!!  I know how he feels...I have bites all over me from <br/>
weeding in the garden.  I thought these mites were commonly known as <br/>
chiggers and thought it was unusual that I had them because I have <br/>
never had them before.  I hadn't heard about a problem with mites this <br/>
year but can attest to the fact that there is!<br/>

 I couldn't stop scratching and of course the scratching only made it<br/>

<br/>
 The latest I'm reading is that you should stay out of brushy areas,<br/>
especially at night.  Right.  Tell that to a letterboxer with a dog!  <br/>
