<br/>
I just wanted to let you know that there are two new boxes out there <br/>
to find. I'm excited to say I've placed my first boxes this weekend! <br/>
Their names are: Old Rugged Cross and Little Mac. (And I really <br/>
really hope they don't stink!)  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they are both in the Reed City area (Osceola County) and are <br/>
pretty easy (my 9 year old brother was my guinea pig).  But here's <br/>
my reasoning: Reed City is a place that many people pass or stop in <br/>
briefly (for McD's or to fill up the tank) on their way across the <br/>
state. So I placed two boxes that are pretty close to highway access <br/>
and not too difficult or time consuming so that if you are traveling <br/>
through, you might be able to take a little extra time to come see <br/>
these two places (which are not jaw dropping spectacular, but pretty <br/>
cool anyway). <br/>
<br/>
I posted clues to the LBNA page this afternoon, they appear on the <br/>
What's New link, but not the Map (is that normal?). <br/>
<br/>
If you go to find them, I'd appreciate any feedback, since this is <br/>
my first try and I want to do more and would like to make them the <br/>
best that I can!<br/>

the old U.S. 131.  Liked your stamps too!<br/>
