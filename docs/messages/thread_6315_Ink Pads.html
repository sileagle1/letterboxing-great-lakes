They also have some at Michael's Crafts.  They also have coupons.  Hobby Lobby does not have much of a selection.  HTHs<br>

I agree with the other suggestions, but you could also get markers.  A few more options in that raised pad category are the dew drops and Joann carries inks for a $1.00 each that are raised just enough and I like them.  They are near the front of Joann, by the registers usually.  Joann also has the markers, dew drops too, along with the suggested Cat Eye.  Stampeaz has them as well, except for those $1.00 inks.  <br>
