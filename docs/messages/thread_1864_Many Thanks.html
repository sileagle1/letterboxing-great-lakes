So, this was my first gathering and it more than lived up to my <br/>
expectations.  The people I met were all very friendly and made me <br/>
feel welcome at the event.  And I had a great time looking for all <br/>
those boxes.  Have to admit, I even went out Sunday afternoon and <br/>
started working on Boch's Circus.  ;-)  If the weather stays nice <br/>
tomorrow I may go again to finish it up as I have the day off.  Again, <br/>
thanks for a great day and I went home with 11 new stamps in my log.<br/>
