I recently realized that the June 2nd Event is on the same weekend as <br/>
the annual Memorial golf tournament in nearby Dublin Ohio. I'm not <br/>
worried about the influx of people in the area. I'm worried about the <br/>
weather.<br/>
If you've never heard of the Memorial Tournament, here's the scoop.<br/>
According to legend, the golf course (Muirfield) was built on an <br/>
ancient Indian burial ground. And the chief of the disturbed Indians <br/>
(Chief Leatherlips) has cursed the tournament every year with rain. It <br/>
is a given that it will rain at some point during the tournament.<br/>
This year the tournament runs from May 28-June 3. <br/>
Just something to keep in mind when packing.<br/>
