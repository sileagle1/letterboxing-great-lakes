As a reminder, there is a sign-up in the database section for anyone <br/>
interested in knowing (or letting others know) where you will be <br/>
camping/lodging. <br/>
(https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LBGLK/database/56/edit)<br/>
<br/>
Also, we are looking for someone to host the traditional night before <br/>
get together.  This is usually held in/near the camping area.  If you <br/>
are interested, please let us know.  There is a rather large shelter <br/>
near the electric campgrounds at Lowden that would be good...it is on a <br/>
first come basis but that also means it is free($).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all of you who have sent in stamps (or even just getting <br/>
them in the mail now) and donations!<br/>
