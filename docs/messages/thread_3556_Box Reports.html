keep up with reading the board.  Gotta know the newest gathering info :)<br>
<br>
After receiving a couple reports on some of my boxes, I went out today <br>
to check on a couple of them.  <br>
<br>
Adult Swim Series: Futurama is doing fine.  Had to replace the logbook <br>
though since it was completely filled up.<br>
<br>
Adult Swim Series: Family Guy had to be pulled for some MAJOR box <br>
maintenance.  The stamp is MIA and the logbook has been reduced to <br>
loose pages.  A special thanks goes out to Atom 118 & Coffeebeans for <br>
salvaging what was left of the box.  I will recarve and replace this <br>
one as soon as I can.<br>
<br>
Catapulted Cow had to be pulled for maintenance as well.  This poor <br>
letterbox has the worst luck ever!  This time is was discovered by <br>
forest critters.  When we got to the tree that houses the box, we just <br>
started pulling out random pieces.  First came a chewed baggie with the <br>
logbook inside.  The logbook was wet and dirty but it should be <br>
salvagable.  Then came the stamp in another chewed baggie.  The stamp <br>
is completely ok - just had to peel the semi-frozen papertowel off of <br>
it.  Then came the chewed bottom of the box - filled with slushy <br>
water.  And we never even found the top to the box.  But never fear - <br>
this one doesn't need too much work so I should be able to get it back <br>
out rather quickly.<br>
<br>
Hope this finds you all well and I'll see ya on the trails :)<br>
