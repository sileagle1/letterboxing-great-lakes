I wrote recently about how an ordinary box or location can be made <br/>
special by the clues which reveal a deeper meaning.  It turns out I <br/>
was more right than I ever imagined.  <br/>
<br/>
This summer I placed a bunch of boxes in Wyoming in honor of my <br/>
father, who grew up there.  My clues have a lot of family history in <br/>
them.  Today, thanks to a random internet search, I got a "contact <br/>
the placer" email from a first cousin of my father's, age 73!  His <br/>
mother, my great aunt, moved from Wyoming to Washington state in the <br/>
1940's and I never met her, let alone her children.  Yet here we are, <br/>
connected.  I was able to send him a copy of my father's memoirs, <br/>
which include many stories about his father.  In turn, I just got a <br/>
scan of a charcoal sketch of my great-grandfather who died sometime <br/>
shortly after my father was born in 1914!  <br/>
<br/>
This hobby can take us interesting places in more ways than one!   <br/>

That's one of the best stories I've heard in a long time. How neat!<br/>
