Micro-Meet this Saturday.  But in order to meet him, you must prove<br>
your scientific ability.  Go to Files -> Clues and more clues -><br>
FungusWoman box clues and look for his file.  Bring a copy with your<br>
answers to the Meet (disregard what it says about emailing) and he'll<br>
be happy to have a chat with you (or at least leave his mark in your<br>
logbook).<br>
<br>
If you are unable to attend but would like the good doctor to pay a<br>
visit to your home at a later date, follow the directions included in<br>
the file.<br>
