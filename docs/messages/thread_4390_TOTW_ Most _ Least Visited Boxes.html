up.  For those of you who have placed boxes:  which box is your most <br/>
visited one and which is your least visited one?  And why do you <br/>
think that is the case?<br/>
<br/>
For myself, our Cemetery Stroll #1: Showmen's Rest is our most <br/>
visited box.  We're on the 3rd or 4th logbook now.  It has an <br/>
interesting--and true--story (it is the burial site of a large number <br/>
of victims from a circus train wreck in the early 1900's), so I think <br/>
the story appeals to people.  Plus, it is in a heavily populated area <br/>
and it is not a long walk.<br/>
<br/>
Our least visited box(es) are the series of 5 boxes that we planted <br/>
in Alaska.  Of course, it is fairly new so people haven't had much <br/>
time to search for it yet (no reported finds yet).  However, I think <br/>
they will remain lightly visited because: Alaska doesn't seem to have <br/>
a lot of boxers and our boxes are not easily visited by the cruising <br/>
tourists.   A lot of people seem to use the cruise ships' land tours <br/>
with their specified stops and these boxes really require you to have <br/>
a car so that you can visit the sites.  In fact, our travel agent was <br/>
shocked that we were going to rent a car for a week and drive around <br/>
Alaska--none of her customers had ever done that before.  You'd think <br/>
we were going to some dangerous and foreign destination, instead of <br/>
one of the 50 states.  <br/>
<br/>
So, what's the scoop on your boxes???  Maybe it will spur some visits <br/>
to your least visited boxes...<br/>

Ahh yes, that evil mystery box.  I've been trying to figure that <br/>
thing out for almost a year now, on and off.  it's completely <br/>
escaping me and driving me nuts!<br/>
<br/>
The "face" one is on my list to do, but I haven't been out boxing in <br/>
a long time, so I haven't been to it, yet.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree that the word mystery seems to scare away a lot of people.  I have several mystery boxes that seen less than 6 visitors in 3-4 years, but my least visited box is Swan Cemetery -- as far as I know only 1 person has been there in nearly 3 years.<br/>
<br/>
Until I pulled it this winter, my most visited box was Old Mission Point Lighthouse.  Since then it would have to be the series of boxes at Duncan Woods in Grand Haven.  Although just in the past month there has been a rash of finders to several of my U.P. boxes -- glad to see so many people are vacationing in the U.P.  It is surely an awesome place to vacation and letterbox!  If you are headed up that way yet this summer or fall and will be spending any time in the Porcupine Mountains, I may have something you are interested in (yes, there are a few boxes in the Porkies).  E-mail me offlist...<br/>
<br/>
For all of you lighthouse enthusiasts, the Old Mission Lighthouse box will be put back in place in October, as well as replacement boxes for Point Betsie and Grand Traverse Lighthouses.<br/>

&gt;Things have been so quiet on the board--maybe a TOTW will stir things<br/>
&gt;up. For those of you who have placed boxes: which box is your most<br/>
&gt;visited one and which is your least visited one? And why do you<br/>
&gt;think that is the case?<br/>
<br/>
My least visited box is probably the Sandy Crane box in Jackson, <br/>
which surprise me since the clues are pretty easy.  The best time for <br/>
crane viewing is from Sep-Nov, so maybe people are waiting for then <br/>
to find the box.<br/>
<br/>
Probably in a tie for least visited is my mystery box out in Sanilac <br/>
County.  I think the cryptogram scares people off, but it's really <br/>
pretty easy, I think.<br/>
<br/>
The most visited boxes are my cemetery boxes in Wayne County.  I need <br/>
to get the last two boxes in this series planted!<br/>

&gt; I would have to agree that the word mystery seems to<br/>
&gt; scare away a lot of people.  I have several mystery<br/>
&gt; boxes that seen less than 6 visitors in 3-4 years,<br/>
&gt; but my least visited box is Swan Cemetery -- as far<br/>
&gt; as I know only 1 person has been there in nearly 3<br/>
&gt; years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Until I pulled it this winter, my most visited box<br/>
&gt; was Old Mission Point Lighthouse.  Since then it<br/>
&gt; would have to be the series of boxes at Duncan Woods<br/>
&gt; in Grand Haven.  Although just in the past month<br/>
&gt; there has been a rash of finders to several of my<br/>
&gt; U.P. boxes -- glad to see so many people are<br/>
&gt; vacationing in the U.P.  It is surely an awesome<br/>
&gt; place to vacation and letterbox!  If you are headed<br/>
&gt; up that way yet this summer or fall and will be<br/>
&gt; spending any time in the Porcupine Mountains, I may<br/>
&gt; have something you are interested in (yes, there are<br/>
&gt; a few boxes in the Porkies).  E-mail me offlist...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For all of you lighthouse enthusiasts, the Old<br/>
&gt; Mission Lighthouse box will be put back in place in<br/>
&gt; October, as well as replacement boxes for Point<br/>
&gt; Betsie and Grand Traverse Lighthouses.<br/>

&gt; &gt; My Most visited boxes would have to be The Wright<br/>
&gt; &gt; Brothers &amp; The Old Rugged Cross I have in Woodland<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cemetery. This is a great and famous cemetery. We<br/>
&gt; love<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to check the boxes. We always end up<br/>
&gt; spending<br/>
&gt; &gt; about an hour just walking around.  My least<br/>
&gt; visited<br/>
&gt; &gt; is Mystery Box (Not Really) which is 2 blocks from<br/>
&gt; &gt; Woodland Cemetery. I think the word Mystery Box<br/>
&gt; scares<br/>
&gt; &gt; most people and they don't even look at the clues.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And why do you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think that is the case?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; For myself, our Cemetery Stroll #1: Showmen's<br/>
&gt; Rest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is our most <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; visited box.  We're on the 3rd or 4th logbook<br/>
&gt; now. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It has an <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting--and true--story (it is the burial<br/>
&gt; site<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of a large number <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of victims from a circus train wreck in the<br/>
&gt; early<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1900's), so I think <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the story appeals to people.  Plus, it is in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; heavily populated area <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and it is not a long walk.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Our least visited box(es) are the series of 5<br/>
&gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that we planted <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Alaska.  Of course, it is fairly new so<br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; haven't had much <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time to search for it yet (no reported finds<br/>
&gt; yet). <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I think <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they will remain lightly visited because: Alaska<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't seem to have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot of boxers and our boxes are not easily<br/>
&gt; visited<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; by the cruising <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tourists.   A lot of people seem to use the<br/>
&gt; cruise<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ships' land tours <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with their specified stops and these boxes<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; require you to have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a car so that you can visit the sites.  In fact,<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; travel agent was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shocked that we were going to rent a car for a<br/>
&gt; week<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and drive around <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Alaska--none of her customers had ever done that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; before.  You'd think <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we were going to some dangerous and foreign<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; destination, instead of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one of the 50 states.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, what's the scoop on your boxes???  Maybe it<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spur some visits <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to your least visited boxes...<br/>

Wow, I'm really surprised how many cemetery boxes have been mentioned <br/>
already!  "Most visited" boxes by Waltzing Pigs, Hales Angels, and <br/>
Bali and "least visited" by SpringChick.  We haven't been to most of <br/>
those mentioned, but HAVE been to some of the WP's cemetery boxes and <br/>
have really enjoyed them - very interesting cemeteries and stories.  <br/>
I think there is at least one more WP cementery box that we haven't <br/>
tried yet.<br/>
<br/>
I think my most popular box is the very first one I planted in a <br/>
nearby suburban park.  I simply titled it "Wirth Park" and it is a <br/>
nice little walk in the woods, with a little history and a tiny bit <br/>
of math.  I think it's been visited a lot because it is one of the <br/>
older boxes in this area (nearing 4 years old) and it is fairly easy <br/>
to find. Other popular boxes of mine are "Playing Possum" in IL <br/>
and "Motown Wonder" in MI.  Not too hard to figure out why - they are <br/>
in parks that were the sites of previous GLk gatherings.  Gathering <br/>
sites are a popular destination even long after the event is over <br/>
since there are usually a lot of boxes to find without having to <br/>
drive around much.  One other trend I noticed is that boxes <br/>
in "vacation" spots are also popular.  I have one box in Door County <br/>
WI that gets a lot of visitors and I also get a lot of reports for <br/>
the box we adopted in Hawaii.<br/>
<br/>
I have 4 boxes that are tied for "least popular".  To my knowledge, <br/>
none have been found yet.  One in Mexico planted in MAR 2005, one in <br/>
Oregon (SEP 2005), one in Washington state (SEP 2006) and one in <br/>
northwestern WI (JUL 2007).  Not many people visit the southwestern <br/>
coast of Mexico and not everyone wants to do some long hikes in <br/>
mountains.  However I'm sure someone will be finding the WI one soon, <br/>
since I just got FF reports on 2 others we planted last month in WI &amp; <br/>
MN.<br/>

&gt; I would have to agree that the word mystery seems to scare away a<br/>
lot of people.  I have several mystery boxes that seen less than 6<br/>
visitors in 3-4 years, but my least visited box is Swan Cemetery -- as<br/>
far as I know only 1 person has been there in nearly 3 years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
My only remaining mystery box is also my least visited.  I think a lot<br/>
of it has to do with the lack of geographic specificity.  As someone<br/>
just pointed out, a lot of letterboxers have been hitting many of the<br/>
U.P. boxes this summer, but my last hit on my mystery box up there was<br/>
more than a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, a mystery box I had in the Chicago area (until it<br/>
disappeared for the third time--which seems to be the point at which I<br/>
typically lose enthusiasm for replacing a box) was very<br/>
popular--probably because the mystery was at about a 2nd grade level<br/>
(quick, who was America's most famous architect?) and it was in an<br/>
urban area that gets lots of visitors.  <br/>

have solved, some I haven't gotten to start yet and I'm soooooo glad <br/>
to hear the lighthouse boxes are poping back up cause before <br/>
letterboxing came into our lives lighthouse were what we planed our <br/>
trips around.<br/>
<br/>
I know this wasn't helpful but the board has been so quiet and I was <br/>
excited to see a topic. :)<br/>

Hi Travel'n Turtle ... We'll be back in Cleveland in two weeks, and your Sound of Music series is one I'm hoping to be able to get to, though Berea is a ways away!<br/>

to judge.  But I have noticed a definate most traveled and least <br/>
traveled box.<br/>
<br/>
Most: "Bridge That Takes You Away and Back" is by far my most <br/>
traveled.  It's in a cemetary that offers an absolutly beautiful <br/>
view of the Mississippi.  I just discovered this past weekend that <br/>
it is missing.  But it's one of those that I MUST  replace, just <br/>
because the view and the spot have sentimental value to me.<br/>
<br/>
Least: "Long Road Home," which went missing as well, only had one <br/>
person find it.  I decided that the placement of it was crap and it <br/>
was out in the middle of south west wisconsin.  So that one is <br/>
archived.  <br/>
<br/>
My Broadway Series is also pretty well traveled, not only by locals, <br/>
but by out of towners.  <br/>
<br/>
I've noticed that a lot of everyone elses most popular boxes are in <br/>
cemetarys.  I think that's wonderful!  <br/>

more  people have looked up my clues to "Welcome to Iowa" than have "Welcome <br/>

We've got Sound of Music on our plans for this weekend (along with <br/>
bunches of others - make the most of the last of summer, I guess)!  <br/>
We hope to be out there Sunday from Illinois and look forward to the <br/>
series.<br/>

&gt; which box is your most visited one and which is your least visited <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most visited: Sound of Music Series that I replanted after it's <br/>
demise <br/>
&gt; for another planter, FatLarry. I actually need to go replace the <br/>
&gt; logbook (at least 50 pages) this week. I think it's visited a lot <br/>
&gt; because it's a replacement and everyone wants to get the new <br/>
stamps, <br/>
&gt; but also it's a series of 8 in a short walk. And a beautiful walk <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; darling stamps (if I do say so). I love it! I actually dragged my <br/>
&gt; guitar playing, singing Nun Sister-in-law with me to plant. She had <br/>
&gt; just moved back from Austria to Ohio!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Least visited: I've got a stamp on a cruise ship that has never <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; visited, but there's no logbook so it's hard to tell. I'll be back <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; that ship in February so I'll be able to check on it's status and <br/>
&gt; replant if need be.<br/>

Enjoy the spot; it's beautiful. I saw a huge buck last time I was <br/>
there. Also, bring some napkins and water to wash the stamps (well <br/>
used) and markers to get the best colors. You'll be happy you did. <br/>
When people look through my logbook this is the one group of stamps <br/>
(of mine) that gets the most attention because of the colors!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and be stealthy! Travel'n Turtle<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have been pretty quiet of late but I had to chime in on this topic.  <br/>
So far it seems that our most visited box, which may have been washed <br/>
away recently (the park has been closed because of the water so I <br/>
couldn't go grab it or even check) has been, "Stick a Fork in Me," the <br/>
next closest box would have to be "I heart Haring," the fact that they <br/>
are in the same park may help that.  We are always surprised when we <br/>
check on them because we very rarely get reports on those boxes.  "Ceci <br/>
n'est pas un boite de lettre" has also been busier than we knew.  By <br/>
far, "North Dakota Bound," a box we placed in Minnesota last year is <br/>
our least visited, As far as we know it has never been found  we have <br/>
also heard nothing about "The Wet Bandit" also in Minnesota, but only <br/>
for a few months.  I am not surprised about "North Dakota Bound" <br/>
because even by Minnesota standards, it is in the MIDDLE of <br/>
nowhere, "The Wet Bandit" is much closer to civilization, so I am <br/>
pretty sure it has been found, just not reported.<br/>
