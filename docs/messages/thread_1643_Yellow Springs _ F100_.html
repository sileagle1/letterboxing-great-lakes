We found most of the boxes that were still there and the one's we didn't find were still beautiful hikes.  Most of the boxes were in horrible condition, the logbooks were invariably soaked.  We suspect that they have been abandoned.  One of the boxes is now missing because of us.  After climbing down a cliff (with dogs under pack!) we found the box only to be attacked by wasps!  Claire stepped in a ground nest and she and Katy both got stung.  We ran with the stamp in hand and weren't about to go back there!  I think they very much deserve the "purple heart" because after making sure that they would both be ok (Katy is allergic and Claire was stung multiple times) we went out 'boxing again later that evening and all day Sunday.  Katy has been in contact with a letterboxer from that area and we will be mailing the stamp back to them for replanting later this fall or next spring.  Sunday was a bit of a bust with more than half of the boxes we looked for missing, but the boxes we did find were nice anyway.  <br>

Over the weekend, I hit F100!  With that find, I unveiled my new signature stamp.  <br>

  This weekend, Katy, Flying Dragon, the dogs and I took a lovely letterboxing trip to Yellow Springs.  We found most of the boxes that were still there and the one's we didn't find were still beautiful hikes.  Most of the boxes were in horrible condition, the logbooks were invariably soaked.  We suspect that they have been abandoned.  One of the boxes is now missing because of us.  After climbing down a cliff (with dogs under pack!) we found the box only to be attacked by wasps!  Claire stepped in a ground nest and she and Katy both got stung.  We ran with the stamp in hand and weren't about to go back there!  I think they very much deserve the "purple heart" because after making sure that they would both be ok (Katy is allergic and Claire was stung multiple times) we went out 'boxing again later that evening and all day Sunday.  Katy has been in contact with a letterboxer from that area and we will be mailing the stamp back to them for replanting later this fall or next spring.  Sunday was a bit of a bust with more than half of the boxes we looked for missing, but the boxes we did find were nice anyway.  <br>
