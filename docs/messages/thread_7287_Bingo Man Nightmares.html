Just to want to let you all know that I have been finding pins in my legs and arms lately. Usually they show up before noon each day. Funny thing...I pull them out yet they just keep showing up. Plus, I'm having scary dreams about boiling water, devil forks, and Wisconsin Hiker making soup. Hope it's cheese soup, but something tells me the main ingredient is me.
