<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that we pulled some remaining temporary <br/>
boxes tonight - I'm Late, I'm Late!!,  Pack of Cards, and The Rose <br/>
Gardeners are no longer available.  We'll be mailing them back to <br/>
their creators within the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
While we were out on the trails, we checked a few other boxes that we <br/>
passed along the way.  All of them were in good shape:<br/>
<br/>
Alice In Weatherland<br/>
Enormous Puppy <br/>
The Gryphon Letterbox<br/>
Wasp in a Wig #3<br/>
White Rabbit #2<br/>

We had fun the last 5 days boxing in the eastern half of Michigan's <br/>
UP (Upper Peninsula).  We saw that J&amp;B Books had stamped into many of <br/>
the Mackinac Island boxes a week or so before us and we also stamped <br/>
in a day or so different than Atom118 and CoffeeBeans, so they were <br/>
obviously enjoying the same area.  Once or twice we stamped into a <br/>
box on the same day as someone else, but we never ran into any other <br/>
boxers on our trip. We did see a lot of stamps by people that we <br/>
didn't recognize.  They must not be a member of this list, or perhaps <br/>
they are, but don't post much.  Saw lots of great lighthouses, <br/>
waterfalls, rock formations and scenic shorelines during our visit. <br/>
In addition to hiking on a few trails, we also logged ~34 miles of <br/>
biking on Mackinac Island and Grand Island. In our box hunts we got <br/>
to see some great carvings by SpringChick, NorseGnome and TJ Mich!<br/>
<br/>
One other item of note was seeing Dragon's entries as he logged his <br/>
99th and 100th finds in 2003!<br/>

we were also amused to see Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man stamped <br/>
into a few boxes a day or so ahead of us.  We enjoyed the multiple <br/>
chances we had to get out and stretch our legs at some nice places <br/>
we never would have seen without letterboxing. :)  There were some <br/>
nice boxes up in the UP and northern WI, so kudos to those of you <br/>
who placed them.  We also managed a few additions on our quest for <br/>
the Grail and our Around the World travels, which were fun finds <br/>
too. :)<br/>

Yep!  I think we were there at around 6 pm on July 3.  We saw so many <br/>
boxes that people had stamped into a day or two before us, or the same <br/>
day, that we really were expecting to meet up with someone at some <br/>
point!  On the other hand, we were at a lot of other boxes where we <br/>
were the first to stamp the book in 2006 and actually had the honor of <br/>
being the first finders of the Tahquamenon River Series, even though it <br/>
has been in place for almost a year.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad you enjoyed your trip to our native peninsula!  We wanted to <br/>
say a public 'Thank You' for finding our "Old Well" box near <br/>
Manistique.  We'd stopped by in May to check on that one, and <br/>
thought it was missing, even though we scoured the area for 20-30 <br/>
minutes.  <br/>
<br/>
A few folks had e-mailed us to ask about that box, so we're happy to <br/>
announce that the listing has now been 'unarchived' and is active <br/>
again... especially since it was the first box stamp T ever carved!<br/>
