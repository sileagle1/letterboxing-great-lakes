<br/>
We're out on our summer sailing cruise for another 3 weeks and this <br/>
is the first time I've had to stop and check email.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd let you all know that Bindle Bum and I have planted <br/>
a new box in Charlevoix (MI) and 4 boxes here on Beaver Island.<br/>
Clues are going to have to wait a bit, I only get 20 mins online and <br/>
have a lot to catch up on in my email. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what our next port of call will be, but we're thinking of <br/>
Fayette, Escanaba or Menomenee (MI) But Green Bay (WI) looks <br/>
attractive too.  More boxes will be placed where ever we go though.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like the Gathering was wonderful.  Sorry we had to miss it, <br/>
but we're having a wonderful cruise this year.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
