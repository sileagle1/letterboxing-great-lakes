&gt;Ahhh Wisconsin Hiker took April 6th. That was my first choice and <br/>

Yea, the dates from 4/1 - 4/15 were hot commodities, I think most <br/>
people in that range weren't given their first picks.  You must not <br/>
have given me 3/16 as a pick, or I would have given you that <br/>
day.  the "picker" for 3/16 was a fake name, not really picked.  Any <br/>
names listed in ( ) on that list were fake names.   That date would <br/>
have been a loser, anyway.  So, it doesn't matter either way.<br/>

Cool.  That's what I wondered when April 6th was taken.  If someone just chose it randomly or if it was due to a birthday.  I chose April 6th because of birthday reasons (not mine).  <br/>
