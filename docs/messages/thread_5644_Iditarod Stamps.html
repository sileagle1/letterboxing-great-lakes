FYI, I have put the clues to all 27 boxes online on both the AQ site<br/>
and Letterboxing.org and these boxes will remain in place for anyone<br/>
who wants to seek them. Glad everyone had a great time and the weather<br/>
was marvelous. As for Familyof6...he's taking a rest. OK, just<br/>
kidding. I have some carvings to get done for other events! <br/>
