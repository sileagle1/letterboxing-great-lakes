WH - I have offered to carve a stamp for that box.  I was especially disappointed that it seemed to never have had a stamp since the clues were rather well written - as though they had some experience boxing.  FYI to the other GLKer's - I was the first finder on the box in question.<br>

I too was disappointed with no stamp and was going to offer to carve one.  (The geoball was beckoning to be carved for some reason...)<br>
