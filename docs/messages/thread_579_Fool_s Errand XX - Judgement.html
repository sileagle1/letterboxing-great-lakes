only has it disappeared, but to add insult to injury another box <br/>

FEXX.<br/>
<br/>
Team Taco and I collaborated on this box, so it is very dear to my <br/>
heart.  They spent hours and a ton of talent on carving the stamp, <br/>
making the log book, scouting the location and writing awesome <br/>
clues.  I spent hours and hours making a great cover for the <br/>
stamp in the form of a book of judgement.<br/>
<br/>
This is very sad.<br/>
<br/>
I am off for a few days to Starved Rock; when I get back, I'll post <br/>
that great stamp so you can see what you've missed.<br/>
<br/>
We will plant again.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was a letterbox.  The individual who planted the new box is new <br/>
to letterboxing and claimed that she had no idea another box was <br/>
placed in the same area.  Since the box that we and Acorn had <br/>
planted (and is now missing) did not have the name of the town or <br/>
the cemetary in which it was planted prominently and explicitly <br/>
displayed in the title of the clues, the new 'boxer considered the <br/>
area boxless.<br/>
<br/>
Which it was, by the time she got there.  It seems "Judgement" was <br/>
fine until we allowed Acorn to give us credit for the box.  So <br/>
whoever has it in for our boxes hasn't forgotten us, which is pretty <br/>
creepy if I allow myself to think about it for very long.<br/>
<br/>
I've learned a couple of things from this: one, a shroud of mystery <br/>
isn't always a guarantee of safety and security of your clues and <br/>
boxes, and two, never underestimate the power of a grandma with a <br/>
pencil box and a kitty cat stamp!  Those flagstones are HERS now, <br/>
and she can definitely have 'em!<br/>
