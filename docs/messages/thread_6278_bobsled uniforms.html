I am genuinely concerned for it appears you reside downwind of those amusing oversmiling Jamaican bobsledders. I have not mentioned the silly bubblegum-singing musical group calling themselves the Baha men, whom we sincerely thank you for returning to our consciousness after we had graciously assigned them to the existence of forgottondom. The musical ensemble mentioned by usto was the Beach Boys, who, after obtaining themselves an honorable career despite leader of group assuming position of loonydom, poisoned airwaves of American radio with repetetive audio pablum, as well as employing for aging audience he of big hair John Stamos.

Furthermore, the kangaroos and sleepy bear wombats you refer to are legendary residents of respectful nation of Austria, as all people of world know.

<br>
I have been gone for short while and I see further hilarity from olympic participantserupting forth like mashed potatoes from mouth of John Belushi! More wonderful people claiming that kangaroos and wombats reside in down underland of Austrailia!<br>
<br>
Can you picture mama kangaroos with their babies in pocketsbouncing around under line of demarcation of equator? Baby joeys would be flying around like Mongolian jumping beans!<br>
<br>
And Australia is now claiming distinguishedpedigree of Michael Hutchence! He is accomplished musician and video star agreed upon, but he is definitely residing from Austria, as can be evidenced by beautiful waltz "Never Tear Us Apart" in style if Richard Strauss. One two three, one two three!<br>
<br>
Maybe you are indeed thinking of Australian pop musician singing starRick Springsteen?<br>
