<br>
I just wanted to share an ad I saw today in my new issue of "Family <br>
Fun". It was a two sided Chevy ad, which was based on letterboxing. I <br>
posted the pictures in the "Files" section. Sorry, I don't know how to <br>
put 2 pictures in one file. <br>
I thought they did a great job of describing letterboxing. And I was <br>
happy to see that they mentioned "leave no trace" and "re-hide better <br>
than you find" a couple of times.  <br>
I was just amazed to see a huge company like that using letterboxing in <br>
their advertising. Just wanted to share it with the group : )<br>

<br>
Thanks for sharing this article with us!  I'm amazed. <br>
<br>
I also wanted to ask if anyone else has seen the new KIA commercials.  A <br>
few threads ago, we were talking about the "OCD" of putting colored <br>
push-pins on maps based on "found", "not found"  and high priorities. <br>
<br>
I could hardly believe my eyes, that in this commercial, they drive with <br>
their mega-sized red ball push-pins on top of their KIA's taking them <br>
all over the country and then planting them at their locations of <br>
conquest!  It is an awesome commercial!  If you have not seen it---watch <br>
for it.  I swear you will be grinning from ear to ear wanting to give <br>
those folks a high-five for their efforts! <br>
<br>
Last but not least, Happy Father's Day to those who signed up for the <br>
job!  :)<br>
