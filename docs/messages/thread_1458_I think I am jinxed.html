<br>
I am really really bummed. I carved a stamp, baked and cooked, car was packed and now my daughter has strep throat. AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  We took her to the dr today because she suddenly developed this rash over her whole body and acted like she didn't feel very good. Dr put her on antibiotics and bed rest for 48 hrs.... sooo once again I have to miss out on a fun gathering. I AM SOOOOO BUMMED! Maybe next time I need to wait til the very last minute and go as a surprise, then no one can have anything...LOL<br>
<br>
I am so sorry, I really wanted to meet everyone and have a good time.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
