This series looks awesome! I wish we were going to be in your neck of <br>
the woods soon so we could snap it up. In fact, you might say I <br>
am "hopping mad" (groan...) that we will miss it... :-)<br>

Since more than one person expressed difficulty in opening our file, I <br>
have tried once more.  The new version is in our clue folder and is a <br>
pdf file.  If you have Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat, your computer <br>
should be able to open it.  It might open right from this website, or <br>
you may have to save it to your computer and then open it from your <br>
hard drive.  I don't understand why the other one wasn't working, it <br>
opens just fine when we try it.  I hope this new one works, otherwise <br>
I'm out of ideas.  The clues to the Easter Egg Hunt will be posted on <br>
Atlasquest and LbNA on Wednesday.  Sorry the clues are disagreeing <br>
with you guys.  Computers, can't live with them, can't live without <br>

sorry that people are having trouble with the file, we can't figure <br>
out what the problem is.  We used the "Arial" font, which is a <br>
standard Microsoft font.  Lots of other boxers have said that they had <br>
no problems getting it open.  We're at a loss.  We hope that the new <br>
file is working for those of you who can't get the original open.  <br>
Again, may we remind you all that the clues will be on LbNA and <br>
Atlasquest on Wednesday morning (acutally, probably late Tuesday <br>
night).  We hope that you have a chance to come on out to our neck of <br>
the woods to find some eggs and have a good time in a neat little park.<br>
