get out today. When I realized that *I* was within striking distance <br>
myself, the deal was sealed. So off I headed to the Grand Rapids (MI) <br>
area to join with Grandvilla and Mobiusklein. First on the agenda <br>
were Bindle Babe's Fate of Easter Series and then the Bonus Easter <br>
Eggs.<br>
An exchange on the trail was another bonus during that hunt. <br>
SpringChick's letterbox partner for the day, Taylor, shared her stamp <br>
with us.<br>
Then we moved on to two very cool hunts at Grand River County Park. <br>
Great clues and stamps were the way to close in the 100 mark. While I <br>
didn't need a slide rule, trig tables or algebraic formulae, a <br>
calculator would have come in handy. Wow, I did more math than I've <br>
done for years! "Sphinx" and "Serpentine" were challenging hikes <br>
through a wonderful park -- with good clues to boot.<br>
They finished me with an easier one at Hager Park for F-100!<br>
If you go to Grand River, study the clues in advance.<br>
Oh yeah, I ended the day with an even F-100.<br>
Now, for tomorrow.<br>

Mathman series.  Six more Mathman boxes will be placed in mid-May!  <br>
I know every letterboxer in WI is just waiting with baited breath <br>

the happy dance on your 100th find, but so happy the day worked out <br>
successfully for you.<br>

I understand that congrats also are in order to Grandvilla and <br>
Mobius Klein who reached the F-100 mark just before us within the <br>
last month or so.<br>
<br>
Thanks too all of you also for the boxes you have planted in the <br>
West Michigan area, helping the rest of along to our #100.<br>
<br>
After hearing your account of the search for Grandvilla and Mobius <br>
Klein's boxes at Grand River Park, I am itching to get over there <br>
and do Sphinx and Serpentine.<br>
<br>
You guys are all too cool and I look forward to continuing on the <br>
journey for the next 100 with you!<br>

I'm getting so excited for the gathering it's just<br>
ridiculous. I will be getting my 100th find sometime<br>
on Friday afternoon at the haunted harvest gathering<br>
site. It would be cool to have the f100 stamp there. I<br>
look forward to meeting you all this Saturday ( and<br>
Friday for those of you coming out early, don't forget<br>
you signature stamp and any personal travelers you<br>
might have. I've been doing some research and I'm<br>
armed with a sheet of paper full of answers for those<br>
of you with P.T.'s). See you all soon.<br>
