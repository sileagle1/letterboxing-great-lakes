                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello fellow Letterboxers!  I'm Munchkin Stamper from the Lansing <br>
area.  My Sister and I were introduced to Letterboxing while <br>
attending a Rubber Stamp Camp Retreat weekend 3 years ago.  Two of <br>
the stampers that planted those boxes for that weekend have turned <br>
out to be real "kindred spirits" to both of us (and our mom and <br>
other sister).  Together we planted a LB series at a Stamp Retreat <br>
that was great fun!  The theme was Wizard of Oz.  Since then, none <br>
of us travel anywhere without our journals and clues.  Last fall we <br>
planted a 7 box series called Aiden Lair just south of Jackson.  I <br>
have boxes in East Lansing, Clare and North Carolina.  I'm going <br>
back to NC in May to plant more at Chimney Rock (where they <br>
filmed "Last of the Mohican's"), Lake Lure (where they filmed Dirty <br>
Dancing), and maybe some at some beautiful waterfall locations. <br>
<br>
We attended the Gathering that Spring Chick held.  So far it's our <br>
one and only, it was very enjoyable! and cold!  Can someone share <br>
where the next one might be location wise?  I guess I thought it <br>
would be Michigan again but it doesn't sound like it.<br>
<br>
Sorry to ramble, it must be the Friday let-me-outside crazy person <br>
coming out!     <br>
<br>
Thanks Deb for getting this site up and running.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  We're John and Sara, otherwise known as Leapin' Lizards.  <br>
<br>
It was great to meet those who made it to the Wisconsin gathering and we <br>
hope to meet more fellow letterboxers at the Great Lakes gathering this <br>
summer.  We thought we would take a minute to introduce ourselves and <br>
share how we got into this crazy thing called letterboxing. . .<br>
<br>
Sara:  I have created a monster!  About a year and a half ago, I came across a <br>
blurb about letterboxing in an outdoor travel magazine.  So I asked John what <br>
he thought and he said...<br>
<br>
John:  Cool! Let's try it!<br>
<br>
Sara:  We started letterboxing in January 2003 and since then we've seen lots <br>
and lots of great places.  Places which I'd personally love to stay and visit the <br>
non-letterboxing points of interest, as well, to which John always assures me, <br>
"We'll come back."  But as time goes by, and we have yet to return, I know it's <br>
just a line . . . so typical of a guy.<br>
<br>
John:  Well, if Sara's legs weren't so short, we'd get to the boxes faster and <br>
have time to visit the other places.  <br>
<br>
Sara:  Like in Michigan! So many cute towns and shops!<br>
<br>
John:  So many letterboxes!  The makers of Advil really need to thank Spring <br>
Chick for the amount of Advil we purchased during our trip. <br>
<br>
Sara:  But it was worth every sand dune we had to climb!  We must have <br>
walked 70 miles during those five days.<br>
<br>
John:  But really, letterboxing has been a great way for us to spend time <br>
together, take walks together....<br>
<br>
Sara:  I'm still convinced he only holds my hand to drag me along...<br>
<br>
John: ...and teach us patience....like waiting for Sara.  <br>
<br>
Sara: . . . and gain endurance, like when John makes me walk in sub-zero <br>
temperatures into stright-line winds off of Lake Michigan. <br>
<br>
John:  And criminal law,  like when were stopped by Missouri police for a <br>
random drug check of our vehicle while driving home from a letterboxing trip. <br>
"Really, officer we're just looking for boxes with stamps in them. "  Thank <br>
goodness we had the pictures to prove it!<br>
<br>
Sara:  We recently marked our 200th find (and retired our first signature <br>
stamp).  Currently, we've planted 16 letterboxes in 6 states and released  5 <br>
hitchhikers.  <br>
<br>
John:  We have several series ready to be planted, too...<br>
<br>
Sara:  Yes, he has close to 100 boxes ready to be planted.  He tells me that <br>
he has carved all of the stamps, but I'm convinced he has his art students <br>
carving them...Sometimes when he's sleeping, he yell's out,  "You call that a <br>
stamp!  I've seen better stamps carved out of potatoes by kindergartners!"   <br>
<br>
John:  I would never let that happen in my sweatshop, er, classroom.<br>
<br>
Sara:  Like I said, I've created a monster.   I've now got him on a 12-step <br>
program.<br>
<br>
John:  Yes, I'm on step 10 at 340 degrees.<br>
<br>
<br>
Happy boxing--<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Munchkin Stamper!  Good to hear from you again...  Your NC series <br>
sounds cool, too bad they are so far from here.  Perhaps a good <br>
reason to plan a trip...<br>
<br>
Don't know if you got an answer to your questions about the <br>
gathering or not, if so, sorry for the repeat.  Tim (the Dragon) <br>
from WI is coordinating an event for this year -- late May/easrly <br>
June -- date to be determined any moment.  The idea when we had the <br>
gathering last year in Michigan was that we would move it around <br>
the "Great Lakes" states from one year to the next so that it would <br>
be close to those who had to drive a distance the year before.<br>
<br>
He is currently looking at locations in northern IL, but last I knew <br>
a definite park had not been picked.  Stayed tuned for more info and <br>
hope to see you there!<br>
<br>
Welcome to the group!<br>

boxes along the lakeshore in one weekend than I could hope to get <br>

Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
Happy to hear so many people enjoyed our intro...and<br>
yes...although Sara is a long distance runner, she<br>
seems to really take her time on the walks:)  Well, we<br>
planted 8 letterboxes in the last week in three<br>
states...clues to come shortly...hopefully before<br>
Thursday.  We had another 5 to plant in those areas,<br>
but rain and darkness prevented us from doing<br>
so...look for many more in the coming months:)<br>
<br>

If you're interested, we do have a gathering coming up on June 12th <br>
near Chicago.  You can find details at<br>

There will be a carving workshop and a "newbie" workshop at our <br>

covers the eastern Great Lakes more specifically, but you are welcome to<br>
stay here -- we don't really have any boundaries.  I think you will find<br>
that a lot of the folks here are concentrated in the MI, WI, IL area but<br>
letterboxing tends to take off in pockets with wide open spaces of<br>
letterboxing-void in between.  The regional groups have popped up around the<br>
concentrations of boxers, and those folks in between are free to join up<br>
with any of them.<br>
<br>
Although some of the posts here would pertain specifically to boxes in<br>
states quite a distance from you, I think you will find that in general the<br>
topics are not so specific to locale and are of interest to you.<br>

Sounds like you are off to a great start!<br>

Oh!  Kaycee!  Did you find the "Buffalo Wings", "In Search of Charles Butterfield" (that might be the wrong title), and "Monsters of New York" in Como Park yet?  My cousins live in Amherst/Snyder, and those were the three I found while visiting there.  That Charles one is a great stamp!<br>

I'm from Byron Center, MI, and absolutely love letterboxing.  It was a great<br>
day to get outside and enjoy finding a letterbox.  I'm getting ready to<br>
plant some boxes this summer so maybe someday you'll find one of mine!<br>
There are so many great letterboxes in this area.  Enjoy!<br>
