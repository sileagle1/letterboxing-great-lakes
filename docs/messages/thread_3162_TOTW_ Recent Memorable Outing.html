                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great topic! I would say that recently, our most memorable outing was <br>
while letterboxing in CT in September. The landscape is just so <br>
different from Michigan. We were on the Metacomet trail and we had to <br>
scramble over rocks... and then boulders... and we were constantly <br>
going up, up, and up. When we finally reached the top (after a good <br>
hour-long hike) the view was spectacular. You could see for miles and <br>
the trees far below were tiny. It was one of those hikes that made me <br>
glad I letterbox, because I almost certainly would never have taken a <br>
walk like that (which ended up being close to four hours) without the <br>
motivation of finding a series of boxes.<br>
