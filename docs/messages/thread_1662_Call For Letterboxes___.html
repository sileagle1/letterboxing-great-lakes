A Clue! MI Fall Gathering at Yankee Springs Rec Area.<br/>
<br/>
There are a handful of existing letterboxes already in the park and <br/>
we are hoping you will help with some additional boxes before the <br/>
gathering. There are a few ways you can do this: <br/>
<br/>
* Ideally we would like to see more permanently planted boxes in <br/>
this awesome park. So if you are able, why not plant a box or two <br/>
here sometime before the fall gathering? If you do, feel free to <br/>
bring copies of your clues to distribute to gathering attendees who <br/>
may not have had a chance to print clues before coming. <br/>
<br/>
* As not everyone lives close enough to head over to Yankee Springs <br/>
and plant a letterbox, we welcome box contributions specifically for <br/>
the gathering. We are not setting a specific theme for boxes, so let <br/>
your imagination run wild -- feel free to play off the fairy tales <br/>
theme being used for the clue exchange game, anything related to <br/>
fall, perhaps a Halloween themed box, or maybe something relating to <br/>
the park name or history... Whatever appeals to you! If you will be <br/>
contributing a letterbox for the gathering and would like to have us <br/>
plant it for you, you will need to have it mail it to us so that we <br/>
receive it no later than October 5, 2005, to allow time for planting <br/>
and writing clues. Clues for these boxes will be distributed at the <br/>
gathering. <br/>
<br/>
* Alternately you can create a box and bring it with you to plant <br/>
when you arrive at the gathering. In this case you will need to plan <br/>
on distributing clues either via word of mouth or by writing them up <br/>
for people to copy, etc. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we really want you to come to the gathering, but if for <br/>
some reason, you aren't able to attend, we would be thrilled if you <br/>
would still like to send us a letterbox!<br/>
