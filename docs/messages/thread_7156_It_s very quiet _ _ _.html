We managed a few letterboxing adventures over the holiday weekend.  Most of them were out of state, short, and not particularly noteworthy, although there were several fun carvings.  One was a nice leg stretcher and while the littlest elf rode most of the way, she opted to hike a pretty good bit of the end.<br/>

Our letterboxing life is a lot like this lately:  crummy weather, too busy, too busy, too busy, boxing three weekends in a row (unbelievable!), too busy, too busy, date night to scout planting possibilities canceled due to rain, too busy, boxing while traveling, pool time, pool time.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep your letterboxing tales coming.  <br/>

Unfortunately, our letterboxing life has been a bit quiet since we got <br/>
our newest member.  However, we have managed to cross a few boxes off <br/>
here and there, and we are slowly working our way through the 'Search <br/>
for the Key' (sameless plug).  Unfortunately, I think we've hit that <br/>
part of summer where we get a bit reluctant to go out in 100F heat and <br/>
sun, and now with the new addition, we've become even more reluctant.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, we don't have many fun tales to share with the group.  On <br/>
the upside, we fortunately haven't had any tales-of-woe to share with <br/>
the group either!<br/>

<br/>
Last week I traveled from Michigan down to Jackson, MS to visit my son who is doing a summer fellowship there. I did a little boxing on the way down. One of my stops was Memphis, TN. There was a quick driveby on Beale Street (about all I could handle because of the high 90s temps and humidity). It was by a statue of Elvis and I nabbed a parking spot right in front of the statue. I put my dime in the meter for 8 minutes, calculated where the box would be, jumped out into the heat to grab it and raced back to my car to do the logging in where it was cool. On my little dash to the spot, I noticed a homeless man sleeping a bit away under a tree, his back to me. I was sure he hadn't seen me, so I felt relieved that I hadn't given any secret hiding spot away. <br/>
<br/>
The box had a note on it that it needed repairs, so I had come prepared. Everything was soaking wet, so I used my 8 minutes to clean the container and stamp, get a new logbook ready, and put new bags around everything. Almost good as new. Feeling pretty proud of myself for doing all this in less than 8 minutes, I got ready to hop out to make a quick return of the box. But then I noticed that the homeless man was sitting in the exact spot where the box needed to go! I waited a few moments (by now my 8 minutes was up and I saw the meter person making his way down the street) but I could tell this man was not going to budge. I think he could tell I was watching him, because all of a sudden he was watching me. Hmmm. So what do I do now? My plan had been to head out of town at this point and continue my journey to Mississippi. <br/>
<br/>
I decided (at that moment) that while in Memphis, I should definitely find a BBQ spot. So I headed to Neely's had a great little lunch special, checked in with all my kids and husband, then went back to see if Elvis was alone. Beale Street was quite a bit busier, so parking was more of an issue, but I found a spot (not sure it was legal) across the street in an alley. My homeless friend had moved on, but now there was a repairman doing some sort of work right by Elvis. I waited, thinking it was much too hot for him to be outside long, and I was right. But as soon as he left, a large group gathered around Elvis to enjoy several photo opportunities with him. I watched the entire photo session, saw them wander away, and realized my chance had come. <br/>
<br/>
I casually wandered over to where I needed to be, keeping one eye on my car hoping I wouldn't be ticketed and the other checking for people (homeless or otherwise) who might be watching. I replaced the repaired letterbox, then wandered back to my car. I was on the highway headed south shortly after that. <br/>
