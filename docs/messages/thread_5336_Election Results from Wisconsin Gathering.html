                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here are ALL the election results for the traveling ELECTION DAY stamp:<br>
<br>
"Birds of a Feather" event, Kirkland, IL - June 21, 2008:<br>
    McCain - 11 votes<br>
    Obama - 8 votes<br>
        (2 write-ins)<br>
<br>
"Mid-Coast Maine Letterboxing" event, Brunswick, ME - August 1, 2008:<br>
    McCain - 12<br>
    Obama - 10<br>
        (20 write-ins for various locals)<br>
<br>
"Beautiful Ohio's Edge" event, Woodsfield, OH - August 30, 2008:<br>
    McCain - 8<br>
    Obama - 2<br>
        (1 write-in)<br>
<br>
"WI Letterboxing 10th Anniversary" event, Sturgeon Bay, WI - October 4, 2008:<br>
    Obama - 13<br>
    McCain - 6<br>
        (2 write-ins:  Bob Barr & Paul McCartney)<br>
<br>
As you can see above, the votes were fairly close at the first 2 events.  The Ohio event (McCain landslide) was held right after Sarah Palin was chosen as McCain's running mate.  And now the economy has everyone concerned (Obama's first victory).  <br>
<br>
ELECTION DAY isn't scheduled to travel to any more events, so I guess we'll all just have to wait and see what happens next month.  Thanks to all who participated, it's been fun :)<br>
