Is there a preferred way of listing boxes so there aren't duplicates?<br>
Or does it really matter since the interpretations of any given topic<br>
would be different? We can't list boxes before they're planted. Or can<br>
we? And just note in the clue that they'll be for the gathering and<br>
clue will be to come?<br>
<br>
Forgive me, I'm a large-gathering newbie.... :]<br>
