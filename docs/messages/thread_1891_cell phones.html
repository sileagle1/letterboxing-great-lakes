carrier; I just have a really weak signal here in my<br/>
office at work (must be the building's walls?). <br/>
Luckily it works fine inside my apartment, though,<br/>
which is a very good thing since I no longer have a<br/>
land line!  As for the woods, we've never checked to<br/>
see how strong or weak our signal is while out<br/>
letterboxing....<br/>
