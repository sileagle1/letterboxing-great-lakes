                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're getting more serious about planning an LB trip for Labor Day <br>
weekend.  We plan to take the new ferry across from Milwaukee to <br>
Muskegon and will probably bring our own car since convenient car <br>
rental options don't seem to exist at this time.<br>
<br>
We would plan to spend most of our time letterboxing and will <br>
research locations and maps in advance, then probably post something <br>
when it's closer to our trip to see if any of you know of any <br>
changes/updates re: any of the boxes.  My question now is whether a <br>
lot of boxes have been pulled due to the Michigan State Park rules <br>
re: letterboxing, or if the boxes are still in place.  If they are <br>
still in place, are all clues available via LBNA site or are they <br>
published elsewhere?<br>
<br>
SpringChick has already provided some info re: hotels and a perch <br>
dinner recommendation (is it offered every night?).  I'm interested <br>
in any additional recommendations anyone may have re: places to stay <br>
near a lot of letterboxes and especially places to eat.  <br>
<br>
We'd love to meet up with anyone in the area while we're there, <br>
perhaps even meet somewhere for dinner one night.<br>
<br>
You can contact me off-line if you wish (or post to the group in case <br>
others are thinking of a similar excursion).  My address is:<br>

Thanks!!!<br>
