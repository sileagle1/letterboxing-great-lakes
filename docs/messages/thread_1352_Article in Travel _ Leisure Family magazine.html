Our nephews were interviewed by this author, who along with a <br>
photographer, accompanied them on a couple of letterbox hunts in the <br>
southern U.P. of Michigan in July 2003.  It looks like the final <br>
article was much shorter than her original plans. <br>
<br>
However, the photo that is on the website appears to be of 3 other <br>
youthful letterboxers finding one of SpringChick's boxes... it's very <br>
tiny, but I'm pretty sure I recognize the stamp image!  Neat!<br>

I saw the article in T & L yesterday and had to do a double take to see <br>
if it was even the same person whom I spoke with way back then.  At the <br>
time Jaime told me it would be running last summer.  When the article <br>
never came out, I figured he (she?) had gotten discouraged because I <br>
wouldn't agree to be interviewed and just scrapped the whole thing.  <br>
Looks like it just laid dormant for a bit.<br>
