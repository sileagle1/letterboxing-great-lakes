                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are back from our long weekend in Vermont where we took the opportunity to attend Mark &amp; Sue Pepe's "Back to Our Roots" gathering.  Mark &amp; Sue were the second letterboxers we ever exchanged with at GLK 2005 (the very first person was Mrs Doglvrs!)  We have maintained a friendship with both of them in the ensuing years, and we've appreciated the dedication the Pepe's have made to document the historical beginnings and growth of this fun hobby we all have grown to love and enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
This event was truly a letterboxing highlight for us! There were letterboxers from at least 15 states (we were the only ones from the Great Lakes)  We tried to represent you all in a good fashion, but we have to tell you that we boxed with Silver Eagle from Texas and The Lazy Letterboxer and the Letterboxing Ham from Massachusetts and we managed to get lost requiring miles of extra hiking. (WiHi and MM have been lost with us before in a similar fashion, so they understand how easy it is for us!) We were so lost that we ended up on a road as "hitchhikers" of sorts until Choi, Lundy and JESS sea rescued us by shuttling Tonto back to our car to come and fetch us!  We forgot clues sheets, maps and managed to get lost a second time.  But, in our defense, the others likewise forget theirs.  We still had a great time laughing at being so pathetic!<br/>
<br/>
The weather was cool, wet and MUDDY, but it did nothing to dampen the spirit of the weekend.  From the opening reception on Friday to the all day event on Saturday, we were amazed by the incredible carving (Kreepy Kelli's work was unbelievable!), delighted with the great hikes, but we were most excited to meet and spend time with those early letterboxers that helped make possible letterboxing as we now know it.  Mark &amp; Sue had managed to keep secret that they had invited many of the early letterboxers to converge in one meeting. <br/>
<br/>
The first people we ran into Friday night was RaqsEnigma and Der Mad Stamper from Oregon and we had the chance to personally thank DMS for his LBNA tutorial on carving that Tiptoe happened upon in 2002.  This was the portal by which we fell down the rabbit hole into the world of letterboxing! <br/>
<br/>
On Saturday, back at the event site, we were sitting across from a very pleasant, quiet gentleman and asked for an exchange.  He stamped into our book and we realized that he was the Orient Express/Tom Cooch, one of the very first letterboxers in North America way back in 1998.  Sitting next to him was Silver Eagle who asked him about the early days of letterboxing. Tom nonchalantly pulled out a very small logbook and turned to the first page.  There was a stamp image of the Prayer Rock letterbox with F-1 - first finders status!  Essentially, the first stamped image of the first box in North America!  Silver Eagle and Tiptoe looked at the image then looked at each other like two kids who couldn't believe they were seeing Santa for the first time!  Tiptoe literally got goose-bumps and tears in her eyes.  Tonto in typical fashion said it was like being with Abner Doubleday holding the scorecard to the first ever baseball game!  That Tonto - always one for a sports analogy!  It was one very incredible moment for us!<br/>
<br/>
It was an awesome privilege to be part of this reunion with those responsible for starting LBNA, but we couldn't help but feel that others from our GLK group should've been there - specifically our own Spring Chick, Dragon and others who have been so good about growing the hobby/sport in our Great Lakes area for so long!  We really missed not having you all witness the moment for yourselves.  The Pepe's out did themselves in hospitality and organization - 56 stamps for the event alone!  It was letterboxing perfection!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and by the way, whatever posts you read on other letterboxing groups about us being naked on the trail are to be totally ignored!  Not true! <br/>

It wouldn't be a true T&amp;T trip if you didn't get lost...  (Too bad nobody gave us a ride when we ended up on the road with you in Tucson.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It really was a great event, wasn't it? Everything about that trip was just so special for us. Seeing you two out there, people close to my own back yard, was just wonderful  - and I have to admit, it sure was nice to hear someone say "You're from Rockford, right?" so that I knew I was actually being recognized for myself instead of the usual - "Oh yeah, aren't you DMS's girlfriend?" ;-) I never did get your new stamp - guess that means we need to run into each other again soon!<br/>
