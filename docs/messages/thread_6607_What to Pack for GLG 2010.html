                    <div class="plaintext-content">After spending a day planting boxes in Jubilee yesterday, I thought I'd give you a little heads up, so that you know a little of what to expect from this park.<br>
<br>
Jubilee College State Park is amazing. The butterflies were everywhere and there were some interesting plants (like Cup Plant)that you don't see everywhere. I had a wonderful day, so please don't take the following as a complaint.<br>
But, Jubilee is also a park with fangs. There were stinging nettles, poison ivy and lots of things with thorns. You will be encountering them simply because they were unavoidable. And even if they don't get another drop of rain before the event, it will still be wet. Parts of the trail were more than 6 inches under water and much of the rest was slick or covered in slimy, boot sucking mud. Come prepared.<br>
<br>
Some things you might want to bring:<br>
*a complete change of clean clothes (or two), including plenty of extra socks.<br>
*hiking boots or shoes you don't care about ruining.<br>
*long pants (I beg of you, please don't wear shorts.)<br>
*if you can stand it, long sleeves might be good too.<br>
*gloves<br>
*sun screen<br>
*bug spray<br>
*twice as much water as you expect you'll need. (including a small bottle to rinse off your skin if necessary. I'm serious about the nettles.)<br>
*a good attitude :)<br>
<br>
Some of the boxes include metallic ink. A baggie of wet paper towels (water only) might be helpful for cleaning the stamps when you are finished so the next person doesn't end up with a mess.<br>
<br>
You are in for a treat at the event. Everyone outdid themselves with carving. I am completely jealous that I am going to miss it!<br>

Wow, it can get warm out there (even under the canopy), and there is alot of ups and downs. <br>
