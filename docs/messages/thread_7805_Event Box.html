                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello.  I am having an event in October here in southwest Indiana.  I was looking thru the files and noticed that this group has an official event box made by SpringChick.  Does anyone know if that box is still available?  It appears that SpringChick has not logged on to AQ or LbNA in a while.  <br>
<br>
If anyone else has an event box that we can borrow I would really appreciate it.  It would be nice to have 2-3 more.  <br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
