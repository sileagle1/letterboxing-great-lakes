mother and brother turned me onto this hobby and I am not sure that <br/>
was a good thing. I dragged the family to three different sites <br/>
during our family trip. Our first find was the rediscovery letterbox <br/>
in the Flyfisher's series and the box was in good condition. Since <br/>
we were in the area we also found Indian Resting Spot (that box was <br/>
also in good condition and in a great location!). Since we have a <br/>
two year old in our family we decided 2 boxes was a good start. The <br/>
next day we went to Spring Grove Cemetery and found the Abbey (good <br/>
condition) and the Norman Shield (good condition and we were the <br/>
first ones to stamp the book!) Finally we went to Cherokee Park and <br/>
found the box whose clues begin with the spitting turtles (good <br/>
condition). <br/>
Some things we learned along the way. (1) Our stamp is entirely too <br/>
big. (2) I need to work on my carving skills. (3) Biking is an <br/>
excellent way to get around between boxes (If the terrain allows).<br/>
Just my thoughts on this new hobby. I hope to locate a couple more <br/>
boxes this weekend and I am already working on ideas for placing <br/>
boxes. <br/>
Glad to have found the group.<br/>
