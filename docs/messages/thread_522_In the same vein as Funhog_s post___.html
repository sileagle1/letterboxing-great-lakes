But I'm not too terribly worried about it, esp. since our stamps are different and as I've said before, Deedle &amp; I always box together, so our names are always signed in as Doodle &amp; Deedle Bug (so you'll know it was me and not the other one).  It just threw me that out of all the trail names in the world, someone else chose mine.  Esp. if you know what a REAL doodlebug looks like!

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
