<br>
Today's report:  I started the day by locking myself out of my brother's place in Algoma.  I ended the day by trying to return to Algoma via Brown County (oops - missed a turn to stay on 42).  But I count the day successful because I found 10 of the 14 boxes I tried to find!<br>
<br>
I found ALL of Tiptoe and Tonto's Tortoise and the Silly Hare LBs!!!!! ;)  And yes, T&T, I get that the moral of story is slow and steady wins the race.  And Merlin and Ardea's boxes were great overall experiences - if you all ever get a chance to go for boxes by these 2(4?) placers - DO IT!  <br>
<br>
After I went for the Deciduous Monkey III box, I kept thinking that DM had followed me to Peninsula SP.  Maybe I was monkey-led there, rather than pixie-led????  Not too surprising is that the boxes I find challenging up here are placed by people whose other boxes have given me fits.  But I told my DB and DSIL that the landmarks changed.  Yeah - that's it.  ;)<br>
<br>
A friend of my niece was asking me if I'd found the LB's in the Algoma area, including the one at Cave Point!  I tried not to laugh, then explained about the 10th Anniversary gathering in '08, and how that was the first time I'd ever been to Door County.   When I found the Algoma LB back then I didn't know my DB (actually half-bro) lived in Algoma not too far from the LB.  I'm sure glad we re-connected!   <br>
<br>
There are so many boxes here that even a two day trip is not enough!  I guess I'll have to come back!  And by then maybe it'll be frozen custard season at my DB's coffeeshop!  :P<br>
