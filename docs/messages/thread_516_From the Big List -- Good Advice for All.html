get excited about a box find and are perhaps less discreet than the <br/>

it worth sharing for all of us, newbies and oldies alike.<br/>

If you you are new to this activity because of the article in Time<br/>
magazine, or have come to it in some other way please read this<br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
New participants are always welcome, but before you begin searching<br/>
for letterboxes, please take a moment to consider this  think of<br/>
the effort that goes into carving a stamp, maybe even hand making a<br/>
logbook, and then to find a secure spot to hide the box in the<br/>
vicinity of a certain area or site. All of that effort spent for no<br/>
other reason that to bring some enjoyment into the world.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware of your surroundings; enjoy the view from where you are.<br/>
Letterboxes are often place in areas for a certain reason, spend a<br/>
moment to consider why the placer may have chosen to share this area<br/>
with others, by drawing them here with the lure of a letterbox find.<br/>
<br/>
Survey the area for people who may be watching what you're doing.<br/>
Remember, a common activity is "people watching"... someone may be<br/>
watching you! Please don't give away the hiding spot to others who<br/>
might not share the appreciation of this activity. If you will use<br/>
care when you replace the box in it's hiding space, you can be sure<br/>
you won't contribute to a box being lost, stolen, or destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Consider that there would be no letterboxing, if there were no boxes<br/>
to find. Missing boxes not only deprive other boxers of the same<br/>
sense of enjoyment you just experienced, but the person who created<br/>
the box has lost all the time they spent and sadly, may someday<br/>
choose to stop placing boxes.<br/>

My name is Juan and I am new to letterboxing, I live in East Lansing (MI) with my wife and daughter (we are here for grad school but we are from La Pampa, Argentina).<br/>
<br/>
I am one of the people that knew about letterboxing from the Time article and I don't think that the post "Good Advice for All" is unfliendly, but I think that there are two different pieces of advice mixed in the text:<br/>
<br/>
1) things that are pertinent to the (tacit) rules of letterboxing (such as proper re-hidding, avoiding revealing the place to other people, leave no trace, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
2) things that are more personal and are related to the particular focus that each person wants to give to the hobbie (such as researching/thinking about the area, the symbolism and conections site-stamp-placer, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
Personally I very much agree with all the text and that's the way my family and me are enjoying the hobbie (plus some artistic touch in the design and composition of our log-book) but I recognize that other people may not agree with all that was written and they are in all they right provided that the basic rules are observed.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to say that the list is very nice and find all the discussions pertinent and interesting, thank to you all<br/>
