<br>
I have just finished packing up the TESS box  (Traveling Event Stamp Showcase) for travel <br>
to TrailTracker (sending Priority mail in the morning) and I was just remarking how there <br>
are a few states un-represented...<br>
<br>
What's up Ohio, Wisconsin and Minnesota?!?!  (Indiana could use a few more)<br>
<br>
The theme is "Made in My State" and there's plenty of room for more -- in case you still <br>
want to contribute.<br>
<br>
These states are well represented:<br>
Michigan (6 stamps)<br>
Illinios (6 stamps)<br>
and Indiana is in there with 1 stamp.<br>
<br>
This great box will be appearing at the "Cabin Fever Reliever" event in Ohio and also at the <br>
annual Great Lakes Gathering also in Ohio....bring a stamp to contribute to one of these <br>
events...or feel free to contact me or SpringChick for a mailing address, and your stamp <br>
will be included.<br>
<br>

btw...I hear this TESS thing has one smokin' hot logbook.....<br>

<br>
We're very excited to get this for our event here in Ohio this coming <br>
Saturday!!  I do have a few ideas for contributions, but had never seen <br>
the TESS box before and so this will be a perfect opportunity for those <br>
of us in Ohio (and a few from Indiana too) to see this before the big <br>
June 2nd shindig!  Thanks so much for allowing us to join in!  :)<br>
<br>
I will let you know as soon as it arrives!<br>

WOW!!!  First, that IS one smokin' hot logbook condo!!!!  Very creative <br>
in every way possible.  I promise to take good care!!!  The stamps that <br>
so many have contributed are very well done and extremely interesting!  <br>
What a traveling educational box! <br>
<br>
Shhhh (I don't want to give the stamp away) to the person who <br>
contributed the MI stamp that begins with "V"---I was born in Detroit <br>
and that (product) was a staple at my grandparents and both <br>
great-grandparent's homes. That stamp brought a wondeful flashback of my <br>
grandmother proudly telling me that V****** was made in MI!  Thanks for <br>
the great memory!  I had forgotten.<br>
<br>
There are going to be at least a couple of Ohio boxes contributed right <br>
way so we get on the map as well.<br>
<br>
SpringChick, thanks for listing this and sharing AND for your fantastic <br>
GLK stamp!!  NICE to have in anyone's collection!<br>
<br>
I do have one question---and will ask it outloud so everyone can see the <br>
answer:<br>
Where do you record these boxes??  I looked under just a couple of <br>
individual contributors and did not see their stamp listed.  I don't <br>
think TESS comes up when I search for it either.  Help, please!  :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, the one sure way to record them is to stamp them in your logbook.<br>
<br>
As one who long ago stopped recording<br>
stamps/events/placements/finds/exchanges *anywhere* except in my logs,<br>
I am curious about the desire to have it online as well. B ut I<br>
understand that others have their own needs.<br>
<br>
The TESS series was created for some event organizers to access stamps<br>
for their events. There was great debate about whether throwing HHs on<br>
the table with 'official' events stamps was appropriate and some box<br>
creators did not want their stamps left out for general consumption.<br>
Hence, TESS and a series *meant* to be shared at an event.<br>
<br>
So, there they are.<br>
<br>
I carved one for that series and it is in my logbook in the section<br>
where I keep stamps that I've carved. They're not all letterbox stamps<br>
for boxes I've planted -- some have been planted by others.<br>
But, unlike boxes I've planted -- for which I continue to claim some<br>
ownership -- the stamps are "out there". Their home, among other<br>
places, is the TESS collection.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope the attendees enjoy the fun collection.<br>
