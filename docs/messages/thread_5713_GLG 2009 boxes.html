<br>
We have permission to place 12-15 temporary boxes for our event.  I'm going to create 15 listings at AQ. <br>
<br>
Guidelines for trail boxes - <br>
<br>
1. All Things Green (15 boxes max) - please submit your idea to me for listing in the series posted at AQ.  For this series, please design your stamp to use GREEN ink only (no metallics, unless you provide the ink with the box).  Any GREEN IDEA is acceptable.  Since <br>
we are emphasizing "green" I'm suggesting the design not exceed the size of an LTC trading card (2.5x3.5?).  Why?  Simple!  After the event, these stamps can be returned to the owners to be recycled!!!  An added bonus - we can create uniform logbooks and have each container look more official.<br>
<br>
Deadline for mailing - March 15, 2009.  <br>
Include in mailing - stamp; green inkpad (optional).  In return you will receive the logbook created for your stamp, including the event stamp, and all the finders during GLG 2009. And of course, your stamp.  If the stamp is lost you agree not to hold speedsquare et al <br>
responsible.<br>
<br>
Shelter Boxes (series) --<br>
<br>
1. The Conservation Movement<br>
2. The 1920's &  1930's<br>
3. Our State Parks (favorites from each GL state)<br>
<br>
These will be listed as Travelling Event Boxes at Atlas Quest. No restriction on size and color.  It would be nice to see at least 2 submissions from each of the Great Lakes States.  Contact me with your requests/reservations.  No limit set at this time.<br>
<br>
Deadline for Mailing - April 15, 2009<br>
I will send the mailing address under separate cover.<br>
<br>
Letterbox trading cards (LTC') - will be welcome, especially if they incorporate any of the themes listed above.<br>

Will I have to look up and print clues before coming to the event?  And if I<br>
make a shelter stamp, do I post clues, or write something about it, etc?  Do<br>
I stay with it the whole time?  I'm confused and need some details about<br>
what to expect and how to prepare.  Thanks in advance for your patience.<br>
<br>
Also, please let me know if you need any more "All Things Green" stamps, and<br>
I'll try to re-carve my "Kiyah!" stamp and send it late, if you still want<br>
it.  I deleted it off the database for now until I hear otherwise.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've only been to 2 events (GLG08 and Wisconsin 10 year) but here's my 2 cents plus a handy link.<br>
<br>
Personal travelers are stamps people carry with them and you have to say something or do something to get them.  For example my personal traveler is called "All star" and you have to be show me your converse tennis shoes in order to get it.<br>
<br>
At both the events we went to they had copies of the clues there.  But get to the location early so you can get a copy before they run out.  It is helpful to go to AQ and print out the cluse for nearby boxes and the check off list that has personal travelers, attendees and event/table top boxes listed.<br>
<br>
Table top boxes  or "shelter stamps" that we have seen just stay on a table or are hidden in something that looks like it belongs in the room (like a coffee can).  I haven't seen anyone stay with their box.<br>
<br>
Here's the handy link - http://www.atlasquest.com/events/tips2.html<br>
<br>
The Pugnasties will be at GLG09 hunt us down, and we'll do an exchange!<br>
<br>
I hope I was able to clear some things up for you. <br>
