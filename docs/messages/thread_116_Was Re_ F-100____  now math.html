I know from reading your clues in the past that I'd get WAY more math <br/>
than I could handle. Oh yeah, simple addition and subtraction gave me <br/>
a huge headache yesterday ("...the sum of x+y minus the top and <br/>
bottom numbers as a divisor, added to the mileage as you entered the <br/>
park..") You get my drift.<br/>
I'm ready to send Mobiusklein (and Grandvilla) over to WI so they can <br/>
get a taste of your brand of math. <br/>
OTOH, if you require your students to get outside, more power to you.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, have you got a location for the gathering decided yet?<br/>
Anxiously waiting.....<br/>

&gt; Congrats Azobox on F100!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, if you want to do some tougher math, come to WI and try my <br/>
&gt; Mathman series.  Six more Mathman boxes will be placed in mid-May!  <br/>
&gt; I know every letterboxer in WI is just waiting with baited breath <br/>
&gt; for more of my Mathman boxes! (Yeah, right...especially John ;-) )<br/>
&gt; . . .or you can just do the Weapons of Math Instruction series.  No <br/>
&gt; math required and all boxes are in great shape (just checked today).<br/>

&gt; &gt; After watching SpringChick reach her F-100 mark yesterday, I HAD <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; get out today. When I realized that *I* was within striking <br/>
&gt; distance <br/>
&gt; &gt; myself, the deal was sealed. So off I headed to the Grand Rapids <br/>
&gt; (MI) <br/>
&gt; &gt; area to join with Grandvilla and Mobiusklein. First on the agenda <br/>
&gt; &gt; were Bindle Babe's Fate of Easter Series and then the Bonus <br/>
Easter <br/>
&gt; &gt; Eggs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; An exchange on the trail was another bonus during that hunt. <br/>
&gt; &gt; SpringChick's letterbox partner for the day, Taylor, shared her <br/>
&gt; stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; with us.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then we moved on to two very cool hunts at Grand River County <br/>
&gt; Park. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Great clues and stamps were the way to close in the 100 mark. <br/>
&gt; While I <br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't need a slide rule, trig tables or algebraic formulae, a <br/>
&gt; &gt; calculator would have come in handy. Wow, I did more math than <br/>
&gt; I've <br/>
&gt; &gt; done for years! "Sphinx" and "Serpentine" were challenging hikes <br/>
&gt; &gt; through a wonderful park -- with good clues to boot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They finished me with an easier one at Hager Park for F-100!<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you go to Grand River, study the clues in advance.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh yeah, I ended the day with an even F-100.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now, for tomorrow.<br/>
