I know from reading your clues in the past that I'd get WAY more math <br>
than I could handle. Oh yeah, simple addition and subtraction gave me <br>
a huge headache yesterday ("...the sum of x+y minus the top and <br>
bottom numbers as a divisor, added to the mileage as you entered the <br>
park..") You get my drift.<br>
I'm ready to send Mobiusklein (and Grandvilla) over to WI so they can <br>
get a taste of your brand of math. <br>
OTOH, if you require your students to get outside, more power to you.<br>
<br>
BTW, have you got a location for the gathering decided yet?<br>
Anxiously waiting.....<br>
