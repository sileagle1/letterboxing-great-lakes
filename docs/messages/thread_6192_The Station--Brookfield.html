We went to the Station (site of the upcoming Bunny gathering).  I figured it was the perfect plan--get a nice dinner AND a letterbox (beautiful stamp BTW).  We asked for the letterbox, which our waitress brought right over.  As we were finishing our meal, a lady (manager? owner?) came over and asked if we were some of those letter people.  She started talking about the upcoming gathering--seemed quite excited about it. Wish we could come, but we will be doing our Boar's Head Festival at church.<br/>

The food was marvelous.  The kids enjoyed pizza, DH had a burger, and I had the meatloaf.  And we DEFINITELY recomment the beer battered cheese curds.  YUM!<br/>
