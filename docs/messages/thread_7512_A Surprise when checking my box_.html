                    <div class="plaintext-content">That probably is what happened; perhaps the workers found the box when they were removing everything from the site … anyway, no one had yet signed the geocache paper.  I had heard (probably from you) that there was a geocache near my box there.  However, no one who’d found my box recently had mentioned it!  Just a weird happening!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I found my Mary's Mugs: Four Queens stamp and logbook safe and dry inside a geocache.  My box was gone - there were chew marks on my baggies.  Thanks to a reported concern from WH/MM, I went to check on it.  The area around this stump had been cleared of tree fall and underbrush, in preparation for the restoration of Native American mounds - one of which was about a foot away from my box.  I had no idea the mound was there.  While I was sorting through things, a park worker came by and told me what was going on.  I'm sure he saw the stuff I had laid out, but said nothing.  I don't see how they could have not found the geocache.  I removed the LB out of respect for the area.  Plus I thought a new hiding place would be a lower risk for accidental finds.<br>
<br>
The box will be replanted - once the weather and my work/family responsibilities cooperate.  Looking forward to that day!<br>

I saw you just signed in for the box.  Glad you were able to find it even though it had been moved.  The whole area was re-done, so I'm glad when they cleared it out they didn't destroy the box.  Was the geocache in it then?  It was a clear plastic long narrow cylinder with a blue top.<br>
 <br>
I don't think the rock I put the box behind could be moved ... it's huge!  And it's further away than the rock that's more in front of the sign.  Well, we'll see what happens!  It's amazing what a popular spot that is!!!<br>

Oh, okay!!  I had thought about hiding the box in one of those cement blocks.  I'm glad I didn't, if people are using them for their picture-taking!!  I actually moved the box away from that whole section.  Yes ... they totally re-landscaped and re-did their cement work of that area.<br>

No, the geocache was not in the box. It had been tucked behind some cement blocks, which is what hte one family moved to take their photos. It looked like the area had just been relandscaped and my guess was that the workers saw it, opened it up, discovered what it was and simply "hid" it as best they could.
