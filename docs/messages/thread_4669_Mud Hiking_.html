Oh, no need to be sorry.  I'm still in a bit of pain today, but finding letterboxes is always a challenge that takes you to new locations with no promises of finding them.  It was still a nice day to get outside and 'hike around in the mud.'<br/>

  Atomic Beans got out and enjoyed the weekend. We spent Saturday walking <br/>
  around downtown scoping out places/clues for a downtown box (thats my <br/>
  teaser). On Sunday, we ventured north to find some boxes <br/>
  (unfortunately, it seems that a few of the older ones might be <br/>
  missing). It was a great day, but our shoes and pants got coated with <br/>
  mud. We managed to find a few by Beetle, Flying J, Mischief aka Lauren, <br/>
  and Garden Elf. Not only our pants, but our car got coated too. Today, <br/>
  I parked it on the roof of the garage at work...hopefully it will rain <br/>
  and wash off some of that mud!<br/>
<br/>
  I hope you feel better Beetle! (for the rest of you, it was one of our <br/>
  boxes that took her down.....oops/sorry!)<br/>
