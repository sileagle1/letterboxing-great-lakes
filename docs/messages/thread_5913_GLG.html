Last time I made it to the Great Lakes Gathering was in 2005, so it was nice to see familiar faces (instead of just stamps) and match up some new faces and stamps.  It's also the first time I'd ever been cootied - though I managed not to take any home with me.  The dogs are completely worn out;  I think Yuki was asleep in the car today before we even reached I-69.<br/>

Do you think I can figure it out? nope! Can any send me some layman's directions so I can print some of the photos I desperately want. Specially since I didn't bring my camera to the GLG and I know there will be lots that I want from there...<br/>

thanks guys<br/>

It might be a good idea if some of you bring washcloths, with water only in a baggie to the event. I imagine most of you will either have brown/gray markers/pads, or metallic pads... With the metallic, the ink can build up, especially with so many will be stamping them. So it might be good to have a damp washcloth(water only please, other products can harm stamp, water will do the trick) on the trail just in case the stamp looks a bit filled with ink.<br/>
That's all!<br/>
<br/>
See ya in June, so close-24 days!!!<br/>

<br/>
Familyof6 -- you were missed.  We were hoping to see you on the trails <br/>
but didn't get your email until last night.  I overheard others asking <br/>
about you too.  Hopefully your car will get fixed soon.<br/>
<br/>
A HUGE THANK YOU to Papa, LunaGirl, and SpartanFans for putting on a <br/>
great event.  The park was a great choice for spreading everyone out <br/>
(but not a great choice for the number of mosquitoes).  We loved the <br/>
puzzles and finding so many boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We will be planning a return to the park to get more of the boxes we <br/>
didn't find yet.  Maybe we need a followup event later this summer for <br/>
those of us who want to seek the remaining boxes?<br/>

Wish I could attend, but my husband planned a trip for the family( I swear he does this on purpose like he has GLG ESP).  Anyhow, PackerBackers was kind enough to transport the sign and stuff back to WI for me and I did send all the leftover money from last year in to help cover costs. <br/>

I pray for good weather this weekend and safe travels for everyone.  <br/>
