Hope you find it helpful.  As I said, whenever Jade uses the Speedy<br/>
Cut she mounts them on the foam board and they seem to hold up much<br/>
better.<br/>

  This was so helpful.  I was thinking in  different directions and this looks much more do-able.  Yesterday was our last day for teaching.  I have a paper due tonight, and our neighborhood home tour is Saturday, so I 'm looking at next week to make my first carving attempt.  I'll report back in on how it is going.  <br/>
  Thanks so much for all the help.<br/>
