boxing for a few years.  Not sure how many of his boxes are still out <br>
there or if there is any way to get the clues now.  Last I heard, he <br>
was active in Geocaching, but wasn't answering any questions about <br>
his boxes.  They may have turned into park trash if no one is able to <br>
get clues for them or maintain them.<br>
