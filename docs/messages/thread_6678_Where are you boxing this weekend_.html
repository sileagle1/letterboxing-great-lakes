<br>
We'll be making a return visit to the "Yellow Brick Road" in Illinois and hopefully we will be able to avoid the Wild Parsnip and Giant Hogweed (and the mosquitoes).<br>
<br>
Does anyone else hope to find a few boxes before the fireworks displays?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, as at least a couple of you already know, we are heading east for <br>
the long holiday weekend to hang out and do some letterboxing in the <br>
Cleveland, OH and Erie, PA areas.  We figured that this might be one of <br>
the last weekends that we'll have to just get away for awhile, so we'd <br>
better take advantage of it.  Added bonus: NO FAMILY out that direction <br>
to distract us from boxing. ;)<br>
<br>
And since one of our letterboxing goals of the year was to add 2 new <br>
states to the list of where we've boxed, we decided that PA was going to <br>
be closest one to drive to -- we already added MO as our other new <br>
boxing state this year back in March.  So hopefully after this weekend, <br>
we'll have found letterboxes in 18 different states together -- CA, IA, <br>
IL, IN, KY, MA, ME, MI, MN, MO, NH, OH, OR, PA, VA, VT, WA, and WI if <br>
anyone's interested.  I've also found boxes in two other states (CT and <br>
FL) but those were without Atom so they don't "count." :P<br>
<br>
Hope everyone enjoys the weekend and has a happy 4th!<br>

This week, I'm hiking around and doing maintenance on my boxes.  Also, I have been busy creating and planting more letterboxes.  You can never have enough letterboxes out there to find.  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Sometimes I wish this hobby wasn't such a secret.  We need to recruit new boxers so they too can create letterboxes for us to find.  Instead of 'finding' letterboxes, let's think about finding letterboxERS.  Invite a friend to go boxing.  <br>
