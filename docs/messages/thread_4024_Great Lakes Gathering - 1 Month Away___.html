                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have carved my 2 letterbox stamps, completed one handmade logbook, but I still have the <br>
other logbook to make.  I've also been putting together covers for smaller logbooks to be <br>
sewn and mailed off shortly for the raffle baskets.<br>
<br>
I have my letterboxes listed at AQ as Event Boxes, but really, they belong in the "local area" <br>
listing.  I figured once I planted them, I would relist them.<br>
<br>
How is everyone else doing on their letterboxes?  The database shows 30 submissions with <br>
about 13 to be sent ahead of time for planting.<br>
<br>
Stacey, how did you plan on getting those planted and clues written?  I am hoping to get over <br>
to the area about a week ahead of time to plant my two.  Do you need help?  The weekends <br>
are getting scarce, so I need to schedule my time carefully.<br>

  I was thinking that any regular boxes we find that weekend, I'd still do my stamps the same way.

As far as logbooks go, we have always logged everything in one book, chronologically.  The books provide a history of where we've been and who we have met.  For an event, we usually make sure to stamp the official Event stamp first (or save a page for it), then as we meet people and find boxes at the event, they are all stamped in on the following pages.  We use whatever logbook we are currently using, not a separate one. <br>
However speaking of logbooks at an event - be sure to bring a spare if you are nearing the end of one!<br>

Thanks!  That's what I leaning towards, because I don't think I'd <br>
scrap pages of individual exchanged stamps or personal traveller <br>
stamps.  I still may do any boxes that we search down <br>
separately.  But, I'll see how it goes.  I think it'd be too <br>
stressful to try to do everything separately.  Plus, how do I know <br>
how to divide up my book in sections until I know how many stamps of <br>
each kind I'll get? LOL Why complicate the issue any more than need be?<br>

Larger stamps? Well, depending on how large..I can either stamp the<br>
larger portion, or I can lay index cards side by side until I have<br>
enough space!<br>

It also means I can stamp in at work, or at home, or in the car, or<br>

WoW, I'm not that bad. However, I do include my PFX count next to every  <br>
stamp in my book as well as the LBNA catalog # (if there is one). <br>
 <br>
We went out to find the "Blues Clues" stamps in Moline, a series of 4  stamps <br>
that we found out of order. In my PFX counts I had them "Blues Clues  stamp <br>
#1," "Blues Clues stamp #4," "Blues Clues stamp #3" & "Blues Clues  stamp #2" <br>
-- my wife thought I was nuts and said I could just label them 1- 4. <br>
 <br>
I scoffed at the notion.<br>
