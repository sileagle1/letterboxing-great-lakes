                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have compiled a listing of the first letterboxes in each MI county. <br>
There are a few where I am still researching the plant date and one <br>
county (Mackinac) where I have yet to pinpoint which Mackinac Island <br>
box was actully the first one planted.<br>
<br>
While it would have been a challenging personal goal to find and stamp <br>
each of the "first box in the county" letterboxes, some of these are <br>
no longer active boxes so unless you've already been to them, you're <br>
out of luck.  But it is still interesting historical information.<br>
<br>
I used several old cached versions of letterboxing.org and searched <br>
the message archives at letterbox-usa to compile the data, but it is <br>
certainly possible I missed something.  If you feel there is an error <br>
in any of these (and can confirm an earlier plant date), please let me <br>
know. Also if you can supply any of the missing information, please e-<br>
mail me.<br>
<br>
The criteria I used is explained in the text on the page (i.e. no <br>
temporary/gathering boxes or mystery boxes without listed county, etc).<br>

<br>
Note: This information may not precisely coincide with the boxless <br>
counties initiative because there is at least one MI county that had a <br>
box at one time, but is now boxless.<br>
