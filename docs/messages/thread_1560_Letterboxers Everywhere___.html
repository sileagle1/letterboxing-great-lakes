                    <div class="plaintext-content">So this past weekend, Deedle & I took a break from<br>
letterboxing to participate in the 2nd annual Rails n'<br>
Trails Bike Tour.  It's held in the Cuyahoga Valley<br>
here in Northeastern Ohio.  You & your bike get loaded<br>
onto the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad train, and<br>
you're taken to Akron.  From there, you leave the<br>
train & bike the 27 miles back to your car along the<br>
towpath, stopping about halfway through for a<br>
spaghetti lunch served by the bike club that sponsors<br>
this tour.  <br>
<br>
That morning as we were waiting to board the train, I<br>
saw someone out of the corner of my eye who looked<br>
really familiar.  "Hey, isn't that Blaze?" I asked<br>
Deedle.  Sure enough, one of the other participants in<br>
the tour was Blaze from Ohio, who we'd just met a few<br>
weeks ago saying good-bye to area letterboxer<br>
Gamecock.  So of course, as we boarded the train we<br>
said hello to her and talked letterboxing on the way<br>
to Akron.<br>
<br>
Letterboxing - it follows you everywhere! :)<br>
