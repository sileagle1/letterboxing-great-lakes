                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, the local newspaper and the Chicago TV channels have been <br/>
reporting on the recent shotting and boggled armed robbery attempt at <br/>
the Silo Restaurant in Knollwood; unicorporated Lake County west of <br/>
Lake Bluff. <br/>
<br/>
"OUR Silo - famous scene of Special Indoor Letterboxing Outing in <br/>
Feb. 2007 and the place to be on Feb. 16, 2008 for S.I.L.O. II.  The <br/>
theme will be: St. Valentines Day Massacre - Crime Doesn't Pay.  <br/>
Dress according!  Letterboxes, activities, fun, and mischief <br/>
currently being planned by those two criminal master minds - Fungus <br/>
Woman and Beetle.  <br/>
<br/>
However, when I first heard the news about the robbery attempt, my <br/>
first thought was ...YIKES!  That's our winter letterboxing gathering <br/>
place!  Will we have to change our theme?  <br/>
<br/>
Well, all letterboxers can relax.  S.I.L.O. II will still happen as <br/>
planned.  As it turns out, one of the managers is a letterboxer!!! <br/>
It's a small world. She is looking forward to having all of us return <br/>
this year.  Apparently she wasn't there last year, but ALL the <br/>
waitresses and staff told her all about that group of people in RED! <br/>
I guess we made an impression on some of the staff.   <br/>
<br/>
So, circle that date - February 16, 2008.  All gangsters, mobsters, <br/>
bootleggers, flappers, crooked cops, elected public officials on the <br/>
take, escaped prisoners, and thugs are invited. Guest appearance by <br/>
Al Capone himself.  <br/>
<br/>
Beetle <br/>
