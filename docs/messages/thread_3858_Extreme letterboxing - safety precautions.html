                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many of you who know me, know that I often hike alone, actually prefer to hike alone.  I've posted this before to various lists, but thought I would share it again for those who are new and have not seen it before.  While one can never completely ensure their personal safety while hiking, particularly alone, there are a few simple thing I do to better my chances or having a safe trip or being located if something did go wrong.<br>
<br>
1) This seems obvious, but always know where you are.  Sometimes we follow the directions in the clues to get to a park and don't even know the name of the park or how we got there and thus could not accurately give a location if it became necessary to call for help.  The more accurate information you can provide to a rescuer, the quicker somebody will be able to reach you if you need help.  <br>
2) Carry a charged cell phone -- you may not be ensured service, but it certainly is not going to hurt to have it...  remember the guys who were rescued off Mt. Hount based on the signal of a cell phone?<br>
3) Let somebody know where you are going.  Before I leave, I try to leave a list of the letterboxes I was planning to look for, in the order I am planning to do them (to the best of my knowledge before getting there).  Make sure the person you are leaving this with knows how to access the clues for these letterboxes or if they don't, make them copies of the clues.<br>
4) Let somebody know where you are en route.  As I move from box to box, I call home and leave messages on the answering machine as to my location -- where I've just been, where I am headed next.  This information along with the rough itinerary I've left would make it much easier for somebody to zero in on my whereabouts should I fail to return.<br>
5) Always carry water and a basic first aid kit at minimum.<br>
6) Be aware of the conditions around you -- terrain, weather, etc.  This can be especially important in areas that you are familiar with as we tend to not be as observant in familiar areas as we are in new areas.  If the weather in your area can change in an instant and present an unsafe situation where you are (i.e. lightening storms, flood waters, etc.), know the forecast and be observant.<br>
7) Make noise while walking.  Most wild animals are just as scared of you as you are of them.  But it is instinct for a wild animal to attack if they are startled and feel threatened.  While hiking with people, we generally carry on conversation and this is enough to warn of your presence and not take an animal off-guard.  But when you're out alone, you don't have this (unless you use your hiking time as therapy and talk to yourself ;-).  So shuffle your feet, hum, whistle, etc. just to make a little noise.<br>
8) When you encounter other people, don't come across as a victim.  The way you carry yourself, whether or not you make eye contact with another person, if you speak, even your own internal feeling of confidence -- these things all send non-verbal messages to a potential perpetrator and can make you more or less likely to actually become a victim of foul play.<br>

I'm not into the difficult hikes and would have to vote no on the poll questions. But I have done things I shouldn't have, that risked my life for nothing more than nice scenery, a solitary trailride or for a letterbox. Looking back on it, I realize it was stupid and dangerous. But it's so hard to hold back the drive when you've gone so far for a box and then come to what might seem like a surmountable obstacle. <br>
<br>
It seems to me, someone a few years ago posted about how they had to be rescued from being trapped in mud by police and fire personnel. And recently someone encountered a crazy man that attacked her dog (after his dog started a fight with her dog.) I found myself trying to get "just one more" in total darkness in an area where a dead body was found two weeks later. So you not only have dangerous terrain, you have dangerous people and animals to consider as well.<br>
<br>
When you go on a hike, is it always in areas where you have cell service? Do you even carry a cell phone with you? Do you know exactly where you are and how to tell someone how to find you? Does anyone know exactly where you are? Would they notice that you didn't come home?<br>
<br>
My point is: don't let the drive get the best of you. Or, at least (as Trail tracker did) let someone know where you are and what you are doing BEFORE you take a risk. At least that way you don't have to wait for someone to notice you're missing or happen along and see you before you can get help. On some trails, that might take days or more! A little planning and notifying someone in advance could save your life if something happens.<br>
<br>
If you know you're going for a difficult box, take along at least one other person that can pull you to safety and could go for help if you're walking up the stream and slip and crack your head on a rock (or fall down a cliff and break your leg or whatever.)<br>
<br>
I think it's a responsible thing to do to warn people about what they might encounter during the hunt. It's much easier to prepare or choose not to hunt BEFORE you get out there and find out you're in over your head or let the thrill of the hunt over ride good judgment. :-)<br>
<br>
I'm sure no one wants to have someone die or get seriously injured looking for their letterbox.<br>

me  "what's a 'lil girl like you doing out here by your lonely self?" <br>
I really don't know how I got all those clues done for the Fantasy <br>
gathering I did last year! I guess I felt a little more comfortable <br>
seeing people walk by every 100 yards or so. And it isn't like I <br>
don't take all the precautions she mentioned earlier, I guess I have <br>
an over reactive imagination. One time I went to look for a mystery <br>
box by myself and had to turn around because I just felt too scared! <br>
It was a bumber too because I knew I would have been the first to <br>
find it.<br>
