  I think one of the most amusing things was when we were checking on a <br>
  series of boxes of ours. When we got to the third box, we found a <br>
  hitchhiker. However this HH wasn't IN our box, it was in its own box, <br>
  which was actually LARGER than our box. The HH not only had a stamp <br>
  and logbook inside the container, but also an ink pad. That wasn't an <br>
  easy HH to move along, because it had to be placed with another box <br>
  that had a big enough hiding spot to hide 2 full size boxes!<br>

It was BigPurpleFoots question that has us now focused on the lighter and more fun side of LB'ing.<br>

Yep, I was just answering the question!  <br>
No, that wasn't the one.  So it sounds like there are multiple GIANT HHs out there.  I assume they were started by newbies who didn't understand the nuances of the game very well yet.  The one we found was called:  Whooo! What? Where am I Going? HH<br>

The one we found was a box unto itself called "Picture a World . . ." you  <br>
had to write in the logbook (larger than most of my logbooks) what you wished  <br>
for the world to make it better. <br>
 <br>
Someone wrote in, "I picture a world where Hitchhikers are small enough to  <br>
fit into a letterbox." That gave me a good laugh.<br>
 <br>
I think Trailrider and Pastors Wife found that one after it left our  <br>
hands.... they could verify.<br>

I found one in the woods of Georgia, the Relay for Life HH that was <br>
twice the size of the substantial stamp in that box! It was huge, and <br>
the logbook all filled up. I ended up sending it home. It definitely <br>
threw me when I lifted the log to find two letterboxes!<br>
