His new trail name is Half Empty and he is  planting some boxes out there, even though it is definitely not a letterboxing hot spot.  His latest clue is also very creative, but definitely easier to solve than the Rexlettob series.  If you are interested in seeing the clue, you can check it out here:<br>
