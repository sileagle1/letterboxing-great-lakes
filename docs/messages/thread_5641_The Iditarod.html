<br/>
"Slaughter" is maybe not the right word choice.  After all, we were armed with ice picks!  <br/>
Spartanfans by default got teamed with Tiptoe &amp; Tonto (thanks to Spring Chick and <br/>
Azobox taking too long at the first box...hehehehe) but, we did make a good team!  <br/>
Thanks to risks we took and just plain luck, we came out champions.  And it felt REALLY <br/>
good to shake the Black Cloud of Bingo off Tiptoe and triumph in The Iditarod!  Some of <br/>
you indeed were prophetic!<br/>
<br/>
I know we always sing the praise of event planners and the fun time had by all.  This time <br/>
Familyof6 were no exception.  They did an incredible amount of planning!  We can't even <br/>
tell you how great the stamp carvings were.  Andrew just might be inducted into the top <br/>
all time carvers Hall of Fame.  We had a riot running over ice flows and slushing through <br/>
the melting snow with ice picks!  Everything about this event reassured us that our joy and <br/>
sometimes obsession with letterboxing is well founded.<br/>
<br/>
But, possibly best of all was the gift given to Soring Chick....the handmade voodoo doll!<br/>

With two kids in tow we were just looking forward to collecting a few <br/>
great stamp impressions.  We were VERY excited to be able to collect all <br/>
27 stamp impressions yesterday (even if Mysteryas wasn't as lucky as he <br/>
has been at Bingo).  MI Girl was a great teammate.  Most importantly, we <br/>
all had fun.<br/>
<br/>
FamilyOf6--THANK YOU!  You are an awesome carver and an awesome event <br/>
planner!!!  It must have taken you days and days of planning, carving, <br/>
clue writing, etc.  We really appreciate everything you did to put the <br/>
event together.  Thanks!<br/>

Congrats to you, Familyof6 for putting on such a successful outing <br/>
and for taking the time and effort to do so.  I love your stamp <br/>
from "The Reaper" and I'm sure you had awesome stamps at the <br/>
Iditarod.  Will any of the event stamps be available at a later <br/>
time?  So glad everything went well and you had great weather.<br/>

&gt; It was a GREAT day to be outside, beautiful and sunny with weather in<br/>
&gt; the 40's/50's here in Portland, MI. Several teams competed to win The<br/>
&gt; Iditarod, and our very own Tiptoe and Tonto and Spartanfans teamed up<br/>
&gt; to slaughter the competition. After drying off, everyone met at The<br/>
&gt; Chocolate Moose to see who won, exchange stamps, have lunch, and enjoy<br/>
&gt; homemade ice cream. Here are the results:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1st Place: (a whopping 360 points!) Team Tiptoe and Tonto and<br/>
&gt; Spartanfans. <br/>
&gt; 2nd Place: (250 points) Team of Pale Puppy Posse, Gibson Girl, Billy<br/>
&gt; Bad Bird, and Groovy Girl.<br/>
&gt; 3rd Place: (210 points) Bowl of Cherries<br/>
&gt; 4th place: (205 points) Springchick and Azobox (needless to say,<br/>
&gt; Azobox walked right into the river...not sure if he was planning for a<br/>
&gt; swim or not!)<br/>
&gt; 5th Place: (185 points) Mich Kathy and Site Sleuths<br/>
&gt; 6th Pace: (120 points) JustHappy2Cya and Doglvrs<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Three teams chose to participate in a special race where they had to<br/>
&gt; pull a team mate across a field on a sled, collect an ice block, come<br/>
&gt; back to the starting area, and chip their prize out with ice picks.<br/>
&gt; Needless to say, this DID help the 1st and 2nd place winners win! In<br/>
&gt; fact, Tiptoe nearly jumped out of her car while it was still moving. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was fabulous and pictures are coming soon. Hope everyone had a<br/>
&gt; great day and enjoyed the event. We had a fabulous time hosting it.<br/>
