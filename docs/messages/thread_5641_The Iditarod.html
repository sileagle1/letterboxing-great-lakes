                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was a GREAT day to be outside, beautiful and sunny with weather in<br>
the 40's/50's here in Portland, MI. Several teams competed to win The<br>
Iditarod, and our very own Tiptoe and Tonto and Spartanfans teamed up<br>
to slaughter the competition. After drying off, everyone met at The<br>
Chocolate Moose to see who won, exchange stamps, have lunch, and enjoy<br>
homemade ice cream. Here are the results:<br>
<br>
1st Place: (a whopping 360 points!) Team Tiptoe and Tonto and<br>
Spartanfans. <br>
2nd Place: (250 points) Team of Pale Puppy Posse, Gibson Girl, Billy<br>
Bad Bird, and Groovy Girl.<br>
3rd Place: (210 points) Bowl of Cherries<br>
4th place: (205 points) Springchick and Azobox (needless to say,<br>
Azobox walked right into the river...not sure if he was planning for a<br>
swim or not!)<br>
5th Place: (185 points) Mich Kathy and Site Sleuths<br>
6th Pace: (120 points) JustHappy2Cya and Doglvrs<br>
<br>
Three teams chose to participate in a special race where they had to<br>
pull a team mate across a field on a sled, collect an ice block, come<br>
back to the starting area, and chip their prize out with ice picks.<br>
Needless to say, this DID help the 1st and 2nd place winners win! In<br>
fact, Tiptoe nearly jumped out of her car while it was still moving. <br>
<br>
It was fabulous and pictures are coming soon. Hope everyone had a<br>
great day and enjoyed the event. We had a fabulous time hosting it.<br>

<br>
"Slaughter" is maybe not the right word choice.  After all, we were armed with ice picks!  <br>
Spartanfans by default got teamed with Tiptoe & Tonto (thanks to Spring Chick and <br>
Azobox taking too long at the first box...hehehehe) but, we did make a good team!  <br>
Thanks to risks we took and just plain luck, we came out champions.  And it felt REALLY <br>
good to shake the Black Cloud of Bingo off Tiptoe and triumph in The Iditarod!  Some of <br>
you indeed were prophetic!<br>
<br>
I know we always sing the praise of event planners and the fun time had by all.  This time <br>
Familyof6 were no exception.  They did an incredible amount of planning!  We can't even <br>
tell you how great the stamp carvings were.  Andrew just might be inducted into the top <br>
all time carvers Hall of Fame.  We had a riot running over ice flows and slushing through <br>
the melting snow with ice picks!  Everything about this event reassured us that our joy and <br>
sometimes obsession with letterboxing is well founded.<br>
<br>
But, possibly best of all was the gift given to Soring Chick....the handmade voodoo doll!<br>

With two kids in tow we were just looking forward to collecting a few <br>

27 stamp impressions yesterday (even if Mysteryas wasn't as lucky as he <br>
has been at Bingo).  MI Girl was a great teammate.  Most importantly, we <br>
all had fun.<br>
<br>
FamilyOf6--THANK YOU!  You are an awesome carver and an awesome event <br>

clue writing, etc.  We really appreciate everything you did to put the <br>
