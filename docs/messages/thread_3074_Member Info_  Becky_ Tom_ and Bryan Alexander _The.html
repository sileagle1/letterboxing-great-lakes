                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all, we're The Cats Meow.  We reside in Niles OH which is in NE <br/>
Ohio.  We've been boxing for about 2 1/2 years.  We're fast <br/>
approaching our 100th find and have twenty boxes hidden in 2 states <br/>
and 6 counties.  Our obsession started when my sister in law and <br/>
brother in law introduced us to the hobby.  They live in Florida and <br/>
go by the trail name Kilroy.  It took us about a year to get started <br/>
after she showed me the web page and her log book.  It kept rolling <br/>
around in the back of my mind, but the thought of hand carving stamps <br/>
really intimidated me.  I went out and bought a cat paw to be our <br/>
signature stamp.  One nice New Years Eve it was about 55 degrees and <br/>
I was itching to get outside.  I said to Tom, lets go find the box <br/>
your sister has hidden in McDonald Oh.  So we set off to find it and <br/>
we were hooked.   New Years Day it was still unseasonably warm out so <br/>
he asked me if I'd like to go to Nelsons Ledges in Parkman OH.  There <br/>
were two boxes there that had been placed by Gamecock.  I agreed to <br/>
go since it was winter.  I figured there was no chance of coming <br/>
accross a snake.  We sucessfully found the first box and set off to <br/>
find the second box.  On that trip we didn't find the second box but <br/>
we did come accross a very slugish snake on the trail.  Later that <br/>
spring we found the second box.  We went to our first unoffical <br/>
gathering when gamecock held a get together at Brandywine Falls.  She <br/>
was moving out of state and was going to be there with all her boxes <br/>
for those who wanted to get the rest of her series.  At that time we <br/>
met Doodle and Deedle Bug, Blaze, Gamecock and oh my a few others who <br/>
names don't redily come to me.  I smile everytime I think about that <br/>
day.  That was the day that gamecock gave Doodle and Deedle a stamp <br/>
comemorating their engagement.  :-)  And now, they're joined together <br/>
in marital bliss.   Fast forward to this summer when we attended our <br/>
first official gathering.  The OOSA Cookout.  We had a great time, <br/>
and met some really nice people.  Safariman,Trailtracker, <br/>
Fasinatfinders (whose first box found was one of mine) Grandma <br/>
Butterfly, and many others.  <br/>
<br/>
Since we've introduced a few of our friends to boxing.  We are truely <br/>
hooked! We love all the places our fellow boxers have taken us to <br/>
see.  We're always amazed at the beautiful stamps you all carve.  And <br/>
we look forward to meeting more of our fellow boxers over time.  <br/>
<br/>
This has been a family activity that we've used on vacation, to get <br/>
away from it all, to relieve stress, and just have fun.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to reading more about everyone :-)  <br/>
