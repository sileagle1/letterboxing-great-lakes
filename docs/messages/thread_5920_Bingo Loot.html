                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our booty box arrived also! Camo tape, lock and lock box, carving medium, ink dots-so much cool stuff! The Merry Men have claimed (and fought over) the cool orange whistle, and we all agreed that the coolest "booty" was the instant sanitizing tablets from the Dominician Republic-they're tablets the size of an AlkaSeltzer that when they get wet they turn into sanitizing wipes! How cool! We also got a cool journal.<br>
<br>
SpringChick, are you trying to tell us it's time for us to start carving and planting?<br>
Thanks for all the fun!<br>
Tammy/Maid Marion of RobinHood and Merry Men<br>

Yippy! The bingo winnings have finaly arrived. Thanks to Spring Chick and all the bingo contributers. The carving medium is much needed as are the ink dots, containers and camo tape.I think Grandvilla may have her eye on a couple of items! Thanks again. Happy Trails.<br>
