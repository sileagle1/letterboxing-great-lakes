Sunday...but yesterday we hit Geneva-on-the-Lake to<br>
first find the Eddie's Grill Box. Fantastic view of<br>
Lake Erie from this park. We couldn't find the other<br>
Geneva box. It has probably become a victim of poor<br>
hiding. Under bushes do not make good box hiding<br>
places. Planted the International City box in<br>
Lorain...found the French Creek box. It's funny, my<br>
mom grew up in Lorain and had never been to French<br>
Creek before yesterday. This park had the most visible<br>
wildlife variety of any park we've been to so far. We<br>
saw: huge butterflies, a baby snake, the most unusual<br>
helicopter insect I've ever seen, and right in front<br>
of the box, a turtle standing guard on the trail. Very<br>
cool. We then got ambitious and headed towards the One<br>
Hundred Acre Woods. Oh dear. This is the kind hunt<br>
that is great in the late fall and winter when the<br>
ground freezes. In the summer, it is mud and mosquito<br>
HELL. We found 4 of 5, box #2 was being guarded by a<br>
SNAKE. Ug. I'm sad to say that Piglet's logbook is<br>
kaput. It was so wet that all of the ink practically<br>
disintegrated and it's just a multicolor blob of<br>
paper. If anyone goes to the area, bring a fresh log<br>
for poor Piglet! We didn't have any extras along. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of that S-word, a couple weeks ago I was attempting to find <br>
one of Dragon's Vampire Series boxes and, while on the wrong trail <br>
WAY too far past where I should have been, I came across TWO snakes <br>
hogging up the entire path!  I was already freaked out, because no <br>
one knew where I was and there were three or four suspicious-looking <br>
fishermen hanging about (more the "I have nothing else to do today so <br>
I guess I'll fish"-type than the outdoorsman-type).  I had read some <br>
of the TOTW safety tips the night before and did have a whistle with <br>
me, it was the middle of the day and I tried to look like I knew <br>
where I was going (see, some of the tips stuck with me!).  So here <br>
are these snakes and they didn't look one bit scared of ME, so I <br>
jumped clean over both of them, Olympic-style.  I never did find the <br>
box, because I tried to cram the find into about 25 minutes from <br>
leaving work to picking up my kids - and that included changing from <br>
work clothes into casual clothes.  Man, what it takes to get a few <br>
minutes of letterboxing time! (smile)  Once the boxes are back from <br>
the Monster Mash, I'm going to give it another go - after the snakes <br>
hibernate!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to hear you had a great time in Ohio!  The 2nd Geneva-on-the-Lake box had been pulled already because of possible poison ivy in the area where it was planted, so don't worry, the planter was the reason it was AWOL (she notes this on the clue page, which of course was after you'd already set out for your trip).  <br>
 <br>
Can't wait to go hunt the box you planted, and I'm happy to hear that French Creek is alive and well.  Deedle & I tried to find it earlier in the summer but had no luck...we decided we'll go back in the fall when all that foliage stuff is dead.  Maybe that turtle will still be there to help us out....<br>
 <br>
And how sad that Piglet's logbook is kaput...I'm not sure if the placer, JillBear, is on this list or not.  But, imagine trying to find all those boxes in the POURING RAIN, which were the conditions when Deedle & I made our first attempt. :)  So glad that snake wasn't guarding box #2 when we went the second time....I much rather deal with that ghost we found instead of any snakes.  Hearing about all these snakes is really making me wonder _why_ I'm willing to walk through the woods to find plastic containers....<br>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br>
