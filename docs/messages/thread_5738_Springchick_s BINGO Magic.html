                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I have a pretty good bet that Springchick does something like this when she sets the BINGO gods in motion:<br>
<br>
1. It involves a rubber chicken (don't ask...there's kids in this room!)<br>
2. I'm pretty sure there is some freaky dancing going on...chanting, a bit of screaming, hellraising, and such. Don't believe? Check the police report from her residence!<br>
3. ...and perhaps there is a thong or two (Again..don't go there. The secret may never be shared!)<br>
4. Of course, there are voodoo pins and dolls. <br>
5. and LOTS and LOTS of ink! all colors, of course.<br>
6. Perhaps some Shamans are involved.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, what do you think people? How does Springchick do it? Inquiring minds want to know!<br>
