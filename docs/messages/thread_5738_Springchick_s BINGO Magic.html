                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I have a pretty good bet that Springchick does something like this when she sets the BINGO gods in motion:<br/>
<br/>
1. It involves a rubber chicken (don't ask...there's kids in this room!)<br/>
2. I'm pretty sure there is some freaky dancing going on...chanting, a bit of screaming, hellraising, and such. Don't believe? Check the police report from her residence!<br/>
3. ...and perhaps there is a thong or two (Again..don't go there. The secret may never be shared!)<br/>
4. Of course, there are voodoo pins and dolls. <br/>
5. and LOTS and LOTS of ink! all colors, of course.<br/>
6. Perhaps some Shamans are involved.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, what do you think people? How does Springchick do it? Inquiring minds want to know!<br/>

&gt; Well, technically, there are 10 MI boxes and 7 from the other states, <br/>
&gt; but the extra 3 are in the UP and probably visited very rarely so it <br/>
&gt; pretty much evens out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for people, not counting those 5 not in the region, there are 7 from <br/>
&gt; MI, 5 from WI, 7 from IL, 0 from IN, 0 from OH, and 1 from MN -- sorry <br/>
&gt; if I made a mistake about where someone is from, but I'm pretty sure I <br/>
&gt; got that right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Events: 3 MI, 2 WI, 2 IL, 1 IN, 4 OH, and 2 MN<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Overall, I've been impressed with the distributions that Spring Chick <br/>
&gt; makes.  Also curious... just how do you come up with the list each <br/>
&gt; year?  Care to give us any insight?<br/>

&gt; &gt; If I remember correctly, the Letterbox category is evenly distributed <br/>
&gt; &gt; among<br/>
&gt; &gt; the 6 states, but the Trail Names and Events are not. For example, there<br/>
&gt; &gt; were 4 OH Events on the master list, more than any other state. I'm not<br/>
&gt; &gt; familiar with all the Trail Names on the master list, but I don't think<br/>
&gt; &gt; there is an even distribution (I think it is heavier on the IL, MI and WI<br/>
&gt; &gt; names, probably because they are more active on the message board).<br/>
&gt; &gt; Therefore we can't expect to see a balanced distribution between the <br/>
&gt; &gt; states<br/>
&gt; &gt; on an overall basis.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I went a little further and included not only boxes but events and<br/>
&gt; &gt; people for each state as well. Here are those breakdowns:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; MI: 12<br/>
&gt; &gt; WI: 9<br/>
&gt; &gt; IL: 8<br/>
&gt; &gt; IN: 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; OH: 7<br/>
&gt; &gt; MN: 3<br/>
