Tammy... Yes, this is REALLY great: And I thought I was good with my<br/>
little 5 year old and trying to look "natural" when retrieving boxes!<br/>
You REALLY have got it covered here! If only everyone where as<br/>
stealthy as you! I hope a lot of people read your post :-)<br/>
<br/>
Have a great week!<br/>

&gt; We have managed to find boxes in busy parks with no one noticing.  I<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; having kids helps a lot with this.  If you walk a trail before<br/>
getting to<br/>
&gt; the busy picnic area you can go to a picnic table and tell the kids<br/>
the "old<br/>
&gt; folks" need to rest a bit; hand them some empty containers (box<br/>
size) and<br/>
&gt; then them to see if they can find any bugs or worms to take home to the<br/>
&gt; turtle for dinner while the old folks rest.  Ours are 8 and 11 so<br/>
they are<br/>
&gt; old enough to understand what it is they are to do.  They go to the<br/>
location<br/>
&gt; the box should be, if they find it, they leave one of the boxes they<br/>
had and<br/>
&gt; take the real one.  They then come back to the table and say they<br/>
don't want<br/>
&gt; to look for bugs anymore.  So I say lets do something else then. <br/>
Take out a<br/>
&gt; coloring book and another box size container of crayons, our<br/>
logbooks, etc.<br/>
&gt; Looks like we are wasting time while we rest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another thing we do is toss a ball back and forth making sure one is in<br/>
&gt; front of the area where the box should be.  Overthrow it so the<br/>
person can<br/>
&gt; look for the box while they are looking for the ball.  If they find<br/>
it they<br/>
&gt; slip it into their backpack and come out with the ball.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I usually take sandwiches and such in our backpack so if we need to<br/>
have a<br/>
&gt; picnic to throw off onlookers we can.  When going to a busy park I<br/>
usually<br/>
&gt; pack our logbook and stamps in box size containers as well as our<br/>
lunch so<br/>
&gt; all the boxes just blend in to onlookers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where there's a will there's a way.  LOL  We've had a "sick" kid to<br/>
allow us<br/>
&gt; to be on the side of a road where a box was a couple times, as well<br/>
as boys<br/>
&gt; and their "potty breaks" too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Sadly, I have to agree with Bali - I found both of these wonderful <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps, but I had great difficulty retrieving them with any<br/>
stealth at <br/>
&gt; &gt; all.  I'd suggest hiding places that aren't as exposed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; TrailTroll<br/>
&gt; &gt;===============================<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think maybe they were both in too open of areas where people<br/>
&gt; could be seen too easily retrieving them... <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bali<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We just had to skip a box in Lancaster, WI for exactly that reason.  <br/>
&gt; Box was placed in the middle of a totally open area, near a picnic<br/>
shelter,<br/>
&gt; with people playing nearby.  There's no way you could retrieve that box<br/>
&gt; without being seen.  A cold, inclement day would be the only chance.<br/>
 We ran<br/>
&gt; into the same situation with another box in LaCrosse (same planter).<br/>
 We're<br/>
&gt; trying to get better at reading clues to determine which boxes are too<br/>
&gt; exposed for us to try in the summer, especially on the weekends.<br/>
We're just<br/>
&gt; not cut out to be "urban boxers".<br/>
