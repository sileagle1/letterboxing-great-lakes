So, "Exchange" WAS the most popular choice!  6 people had that as <br>
their free space.  Next most popular was "Cootie" (5) and Beetle (4).<br>

If the column "N" words continue to prevail, we will have a straight line winner soon as there are several people with 4 (in which case, their center space was a good choice).<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's funny to hear you say that. When I was getting my degree in<br>
anthropology I had to do an ethnology, which is a research project in<br>
the field [if someone didn't know that]. I chose a bingo parlor. I<br>
spent months at that bingo parlor, doing interviewing of both workers<br>
and players, mapping movement flow, participant-observation, and more.<br>
I did my analysis using a study of game theory from an ethnology done<br>
in Indonesian cockfighting, if anyone wants to know.<br>
<br>
Anyway! This is really funny to me. Because some of the conclusions I<br>
drew related to how workers -- that was my name for the administrators<br>
of the game -- differed in their belief system about both bingo and<br>
about the luck vs control of playing the game, versus the same beliefs<br>
held by players of the game, who were trying to win the game. And I am<br>
seeing some of the same belief structures come up in the discussion as<br>
to bingo on here. It's pretty amazing. I don't know why I am so<br>
astounded that I was right in my analysis, but I am. Maybe because I<br>
was only 21 and I didn't think I knew much at 21!<br>
<br>
For example, I drew a sharp distinction between the people I called<br>
"workers", anyone who administered the game, and "players", anyone who<br>
participated in the game itself. They had such radically different<br>
perspectives on the game itself, how and why to play it, and winning,<br>
and there were reasons for this distinction that I don't need to go<br>
into. I am seeing some worker-speak in SpringChick's posts. I don't<br>
know why I am astounded, after all it is her game and she is running<br>
it, so she should talk like that, I am just blinking at it. And I am<br>
seeing some player-speak in other peoples' posts too. It's like I<br>
learned a foreign language that no one else knew 15 years ago, and all<br>
of a sudden someone starts using in front of me. And I still remember<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Here's an example of what I am talking about...in my research I found<br>
that players had 2 systems for trying to win. I called one Math<br>
Systems, and it included all forms of logic, and the other<br>
Superstitions, which included anything else pretty much. So a player<br>
using a Math System would say, "I always pick cards that have 7's in<br>
all 4 corners, because 7's come up more often." Or, "At this bingo<br>
hall, I always pick these numbers.... because the balls are old and<br>
balls with those numbers have been called more often, therefore, the<br>
balls have been worn away on one side from being in the little holder<br>
more often, and so now they are lighter on one side and will pop up<br>
more often. Here. At XYZ Bingo Hall, their more worn out numbers<br>
are..." I swear I am not making this up, people actually said that to<br>
me, more than once.<br>
<br>
Basically Math Systems had to do with numbers, their positioning,<br>
probabilities, and percentages. But at the e base of it, Math was<br>
supposed to be based on some form of logic. If you could say "I do<br>
this and it works because..." and have a reason it was almost always a<br>
Math System for winning. If it has "because" in it, that was a verbal<br>
marker.<br>
<br>
Superstitions included anything that had no reason behind it, or any<br>
statement where the player said "I do this XYZ and it always wins. I<br>
don't know why it works, but it does." Examples included having a<br>
lucky elephant statue that always generated a win when its trunk was<br>
turned to face north. Wearing a certain shirt. Sitting in a certain<br>
seat. Having a talisman or setting up an entire altar [I documented<br>
some of there; they were so interesting]. Having rituals.<br>
Superstitions basically were a mythology of bingo.<br>
<br>
The workers were very dismissive [at that time and place] of the<br>
players as a whole. There's a whole big reason for that I don't need<br>
to type up here, but it was very interesting to find out what it was.<br>
It was especially interesting bc this bingo was at a Catholic high<br>
school and both workers and players knew each other rand were<br>
frequently friends/friendly on a personal level, but on Bingo Night<br>
those relationships were subsumed to the Bingo Parlor Hierarchy. But<br>
anyway, workers were especially derogatory towards Superstitions or<br>
any player who openly used Superstitions, but they did have some<br>
grudging respect for those using Math Systems. Because there was some<br>
kind of logic or reasoning behind those.<br>
<br>
I hadn't really been reading the bingo posts bc I am not playing and I<br>
am not sitting here analyzing any of you here. It was just a momentary<br>
and very strange flashback because I accidental read some stuff that I<br>
had not heard or thought about in over 15 years.<br>
<br>
Hm, maybe I should make a bingo letterbox....<br>
<br>
I don't know why I am so thrown by this. It's like, what, did I think<br>
anthropology was a joke and I was fooling around when I did it? It was<br>
just very very odd in a funny way to read this!<br>

I'm not really sure I understand what you are getting at here, but if <br>
you are implying that I have been dismissive toward the Bingo <br>
participants based on a single observatory post, I think you are way <br>
off base.  My post was made only as an observation of a trend I found <br>
to be of interest, not to say anyone did it right or wrong or one <br>
choice was better than another.  I am sure people had all sorts of <br>
reasons for choosing the free space they did and I daresay some had no <br>
reason at all, they just chose a word.  I was simply pointing out the <br>
deductive process I personally would have used for choosing had it <br>
been my choice to make -- it only stands to reason that my brain tends <br>
to work logically as I am a computer major.  This does not mean to say <br>
my way of thinking it right or better than anyone else's, nor that I <br>
feel it is superior.  It was simply an observation and an exchange of <br>
ideas.<br>

<br>
IIRC it was bc, though I had never played bingo, late that summer<br>
before school started, I stayed the weekend with a friend of mine who<br>
was from that little college town. For fun she and her family went and<br>
played bingo. I was not into it, but I walked around and saw all the<br>
little "altars" people had set up. I was also getting my degree in<br>
religious studies and I was fascinated. I wanted to know what the<br>
altars were, what all the symbols were, the rituals, what each item<br>
meant.<br>
<br>
But in the end, the Math Systems were more interesting, bc those<br>
people had reasons and a whole justification for why they picked the<br>
cards they did or sat where they did or whatever.<br>
<br>
The reason this is so amazing to me is bc I had pretty much forgotten<br>
about how much I know about BINGO!<br>

<br>
You know, I was very very careful to be sure and put that in. And I<br>
know you read it, bc you just quoted it. So if you are looking for<br>
some reason to get bent out of shape, look somewhere else. AT THAT<br>
TIME AND PLACE means in a bingo parlor in Wisconsin where I did months<br>
of research. AT THAT TIME AND PLACE. Can I say it more emphatically?<br>
<br>
I should have known not to bother trying to say ANYTHING bc someone on<br>
here would find some reason to take it personally, no matter how much<br>
I emphasize there is nothing to get all bent out of shape about.<br>
<br>
Sometimes when a pewrson is talking about someone else, someplace<br>
else, that really is what they are talking about.<br>
<br>
Then again, I should have known not to say anythign bc honestly<br>
ANYTHING said to letterboxers always seems to tick someone off. Even<br>
if it's not about them. Or letterboxing.<br>
<br>
What's really making the eye roll here is, could I have emphasized any<br>
more that my conclusions ThEN were based on months of personal<br>
research I actually did? But no, now I am drawing some conclusions<br>
based on one post that so-and-so is dismissive of players.<br>
<br>
THIS bingo game is not the same as THAT bingo place in many specifics.<br>
IF you, SpringChick, were dismissive of the players of THIS game I<br>
would be extremely surprised, bc the structure of THIS game does not<br>
lend itself to that attitude and for very specific reasons [which no,<br>
I did not go into, bc it had nothign whatsoever with what was<br>
happening HERE]. I was very specific that what I happened to see in<br>
some posts was peoples' attitudes toward picking their free spaces,<br>
numbers, orientation, and how close it was to the Math Systems I<br>
observed waaaaaay back then and that this surprised me. But of course,<br>
I must be saying someone is dismissive HERE.<br>
<br>
Now I am doubly glad I did not participate in this game. I am sorry I<br>
even bothered to read the post I did about it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read about 1/4 (at most) of the posts here -- mainly due to my  <br>
hectic schedule, 3 kids in god-knows-how-many extra curriculars, and  <br>
various other daily comittments -- so I don't know what all this  <br>
quarelling is really about either. And I did not read every post in  <br>
this current thread. But to add my own two cents, I will say that  <br>
probably a few people took that initial post a little personally  <br>
about why some people chose the middle square, when it was probably  <br>
more advantageous to choose a corner square. I will say that I did  <br>
feel stupid at first... muttering to myself:  "...Hmmmmm.... I always  <br>
thought the center square was the best place for a free space?!?!"<br>
<br>
Until... UNTIL... I went over to the files section on our list (or is  <br>
it database? see... I told you I don't keep up here...) and read over  <br>
the rules of the current bingo game. Then there it was: AHA! Not only  <br>
can you win up and down, diagonally, and "cover all," which is all  <br>
the bingo I ever learned growing up... but you can also win 4 corners  <br>
and perimeter too! I had never even heard of the last two!!!  So I  <br>
personally chalked it up (my choosing the center space rather than a  <br>
corner space,) to my own stupidity of not reading the rules of this  <br>
particular game in the first place!<br>
<br>
I dare say, however, that there were probably a few others besides  <br>
myself that didn't fully know of the other win "options" and simply  <br>
chose the center square because that's typically the best spot in  <br>
traditional bingo. Asking why someone made a choice, and then further  <br>
stating that a different choice is perhaps better, is always going to  <br>
stir things up just a little bit with some people. I didn't take it  <br>
personally however.<br>
<br>
Have a great day!<br>
