<br/>
I believe the Mill box is still in place, but apparently the Falls box<br/>
was found by some teenagers who thought it would be fun to toss it off<br/>
the bridge and watch it go over the falls.  Lucky for me, they had bad<br/>
aim and it landed in the rocks under the bridge where the rangers<br/>
found it and were alerted to my box.<br/>
<br/>
I have the application form and will be filling it out and returning<br/>
it to the ranger, but like I said, the boxes will not be approved<br/>
until someone physically goes to the hiding location with the ranger<br/>
and he approves the location.  I had had helpers in the area in the<br/>
past, but I do not think they are active boxers anymore.  So if anyone<br/>
out there is willing to help me out, let me know!<br/>

Ok, I need to let off a little steam again (go back in the archives to see  <br/>
the first time I let off a little steam).<br/>

When I read the paragraph above I want to scream, "IT'S BEEN THERE FOR  THREE <br/>
YEARS! LET IT BE!!"<br/>
<br/>
I wish they would just give it up.<br/>

I'm done.<br/>

park rangers take a page out of the MA rangers guide book;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Some exciting news! I don't know if anyone has mentioned  this, but there are<br/>
some really terrific hand-made stamps that have just been  put out by the MA<br/>
DCR - they have management of many parks in MA. The series  was produced by 2<br/>
rangers that were inspired by the CT park service and their  passport<br/>
program.<br/>
<br/>
The stamps are part of a 'passport' promotion  encouraging families to visit<br/>
the vast system of parks. They are hand-made by  a children's illustrator and<br/>
they are all self inked. The passport books are  available free from the DCR<br/>
at parks and on the website. I have visited over  31 sites with my<br/>
letterboxing buddy Ginny. It is actually better to use your  own paper or<br/>
letterbox journal as the stamps are large and they bleed through  the<br/>
passport book paper (and are hard to line up). There are 5 regions with  76<br/>
stamps in total. If you complete sections, you can get a t-shirt with  the<br/>
stamps on it. We were the first to complete the central  region!<br/>
<br/>
Here is the website for all of you that are interested:<br/>
<br/>

(http://www.mass.gov/dcr/passport/index.html) <br/>
<br/>
There  are pictures of the stamps online. We have bumped into Geo cachers - I<br/>
wanted  to let the letterboxing folks know about this - the stamps are more<br/>
like our  hobby. Also, they are drive-bys- you find the box at the park and<br/>
open it  with a combination listed in the passport book.<br/>
<br/>
It's a lot of fun and  sometimes quite challenging. Some of the parks have<br/>
admission fees, but I  have taken out park passes at my library or asked the<br/>
folks at the entrance  to stamp in. Most of the parks are really cool places<br/>
to know about.<br/>
<br/>
I  hope we bump into some letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Best  regards,<br/>
<br/>
