                    <div class="plaintext-content">The forecast for next weekend is exactly what we experienced yesterday <br>
at Alum Creek for the big Columbus Cluez-In event!  Many of us ran into <br>
each other placing boxes!  It was the mini-gathering BEFORE the event.  <br>
It was a good thing too because that way we knew which trail each other <br>
was using to place boxes and which were still open.  Anyway, yesterday <br>
we did get a major downpour after it being super sunny and gorgeous for <br>
most of the day---then it all cleared up again.  (True to the Memorial <br>
Golf Tournament tradition!!)<br>
<br>
I also wanted to give everyone a heads up that there is a lot of poison <br>
ivy in the Alum Creek area and now some of those black flies as <br>
well--but the black flies weren't too bad.  I bought a new product that <br>
I tried out yesterday and it works even better than the packaging says! <br>
<br>
It is "Cortaid, Poison Ivy Care, Toxin Removal Cloths"  "Clinically <br>
proven to wipe away poson plant toxins before the rash occurs." <br>
<br>
It comes in a blue and green box and has 6 pre-moistened cloths <br>
individually wrapped and I think they cost $5 or $6 per box. VERY much <br>
worth the cost. <br>
<br>
The cloths are generous in size and you just open the package and wipe <br>
the entire area down.  There is some sort of soap in the cloths that is <br>
very soothing.  You wipe with one side and then you fold it in half and <br>
rewipe with the clean side and dispose.  Then you need water to wash <br>
off.  I always carry a wet (black?!) clean washcloth in a zip lock when <br>
letterboxing for my hands instead of those scented wet wipes and so I <br>
just used that to clean off. <br>
<br>
This morning I have no rash when I KNOW I was in a lot of poison ivy <br>
yesterday AND---the poison ivy I got a week ago is gone from my hand <br>
too!  By all means the poison ivy on my hand should have been worse <br>
today because I was hot and sweaty yesterday causing it to spread.  My <br>
skin is super smooth today on top of it--where I used the cloth!<br>
<br>
Okay, enough of my info-emmercial!  :)<br>
<br>
I saw zero evidence of cicadas!  So that is good!  :)<br>
<br>
Last, in talking to both M&8X and Eagle Eyes yesterday (our Columbus <br>
Cluez-In hosts) they have really outdone themselves in preparing for <br>
this event!!!  They are two of the most organized people and have things <br>
down to a science!  They picked a perfect place to hold this event and <br>
we will be able to blend in as "hikers" throughout the area with no <br>
problem.  Thanks for all of your hard work over the past year--in <br>
preparing for what is sure to be a very successful event!<br>
<br>
We, here in Ohio, are very much looking forward to meeting and seeing <br>
everyone soon!<br>

You scared me with that first sentence.  I thought somehow I missed <br>
the gathering!<br>
<br>
Are there any places left to plant for those of us coming in Friday to do so?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are tons of places to hide boxes.  I didn't think so at first, but <br>
there are lots of trails that are not marked on the map as M&8X <br>
mentioned yesterday and she got full clearance to use any trail for <br>
"hiking" (that's what we are all doing) even if the gate is closed at a <br>
trail head.<br>
<br>
Alum Creek State Park is huge.  One suggestion on a place to plant---I <br>
hid 7 boxes on the trails by the park office (not the visitor's <br>
center---but the office).  I used the Pine Loop and the outer Lake View <br>
Trail only.  I did not use any of the "inside" trails.  I will also <br>
throw one more thing out about this trail, if you plant on the trail <br>
that runs parallel to, but on the opposite side of the pond and Park <br>
Office---you will be seen and so will those who are hunting.  This is <br>
because the bank of the Park Office side of the pond gets LINED with <br>
folks fishing---and lol they definitely look straight across and see <br>
what you are doing?!  (((big honkin' smile here from my experience <br>
yesterday))).<br>
<br>
I would also suggest that you do wrap your boxes in camo tape etc if you <br>
have time..  I normally do, but ran out of time for these.  Camo tape or <br>
at least spray painting them would have helped.  There are mostly only <br>
sticks to cover with and some pine needles.  I never found any rocks in  <br>
the area by the park office on the east side nor on the west side of the <br>
lake either. <br>
<br>
Very sorry for the scare!  I promise you that was not intentional!!  :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Barb, thanks for the heads up about the poison ivy.  I've never gotten <br>
it, but my two guys get it all the time.  I'm heading out today to hunt <br>
down the wipes you've mentioned.  And thank you for that tip also.  <br>
I've never heard of them. Tom will be so happy!  Also I have a little <br>
treat for everyone at the gathering!  Be sure to hunt down The Cats <br>
Meow to receive your candy stamp.  Yes, you heard that correctly.  A <br>
stamp that is edible :-)  I saw them and thought you know, what a <br>
perfect thing for folks addicted to stamps and ink.  We are so looking <br>
forward to this event.  This actually kicks off our vacation.  After we <br>
leave the event we will be heading to the Catskills for a week.  If <br>
anyone has any suggestions for must find boxes in the <br>
Newburgh/Plattekill area please let me know.  We're looking forward to <br>
seeing old friends and meeting new ones!!!!! Also, one other thing I <br>
want to mention.  Law enforcement in Ohio is being encouraged to crack <br>
down on those not wearing seatbelts.  So as you come to the event, <br>
buckle up and be safe!!!! See everyone Friday and Saturday!!!! Becky <br>

  We planted quite a few boxes on Sunday and you wouldn't believe the ticks we found afterwards. Luckily we were still in the parking lot when I screamed for Jim to "get it off me!!!!" And that was just the first of many screams. We got back out of the car and tried to do a once-over (in the downpour). We found about 8 more, plus 2 more that we found later  (one on me!). <br>
  So...keep an eye out for cooties and ticks this weekend!  <br>
