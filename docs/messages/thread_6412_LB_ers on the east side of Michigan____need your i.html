                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a weekend in April where hubby is out of town on business and I promised Lulu that we'd do something fun, just the 2 of us. So we were thinking of heading out of town to do some letterboxing. We'd like an area where we can search for several boxes, all in the same park, or close proximity.<br>
<br>
We're coming from the Grand Rapids area and I really don't want to drive more than 3 hours. We'll probably drive there on a Friday night, stay in a hotel, box all day Saturday and possibly a little bit of Sunday before heading back home. I was thinking of the Detroit area, because if I'm going to drive that far, I'm going to make a stop at Trader Joes. Yes, strange excuse, but we don't have a TJ's on this side of the state and I've never been to one. Keep hearing all kinds of great things about them, so I figured we'd stop at one before heading back home. Apparently there are locations in Farmington Hills, Northville, Royal Oak, Ann Arbor, and Rochester Hills, so boxing near those areas would be a plus ;~)<br>
<br>
So.......can you suggest an area over towards Detroit where there are several boxes all in one park or a couple parks that are somewhat close to each other? Not being familiar with the local areas, I don't want to have to drive to several locations just to find 1-2 boxes at each place. I'm hoping that there are some parks where we can park once and hit the trails and find several. I know I can look on AQ and LBNA, but can anyone give me some input as to what areas I should start researching?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Are there particular kinds of boxes that you like to find?<br>
For example, my kids enjoy being able to play on playground equipment <br>
after we find a box.  We also enjoy story clues and puzzles.  Some <br>
people enjoy long hikes.  Some people enjoy great stamps.<br>

It would be fun to have a mini-meet if some of us are available that <br>

<br>
The weekend we have in mind is April 16-18 (specifically, that Saturday). I haven't looked yet, but I'm guessing (hoping?) that the colleges won't be graduating that early?<br>
<br>
I'm up for a mini-meet if that weekend works for others too. Thanks for the Ann Arbor suggestion!<br>
