Steam  Engine 261, one of the largest ever built, is coming back to <br>
Milwaukee  today (Wed) to give a few excursions over the weekend.  <br>
(It was built  in Milwaukee and used by the Milwaukee Road.)  As best <br>
as I can tell,  it will be traveling the CP tracks to the Amtrak <br>
station in Milwaukee  tonight as well as during the excursion.  These <br>
are the tracks that  are near the following boxes of mine:<br>

folks had a restaurant-- I sure wish I was there to see it.  I take the  train <br>
back to <br>
WI/MI every summer.<br>
