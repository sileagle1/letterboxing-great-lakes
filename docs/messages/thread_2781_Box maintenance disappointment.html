I checked on my Chief Pontiac this weekend, and found that the stamp <br>
and inkpad were there, but the logbook was gone. Oh well - that <br>
happens. What disappointed me was that at least three people have been <br>
there since it disappeared, and nobody contacted me. I could tell <br>
there had been visitors because one left a post-it-note and two wrote <br>
directly on the tupperware. I know lots of people don't contact the <br>
placer with regular finds, but it is sad that nobody could let me know <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I understand your venting!  I have lost 2 log books and a stamp in the <br>
past two weeks!  After I heard from a boxer that she found one of my <br>
boxes that had a bonus and she didn't mention the bonus, I checked it <br>
and found the container filled with sticks!  No trace of log book or <br>
stamp!  Another box had the stamp and the remains of a chewed paper, <br>
but no log book.   Amazing how they just seem to disappear into thin <br>
air!  Tis very frustrating, but guess these things go along with the <br>
letterboxing experience. I too wish more people would "contact the <br>
placer"!  <br>
