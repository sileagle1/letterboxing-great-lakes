                    <div class="plaintext-content">I figure that all gatherings are pretty much open to anyone, so I don't <br>
really differentiate between what is "local", "state", "regional" <br>
or "national".  We've attended an event in Connecticut and I know at <br>
least a few others in this region have attended gatherings in other <br>
areas of the country.  Most gatherings are publicized on the discussion <br>
groups and AtlasQuest, so I believe that is considered an "open <br>
invitation".<br>
<br>
I also figure that it's fine to have multiple gatherings in the same <br>
time period.  Not everyone will be available on the same weekend, nor <br>
will everyone be willing to drive to a given location.  If there are <br>
people willing to organize an event, I say "go for it!".  More <br>
gatherings increase the likelihood that there will be at least one that <br>
each person could make it to.  For example, there was an event in <br>
Illinois on SEP 17 and one in Wisconsin on OCT 1, only 2 weeks later.  <br>
Some people could make it to one, some to another, and some to both.<br>
<br>
I think it would be good to continue the tradition of having a <br>
gathering that is called the "Great Lakes Gathering" and that it <br>
rotates between the 5 states that are in the region (assuming there is <br>
someone willing to host in that state).<br>
<br>
We're hoping to make it to as many as possible!<br>

Having attended all three of the 'official' Great Lakes Gatherings, I<br>
enjoyed the chance to meet some of the boxers more distant from my<br>
home turf. But, as the numbers of letterboxers has increased<br>
dramatically over the past several years, so have the attendees at<br>
events. Tales of HUNDREDS of people attending some out of state<br>
gatherings frighten me. One of the things I enjoy about letterboxing<br>
is that it happens best in small numbers.<br>
I wonder if the small get togethers and the quasi-regular statewide<br>
events are replacing the feasibility of the regional gatherings? Or<br>
maybe the biggies will continue but not as the sole event for some<br>
letterboxers?<br>
The Great Lakes region is large. An event in MN will not draw people<br>
from OH, and vice-versa. As we collapse the areas to more driveable<br>
distances, some MI people will drive to IL or IN and some WI people<br>
will drive to MI or IL. But maybe we've simply outgrown our need to<br>
have a single event in which to meet others. Maybe an event in a<br>
central location (whatever THAT might be) on a set weekend is the<br>
answer. That way, the state events can take place on non-conflicting<br>
dates elsewhere during the letterboxing season (whatever THAT is).<br>
I seem to remember at least three events in MI this year in addition<br>
to the Great Lakes Gathering in June. I'm also recalling at least the<br>
same number in WI.<br>
So, like I said, I have mixed feelings. But I'd hate to see quickly<br>
scheduled events supplant some others which carry some history.<br>
<br>
This is an important discussion for our region.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My 2-cents:<br>
I really like the idea of a "set" location on a "set" date as the regional <br>
gathering.<br>
I like the idea of knowing where it will be and when so I can plan <br>
accordingly.<br>
I really, really enjoyed attending 2 state gatherings this year, in addition <br>
to my first Great Lakes gathering.  I wouldn't miss the regional gathering <br>
for anything!  Knowing when and where it will always be, would leave me open <br>
to picking and choosing the gatherings I might like to attend in other <br>
states.<br>
I also enjoy chance to meet with people that live all over the Great Lakes <br>
region.  While large gatherings don't necessarily scare me, I find it fairly <br>
difficult to hunt up boxes at larger gatherings, because I spend so much <br>
time talking to people I know and don't know.  This is an "OK" thing for me, <br>
because I can box anytime, so I make the most of meeting new people which is <br>
really fun for me.<br>
<br>
So, in short, my thoughts are that with a set Regional gathering (possibly <br>
larger) and other State specific gatherings (probably smaller) we may <br>
achieve the "best of both worlds" scenario with the "goer" choosing which <br>
gathering suits them best.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like the idea of having a set location and a set date.  I think this <br>
would allow people to make travel plans well in advance and also would <br>
help other event planners to avoid date conflicts, etc.  Back when the <br>
decision was made to move the GL Gathering around it was to make it <br>
accessible to everyone in the region, both in terms of attending and <br>
hosting, as it was the only gathering held in the upper midwest.  There <br>
are many other gatherings now and those options make this less of a <br>
consideration with the GL Gathering.<br>
<br>
WI Hiker raises a very good point...  If the gathering were to be at <br>
the exact same park every year, it might get a little boring.  Of <br>
course there are generally enough boxes sent in by attendees that there <br>
would always be enough new boxes to find on the day of the event <br>
itself, and there are continually new boxes being planted in all areas <br>
of the GL region, so travelers should be able to find new boxes along <br>
the way.  But, variety is nice and it may be more interesting to set <br>
the "location" to a specific geographic area with several parks rather <br>
than one specific park.  This would also be wise as having a set date <br>
may cause problems with shelter reservation if it were limited to a <br>
specific park.<br>
<br>
One other consideration...  When choosing a permanent location, I think <br>
that the immediate obvious consideration is the proximity to the <br>
majority of letterboxers in the region.  However, in my mind an even <br>
more important consideration is the availability of event hosts.  There <br>
needs to be a willing volunteer host nearby or willing to travel a bit <br>
to plant boxes.  I can't just say, okay this is the place where it is <br>
going to be every year and hope that somebody comes forward to host. <br>
<br>
Thinking this through a bit...<br>
