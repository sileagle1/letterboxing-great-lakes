                    <div class="plaintext-content">In light of my past experience at Boxacon, I've made a few improvements to my hiking stick.  First, I've added a longer leather strap which will allow me to sling it over my shoulder while stamping in, so I don't have to set it down and forget it.  Second, I've tied a red, white, and blue bandanna to it, in case I still set it down, so it is easier to see.  But just in case, as a third fail-safe, I'd really appreciate it if the Wormy Wanderers would follow a few hundred yards behind me whenever I'm on the trail.  Thanks in advance!<br>

Too funny fw!  We also would like to request that Sunnysideup follow behind Tiptoe in case those glasses of hers decide to take a flying leap into the woods!<br>
