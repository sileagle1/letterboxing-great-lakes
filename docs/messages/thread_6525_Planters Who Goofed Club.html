                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now, I do believe I can claim to be a member of the Planters Who Goofed Club - including that subgroup of planters who lost their own clues.  Between today and yesterday, I rewrote - but haven't listed yet - clues to two boxes - both of which were orignally planted last fall.  Thankfully, both were in good shape - whew.  Yes, I'll list them soon before I lose the clues or forget exactly what I meant when I wrote my notes.<br>
<br>
I am very happy to back online - oh how I missed having internet access.<br>
<br>
My backpack now sports three very brightly colored letterboxing patches - including the LbGLK patch!  :)  I haven't decided yet if I'll add some old patches from scout camp and that cool Budweiser tie.  They came from a cool jean jacket little me used to wear.  :)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently, we had a 'Planters Who Goofed' moment.<br>
<br>
We picked up our '2009-Bad Year' series on the 3rd....so, we had a BB in <br>
there (my excuse for poor counting), and I'm sure I counted all the <br>
boxes SEVERAL times while collecting them.  A week later, I'm making <br>
logbooks to turn them into HH's....'hhhmmm....were is the one from <br>
June'...'don't know, I thought you counted them all'...after quickly <br>
going through them in my head...I counted all the places we had hidden <br>
the boxes...but was one short.  So, after checking our clue...yep, sure <br>
enough, we had forgotten one.  Needless to say, we were out there again <br>
this past weekend to grab the last one!<br>
<br>
(sadly, this is the second time in two months we've forgotten where we <br>
hid stuff.....last month while doing maintenance we had to call my <br>
sister-in-law while out on the trail to look up and read us the clue.  <br>
She laughed and asked, 'Uh...are you guys trying to find one of your own <br>
boxes?!')<br>
