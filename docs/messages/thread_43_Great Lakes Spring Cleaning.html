trips to our states to box.  I encourage all letterboxers in this <br/>

checking on all of their boxes.  I think it is also extrememly <br/>
helpful to include in the clues at the begining when the box was <br/>
last checked and repaired so a person from out of state knows that a <br/>
box is truly "active".  (Or do it like I do on the page that lists <br/>
all of my boxes.)<br/>
<br/>
If you have boxes too far away for you to check by then, I'd suggest <br/>
that others in the area be asked to check on them for you.  This <br/>
might not take care of ALL of the great boxes we have in this area, <br/>
but it should tackle most of them.<br/>

such a neat box!  Maybe make it a series?  Please, please, oh pretty <br/>

our power was out most of the day, and since there is not much you <br/>
can do at home without power (except carve stamps), I figured I may <br/>
as well run out and replace Ghosts Below and replentish one of the <br/>
log books that I found down to only 3 remaining pages yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure I can manage to have all of my West Michigan boxes checked <br/>
by then, and also will do a day trip up to Traverse City to check on <br/>
mine and Esperanza's boxes there -- I can also check on the two 45th <br/>
Parallel boxes that Esperanza and Matt the Rat have in place in the <br/>
Traverse City area.<br/>
<br/>
I will not be able to check in on my U.P. boxes by then though.  I <br/>
am really hoping the gathering doesn't end up being on Memorial Day <br/>
Saturday because with the extra day, it would be the perfect time to <br/>
take a weekend trip to the U.P.  A regular weekend isn't really <br/>
enough time.<br/>
<br/>
Tom and Jill, I think you mentioned you would be heading up there <br/>
soon -- Easter weekend perhaps?  I'm sure you will be busy while up <br/>
there, but if you have the time and you could check on any of the <br/>
boxes along your route (mine or Esperanza's) I would really <br/>
appreciate it.  That would save me from having to do the U.S. 2 <br/>
boxes and I could just concentrate on the Lake Superior boxes when I <br/>
go.  Please don't go out of your way and if you don't end up having <br/>
a chance -- don't sweat it, I will get to them.<br/>
<br/>
So let's get out there and get our boxes in shape!<br/>

Regarding your decision to remove your boxes from JW Wells.....DId <br/>
the park administrator contact you? Or are you just getting a jump on <br/>
the impending regulations?<br/>
I have tentatively decided to pull my boxes from state land before <br/>
June and, where possible, relocate them.<br/>
I'm still considering all of the options.<br/>
