                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was going to propose this to just the WI crowd, but since it seems <br>
to be happening in MI too, I'll suggest it here.  <br>
<br>
With the weather getting better and vacations being planned, there <br>
might be some letterboxers from other parts of the country planning <br>
trips to our states to box.  I encourage all letterboxers in this <br>
area to set April 30 as a goal to complete spring cleaning and <br>
checking on all of their boxes.  I think it is also extrememly <br>
helpful to include in the clues at the begining when the box was <br>
last checked and repaired so a person from out of state knows that a <br>
box is truly "active".  (Or do it like I do on the page that lists <br>
all of my boxes.)<br>
<br>
If you have boxes too far away for you to check by then, I'd suggest <br>
that others in the area be asked to check on them for you.  This <br>
might not take care of ALL of the great boxes we have in this area, <br>
but it should tackle most of them.<br>
<br>
Oh! And Matt - please replace Chicago Underground please!  It is <br>
such a neat box!  Maybe make it a series?  Please, please, oh pretty <br>
please! ;-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dragon, I think this is a fabulous idea!  I was out again today -- <br>
our power was out most of the day, and since there is not much you <br>
can do at home without power (except carve stamps), I figured I may <br>
as well run out and replace Ghosts Below and replentish one of the <br>
log books that I found down to only 3 remaining pages yesterday.<br>
<br>
I'm sure I can manage to have all of my West Michigan boxes checked <br>
by then, and also will do a day trip up to Traverse City to check on <br>
mine and Esperanza's boxes there -- I can also check on the two 45th <br>
Parallel boxes that Esperanza and Matt the Rat have in place in the <br>
Traverse City area.<br>
<br>
I will not be able to check in on my U.P. boxes by then though.  I <br>
am really hoping the gathering doesn't end up being on Memorial Day <br>
Saturday because with the extra day, it would be the perfect time to <br>
take a weekend trip to the U.P.  A regular weekend isn't really <br>
enough time.<br>
<br>
Tom and Jill, I think you mentioned you would be heading up there <br>
soon -- Easter weekend perhaps?  I'm sure you will be busy while up <br>
there, but if you have the time and you could check on any of the <br>
boxes along your route (mine or Esperanza's) I would really <br>
appreciate it.  That would save me from having to do the U.S. 2 <br>
boxes and I could just concentrate on the Lake Superior boxes when I <br>
go.  Please don't go out of your way and if you don't end up having <br>
a chance -- don't sweat it, I will get to them.<br>
<br>
So let's get out there and get our boxes in shape!<br>

We're also planning to remove our 3 boxes at J.W.Wells State Park along<br>
Green Bay.  The park administrator has offered to let us make them into<br>
"virtual caches," in which finders hunt for some existing place in the<br>
park, but there is no physical box to find there.  She would keep the<br>
stamps at the campground office, open any day between 7am and 9pm, so<br>
people could stop by after the "hunt" and stamp in.  We may take her up<br>
on that offer with at least 1 of the boxes, mainly because we're curious<br>
to see how it might work out.  This will require us to fill out the<br>
usage permit, but no charge.  <br>

Regarding your decision to remove your boxes from JW Wells.....DId <br>
the park administrator contact you? Or are you just getting a jump on <br>
the impending regulations?<br>
I have tentatively decided to pull my boxes from state land before <br>
June and, where possible, relocate them.<br>
I'm still considering all of the options.<br>
