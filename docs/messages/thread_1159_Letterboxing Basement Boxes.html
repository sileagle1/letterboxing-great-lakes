Back when the letterboxing.org site was converted from the old site <br/>
to the new site about 2 years ago, everyone was asked to move the <br/>
clues to their boxes over to the new site.  Boxes that were not <br/>
moved over were put up for adoption and after a period of time, <br/>
boxes that were not adopted were put into storage in the <br/>
letterboxing basement.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the boxes that ended up in the basement were those that had <br/>
been placed by somebody who left the hobby and didn't remove the <br/>
clues to their boxes from letterboxing.org.  In many cases nobody <br/>
was interested in adopting a box simply because nobody was near the <br/>
location it was planted.  Some of the boxes may be still active, <br/>
others are no doubt missing.<br/>
<br/>
There is a current effort underway to clean some of these boxes out <br/>
of the basement -- remember, an abandoned letterbox is litter.  <br/>
There are a lot of new letterboxers in the past couple of year and <br/>
there is a good chance that some of these abandoned boxes may be <br/>
conveniently located to one of them.  <br/>
<br/>
Please take a minute to check out the letterboxing basement and see <br/>
if there are any boxes that you may be able to check on or adopt.  <br/>
If you check on a box or are interested in adopting one, please <br/>
notify the basement list owners so that it can be removed from the <br/>
basement.<br/>

I was going to look for Ohio Fossil in West Lafayette later this spring.  I will try to get it out <br/>
of the basement, unless Armadillo Jo gets there before me!<br/>
