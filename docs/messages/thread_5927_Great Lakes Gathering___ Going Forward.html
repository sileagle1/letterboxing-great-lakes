                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would be very sad if the GLG stopped happening.  Personally, I don't think<br>
it is too big or that it compares to the more local or state events.  For<br>
one thing, there's a larger selection of boxers so that you meet new people<br>
each time and see familiar faces, both of which are enjoyable.  Also, it's<br>
good incentive to get out of your local state and do some boxing - who<br>
doesn't like that?  My naive opinion, having never hosted one of these, is<br>
that the size is manageable.  Are the attendees ever all in one place at one<br>
time?  Even at lunchtime we have ebb and flow as people come off the trails<br>
late (like KG, FD, and I did) or leave to hit the trails while others are<br>
still eating.<br>
<br>
As for the details - I think both the rotation and having an established<br>
date are great planning tools.  In fact, Kimono Girl and I were talking<br>
about the wheres and whether or not we will make the next few GLGs.<br>
Personally, I have no preference for the actual date - this one works fine<br>
but so would just about anything else from May to mid-August.<br>

<br>
...the state rotation is good, for reasons previously mentioned.<br>
<br>
...while state and other small events are fun, the "big gathering" should stay. And funny that everyone talks about the size of the event being so big...while numbers obviously don't lie, it didn't seem that big to me. At other events it seems you were always running into large clusters of people at the various boxes, to the point where it became more of a pass the word where the box should be hidden to the next group, who would do the same for the next, rather than actually finding and hiding the boxes. Maybe it was because Speedsquare did anice job of spacing them a good distance apart, but it didn't seem as crowded as usual.<br>
<br>
...I would be in favor of avoiding the graduation/Memorial Day crunch. While my kid has passed the HS graduation milestone andcollege is a few years away, it still is an awfully busy time of year. Not that I can suggest a better time, however, though the fall events are always nice, so maybe we can push it to the other end of the season.<br>
<br>
And that's all I have to say about that!<br>
