getting us fired up about the hobby, since he planted so many <br>

We hope you all are still enjoying the holidays and that you get a <br>
chance to get out to do some boxing (or stay in to do some carving) <br>
as this year ends and the next one starts!<br>

<br>
Thank you so much for being out there and hiding all of those little <br>
boxes for the rest of us. As a newbie to boxing I really feel honored <br>
now to have found several of you Door County Boxes and your Adoptees <br>
up there. <br>
<br>
I just started letterboxing this past September on our annual trip to <br>
Door County and your boxes accounted for over half of the boxes that <br>
we found while we were up there. Your Sherwood Point Box was our <br>
first attempted box. Unfortunately due to the trickiness' of the <br>
clues at least for a beginner (getting dj vu, finding the correct <br>
trail sign, and sighting the reverse azimuth of B) it ended up being <br>
our second find. Our first box was the Door County Tradition by <br>
Wisconsin Hiker. (I know that he will be proud after reading this). <br>
His was on the same trail as yours and was an easier find. But we <br>
didn't give up. So yours are officially our 2nd, 3rd, 4th boxes that <br>
one being The Cave Point Box which I have since read is one of the <br>
oldest box in WI which really makes that one special. Then you were <br>
our 7th box the Mink River Box, which by far was the most challenging <br>
of my finds and therefore another notable one. Last but not least you <br>
get credit for our 10th, 11th and finally our 12th the Sturgeon Bay <br>
Shipping Bay Canal Box that we just had to grab on our way out of <br>
town. I just couldn't get enough of that stamping stuff.<br>
<br>
So please keep on hiding them and we'll all keep on looking for them.<br>
<br>
Congratulations again on your achievement.<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We want to congratulate Dragon on this honor as well...After all, he was the very first <br>
letterboxer we ever contacted!  He talked us into going to our first gathering and <br>
reassured us it wasn't a cult!...(We weren't all that sure when the first letterboxer we ever <br>
met face to face was Mrs. Doglver!)  He also provided us with our very favorite box <br>
ever..."Mo Mustangs"..and what can we say about all of the Faire boxes...When we first <br>
heard about letterboxing, we recall the only prolific planters in our region were Spring <br>
Chick in MI, Fransolo in Ohio, and Dragon in WI...My how things have grown!<br>
Congratulations, Dragon, we hope you can find more time to letterbox in the New Year!<br>
