Which brings me to the earlier question about GLG 2009.  It's time for INDIANA to host <br/>
one.  I've been looking and looking for a spot that will accommodate, more or less, 150 <br/>
folks.  And if I'm going to be super involved in planning, I would need to make the <br/>
location convenient for me to visit several times before the big day.  Pokagon State Park <br/>
really has the best facilities and location for Great Lakes Folks.<br/>
<br/>
The shelters could not be reserved until today.  There are 2 shelters that accommodate <br/>
150 and one of them was already booked when I went online.  I was lucky and made the <br/>
reservation for the other large shelter.  If this location is not picked for the event by the <br/>
Great Lakes group, I will only be out $30.<br/>
<br/>
I will need some help organizing this event!  I would like to make a website (learn <br/>
something new this year beyond my own blog) and get others to handle various aspects.  <br/>
My folks have a summer home nearby the park where I could host a planning party any <br/>
time after Labor Day.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I have not stepped on any toes by getting an early start for May 30, 2009.  I was <br/>
afraid to wait another day to make a reservation.  If anyone else has planned and paid for <br/>
another location, I will happily step aside.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to keep any more details under wraps until a small committee is formed.  If <br/>
you think you want to help, please contact me off-list.<br/>
<br/>
I need to log off now.  The tornado warning sirens just began.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day in Minnesota!<br/>

SpringChick, can you let us know if this is a "go"?  If so, we can reserve some lodging within the park.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Hey pugs, you may want to check out some of the info in the Photos, <br/>
Files and Links sections of this message board.  You can see a lot of <br/>
past history of the annual Great Lakes events.  However here's the <br/>
short answer:<br/>
<br/>
2003 - Michigan<br/>
2004 - Illinois<br/>
2005 - Michigan<br/>
2006 - Wisconsin<br/>
2007 - Ohio<br/>
2008 - Minnesota<br/>
2009 - Indiana????<br/>
<br/>
However you can plan an event for whenever you want.  We hosted one in <br/>
the fall of 2005 called "Haunted Harvest" in the Milwaukee area.  There <br/>
have been numerous other events in IL, WI, MI, OH, etc at various times <br/>
of the year.<br/>
