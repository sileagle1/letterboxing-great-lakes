Yes, I too would like to know who's in charge of the weather around here.  I <br>

I feel your pain Trail Rider! I'm just north of you in Janesville, and <br>
we have 5-8 coming our way. YUCK!! I, like Coffee Beans, am having <br>
major letterboxing withdrawals. Some of my kids don't like to be out in <br>
the cold, so we haven't been boxing since November. Man, I am SO ready <br>
for spring  =)<br>

Yep, we're supposedly going to get hit with another 8"-13" tonight/tomorrow.  With this freaky weather though, maybe it will all melt by the time FEB 16 rolls around.  We had a record high of 63 degrees on JAN 7, but that was followed by several "below zero" days later in the month.  Yesterday we had rain, tomorrow probably lots of snow.  Unfortunately, there is still a LOT of winter left...<br>

Oh, that would be so nice if it did  =)  I have not signed up for SILO <br>
II yet because I'm waiting to see what the weather will be like. If <br>
it's as bad as it has been lately then I'm definitely not making the <br>
trek down there. Born and raised in WI and yet I can't stand driving in <br>
the snow...go figure!<br>
