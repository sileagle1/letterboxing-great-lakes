What a fantastic time we had today meeting new friends and hugging old ones!!!<br>
As always SpringChick and Azobox pulled out all the stops -- you guys ROCK!<br>
<br>
This Michigan Fall gathering has become my most favorite one to attend, and I found myself <br>
eagerly anticipating today...what a FUN time!!<br>
<br>
Thanks again -- and to those who couldn't make it, we missed you....and I'm sorry to say, <br>
you really missed out.  Be sure to clear the date for next year!!<br>
<br>
Can't wait to get back over there and hunt up the rest...maybe when my feet recover.<br>

THANKS to everyone who came out for the MI Fall Gathering and to<br>
everyone who contributed excellent boxes and time and food to make<br>
this year's fall gathering one of the best yet!!!  It was so great to<br>
see old friends -- has it really been a year already?!?  And just as<br>
good to meet new letterboxers from near and far -- we truly enjoyed<br>
chatting with all of you and all the wonderful trail stories we heard.<br>
<br>
The boxes that were planted for the event are intended to be permanent<br>
at Pigeon Creek Park and the clues will remain in the files section<br>
here at this list.  I will be uploading a new version of clues<br>
tomorrow with a few corrections (what kind of a trail map puts north<br>
on the bottom anyway?)<br>
<br>
Again thanks to everyone!  I am exhausted but it is a good kind of tired!<br>

Many thanks to SpringChick and Azobox for organizing yet another <br>
great event! We enjoyed meeting up with old friends and new. The <br>
boxes were wonderful ~ so many talented carvers contributed that we <br>
can't decide which one is our fave. And knowing that these boxes will <br>
be kept in the park gives us all the more reason to head back to the <br>
west side of the state to pick up the boxes we didn't have a chance <br>
to get!<br>
