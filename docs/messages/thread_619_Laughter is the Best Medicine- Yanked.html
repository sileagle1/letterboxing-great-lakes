My mystery box- Laughter is the Best Medicine, has been yanked for many reasons, the biggest one being that I finally caved into the pleading of my better half, who begged me not to subject someone to that locale.  On a box check we took yesterday, the sordid nature of the litter finally convinced me.  Somehow, the combination of baby diaper, empty champagne bottle, and Trojan wrappers created a vivid, and horrible, mental picture.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, congrats to SEALPOINT, who was the only person who'd even found the box!<br/>
<br/>
Will update when he's up and running again,<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
