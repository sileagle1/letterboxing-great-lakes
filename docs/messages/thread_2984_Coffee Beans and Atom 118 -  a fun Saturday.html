I haven't found the Hollywood Blockbusters yet but I have the clue sheet printed, so it's on my list!  I found one of Cherokee Rose 2's HHs too.  I'm home today and I want to go letterboxing, but not alone.  There's always the possibility of meeting up with a three-eyed ax murderer!  <br>

  Subject: [LbGLK] a fun Saturday<br>
<br>
<br>
  We had a very successful day of letterboxing on Saturday and just had to <br>
  post a big "WOW" for the people whose boxes we found. We were up along <br>
  the Des Plaines River Trail in northern IL to find boxes by <br>
  CinemaBoxers, Cherokee Rose2 & Hawkeye, and Beetle. We thoroughly <br>
  enjoyed the "Trip Across America" boxes 1-10 by CR&H -- very fun to see <br>
  what images were chosen to signify each state. We look forward to the <br>
  remaining states and are betting amongst each other as to which ones <br>
  will be next. ;) And for being new to letterboxing, CB have carved some <br>
  amazing Hollywood-themed stamps. We enjoyed the new "Hollywood <br>
  Blockbusters" series (which we happily report being FF on) and are great <br>
  fans of Harry Potter too. I personally think Johnny Depp is a bit <br>
  scary, but apparently CB are big fans and did a fine job with those <br>
  stamps as well. :) We ended the day with a couple of boxes by Beetle, <br>
  thankfully surviving a visit to the three-eyed ax murderer and avoiding <br>
  the cops at the site of the Rondout train robbery. Unfortunately it <br>
  grew dark by this time, and we weren't able to visit the Fatman without <br>
  causing all his friends to wonder what was going on with the flashlight <br>
  party around back, so we will have to visit him another time.<br>
<br>
  All in all, after about 8hrs of boxing and 10-11 miles of hiking, we <br>
  managed 21 boxes for the day. :) Thanks for the fun!<br>
