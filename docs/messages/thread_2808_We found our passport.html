<br>
And, speaking of finding the boxes before the end of September...  just a <br>
reminder to anyone else who was thinking about doing the 80 Days series --  <br>
we will not be maintaining the boxes after September 30, 2006.  We are not <br>
planning to pick them up, but if one goes missing, it will not be replaced. <br>
After September, as long as all of the boxes are still in place, anyone who <br>
finds all 15 of them is still eligible for the World Traveler Bonus Stamp <br>
(and also the Around the World in 80 Days bonus if they are found within 80 <br>
days), but if a box is missing and you are not able to get all 15 because of <br>
this, the bonus stamps will not be available.<br>
<br>
As one of the locations closes for the season at the end of September, if <br>
you want to ensure yourself as much time as possible while the boxes are <br>
still being maintained, you should request a passport soon as there are only <br>
about 72 days left before the end of September.<br>
