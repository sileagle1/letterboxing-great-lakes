                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I saw SpringChick's announcement about re-running Letterboxing<br>
BINGO, I again wondered how long the game might go. Last year we were<br>
all a bit surprised that it lasted until mid-summer. <br>
Okay, okay, it only lasted 'til mid-summer for *some* of us. <g><br>
<br>
So anyway,  how long might it take for your BINGO card to fill? Or,<br>
more specifically, for *anyone's* card to fill?<br>
Now, I'm talking about the Big Game here, not the four interim games.<br>
<br>
Maybe early to mid-February? How about March? Could be April or even<br>
May. Who knows?<br>
<br>
If you'd again like to add some excitement to the Letterboxing Bingo<br>
game, enter the Side-Wagers Game.<br>
Email me the date you think the game will end. In other words, when<br>
will she pull the item that finally and completely fills in some<br>
player's card?<br>
Again, I'm talking about the Big Game here, not the four interim games.<br>
The date will be determined by the claiming of a successful card by a<br>
BINGO player (and its certification by SpringChick).<br>
<br>
I must have your guess before January 1, 2007.<br>
Mail to jparkerg at Yahoo dot com<br>
(my usual address for this group)<br>
In the subject line, put "Bingo".<br>
<br>
I'll award the winner's prize to the person who comes closest to the<br>
actual day or is closest before the day the Bingo Game ends. If you<br>
choose February 15th, for example, and someone else chooses the 20th,<br>
and the game ends on the 19th, you win. In other words, you'll hold<br>
all of the days until the next guesser hits the calendar. But you<br>
don't know who has chosen which days or how far apart they've fallen<br>
(and neither does SC!).<br>
<br>
Last year there were a couple of players who chose identical dates. I<br>
accepted the first one I received (and offered another shot to the one<br>
who'd doubled up on the date.)<br>
This time around, I will assign the another available date to anyone<br>
who chooses a date already taken. I'll do this by moving out in the<br>
calendar until I find a date between your choice and the next one chosen.<br>
So, if you choose Feb 20 and it's already taken, and I look and see<br>
that the next date chosen is the 24th, I'll assign you the 22nd. If<br>
there is another player already on the adjacent date and it is not<br>
available, I'll move you to the next available date.<br>
I anticipate a few more players this time and since I *do* have a life<br>
besides shepherding the BINGO Side-Wagers game, let's just say that<br>
I'll do my best to keep you informed if I need to alter your chosen<br>
Side-Wagers date.<br>
<br>
I'll select a prize for the lucky winner.<br>
You do not need to be a player in the big game to participate.<br>
<br>
<br>
For more about SpringChick's game, check the files section of our<br>
Great Lakes Letterboxing Group. Go towards the bottom of<br>
the files list.<br>
The word list, the grid and the rules are included.<br>
There is still time to get into the game(s).<br>

<br>
Good luck,<br>
