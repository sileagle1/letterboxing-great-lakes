So how many of the rest of you got the email asking to participate in<br>
an article about Letterboxing in the Grand Rapids area?<br>
<br>
Still haven't decided what my response is going to be. I'm torn ...<br>
wanting to stress the important aspects of boxing and understanding<br>
that the Editor has ultimate control of which parts ever see print. I<br>
have a concern that our priorities may not be the same. <br>

Haven't been contacted yet, but then I haven't checked m y mail.  As<br>
other LBers have said, either you give them the information that you<br>
think is important or they'll get mis-information from somewhere else.<br>
 Better to err on the side of caution...<br>

just contacted by our local paper (Champaign-Urbana, IL) about doing an<br>
article on letterboxing, too!  I'm going to do the interview, but only<br>
because I know and trust the reporter who's writing the article.  It's<br>
kind of funny - I've known her for years because our dogs play together,<br>
and she got my name from a friend of hers who emailed me about one of my<br>
boxes (it's missing, again).  The article will be published sometime this <br>
month, so I will let you know how it goes.  I'm hoping that it will get<br>
more people in the area interested in boxing and I can collect more<br>
stamps in my logbooks...<br>

We have enjoyed boxing in Grand Rapids (Richard is from there,<br>
although we're both in Chicago now) and are looking forward to<br>
squeezing in another day on our next visit in March. I hope the<br>
interviews go well and that this won't result in too many boxes going<br>
missing or areas getting damaged from too many people. <br>
