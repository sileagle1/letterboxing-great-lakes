I just wanted to post that my Holy Grail exchange box was mailed out to <br/>
it's secret recipient on Saturday afternoon.  I know I'm a month early <br/>
but I had the box done so I figured I would get it out there.  Can't <br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I received the box I am hiding for the exchange.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to get opinons.<br/>
<br/>
How hard should the hide be.  Are these boxes supposed to be<br/>
challenging, easy, doesn't matter?  How obscure should the clues be or<br/>
should they be straightforward?  How out of the way should the<br/>
location be?<br/>
<br/>
I am assuming that all of these are up to the huder, but since this<br/>
was my first exchange, I didn't want to end up doing a hide that is<br/>
not in the spirit of the program.<br/>
<br/>
So the question is what are you all expecting?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The difficulty of the hide and the clues is entirely up to you.  I think the only solid rule about it is that it can't be a complete mystery box (you have to at least list the state and county, and I think the city too).  Dragon created a website that has all the info about the exchange (there's also a word document in the files section of this group with that info) but I promptly forgot to write it down when it was posted and I have since deleted that post.  The only thing I have to add to this is that, since someone else's hard work went into making the box you're going to hide, you should try to find the very best hiding spot you can.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here are the parts of the "rules" pertaining to the Grail Exchange<br/>
hiding question raised recently:<br/>
<br/>
6)   Boxes must be planted in traditional letterbox style  they  <br/>
cannot be turned into Postal Letterboxes and should involve at least a<br/>
modest hike (at least a 1/4 mile). <br/>
<br/>
7)   Clues can be any style, but to ensure that nobody's efforts just<br/>
lay in hiding, never again to be found, they should not be total<br/>
mystery boxes -- clues should give at minimum a city and site name.<br/>
Beyond that, creativity and conundrum are encouraged. <br/>
<br/>
8)   Dragon will create a website to encompass the entire project,<br/>
which will include the clues to boxes.  Once you have the clues ready,<br/>
send them to him via email and he will post them. <br/>
<br/>
9)   For this project, boxes must be placed in the Great Lakes States,<br/>
but any member of the group may participate.   <br/>
<br/>
In particular, note in #8 that once you have the clues ready, you<br/>
should send them to ME. Do not post them on the LBNA site.  One reason<br/>
for this is rule #11:<br/>
<br/>
11) For this series, we'll try to keep everything a secret from each<br/>
other as possible.  Do not tell what you are making, what you are<br/>
hiding, and where you have hidden it.  This would also mean that the<br/>
exchanging of "Holy Grail" clues is forbidden! (This last sentence is<br/>
refering to the coded clues to the Holy Grail box.)<br/>
