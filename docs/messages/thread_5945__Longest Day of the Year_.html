                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, it's been so quiet here that everyone MUST have been out boxing!  We had a very nice time in Green Bay.  There is a new letterboxer in that area called AtHomeDad that has planted some very nice boxes.  It is quite unusual for a new boxer to put out such high quality boxes (we certainly had a much longer learning curve on our carving and placements).  Excellent carvings, good placements, double-baggies in camo boxes, etc. <br>
<br>
We also found some very amusing Pugnasties boxes.  Check out the Boxers n' Briefs series if you are in the area.  <br>
<br>
During our hunts we had a chance to visit many different parks, view Lake Michigan, a waterfall, follow along a river AND visit a custard stand!<br>
<br>
We saw that CherokeeRose2 and Hawkeye were also in the area - they had stamped into several boxes we found on the same day.  Too bad we missed actually seeing them in person!<br>
<br>
Hope you all had a good weekend (and a Happy Father's Day)!<br>
