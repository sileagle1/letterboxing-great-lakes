kids find the boxes and decipher the clues. As always, spot the box<br/>
first and rehide exactly as before. We found one box recently that was<br/>
not exactly where it was said to be (it was inside the dead tree<br/>
instead of in the sticks at the bottom). This frustrated my kids to no<br/>
end. Upon further looking, we found it. My wife and I never ever let<br/>
the kids rehide the box and we always remind them not to destroy the<br/>
locale in any way. But...I stick behind what I posted earlier. Let the<br/>
kids find the box, even if you found it first.<br/>
