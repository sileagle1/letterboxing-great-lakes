versitile!  It can be a bush or ivy, stand alone or have a host and <br>
take several different forms.  What also makes it great is that the <br>
leaves have many different shapes and colors, which makes it SOOOO <br>
easy to identify!  What is probably the absolute best thing about <br>
poison ivy is that the chemical that causes the rash is found on all <br>
parts of the plant, not just the leaves so even touching the stems <br>
or "trunk" in the winter will give you a rash (don't ask how I <br>
know).  I LOVE this wonderful plant!! (Hmmm... could this be <br>
sarcasm?) It gets even better if someone were to burn it with other <br>
brush and leaves... how do you scratch an itch in your throat and <br>
lungs??<br>
<br>
Here is a site with many pictures of poison ivy, oak and sumac...<br>
<br>
http://poisonivy.aesir.com/view/pictures.html<br>
<br>
as a bonus they have rash pictures as well.<br>
<br>
I have dropped a line to my sister in CT about some poison ivy wipes <br>
that they found and bring with them on ALL letterboxing excursions. <br>
When I get that info I will pass it along.<br>
