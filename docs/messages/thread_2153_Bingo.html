                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been reading with interest the Bingo thread on choosing the free <br>
space. When our family was deciding what to choose, I initially <br>
suggested one of the corner spots. My children wanted other spaces on <br>
the board because they liked the words. After some discussion, we <br>
decided that whatever Spring Chick chooses next is random anyway, and <br>
if what we choose is picked next, then we get no advantage over others <br>
(like those who picked "Exchange.") So in the end, we picked "The <br>
Raven." It is the only letterbox on the list that we found.  We <br>
decided that we would be rather disappointed if, at the end of the <br>
game, that particular item hadn't been chosen. It's not in a <br>
particulary strategic spot on our board, yet when "Exchange" was <br>
chosen, it gave us 3 in a row. (We haven't had any since, however.)  <br>
Our choice wasn't entirely random, yet it wasn't strategic, either.<br>
<br>
By the way, the couple of times I have been in a bingo parlor, I've <br>
noticed that those who have some system, or some logical way of <br>
playing, don't seem to win any more often than those who rely purely <br>
on chance.<br>

That is one of my favorite letterboxes! We called to get a rate on that <br>
room and they quoted 450.00 a night. A little steep for my budget. <br>
Awesome stamp, though!<br>

Yikes! I had no idea those rooms would cost that much. It is a cool <br>
area, though. I agree, the stamp was awesome. It's also a special <br>
letterbox for us, since we were first finders.  We're rarely first <br>
finders. The placers did give us a heads up on it, though. They told <br>
us they had just placed it when we met them at the MI Spring Fling <br>
(our first gathering, too).  We rushed over there to find it so we <br>
could be first.<br>

Nothing in the "B" column for me either!  Martini Man has one, but <br>
that is because he chose it as his "Free Space". <br>

Well, the rules & files for the previous year used to be in the Files <br>
section of this message board.  However it looks like Springchick has <br>
removed them in anticipation of posting the new files for this year. <br>
<br>
I'm sure she'll post something when they are available.<br>

What does it say about how addicted to letterboxing we are if I tell you that we already bought 3 things to go to 2011's bingo bootie. And we don't even have 2010's stuff yet. We are so addicted. I can carve the stamp for the support group meeting, just tell us when and were. <br>

The actual post that Fo6 made, said it was an "N" word. He probably just<br>

<br>
I have it listed as a word from the N column.<br>
<br>
Other than the full card, the active games are the postage stamp, <br>
perimeter and X.<br>
<br>
I'm doing pretty good on the perimeter and now have an "anti" postage <br>
stamp! Meaning the two squares to the left and two beneath are <br>
filled in, but none of the 4 squares needed for the postage stamp <br>
have been called. Can we make that a game? LOL<br>
