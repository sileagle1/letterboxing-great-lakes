huge crying scene.<br>
<br>
Did anyone else crack up when Chloe was talking to Edgar about blowing that <br>
guy away and he mentioned that perhaps she wasn't upset about it because she <br>
might have a delayed reaction later?  It's like those two are such techies, they <br>
have no sense of reality.  I'm dying to know what they are like in person.  I <br>
bet at least one of them doesn't even own a PC!<br>
