The Dells of course has MANY, MANY attractions.  Since it is Easter time,<br/>
you might not find many discounts, but there are a ton of great hotels<br/>
w/indoor water parks in the Dells.  We've been to several over the years<br/>
with our extended family.  You could always call to see if they have any<br/>
last minute discounts if they aren't full.  Wilderness is where we've been<br/>
most often, but also Chula Vista.  Kalahari also looks great.  Normally you<br/>
could get a better deal if you went during the week, but since this is<br/>
Easter break, that might not be the case.<br/>

suggest doing the Ice Age Trail Series by VBP. They are great stamps and not<br/>
too difficult of a hike.  OLJ and myself did them completely in the dark :)<br/>
