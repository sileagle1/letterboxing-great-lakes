summer, but a DIFFERENT Oz in Wisconsin!  Even though no letterboxes are<br>
listed on the official event site, there ARE several letterboxes in the<br>
various parks/preserves listed on their website.  (Maybe TJMich & myself<br>
might be able to create a list of the existing ones, or maybe some of us<br>
could even PLANT a few new ones in honor of the community event...)<br>

I'm forwarding this message because I thought it might be of interest to<br>
some of you, especially if you will be in the Milwaukee area on Saturday<br>
July 24.<br>

Dear Deborah:<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We would like to invite you to participate in the Treasures of Oz adventure<br>
and celebration on July 24th.  This is a FREE, family-friendly event that<br>
will appeal to anyone who loves the environment, likes photography, bird<br>
watching, biking, hiking or geocaching.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Nine preserves in Ozaukee County will be offering an open house from 9 a.m.<br>
until 3 p.m. with some docents and volunteers to show you around and tell<br>
you about the site.  Our celebration at Forest Beach Migratory Preserve<br>
(formerly the Squires Golf Course) begins at 1 p.m. and goes until 5 p.m.<br>
with music, food, exhibits and a silent auction.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Get all the details, passport, map and directions at the website:<br>
http://www.treasuresofoz.org <http://www.treasuresofoz.org/> .  Download a<br>
passport and get it stamped at any of the sites you visit.  You will be able<br>
to have your stamps checked off and get raffle tickets for certificates from<br>
local merchants and restaurants.  Bikers and geocachers have opportunities<br>
for additional stamps.  The raffle happens after the event and winners will<br>
be notified by email or phone.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We are advertising by email and word-of-mouth, so please forward this freely<br>
