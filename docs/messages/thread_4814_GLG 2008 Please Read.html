On a quick side note before the list, Red Cat, M.C.<br/>
Bear and myself got together a few weeks ago to talk<br/>
about the gathering and brainstorm on what we could to<br/>
make things fun, new, and exciting. I wish I could<br/>
divulge some of the things here right now, but I<br/>
cannot, some things are better left as a surprise. But<br/>
I will say this, there are several things I have never<br/>
seen or heard of at a gathering and I hope/know you<br/>
will all find them fun and different.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see a great number of you in May. I look<br/>
forward to seeing old friends I've only net once, and<br/>
many new ones. I hope this list isn't too long for<br/>
you. Enjoy!<br/>

I like it...I don't know much about MN, but a state-themed stamp is a great way to learn new and interesting things.  Unfortunately I think the biggest obstacle might be distance.  With gas prices what they are it makes it more difficult for some people who don't have previous commitments to get there.  Flying Dragon and I would dearly love to come (the park sounds truly awesome and like you we look forward to meeting friends both old and new), but we won't know until much closer to the date if we can swing it financially (and not just because of gas prices).  We've had a lot of major changes in our lives over the past year and a LOT of uncertainty...we don't even know for sure what will be happening the next few months.<br/>

That few have signed up at this point is NOT surprizing.  Having run a <br/>
number of gatherings, this is not unusual.  The sign-ups come in bursts.<br/>
<br/>
That aside, as a previous host, I would encourage those of you who know <br/>
you will be going to sign up today so the host do start to get a better <br/>
idea of the number of people coming.  It is a great help to them.<br/>

As for me, I am pretty sure I'll make it, but I probably won't know <br/>
until that week due to school stuff.<br/>

<br/>
As for the gathering, I would have to agree with Kimono Girl, distance is likely keeping some people away or at least from committing early.  It would be a similar situation if we were to hold a gathering in the MI U.P. or the eastern edge of Ohio, etc.  One thing to consider, and you guys may have already thought of this, but just because it is the Great Lakes Gathering, does not limit it to Great Lakes area folks.  Since MN is on the edge of other regions, perhaps there are boxers in IA or even the Dakotas who may be interested in coming.  I haven't kept up with other areas enough to know how regular gatherings in those areas are, but I know there were a lot of G.L. folks who attended a gathering in IA last year.<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I would love to come, but as with last year, the job I am currently in requires weekends beginning in late May through the summer.  The pay-off if well worth it to me, but unfortunately it keeps me from a lot of other fun weekend activities.<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, a smaller gathering is not necessarily a bad thing.  The first couple of years, the G.L. gathering was around 50 people, give or take a few.  There were plenty of awesome boxes and we all had a great time.  Because there were fewer people and boxes, there was actually time to chat with everyone and find all of the boxes.  May not win an award for the most awesome *mega gathering* but there is nothing wrong with that.  It comes down to the place and the people who are there.<br/>

I'm way ahead of you on the other states thing. I've<br/>
already emailed everyone in Manitoba, Ontario, North<br/>
Dakota, South Dakota, and  Nebraska. I will be sending<br/>
out invites to the entire Great Lakes States as well<br/>
as Iowa, Missouri, and Kentucky. I figure that there<br/>
are alot of people who aren't a part of our Yahoo<br/>
group here who would be interested in attending.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very sorry to hear you will not be able to attend<br/>
this year. It was nice to meet you in Delafield and<br/>
I'm sure I'll see you sometime, somewhere in the<br/>
future.<br/>

"May not<br/>
&gt; win an award for the most awesome *mega gathering*<br/>
&gt; but there is nothing wrong with that.  It comes down<br/>
&gt; to the place and the people who are there."<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with you.<br/>
I would think that everyone who hosts/organizes a<br/>
gathering of this size wants alot of people to come to<br/>
share in the excitement and fun. I love to throw<br/>
parties, it's so much fun to entertain people and plan<br/>
a good time for everyone. <br/>
<br/>
I truly understand that many factors influence peoples<br/>
decisions on whether or not they can make it. Take me<br/>
for example, I didn't make the Ohio gathering last<br/>
year due to money. I even had my campsite reserved and<br/>
paid for but had to back out a couple weeks before the<br/>
gathering due to finances. I was REALLY bummed out.<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the list of ideas!  I'm sure it will be<br/>
&gt; very helpful and was very thoughtful of you for<br/>
&gt; those who are not so familiar with MN.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the gathering, I would have to agree with<br/>
&gt; Kimono Girl, distance is likely keeping some people<br/>
&gt; away or at least from committing early.  It would be<br/>
&gt; a similar situation if we were to hold a gathering<br/>
&gt; in the MI U.P. or the eastern edge of Ohio, etc. <br/>
&gt; One thing to consider, and you guys may have already<br/>
&gt; thought of this, but just because it is the Great<br/>
&gt; Lakes Gathering, does not limit it to Great Lakes<br/>
&gt; area folks.  Since MN is on the edge of other<br/>
&gt; regions, perhaps there are boxers in IA or even the<br/>
&gt; Dakotas who may be interested in coming.  I haven't<br/>
&gt; kept up with other areas enough to know how regular<br/>
&gt; gatherings in those areas are, but I know there were<br/>
&gt; a lot of G.L. folks who attended a gathering in IA<br/>
&gt; last year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for me, I would love to come, but as with last<br/>
&gt; year, the job I am currently in requires weekends<br/>
&gt; beginning in late May through the summer.  The<br/>
&gt; pay-off if well worth it to me, but unfortunately it<br/>
&gt; keeps me from a lot of other fun weekend activities.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On a positive note, a smaller gathering is not<br/>
&gt; necessarily a bad thing.  The first couple of years,<br/>
&gt; the G.L. gathering was around 50 people, give or<br/>
&gt; take a few.  There were plenty of awesome boxes and<br/>
&gt; we all had a great time.  Because there were fewer<br/>
&gt; people and boxes, there was actually time to chat<br/>
&gt; with everyone and find all of the boxes.  May not<br/>
&gt; win an award for the most awesome *mega gathering*<br/>
&gt; but there is nothing wrong with that.  It comes down<br/>
&gt; to the place and the people who are there.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Hello everyone! The nice weather we've been having<br/>
&gt;   lately and the late nights of carving have me VERY<br/>
&gt;   excited for this years GLG. I've noticed that<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt;   hasn't been alot of registrations for the event<br/>
&gt; thus<br/>
&gt;   far. That got me thinking about why. Obviously<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt;   won't be able to make it due to prior commitments,<br/>
&gt;   etc. I also thought that maybe some people weren't<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt;   excited about the theme this year as they were<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt;   others in the past, maybe I'm wrong. I know that<br/>
&gt; if<br/>
&gt;   the event was in (insert state here) and it was<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt;   all things related to that state I might have a<br/>
&gt; hard<br/>
&gt;   time coming up with ideas for stamps and/or<br/>
&gt; getting<br/>
&gt;   excited about it. This is just my opinion, yours<br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt;   differ. If however, you need ideas for stamps<br/>
&gt; and/or<br/>
&gt;   need a little something to spark you're interest<br/>
&gt;   please take a look at the huge list of ideas that<br/>
&gt;   follow. I tried to think outside the box and find<br/>
&gt; neat<br/>
&gt;   things that were related to MN. Please give them a<br/>
&gt;   look and see if anything sparks your interest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   On a quick side note before the list, Red Cat,<br/>
&gt; M.C.<br/>
&gt;   Bear and myself got together a few weeks ago to<br/>
&gt; talk<br/>
&gt;   about the gathering and brainstorm on what we<br/>
&gt; could to<br/>
&gt;   make things fun, new, and exciting. I wish I could<br/>
&gt;   divulge some of the things here right now, but I<br/>
&gt;   cannot, some things are better left as a surprise.<br/>
&gt; But<br/>
&gt;   I will say this, there are several things I have<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt;   seen or heard of at a gathering and I hope/know<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt;   will all find them fun and different.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I hope to see a great number of you in May. I look<br/>
&gt;   forward to seeing old friends I've only net once,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt;   many new ones. I hope this list isn't too long for<br/>
&gt;   you. Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; list<br/>
