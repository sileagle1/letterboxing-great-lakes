                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know that this request is kinda last minute, but up until this past weekend I thought that I would only be able to make it on Saturday. Is there anyone who has extra space at their campsite? My understanding is that you can have two tents at a site with a max of 6 people and each site has 2 parking spots. I would be coming by myself with a puptent. I can come either by car or public transit. I would be willing to pay half the fee and contribute to meals (particularly if I can bring the car) I will also check out hotels but I am hoping someone will help me out since this is my first GLG and I want to be able to get to attend as many events as possible.<br>
