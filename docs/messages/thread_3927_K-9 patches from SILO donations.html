Even though I was not able to make the SILO event last minute....I too <br/>
got my patch after donating....<br/>
AND I also got the K9 stamp in the mail today for the "Schoolhouse" <br/>
event here in Ohio on April 14th!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

&gt; I sent these out shortly after the SILO gathering, but I recently had <br/>
&gt; a patch that didn't reach it's destination. So I just wanted to check <br/>
&gt; to be sure the folks that donated $20+ at the SILO gathering actually <br/>
&gt; got their patch.<br/>
