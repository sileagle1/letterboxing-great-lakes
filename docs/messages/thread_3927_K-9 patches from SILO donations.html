I sent these out shortly after the SILO gathering, but I recently had a patch that didn't reach it's destination. So I just wanted to check to be sure the folks that donated $20+ at the SILO gathering actually got their patch.<br>

Even though I was not able to make the SILO event last minute....I too <br>
got my patch after donating....<br>
AND I also got the K9 stamp in the mail today for the "Schoolhouse" <br>
event here in Ohio on April 14th!<br>
