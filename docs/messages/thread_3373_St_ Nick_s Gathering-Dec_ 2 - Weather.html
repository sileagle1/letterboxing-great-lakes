One thing is certain...there probably won't be other groups having 'picnics' that day and the shelter will be free.  <br>

Yes, wear your boots...and maybe bring your snowshoes.  LOL!<br>

Friday night after work, so if the roads are really bad, I'm not <br>
going to risk it.  Hopefully the snow will have stopped by the time <br>
I hit Madison (most forecasts say that it will) and the Wisconsin <br>
DOT will have the plows and such out.  <br>

I'll be anxiously watching the conditions tomorrow!  <br>
