helpful to your fellow letterboxers, but on the other<br>
hand, letterboxing isn't about having everything<br>
handed to you on a platter and for a lot of us it's<br>
the journey that's more important, not the stamp image<br>
at the end.  But again, letterboxing is different<br>
things to different people.  I know that when Deedle &<br>
I can't find a box, often times we'll console<br>
ourselves with ice cream instead ;)  <br>
<br>
I probably would have handled the situation the same<br>
way you did.  If you're presented with this situation<br>
again, I don't think it would hurt to add a little bit<br>
about the spirit of letterboxing if you think it's<br>
called for.  If they take offense, then hey, they<br>
don't have to search for your boxes any more.  There<br>
are plenty of other people (like me!) waiting for a<br>
chance to hunt your plants!<br>

We try to get input from our 6  yr old on where he thinks the box might be. On occasion we get some really good suggestions and have actually found a box because he suggested we look in a few different places we went right by. Most of the time we get great stories about how pirates or aliens or ninja or some such have had a great battle with the letterbox being the prized treasure. He's always sure that they'll bring it back some day so we should try again later.<br>

clear from the message whether it was the kid's first box or not. If it was,<br>
I see absolutely nothing wrong with asking if it's there, and telling, if<br>
you know. I don't think the kid is too likely to get hooked on a<br>
sport/game/hobby based on a first try followed by a lecture about how "life<br>
is tough sometimes". I agree that the journey is an important part, and that<br>
not finding boxes is part of it, but it's a lot more fun when the boxes are<br>
there.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I don't know too many of us (myself included) that are above<br>
the occasional "have you heard anything about this one?" before undertaking<br>
some longer (or not so longer) trips.<br>

  Apparently I'm the only stick in the mud here. I don't think it's entirely<br>
  clear from the message whether it was the kid's first box or not. If it was,<br>
  I see absolutely nothing wrong with asking if it's there, and telling, if<br>
  you know. I don't think the kid is too likely to get hooked on a<br>
  sport/game/hobby based on a first try followed by a lecture about how "life<br>
  is tough sometimes". I agree that the journey is an important part, and that<br>
  not finding boxes is part of it, but it's a lot more fun when the boxes are<br>
  there.<br>
<br>
  Additionally, I don't know too many of us (myself included) that are above<br>
  the occasional "have you heard anything about this one?" before undertaking<br>
  some longer (or not so longer) trips.<br>

You're not; I agree with you.  I don't think inquiring about the status of a<br>

This is true... unless you travelled hours to get to boxes, then  <br>
spend hours hunting for one that isn't there, with many boxes left to  <br>
find... and limited time to be out hunting.<br>
Not asking for hints to clues, not asking for boxes to be handed to  <br>
me, just appreciate knowing if the thing  is still  there if I choose  <br>
to go out specifically to hunt to it.<br>
<br>
If I know a box is no longer there, it can literally save an hour or  <br>
more, especially if it is one that is "on the way" and  is still off  <br>
the beaten path.<br>
With limited hours for play, (and many more hours having to work) - I  <br>
value my free time....<br>
<br>
I am not saying, pout if you find a box isn't there.. but I see  <br>
nothing wrong with inquiring about its status.<br>

<br>
Nor do I, as previously stated.  I think the rub here was that there <br>
are those who want a guarantee and who will only look for boxes that <br>
are *for sure* there.<br>
<br>
Just like everyone has their preference as to long hike or short <br>
hike, paved trail, mountain top or drive-by, so there are <br>
differences of opinon in how much a person feels should be left to <br>
the unknown.  Personally I don't have a problem driving a distance <br>
to look for a box and coming up empty-handed.  Ninety-nine times out <br>
of a hundred I will have enjoyed a rewarding hike, perhaps traveled <br>
to an area that I had never been before, just got out and enjoyed <br>
the day.  I certainly value my time, but it would be hard for me to <br>
consider it a waste of time just because I didn't score a stamp.  <br>
Heck before I ever heard of letterboxing, I used to do those hikes <br>
without expecting anything other than a peaceful walk in the woods <br>
and maybe a view of the lake.<br>
<br>
So, let's say you as a seeker want a reasonable assurance that a box <br>
is in place before you go looking for it.  While you certainly have <br>
the right to ask me if the box is in place, I am not obligated to <br>
tell you if I personally feel that it is more in the spirit of <br>
letterboxing if there is an element of unknown when setting out on a <br>
letterbox hunt.  If you then decide to skip my box because you were <br>
not given a guarantee, I really don't care -- it is your loss, not <br>
mine, because even if the box had not been there, you were sure to <br>
have enjoyed a wonderful walk along a beach or in the woods, etc.  <br>
This is why I plant boxes where I do -- along scenic trails, in <br>
historically significant places, locations with a view -- so if the <br>
box is missing or just not found, it has still been a memorable <br>
experience.<br>
<br>
There are no guarantees in letterboxing.  Somebody can write and ask <br>
me the status of one of my boxes and I can tell them that I am <br>
fairly certain that it is there because there was a found status <br>
logged a couple of weeks previously.  That does not mean the box is <br>
there -- perhaps those letterboxers who logged the find left the box <br>
exposed or were seen by non letterboxers, perhaps nature intervened <br>
since then, etc.<br>
<br>
While finding a box at the end of the trail is certainly the primary <br>
goal for many people -- to differing degrees, those who take time to <br>
smell the roses, enjoy what nature and history have to offer, and <br>
treasure the time spent with family (or in solitude), definitely <br>
will encounter less disappointment with this hobby, even when they <br>
come away from a hunt without a stamp.  Just as with so many other <br>
things in life, a letterbox journey is what *you* make it to be.<br>

Children, and their parents too, need to understand that every effort has it's rewards and sometimes the prize isn't the box - it's the journey.   It's disappointing when a box is missing, because I understand how much work goes into preparing and placing a box.  Letterboxing is about getting off the sofa, getting outside more, experiencing nature, and the thrill of the hunt!<br>
<br>
But I think some of us are just preaching to the choir so to speak, because we already understand what this sport is all about.  There are no guarantees in life, but it sure is sweet when you persevere and find a box.  That should be the lesson that parents should be teaching their children.  <br>

  I'll second that. We always try to use the unfound letterboxes as a learning experience. We try to get input from our 6 yr old on where he thinks the box might be. On occasion we get some really good suggestions and have actually found a box because he suggested we look in a few different places we went right by. Most of the time we get great stories about how pirates or aliens or ninja or some such have had a great battle with the letterbox being the prized treasure. He's always sure that they'll bring it back some day so we should try again later.<br>

Interesting comment and very true.  It made me think though...  <br>
those of us who have been involved in letterboxing for a while have <br>
heard it a hundred times and wonder, does it really need to be said <br>
again? (yeh, yeh, we get it...)  But when there are many new members <br>
in the congregation, maybe a repeat sermon does serve a purpose.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that is where we are falling short in educating new <br>
letterboxers and passing along the intangible concepts -- the spirit <br>
of the game, the ethics, the stealthy aspect, etc.  We have latched <br>
onto those things and they seem so natural and ingrained in the way <br>
we perceive letterboxing and the way we play the game.  We take <br>
those things for granted and assume they go without saying -- <br>
because to us they do, not to mention they tend to be things that by <br>
nature are not out-in-the-open.<br>
<br>
But none of us started there, rather we all came into letterboxing <br>
with a surface understanding of the motions you go through to play <br>
the game -- follow clues, stamp the book, increase your "F" count, <br>
repeat as many times as possible...  And on a rudimentary level, <br>
that is letterboxing and for some people that is all there ever is.  <br>
In some cases that is because that's all they want from it, but in <br>
other cases, I think it is because they don't know any different, <br>
because there is no handbook outlining the peripherals, because that <br>
is all they have been exposed to.  For those who do think of <br>
letterboxing on a deeper level, that was an understanding that was <br>
picked up along the way, from those we came in contact with, from <br>
experience, etc.  Many who have been around for a few years, <br>
particularly before the regional talk lists, gleaned these concepts <br>
from interacting with/watching people like MapSurfer, Legerdemaine, <br>
Der Mad Stamper, Jay Drew, etc.  But a lot of those folks are no <br>
longer actively participating, nor are they visibly passing along <br>
the fundamentals of letterboxing that many of us take for granted.<br>
<br>
There is an interesting conversation over at the newboxers list <br>
about being sneaky and in particular, how to teach kids to letterbox <br>
stealthily without making it seem like a crime.  It is encouraging <br>
to see those concepts being passed on to newer participants.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think what you did was right. I had some people ask me if a LB is <br>
up and running and I just told them the last time I checked it. I'm <br>
not going to run out and check a box just cause little Jimmy might <br>
throw a tantrum if its not there! I agree with the whole LBing is a <br>
learning experience thing and you can't get everything you want in <br>
life, but I wouldn't tell them that. Telling people how to raise <br>
their kids can cause trouble. There were many o' time I would love to <br>
scream across the restaurant "shut that kid up, or take him in the <br>
bathroom", thankfully I keeped my cool.<br>
