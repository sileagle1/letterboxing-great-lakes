place to put one of my boxes.  The spot was PERFECT ... I was already <br/>
writing the clues in my head, until I found the camo covered box. <br/>
<br/>
It never occured to me to "spoil" his location by putting my box <br/>
nearby ... wonder how come so many caches end up next to boxes, then. <br/>
I suppose it may be because the cache placer didn't discover the <br/>
letterbox when the cache originally went in.<br/>
<br/>
The day we found the Old Mission box, there was no geocache nearby. <br/>
However, as there was a bit of poison ivy along the trail, Bindle Bum <br/>
waited while I did the box and what he described sounded like people <br/>
who were probably on their way to return the cache but I was too <br/>
close so they were lingering about.  He thought it was one of the <br/>
funniest things he'd seen since we started boxing. All of us trying <br/>
to be discreet.  Kinda sounds like as much fun as Kara and her mom <br/>
had watching Bindle Bum and I look for the East Meets West box.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
