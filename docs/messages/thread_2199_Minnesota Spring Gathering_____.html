                    <div class="plaintext-content">Your gathering plan sounds great!  It's a long way from Muskegon <br>
(MI) to MN (about 9 1/2 - 10 hours) so I don't know if we will be <br>
able to make it or not, although I certainly am entertaining the <br>
idea.<br>
<br>
The "birth"/"rebirth" idea is a neat theme and could produce some <br>
interesting stamps!<br>
<br>
I was wondering about the group camping area.  Would it be open to <br>
any kind of camping equipment or tents only?  We have a pop-up <br>
camper.  Is it a primitive area or is there electricity?  Showers? <br>
Yeh, I admit it, in my younger years I was a primitive camper, but <br>
have turned into a bit of a camping wuss...<br>
<br>
Also, I wanted to suggest that you might also post about your event <br>
at the new LbNA Midwest Yahoo! group as this group covers some of <br>
the states adjoining MN from the other directions and there may be <br>
some interest from those areas also.  The link for that group is:<br>

<br>
Good luck with the event -- the juggling workshop sounds cool and <br>
the oatmeal dump...  hmmm, definitely a stick to your ribs breakfast!<br>

again. Please pass on this information to others, Thank You. Hello <br>
everyone, this is Chris G. from Burnsville MN. I am writing to let <br>
everyone know officially about the first ever, and hopefully annual, <br>
MN. spring gathering. I've narrowed down the options for parks to <br>
two. The only thing I'm waiting on is word if the weekend I plan the <br>
gathering for is open or not. The gathering is tentatively scheduled <br>
for Friday May 19th thru Sunday May 21st. I will be reserving a <br>
large group campsite for us all, and I'm so excited I can hardly <br>
stand it. As far as themes for the gathering goes, I'm open to <br>
suggestions and I think putting a few ideas to a vote is a great way <br>
to go, that way everyone gets a say in things. My first idea was to <br>
have a theme of birth. whether it be the sprouting of spring <br>
flowers, the birth of new animals, the birth of children, the birth <br>
of the first MN gathering, the rising of the sun, etc. (My wife and<br>
>  I just had our first child in September, so that's where the <br>
whole birth idea comes from). I just think that spring is such a <br>
wonderful time of new beginings and there is so much to celebrate. <br>
The birth theme also leaves alot of room open for interpretation so <br>
that everyone has a very broad range of choices to carve from. As I <br>
said I'm open to suggestions from all and we'll put this to a vote a <br>
little later on. I have one special workshop I have planned  that <br>
doesn't have anything to do with letterboxing. I will be teaching <br>
those who have always wanted to learn how to juggle , how to juggle. <br>
I have been a juggler for several years and find it a most <br>
satisfying hobby. If there are those that can already juggle, I can <br>
show you many new and fun things. I digress, back to letterboxing, <br>
The gathering will start on Friday afternoon/early evening for the <br>
early birds from out of town so that you can hit several of our <br>
local boxes, over 40 within a short drive from either proposed site. <br>
It<br>
>  will be a camping weekend, with a huge "oatmeal dump" (I'll <br>
explain) early on Saturday morning to give us all lots of energy <br>
throughout the day to box like mad. Both parks have a resident four <br>
boxes in them already and my series of nine (It's a surprise)themed <br>
boxes will be making their debut! Plus whatever other stamps people <br>
will be contributing. O.K., "oatmeal dump" is just like a "chili <br>
dump", no wise cracks :) I'll be asking people to bring their <br>
favorite brand of oatmeal, regular not flavored please, and <br>
we'll "dump"  it into a huge pot to be shared among all of us. Kind <br>
of a community breakfast and a great way to get to know people <br>
before we all run off in seperate directions. I'll keep you all up <br>
to date on the specifics and as soon as the site is picked I'll post <br>
info so you can check it out to start your planning. The two <br>
locations so far are either in Afton, MN. or in Marine on St Croix, <br>
Mn. both of which are just this (MN) side of the St Croix river. So <br>
they are both<br>
>  very close to Wisconsin, which leaves you no excuse to not be <br>
there :) Thank you for reading this long post, I look forward to <br>
meeting each and every one of you. If you have questions for me or <br>
would like to let me know you'll be there (Which would be much <br>
appreciated so I know how large of a group campsite I need to <br>
reserve) please email me at my hotmail account which is <br>
