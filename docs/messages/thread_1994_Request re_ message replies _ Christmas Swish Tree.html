 <br>
Just to let you know that I just hide the "Christmas Swish Tree" Hitchhiker in my latest LBox (Paul Bunyan's Baby Blocks) this very afternoon. I'm thinking that "The Red Cat" may just be curious enough to go looking this weekend.  I hope some eager beaver doesn't shorten your Christmas Tree.<br>

It's very difficult to wade through messages that quote the entire<br>

have been flying around here lately. <br>
