I have a few questions.<br/>
We have a 2 year old and a 4 month old.  I know that kids are included<br/>
in the team count, but can we make an exception for the 4 month old, and have another <br/>
person on our team?<br/>
Also, you may not have thought it through this far but will the starting locations be staggered.<br/>
By that I mean, if there are 8 teams will we all head to different areas first.<br/>
I have never done a road rally so forgive my ignorance on how this works.<br/>
