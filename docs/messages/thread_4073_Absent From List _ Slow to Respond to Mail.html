much during the next couple of months and may be slow to respond to <br>
personal e-mails.  I will answer, just that I will probably only take <br>
the time to address personal e-mails and list messages a couple of <br>
times a week instead of daily.<br>
<br>
A huge thanks in advance to Azobox for picking up the slack on <br>
moderator duties, although I will still try to check into the list <br>
from the office every day to approve new members, etc.<br>
<br>
I am moving up to camp this weekend for the summer and have no <br>
Internet access in my cottage as of right now.  Hopefully the wireless <br>
will be up and working in the next week or so, but even then, camp <br>
days are long and computer time will be very limited.  On the flip <br>
side, Lake Michigan in only steps outside my door -- morning before-<br>
work time will probably be spent walking on the beach, not on the <br>
computer.<br>
