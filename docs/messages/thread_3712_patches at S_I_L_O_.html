You may recall that Scoutdogs is participating in a fundraiser with her Dog Scouts troop to raise money to purchase a bullet-proof police dog vest the same day.  She has also graciously carved a special stamp which will be available at the S.I.L.O. if you make a donation (any size graciously and gratefully accepted) to the cause.  However, anyone who makes a donation of $20 or more can receive a patch (I posted a copy of it in SD's photo album if you'd like to see it).  I will not have the patches with me, but make sure you give me your address (unless you write a check and it's printed there).  I will forward them to her (along with the donations) and she will mail them out.  <br>
