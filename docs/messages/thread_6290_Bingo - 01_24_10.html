Does anyone still have a blank card?  I just checked my notes from last<br/>
year, and I think the longest anyone had a totally BLANK card was Familyof6<br/>
who went 20 days with a blank card.  If anyone had a blank card on JAN 21 or<br/>
later, they are now the record holder!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If someone still hasn't had a word by Tuesday, they could then also claim<br/>
the other title - longest streak without a word.  This "honor" is currently<br/>
held by BirdWoman of the Waltzing Pigs.  Although she had some words earlier<br/>
in the year, she later went 25 days in a row without a single word.  Sure<br/>
hope that doesn't happen to us!!  Our dry spell this year was finally broken<br/>
today with that wonderful Cryptogram word.<br/>

Yeah...ME!.....Day 24 and counting....Not ONE single word called in 24 days!...(and yes, I've gone back through and double checked the list!)....I sent some soap to Spring Chick along with my entry...Hmmmmm...maybe she washed away every word I chose!  If she thinks that my pathetic showing in BINGO is going to alter my enthusiasm for everything letterboxing, especially the upcoming Olympics, she's very much mistaken!<br/>

I like this year's word of triumph - "Woot!"  <br/>
Wasn't the word for last year - "Daub!"  ???<br/>
I wonder what next year's word will be - "Bam!" (lol)<br/>
