I had to laugh when I read the cautious comments about what we tell our children about stranger danger and meeting people on the Internet.  (And letterboxers are about as 'strange' as they come!  Just try explaining this hobby to someone and watch their reaction.)  Years ago, I met up with Martini Man and Wisconsin Hiker at a former truck stop/24 hour restaurant, at night, alone.  I had never met them before.  Hmm...but when I stop to think about it, maybe THEY were taking the bigger risk.  Anyway, I encourage Sara of the JC and anyone else to go to the gathering.  You will have the time of your life and meet some of the nicest people in the world.  ---Beetle <br>

Sara - The theme for SILO II was Crime Doesn't Pay with a St. Valentines Day Massacre theme.  Now how's that for bravery...coming to an event like that and not knowing what to expect?  ggghiker was brave and lived to tell about it.  Dead of Winter is sure to be another fun filled letterbox event.  And if you're really brave, SILO 4 is posted on AQ too.  <br>

Please come Sara.  I am the host and my first event was Silo II and I met some people online first and they have become GOOD friends.  It is a great bunch of people and so welcoming.  This is a low-key kind of gathering too.  I don't have all your other answers but there will be a lot of table exchanging going on and hopefully some others experts will answer about the postals.  I will be there from 8 a.m. on as I am the volunteer there for Saturday.  There will be boxes planted indoors and out.<br>

As for your other questions, I am not too experienced about all the official<br>
protocol, but I am planning to bring a table top event box made of several<br>
stamps that I recently carved for LTCs (letterboxing trading cards).  (I'll<br>
also be bringing some LTCs if anyone wants to share, btw.)  An event box is<br>
something you bring to an event that sits out somewhere (with clues or not,<br>
like the tabletops).  A personal traveler is a stamp that you personally<br>
carry about with you.  People ususally have to ask you a question or do<br>
something silly to get the stamp from you.  If you are on AQ you can look at<br>
other people's personal traveler clues for this event to get ideas.<br>
<br>
WHEN are other people coming?  I was confused by the 1-4 pm time and all the<br>
talk of outdoor or earlier boxing ...  just curious.<br>
<br>
I hope that helps!<br>

Sara...We found our first letterbox in January of 2003...we knew that sometimes "letterboxing people" would get together for events...Tonto felt for certain it was a cult requiring a secret hand shake.  (They still won't tell us what it is!)  We didn't get up enough nerve to attend our first event until 2005.  We all have experienced your trepidation on some level before attending our first event, but we assure you, we are all harmless...as Familyof 6 pointed out, sanity is debatable!  However, due to his occasional delusional tendencies, it is HE and not Tiptoe missing the mark!  In matter of fact, we believe upon our first time meeting him, he faked illness at his own event!<br>
Please come...you'll have a good time!  You might want to peek in on the photo section and see that we may be motley, but pretty tame.<br>
