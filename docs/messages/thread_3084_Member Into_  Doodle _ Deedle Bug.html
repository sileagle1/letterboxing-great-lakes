the Deedle Bug part of our couple.  We live in<br/>
Cleveland, Ohio, and have been letterboxing since<br/>
March 2004.  We actually found out about letterboxing<br/>
in the fall of 2003 while searching for information on<br/>
Squire's Castle online.  One of our hits was for clues<br/>
to a letterbox hidden in the area.  As excited as we<br/>
were reading all about letterboxing, it took us a<br/>
while to finally carve our signature stamp and get out<br/>
on the trails (and that Cleveland winter also deterred<br/>
us some).  We weren't able to find the Squire's Castle<br/>
box on our first try, but that didn't deter us from<br/>
become the addicts that we now are (ok, me a little<br/>
more than Deedle).  We finally did find the box and we<br/>
even got to meet the woman responsible for this<br/>
afflication of ours, Blaze, at the unofficial<br/>
Brandywine Falls mini-meet that The Cat's Meow<br/>
mentioned.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, The Cat's Meow mentioned a stamp that Gamecock<br/>
had carved for us in honor of our engagement at that<br/>
Mini-Meet.  We use that stamp as our personal<br/>
traveller.  If you meet us on the trails or at a<br/>
gathering, tell us how we first met to add the image<br/>
to your log book.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing some of you in 2007 at the<br/>
Great Lakes Gathering, if not sooner!  <br/>
