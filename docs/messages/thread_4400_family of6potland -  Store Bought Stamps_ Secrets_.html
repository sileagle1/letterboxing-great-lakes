Some letterboxers really love those hand carved stamps.  I do too, but I'm not a purist.  I plant boxes and I always hand carve the stamp because I know that's sort of where the bar is set, so to speak.  <br/>
<br/>
But I went boxing this weekend and after a long drive, and a short hike, the box was missing.  I didn't find a box at all.  No store purchased or hand carved stamp.  <br/>
But, it was a fun little adventure and the clue took me to a new area.  And....I found a turkey feather.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't 'avoid' boxes with store bought stamps.  I've found boxes with commercially made stamps which were unique to the area, that's OK.  I've found boxes with cheap stamps from a kids stamp set, hmmm...but they were exactly what the area called for, so I was just glad to find the box.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, AQ posts if the stamp is hand carved or not.  But if that is something that is important to a letterboxer, then contact the placer first.  They may tell you.  Or, on LbNA, the box owner can indicate this information in the clue.  <br/>
<br/>
I just think the stamp is what it's all about!  Store bought or hand carved.  That's the difference between letterboxing and geocashing.  <br/>

  OK, I've been reading the board lately and there is A LOT of nastiness<br/>
  about the GPS vs geocache ns letterboxing thing. Lay off people and<br/>
  have fun. Responsible letterboxers and cachers are respectful of the<br/>
  surroundings. SO...there is no need for this "sniping".<br/>
<br/>
  Anyhow, the real reason I'm posting is because I keep finding boxes<br/>
  with store bought stamps off the letterboxing.org site. I know<br/>
  atlasquest states if the stamp is store bought or handcarved.<br/>
  Personally, I avoid the store bought if I can help it. I hate spending<br/>
  time searching for a stamp with OK to great clues only to find a store<br/>
  bought stamp that has no connection to the clues or site. Is there a<br/>
  way to find this out on the letterbox.org site?<br/>
<br/>
  Also, I recently found a box that had no stamp and said to record a<br/>
  secret. WOW! Were the finders of this box ticked off! I guess the<br/>
  secret is..."If you make a box, put a stamp in it!" I think after<br/>
  looking at the last ten entries the planter might realize this. (I'm<br/>
  glad I'm not them...they have an earful coming. Anyhow, just something<br/>
  to LOL about. Box on!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I try and check the boxes I am planning to visit on the two sites, Atlas Quest and LBNA,<br/>
to look for details that the sites might not share.  I find I am checking if it is a store bought or hand carved stamp and most importantly, last recorded find or attempt.  I find that most boxes are posted on both sites.  While I do not avoid those boxes with store bought stamps, I do not make the effort to go get them specifically but rather acquire them when a box with a carved stamp is planted in its area.  About ticked off boxers- try driving an hour for a potential box find of 20 and returning home with less than half that count.  It seems the planter of the majority of the boxes missing was neither concered with the responsibility of maintaining their boxes nor had any consideration for those of who came to find them.<br/>
