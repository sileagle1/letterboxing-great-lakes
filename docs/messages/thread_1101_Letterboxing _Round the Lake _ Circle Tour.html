Although SpringChick has put the Letterboxing 'Round the Lake series<br/>
on the shelf, we'd be interested in knowing which boxes were planted<br/>
or designated for that project.  We hope to make the circle tour<br/>
sometime and we'd want to be sure that those were on our list of boxes<br/>
to find.  We wouldn't want to miss any that were intended to be part<br/>
of the series, but didn't include a reference to the series in the<br/>
body of the clue.<br/>
<br/>
If you planted or designated a box to be included in this series, we'd<br/>
like to hear about it off-list so we're sure to make time for it when<br/>
we plan our circle tour trip.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
