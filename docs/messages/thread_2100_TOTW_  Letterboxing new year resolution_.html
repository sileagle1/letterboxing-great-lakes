I guess it's only right that I share our plans.  I've<br/>
been working on what I consider a letterbox with a<br/>
"twist" to plant in the coming year (since I didn't<br/>
get to before the snow started to fall).  The concept<br/>
is all together, my "twist" has been tested, the image<br/>
for the stamp, although not carved, has been designed,<br/>
just need to scout out a good hiding spot sometime<br/>
next year.  So keep your eyes open for "Invisible Ink"<br/>
in 2006.<br/>
<br/>
Deedle &amp; I are also planning on registering for some<br/>
camping equipment, to aid us in our longer-distance<br/>
letterboxing trips.  Lots of letterbox-saturated areas<br/>
in Southern Ohio we'd like to make weekend trips to.  <br/>
<br/>
What about the rest of you?<br/>

<br/>
First... to be more organized and keep better tabs on the boxes I <br/>
have planted, and possibly retire a few to make way for new ones.<br/>
<br/>
Second, as far as new boxes...  to plant as many of these complete <br/>
and finished boxes I have sitting here as I can, BEFORE starting on <br/>
new projects.<br/>
<br/>
Third...  to make at least one LB trip to the east side of the state <br/>
this year.<br/>

so, since I get so frustrated every time I try to carve that I fling <br/>
the carving materials all over the table and walk off in a huff <br/>

already planned to CT and MA and maybe even Ireland and c) possible, <br/>

You all will have to help me stick to resolution a!! :-)<br/>

I have one huge New Year's Letterboxing Resolution.....to plant my <br/>
first box!! That means that I'll have to work on my carving skills and <br/>
actually fit in the time to carve......so I guess it's a 3-1 resolution <br/>
this year.<br/>
<br/>
SpringChick- It would be awesome to have you over in our side of the <br/>
state in the coming year! Yay!!<br/>

year--and I was batting 0.0  Let's hope these resolutions have a <br/>
better outcome.  I have 2 resolutions.  First, to go on one <br/>
letterboxing expedition a month (more would be OK!)  I had 9 out of 12 <br/>
months this past year.  The second resolution is to improve my carving <br/>
skills.  Perhaps we could have a carving tutorial at the Great Lakes <br/>
gathering since I noticed I wasn't the only one with this resolution.<br/>
