By now you may have heard that we will be hosting GLG 2013 in the great State of Indiana.  We are very excited to host and we will be working with Rnfrog and Joe Boxer to put on a great event.  Here are some initial details for you but we will have a lot more information coming in the upcoming weeks. <br>
<br>
Theme:  The Wonders of the World; A Celebration of Mankind<br>
Location: Indiana Dunes State Park, Chesterton IN<br>
Date: Saturday June 15, 2013<br>
Park Entrance Fee: $5 for IN residents $10 for out of state residents.  May be waived with the purchase of an IN state park pass.  $40 for IN residents.<br>
<br>
Campsite Reservations: camp.in.gov  or by phone: 866-622-6746 site cost is $26/night and all sites are electric.  <br>
<br>
These sites go fast so reserve early.  If you know you are going I’d suggest to book soon!    <br>
Lodging in the area: Hotel information will be provided shortly.<br>
<br>
<br>
A little bit about the park.  The IN Dunes State Park totals about 2200 acres and features 16 miles of trail easy-rugged.  Located on the shores of Lake Michigan it provides visitors with an opportunity to explore diverse landscapes in the Midwest.  It features a variety of habitats that can be seen from the trails.  It is surrounded by the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, a federally administered park of 15,000 acres. <br>
We have spoken to both park Naturalists at the park and they have given us their blessing to host this event at their park.  They have encouraged us by sharing many specific locations for us to plant so you will see the best that the park has to offer.  As a courtesy, we highly encourage the “leave no trace” mentality that letterboxers are known for.  There are very few rules that the DNR has for us, all are posted on the map that we will upload shortly.  However, there is one that is unique to this park: ALL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ARE PROHIBITED WITHIN THE BOUNDARY OF THE PARK. <br>
 <br>
***ATTENTION***<br>
We are looking for carvers!  The stamps should fit the theme which is a broad topic which would encompass scientific, architectural, industrial achievements of mankind-the sky is the limit (think Modern Marvels).  Stamps should be mailed no later than mid May so we have them June 1. Please limit the size to fit on a 3x5 index card.  Please contact us individually if you intend to carve so we can maintain a master list and avoid duplication.  Also, indicate if you want your stamp back.  These will be temporary at this particular park and removed on Sunday after the event. <br>

Oh no, you HAVE to make it this year!  Remember, we had plans to go "family boxing" together this year. ;)  Besides, just think about the family *hosting* the gathering with twin 18mo olds and a 4yr old... You can make the drive with just one little bug! ;)<br>

Oooh, I hope we can make it!  We've had to miss the last few years of Great Lakes Gatherings, and I miss seeing everyone!  There's nothing on the calendar right now... the hardest part will be convincing Deedle Bug to drive 5 hours there and back with a one year old! :)<br>

Here are some initial details for you but we will have a lot more information coming in the upcoming weeks. <br>
><br>
>Theme:  The Wonders of the World; A Celebration of Mankind<br>
>Location: Indiana Dunes State Park, Chesterton IN<br>
>Date: Saturday June 15, 2013<br>
>Park Entrance Fee: $5 for IN residents $10 for out of state residents.  May be waived with the purchase of an IN state park pass.  $40 for IN residents.<br>
><br>
>Campsite Reservations: camp.in.gov  or by phone: 866-622-6746 site cost is $26/night and all sites are electric.  <br>
><br>
>These sites go fast so reserve early.  If you know you are going I’d suggest to book soon!    <br>
>Lodging in the area: Hotel information will be provided shortly.<br>
><br>
>A little bit about the park.  The IN Dunes State Park totals about 2200 acres and features 16 miles of trail easy-rugged.  Located on the shores of Lake Michigan it provides visitors with an opportunity to explore diverse landscapes in the Midwest.  It features a variety of habitats that can be seen from the trails.  It is surrounded by the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, a federally administered park of 15,000 acres. <br>
>We have spoken to both park Naturalists at the park and they have given us their blessing to host this event at their park.  They have encouraged us by sharing many specific locations for us to plant so you will see the best that the park has to offer.  As a courtesy, we highly encourage the “leave no trace” mentality that letterboxers are known for.  There are very few rules that the DNR has for us, all are posted on the map that we will upload shortly.  However, there is one that is unique to this park: ALL ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ARE PROHIBITED WITHIN THE BOUNDARY OF THE PARK. <br>
> <br>
>***ATTENTION***<br>
>We are looking for carvers!  The stamps should fit the theme which is a broad topic which would encompass scientific, architectural, industrial achievements of mankind-the sky is the limit (think Modern Marvels).  Stamps should be mailed no later than mid May so we have them June 1. Please limit the size to fit on a 3x5 index card.  Please contact us individually if you intend to carve so we can maintain a master list and avoid duplication.  Also, indicate if you want your stamp back.  These will be temporary at this particular park and removed on Sunday after the event. <br>

I just booked site 135 but can't figure out how to add myself to the<br>
database. Now I just hope hubby agrees to come because there's no way I can<br>
haul the trailer. But sites were filling up fast so I thought I'd better<br>
snag one.<br>
