On our way out of town, we stopped at a teeny-tiny cemetery to look at some of the family graves.  Just as I was thinking that this might be a nice place for a letterbox, a car drove up out of the blue and asked us if we were looking for a geocache! Maybe it wouldn't be such a great place for a box.<br>
