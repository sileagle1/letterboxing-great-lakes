<br>
I like your trail name, did I mention that before?  The reason I like<br>
it, is because it is a reminder for me that the destination isn't<br>
always what's important. "Journey" reminds me to enjoy the act of<br>
reaching the destination and it fits nicely with why choose to be a<br>
sailor. "Journey" also evokes, for me, thoughts of growth and discovery.<br>
<br>
On the evening I discovered letterboxing, I spent almost the whole<br>
night roaming from site to site drinking in as much information as I<br>
could.  The next morning, I immediately carved my first stamp (hacked<br>
an old eraser with a kitchen knife) created my first box, made a<br>
signature stamp for my husband and myself and placed the box. I<br>
continued to read as much online info as I could. I felt I had a<br>
pretty good handle on understanding how things were done and what the<br>
generally accepted practices were.<br>
<br>
What I'd like to share with you is that despite all the hours, and<br>
yes, it was hours, I spent educating myself  I still committed some<br>
blunders. Here's the first one: My trail name is Bindle Babe because I<br>
somehow thought my husband and I needed to have the same signature<br>
stamp. I knew I wanted it to reflect our passion for sailing so I knew<br>
I wanted a sailboat image. Here's the "duh" part  for years hubby has<br>
called himself a sailing bum. So I had Bindle (the first part of our<br>
boat name) and Bum  excellent! Double letters are always easy memory<br>
hooks.  OK .. a sailboat and 2 B's were going on the stamp. But what<br>
to call myself that started with a B (HUSH UP you smarty pants in the<br>
peanut gallery  I am NOT itchy!)   hmmmm  you can see where this is<br>
going can't you? Yes, unimaginative as it is and as unlike reality as<br>
it is, I chose "babe" <br>
<br>
If I hadn't been so enthusiastic, I would soon have realized I didn't<br>
have to do it that way at all. Oh well, I had posted the clues to my<br>
first box as Bindle Babe and so Bindle Babe I remain.<br>
<br>
Not so terrible, but still  it was because I didn't even know what I<br>
didn't know.  Now let me share a really big mistake I made with you:<br>
<br>
In Spring 2004 I had been boxing for just a few months.  I went to<br>
Portland, OR for an artistic event, unrelated to letterboxing. <br>
However, I was able to combine my new-found hobby with this trip and<br>
hook-up with some of the PNW boxers while I was out there.<br>
<br>
One of these boxers and I traded letterboxes. She placed my "Portland<br>
Rose" box (Portland is known as the City of Roses) out there, while I<br>
brought back her "MI or Bust" box and placed it here. We "adopted"<br>
each others box  that means we do the maintenance and such on each<br>
others boxes.<br>
<br>
Later in the summer of 2004 (I had not yet been boxing for a year <br>
but had quite a few boxes found and placed) when I went to do<br>
maintenance on the "MI or Bust" box, I took photos of the logbook<br>
pages thinking I'd like to share them with the woman who created the box.<br>
<br>
I posted a note to their regional list saying, "MI or Bust box <br>
photos" or something like that.<br>
<br>
Now let's count the OPPSIES, shall we?<br>
<br>
First oopsie: the woman who created the box was also a fairly new<br>
boxer at the time and didn't think to check if that name had ever been<br>
used before. Not good. It had already been used by another, long-time<br>
boxer from the Portland, OR area.  Well, she saw the post and thought<br>
I was talking about her box. Of course she was kind of upset at the<br>
thought that no one considered seeing if the name had been used before<br>
 she had "first rights" so to speak.  <br>
<br>
Second oopsie: it's considered very bad form to post images of<br>
someone's signature stamp without their permission. I didn't know<br>
that. Somehow in all the time I spent trying to learn about<br>
letterboxing, I had missed that bit of information.<br>
<br>
What I'm trying to say is that we were all new to letterboxing at one<br>
time and no matter how careful, how diligent, how sincere we are <br>
mistakes are sometimes made. If we're gracious, we admit our error,<br>
apologize  accept the personal growth and appreciate the fuller depth<br>
of understand we now have. <br>
<br>
Next:  I hope you didn't interpret the "tone" of my previous post as<br>
of being angry with you for posting the location of my Christmas Swish<br>
Tree HH, because that was not my intent at all. I only said I wish you<br>
hadn't posted that.  Kind of like wishing someone hadn't spilled their<br>
beverage on the rug. You know  you sigh and wish it hadn't happened,<br>
but it did and so you just go on.<br>
<br>
SpringChick has done a nice job explaining about HH's and that they<br>
are meant as a surprise and that they belong to the letterboxing<br>
community "in toto" and that exclusivity isn't a part of it. <br>
<br>
I am sincerely glad that you find LB.org and AQ to dovetail nicely<br>
with how you'd like to manage your letterbox clues. That's great that<br>
it works well for you. <br>
<br>
About using "OTHER SITES"  There are land-use issues regarding<br>
outdoor activities such as geocaching and letterboxing on state-owned<br>
land here in Michigan. These are the root cause for my choice to keep<br>
some of my clues a little bit more difficult to find.  For example,<br>
any of my boxes that are located on State Park property are listed by<br>
name at LB.org. However, when you open the clue page, it contains an<br>
external link to my Yahoogroup site. <br>
<br>
I know and understand that it's highly unlikely; given our current<br>
state budget situation; that any State Park employee would be paid to<br>
sit around surfing the internet looking for letterboxers and<br>
geocachers who haven't paid the proper fees  (geez oh pizza, I want<br>
that job if it ever comes up!!)  But hey, I've seen the State make<br>
priority choices that seem even more strange and bizarre, so I'm not<br>
going to rule out the possibility of it occurring.  It's my choice to<br>
use external links as a method of staying below their radar, so to<br>
speak.  Like locks on doors  it's simpler to move on to an easier<br>
target than it is to futz around hopping to external links and poking<br>
around.  Does that make sense to you? <br>
<br>
I not going into why I feel it's morally reprehensible for the State<br>
to even have this particular land-use policy and mentality.<br>
<br>
Up until now, I haven't shared this kind of personal information with<br>
any but my closest friends, as I'm sure about everyone here can attest<br>
to. I've chosen to do so now because I keep getting requests from<br>
people to post my boxes online so they can log them.  I'm hoping that<br>
by educating you and others here about some of the things that are<br>
generally not spoken of the knowledge will begin to make its way into<br>
the hearts and minds of those who also enjoy this letterboxing<br>
activity we share.<br>
<br>
I hope you will reconsider your decision to take my little Christmas<br>
Swish Tree HH out of your box and remove your log entries. I'm<br>
actually quite honored that you thought enough of my little guy to<br>
include it in your first box what a nice extra gift for the first finder.<br>
<br>
Someone on the LbNA recently posted a bunch of links that hold a<br>
wealth of information on letterboxing.  Some of these are the ones I<br>
used when I first discovered this hobby and some are even more new. <br>
I'll just copy and paste them to the end of my message in case anyone<br>
would like to investigate further.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>

most of the answers to your questions.<br>
<br>
Letterboxing.org:<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html<br>
<br>
Silent Doug's site:<br>
http://www.letterboxing.info/<br>
Doug probably has the best info site on Hitchhikers and links to<br>
regional chatlists.<br>
<br>
AtlasQuest:<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/<br>
Ryan has a link set up "Code of Conduct" that is really good for all<br>
boxers to read<br>
<br>
newboxers' group:<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br>
Where there is no dumb question, and is "the" place for many<br>
newletterboxers.<br>
<br>
In addition to these sites you can find listings of other sites on<br>
the left hand side of the chatlist home page, as well as listings on<br>
the LBNA home page. You should be advised that many times there are<br>
hidden clues lodged in informational sites as well as the great info<br>
that can be found. Many times things are not what they seem <<br>
