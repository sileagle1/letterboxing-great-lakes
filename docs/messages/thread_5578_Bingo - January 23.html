Bali, you are more than welcome at TIPTOE'S game but, Tonto is the "Father Knows Best" <br/>
among us, and he would never be considered "The Avenger(s)" toward anything that Spring <br/>
Chick might do,  Besides, he wants to remain "Friends" with SC in light of what team he might <br/>
be on in the upcoming Iditirod.  He is cheerfully looking at his two marked off BINGO words <br/>
on his card and has nothing to do with Tiptoe's daily angst. We are definitely considered "The <br/>
Odd Couple" of letterboxing and beyond.  Only Tiptoe would go so low as to actually <br/>
"Flipp(h)er the "Big Bird"!<br/>

And...if you're doing TV BINGO, how about "Snow Dogs) for February<br/>

But yeah...that "Chucky" doll is creepy. Maybe I should carve him into<br/>
a cootie and plant him on you there. Hmmm......? While I'm thinking of<br/>
it, I should carve The Queen of the Empty Bingo Card too. She's a<br/>
small lady so I won't need much material. Although I've heard that<br/>
it's the little ones you have to watch out for. Oh wait...I shouldn't<br/>
have said that since she's probably reading this right now. OH GREAT<br/>
BINGO QUEEN OF THE EMPTY BOARD....PLEASE FORGIVE ME! (IT was SC's<br/>
comment that got me going!) lol<br/>

Poor Tiptoe, you truly are "Lost in Space"!  Lots of empty space on <br/>
that card..   I have dutifully updated your photo with your new stats, <br/>
but decided to skip any photo editing to show the "Big Bird" <br/>
being "Flipp(h)er"ed.<br/>
