                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey gang, have a great gathering.  We travelled to MI over Memorial <br/>
Day and won't be attending the gathering tomorrow.  Seeing our new <br/>
niece in Lansing prevailed when it came to setting the travelling <br/>
agenda<br/>
<br/>
In between holding a beautiful 2-day old girl, we managed to get out <br/>
and find two terrific series / serieses / serii (??).  The Jetsons <br/>
Series and Grand Woods Series are absolutely terrific carvings.  If <br/>
you're in Michigan's capital, these finds come highly recommended from <br/>
the M Clan.  Just bring your bug spray!  We had to forego Grand Woods <br/>
#4 because the hordes drove us out of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great time at the gathering.  Hope to see some of your stamps <br/>
in some Madison-area boxes and one of these days / years, we'll show <br/>
up at one, but us preachers have to work weekends.  We'll be over to <br/>
clean up the proverbial scraps on the park floor sometime this summer.<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>
Father M Clan<br/>
