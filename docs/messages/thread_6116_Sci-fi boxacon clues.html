<br>
Lighthouse Keeper and I are planning yet another trip out to Minooka this weekend to continue our collection of boxes from the boxacon. (And with any luck find the last LOST "Locke" box!)<br>
<br>
I know there have been several corrections and a couple of boxes re-planted, but I'm having a hard time keeping track of all of them? <br>
<br>
Aimlesst? Did you make corrections to the clues and re-post them?<br>
<br>
Does anyone have a consolidated list of corrections? <br>
<br>
Wish us luck!<br>
<br>
Love to all!<br>

We'll be using the original clues except for archeofrog's box and if we decide to make another attempt on Shards of Honor, we'll keep WFM/SSU's comment in mind.  To my knowledge, aimlesst hasn't updated that clue yet, nor moved the box.<br>
