We are the Wormy Wanderers from IL and are new to letterboxing. We <br/>
just started doing this a couple weeks ago, but we have really <br/>
enjoyed it so far.  Now that we have found a few boxes(only 10 so <br/>
far), we think we're ready to start placing some boxes of our own.  <br/>
We will definately let you all know when we've placed our first box <br/>
and we look forward to hearing some feedback on our hiding places (we <br/>
already have a few places in mind).  If there are any more <br/>
letterboxing gatherings in the near future, please let us know <br/>
because we would love to participate.  Thanks for the funs times and <br/>
we look forward to many more. <br/>

Welcome to letterboxing and to the Great Lakes group!    Sounds like you<br/>
have a good start both with finding some boxes and getting the ideas going<br/>
for some future plants.<br/>
<br/>
So far there has been one annual Great Lakes gathering each of the past two<br/>
years and it is tentatively planned for the second Saturday of June on an<br/>
annual basis -- assuming somebody volunteers to host each year.  In addition<br/>
to that there have been less formal gatherings in individual states and<br/>
cities when the mood strikes or if somebody if travelling and a bunch of<br/>
people decide to get together and meet up with them, etc.  Most of those<br/>
types of gatherings in any of the Great Lakes states would be mentioned here<br/>
on the list, so stay tuned!<br/>
