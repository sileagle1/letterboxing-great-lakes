We are the Wormy Wanderers from IL and are new to letterboxing. We <br>
just started doing this a couple weeks ago, but we have really <br>
enjoyed it so far.  Now that we have found a few boxes(only 10 so <br>
far), we think we're ready to start placing some boxes of our own.  <br>
We will definately let you all know when we've placed our first box <br>
and we look forward to hearing some feedback on our hiding places (we <br>
already have a few places in mind).  If there are any more <br>
letterboxing gatherings in the near future, please let us know <br>
because we would love to participate.  Thanks for the funs times and <br>
we look forward to many more. <br>

Welcome to letterboxing and to the Great Lakes group!    Sounds like you<br>
have a good start both with finding some boxes and getting the ideas going<br>
for some future plants.<br>
<br>
So far there has been one annual Great Lakes gathering each of the past two<br>
years and it is tentatively planned for the second Saturday of June on an<br>
annual basis -- assuming somebody volunteers to host each year.  In addition<br>
to that there have been less formal gatherings in individual states and<br>
cities when the mood strikes or if somebody if travelling and a bunch of<br>
people decide to get together and meet up with them, etc.  Most of those<br>
types of gatherings in any of the Great Lakes states would be mentioned here<br>
on the list, so stay tuned!<br>

Um, I think Delirium is hosting the next Great Lakes Gathering in the<br>
Detroit area next June 18th (2005).  "Mo boxing in Motown" I believe.<br>
