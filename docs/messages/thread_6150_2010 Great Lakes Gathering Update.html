                    <div class="plaintext-content">The polling for date options is completed and by a large majority the choice is to let the gathering host decide the date. So it will be up to the host to set a date, either by his choice or by a poll if he so wishes to let the group decide.<br>
<br>
As for host, two of the three groups are no longer interested in hosting so being that there is only one person/group expressing desire to host the gathering in IL in 2010, there is no need for a poll to choose, rather things are back on track with Matt Hart and party.<br>

Watch for further details from him!<br>

Thank you SpringChick for  your diligence and oversight of the annual Great <br>
Lakes Gathering over the years.  Who knew when you hosted the first <br>
gathering it would grow into such a huge  event! This gathering continues to draw <br>
huge numbers of boxers from all over the  region and beyond . . . they are a <br>
testament to your forethought and hospitality  in this wonderful hobby of <br>
ours.<br>
<br>
<br>
I’m so excited to be a part  of next years GLG and I’ve already let my <br>
excitement get the better of me. As my  enthusiasm grows over the next several <br>
months, I will be diligent as to not over  look any detail.<br>
<br>
<br>
This gathering is a joint  effort between Pitties, Shorty & myself. In <br>
getting to know P & S over  the past few years we’ve grown a good friendship and <br>
before even offering to  host we decided that each of us have different <br>
talents to offer each  complimenting the other, we should work well together in <br>
hosting GLG  2010!<br>
<br>
<br>
The one talent that none of  the three of us have is the talent of creating <br>
a web site. So, I’ve recruited  Nitrocat to create a web site for this <br>
gathering. Due to scheduling conflicts  the site wont be up until the beginning <br>
of next year.  Until  then, you can get information from AQ<br>
And from the Great Lakes  Yahoo Group where we will be adding <br>
files/databases over the next few  weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
THEME: Changing the World –  One Box at a Time<br>
<br>
<br>
About a year ago I sold off  my coin collection (about 15,000 coins) from <br>
all over the world. Coins are  little works of art in your pocket. Anything <br>
you can imagine has, at one time,  been minted on a coin somewhere in the <br>
world. Think people, leaders, landmarks,  animals, trees, plants, ships, <br>
planes, buildings, themes, abstract designs, etc  etc etc. <br>
<br>
<br>
In doing research for  something to carve & contribute you can do an image <br>
search for “World Coins  ______” and fill the blank with the image you are <br>
looking to carve. You can also  go to your library in the reference section <br>
and look through the Kruse Book of  World Coins that has pictures of every <br>
single coin minted from every country  going back to 1900 (and they also have <br>
a Pre-1900 book).<br>
<br>
<br>
Other than an “object of  interest” to carve, you can also think of <br>
countries of your ancestry, a  significant year for you or your family, a place <br>
you would like to visit or have  visited, etc. You can also ask me if I have <br>
any ideas or if you are having  trouble finding just the right coin for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you decide to contribute  a stamp image please contact Shorty on AQ or <br>
through this message board to let  him know what you are carving so that <br>
there are no duplicates. If you are able  to send the “whole package” or “box <br>
ready to plant” (stamp, logbook & box)  that would be wonderful and very <br>
helpful. However, if you can only send a stamp  or a stamp & logbook that would <br>
work out well as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
There will be no  limitations on your creativity, you can carve whatever <br>
size and image you want  to be stamped or inked up with whatever color(s) you <br>
want. Though, at gatherings  of this size monotone seems the quickest & <br>
easiest for large groups to stamp  into. I do ask that you try to carve the <br>
lettering on the coins. Letters do  scare off some people but you owe it to <br>
yourself to at least try, don’t worry if  they’re not perfect and if you <br>
totally mess them up just cut the words out  totally, but please do try.<br>
<br>
<br>
DATE: June 5,  2010<br>
<br>
<br>
This date was chosen for  two reasons #1 it follows the traditional date of <br>
the gathering – the weekend  after Memorial Day and #2 it works well for <br>
Shorty, Pitties &  myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
PLACE: Jubilee State Park  just north of Peoria, Illinois.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is a very large state  park that is somewhat centrally located for <br>
those of us who live here in  Illinois. They have shelters large enough to <br>
accommodate a group our size. Also,  it’s a park not many know about. Unlike <br>
Starved Rock or some other well known  parks I wanted to bring attention to a <br>
lesser known park that has only hosted  one letterbox (ever) that went <br>
missing before anyone found it. <br>
<br>
<br>
This park has granted  permission to hide boxes and leave them out for 2-3 <br>
weeks . . . not permanently L However, I’m sure a few may slip our mind when <br>
we are picking them  all up. ;-) <br>
<br>
<br>
Pitties, Shorty and I are  all thrilled to be hosting next years GLG, you <br>
can contact any of us if you have  any questions or thoughts. We will be <br>
looking into local hotels/camping etc, and  will let you all know how things <br>
progress over the next 8 months or  so.<br>

As soon as you find out anything on decent (ie: clean) campgrounds in the area, that would be great. Coming from out of state, we can only rely on word-of-mouth and online reviews for campgrounds. Can't go in person to check them out ourselves ahead of time. I'd like to make a reservation asap since I know they tend to fill up quickly if they are decent places. Thanks!<br>

That pretty much eliminates it as an option, since I'm too chicken to head out without knowing I'll have a place to sleep.  In your discussions with the people at Jubilee, you might see if they're willing to take reservations if we have a large enough group.  Just add this to what I'm sure is a long list of details to be hammered out!<br>

 From the website, it seemed that they need a 10 person min to get the <br>
group site ($4/per person with $40 min).  So that might work?  From the <br>
gatherings we attended (OH, IN notably), I'd put the number of campers <br>
in the ~10 tent range.  I think, and please correct me, that most of the <br>
campers do tents....so if we could get the group campsite that might <br>
work for most?  I'd be curious about number with IL hosting. When nearby <br>
WI hosted, the number of campers was MUCH lower.<br>

Thanks, Lisa! I expect to hear from JSP soon with information on the exact # & type of camp sites available. In speaking with the park a few months ago, it sounded like there was plenty of room for us. Motel information is being compiled as well. Thanks for your patience.<br>

The camping table listed on the DNR site is misleading. It lists the<br>
facilities available for all DNR properties. I was told Jubilee has Type<br>
A, B/S & C available. No reservations are accepted. Rest assured, we<br>
will continue to work on the lodging details and will try to encourage<br>
the park to accept a group reservation. <br>

So, I actually shot an email off to the park to see if (A) the group <br>
site was available (B) the cost and (C) reservation details [I guess I'm<br>
<br>
assuming you can reserve the group site?]<br>

Even if the park absolutely will not allow reservations for pop-ups, if you have suggestions for other nearby clean (reserveable) sites, that would be great. I'm another one who won't take a chance hauling a camper all that way without a reservation.<br>
