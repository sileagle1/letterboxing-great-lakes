                    <div class="plaintext-content">Do check the rules about firewood, but as a Master Gardener who is from the <br>
 epicenter of the Emerald Ash Borer area, please do not transport any  <br>
firewood from your home to a campground.  All of the original  borer hotspots in <br>
the Upper Peninsula can be traced back to campground areas  where people <br>
unknowingly moved firewood.  See <br>
_http://www.emeraldashborer.info/surveyinfo.cfm_ (http://www.emeraldashborer.info/surveyinfo.cfm)  for  more info.  10 <br>
states and Canada are now involved with upwards of 10  million trees dead or <br>
dying.<br>
 <br>
I know that taking your own firewood saves quite a few bucks, but the  <br>
economic costs are huge to the region as a whole.  Ask one of my  mother's <br>
neighbors who got hit with a $10,000 bill to remove their dead/dying  trees from <br>
their yard.  And, no, insurance doesn't cover it.<br>
 <br>
Thanks!<br>
