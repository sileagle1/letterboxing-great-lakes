I just returned from God's Country and report the 2005 letterboxing season has officially <br>
begun for me!<br>
<br>
The weather was absolutely perfect Saturday and Sunday.  We left Indy Friday and ate <br>
dinner at a new restaurant in Chicago, Hacienda del Sol ... 53rd and Pulaski.  Not a Metra <br>
stop, but near Midway and the Orange Line EL.  We know the owners and perhaps a <br>
letterbox will appear in the future?!?  We had the Parrillada, tried grilled cactus, and the <br>
dessert ... a chocolate cake with flan ... ooh.<br>
<br>
Well, On to Wisconsin!  We met up with our good friend and introduced him to <br>
letterboxing with The Dragon's Deutsche Letterbox.  The combination of hiking in a <br>
beautiful location with historical interest and challenging clues made for a memorable <br>
experience for all.  Even reluctant dh was sorry we didn't have clues for more letterboxes <br>
with us on Saturday.  We'll return for the MCP series later!  Quite a rush to find a box with <br>
my rusty German translation.<br>
<br>
This morning we travelled to get the PI Day Series and the ??? Mystery Box.  We wanted to <br>
get out early to avoid being seen.  Springin' forward sleepy heads still at home.  Thank <br>
you, Dragon, for leaving the series out for me!  I think I might be the first out-of-stater to <br>
log in!  I was thinking of a couple of more stamps ... perhaps ... Pickle Chiffon PI and <br>
Sweetie PI?  As time was short, I had to skip Triangles Triangles Everywhere.  I see I need <br>
to find that old TI-30.  I knew I was in trouble when I found the green box and it looked <br>
like the "WBSC" had been rubbed off the top and I couldn't find a trace of the number "on <br>
top".  I did find 7-digit serial number and the phone number, but I couldn't convince my <br>
dh that we could successfully complete this series before 11:00 am.  I'll be baaack.<br>
<br>
Happy boxing 2005!<br>
