I believe the poll allows you to change your vote at any time, and won't<br>
count it as a multiple vote.  So anyone who wants to change their vote<br>
should be able to do so.<br>

Nope, didn't have that problem.  When I looked at the patch pictures, they<br>
were labled, so I voted for #1, the dark green one.<br>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br>
