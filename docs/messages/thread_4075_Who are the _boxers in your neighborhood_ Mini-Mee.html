of boxers. We had visitors stop by unexpected and a core group for the <br>
entire time. The TESS box lived up to the hype; the stamps are amazing <br>
as well as the coolest box I've ever seen! <br>
<br>
It ended up being perfect weather to sit in a beautiful park stamping <br>
and chatting. Lots of boxes were found before and after and even new <br>
boxers were run into and exchanges gathered. Lots of fun. Cooties even <br>
reared their sneaky little heads... I'm sure they'll be at Columbus <br>
too! :o)<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone who attended. I loved meeting all the new boxers and <br>
seeing all my old friends. May more gather at the next Who are <br>
the 'boxers in your neighborhood? gathering!<br>
<br>
Watch for photos which will be coming soon.<br>
