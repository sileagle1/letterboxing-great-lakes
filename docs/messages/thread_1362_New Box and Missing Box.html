                    <div class="plaintext-content">The bad news is, today we checked on Say Yes to Michigan and <br>
discovered it to be missing.  A search of the area failed to turn it <br>
up.  We will be replacing it ASAP -- I will report back when it's back <br>
in service.  Fortunately we had recently taken digital photographs of <br>
the log entries so far, and will be printing them out and placing them <br>
in the new log to provide continuity.<br>
<br>
The good news is that we placed a new box today, our first regular old <br>
non-micro, non-hitcher box.  It's called Giant Coaster and is located <br>
in Lake Lansing Park South, Haslett, Michigan.<br>
