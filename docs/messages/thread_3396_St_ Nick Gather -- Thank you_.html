                    <div class="plaintext-content">It appears yahoo lost my thank you message sent last night (oh, <br/>
great, now I look like an ingrate...).  Usually I am the first to <br/>
comment on a gathering I attend, since most of the time I end up <br/>
having to leave early.  This time I was amongst the last to leave <br/>
(Beetle was last to pay her dinner bill).  I got home 10 pm last <br/>
night on a letterbox high - today I think I have a letterbox <br/>
hangover!  So much fun shouldn't be legal...!<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...it seems a bunch of messages I sent were lost (did I send them <br/>
to the wrong yahoo group??).  I posted some pics in the photos <br/>
section.  I also logged "Nuts2U" on AQ &amp; LbNA.  No, the clues aren't <br/>
clues.  I just put the recipe for peanut brittle in there for fun.  <br/>
What else did I say?  Hmmm...something hostile about the hiding place <br/>
of a certain hostal (just kidding!  My husband didn't make any <br/>
comments, so his boots I borrowed must not have smelled too nasty.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for a fun day!  I haven't had so much fun in the snow <br/>
since that blizzard back in the 60's when we had a snow day and Route <br/>
66 was closed down to a footpath and the snowdrifts were so high we <br/>
were able to climb onto the roof of our (one story ranch) house <br/>
without a ladder.<br/>
<br/>
So, what's next on the agenda?<br/>
<br/>
--klk/fw, who is cutting and pasting this message into Outlook for <br/>
safe keeping in case yahoo screws up again!<br/>
