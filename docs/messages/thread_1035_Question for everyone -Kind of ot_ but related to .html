                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everybody!<br>
Was wondering if any of you know, or have run across<br>
any hiking/walking groups in the Racine-Kenosha area<br>
during your letterboxing excursions.  <br>
I'm looking to do some hiking for exercise (doctor's<br>
orders) and I want to go in a group where there is<br>
safety in numbers and that meets at least once a week<br>
to walk the paths and trails around here.<br>
Unfortunately, I don't get my heart rate up for long<br>
enough when I LB. Too much stopping to see if I'm on<br>
track. <br>
The closest hiking group I have heard of is a group my<br>
mother-in-law used to walk with before she moved to<br>
CO, but that is in Waukesha and it's a bit too far for<br>
me to drive so I can walk.<br>
If anybody has any info I'd love to have it...and if<br>
anyone is interested to join, I'm almost at the point<br>
where I'm ready to start one just so I get off my tush<br>
and get out of the house.<br>
Thanks bunches!<br>

Hi Everybody!<br>
Was wondering if any of you know, or have run across<br>
any hiking/walking groups in the Racine-Kenosha area<br>
during your letterboxing excursions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hi!<br>
<br>
We belong to the same hiking group as your mother-in-law (she's still a<br>
member and hikes with us whenever she is back to visit in Wisconsin).  Most<br>
of our hikes are within a certain driving radius of Milwaukee.  Our club has<br>
5 hikes each week, but most are closer to Milwaukee than Racine.  However we<br>
do occasionally hike in Racine and even further south in Illinois.   We also<br>
have some hiking weekends planned in Western Wisconsin (Perot State Park at<br>
the end of April and Wyalusing State Park in mid-June).  Anyone is welcome<br>
to join us as a guest on any of our club hikes.  For more info on the club<br>
and to see our current hikes schedule, check here:<br>
http://www.homestead.com/wisconsingohiking/  We'd certainly welcome any<br>
fellow-letterboxers on these hikes!<br>
<br>
I am aware of one hiking club in the Racine/Kenosha area because they asked<br>
permission to copy several of our forms and procedures when they established<br>
their group.  It is primarily geared towards retirees, but they followed our<br>
club's policy and welcome anyone as a guest on their hikes.  You can contact<br>
Marge Miller for more info on the Racine group:  milgeog@execpc.com   I<br>
believe they may hike indoors during the winter months, but outdoors on a<br>
weekly basis during the other seasons.<br>
