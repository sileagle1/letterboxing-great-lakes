Thanks so much for asking for suggestions, it shows those of us who<br/>
have been boxing for some time that you are a "serious" new boxer (vs<br/>
'casual' ie: not interested in the details kind of boxer)<br/>
<br/>
1. I would suggest checking out the NewBoxers yahoogroup. There are NO<br/>
DUMB QUESTIONS on that site and it is FULL of good info for beginners.<br/>
Here is the link: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
2. Check out the FAQ (frequently asked questions) area on the<br/>
letterboxing.org site. Here is the link:<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/faq/newSite.html<br/>
<br/>
3. Silent Doug has a ton of info on his site that you might find<br/>
useful, just go to his homepage and follow the links, it's one of the<br/>
places I used as a resource when I started letterboxing. Here is the<br/>
link: http://www.letterboxing.info/<br/>
<br/>
4. I see someone else has already replied to your post and suggested<br/>
that you allow the kids to "find" the box once you are at the site.<br/>
That is a great way to encourage their participation, but I would add<br/>
one note to that info ... DO NOT LET KIDS RE-HIDE THE BOX WITHOUT<br/>
SUPERVISION! Please, please, please ... make sure the box is always<br/>
put back at least as well hidden as it was found. <br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome to letterboxing and it's great to have another MI group<br/>
join the community of letterboxers. Do you mind telling what part of<br/>
MI you live (or plan to box) in?<br/>
<br/>
Sail on!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would just like to add to this that while letting the kids find the boxes is fun for them, makes them feel involved and successful, be sure at least one adult is close enough to see *exactly* how the box was hidden before the child removed it.  One of the biggest problems letterboxers complain of is boxes not being replaced and rehidden carefully and in the right spot, which can make them more vulnerable to accidental discovery and disappearance.  Many people feel that children retrieving and replacing boxes is a significant contributor to this problem.  So let the kids be involved and *discover* the box, etc. but please be sure you were there and before you walk away, be sure that the box is replaced and rehidden as good as, if not better than it was found.<br/>
