Once teams grasp the basics it's off to the great outdoors for <br/>

I am just curious as about the placers of these geocaches. I <br/>
understand that nothing is homemade in them, but these people still <br/>
have to take the time to hide the box and place the items in it. <br/>
Aren't they worried about their boxes being ruined, just as <br/>
letterboxers are? <br/>

I agree. I think it's a wonderful way for the kids to learn about the <br/>
outdoors. A great way for them to be able to identify poison ivy <br/>
too : ) I wish I would have known about this hobby when I was a Girl <br/>
Scout leader. I definitely would have exposed my troop to it. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That brings up a good question: why geocaching and not letterboxing?  I guess geocachers prefer their hobby and we prefer letterboxing.  Seldom do you meet someone who does both; like Cinemaboxers.  But GS camps usually stress 'stay on the trails,' so I'm not sure why either.  I think the clue writing would be part of the activity fun. Also, the GPS units cost money and to give only one unit to a group isn't much fun if there is a large troop and the others just tag along and wonder about till one or two people sharing the GPS unit pin point the location and find the box.  I've seen groups trampling an area marching around through all sorts of wild flowers and poison ivy too, with only one goal....find the box. <br/>
<br/>
As a letterboxer first who has tried both hobbies, I guess I feel that letterboxing is more environmentally friendly...and we should keep that in mind when placing boxes.  <br/>

The Chicago council is discussion plans for a geocaching program.  Whatever?<br/>

they need something new to keep their attention. <br/>

I totally agree with the no-impact/leave no trace advantages to <br/>
letterboxing that someone else mentioned.  I would hope that the BS <br/>
adult leaders would be sure to stress that this is still part of the <br/>
scouting code of conduct (HOPE)!<br/>

exactly how I thought Boy/Cub Scouts would feel about letterboxing, until we<br/>
did a letterboxing-themed parent/pal weekend with Cub Scouts back in<br/>
April.  Like you, I've staffed numerous Cub and Boy Scout camps and thought<br/>
I knew the market well enough to know it wouldn't be well-received, which is<br/>
why I never bothered to ask the Council about putting boxes on camp until<br/>
there were already caches.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's all how you present it as to whether boys get excited about<br/>
letterboxing.  If you tell them it's art, they'll turn their noses up, if<br/>
you tell them the art side is a necessary part of a treasure hunt game,<br/>
they'll go with you on it.  At our event, all the Cub Scouts received<br/>
hand-carved stamps by someone else. 150 boys - 30 at a time - made carving<br/>
tools seem like a bad idea, but the boys were terribly upset they didn't get<br/>
to play with the sharp instruments - errr, I mean carve their own<br/>
stamps. They did make their own logbooks.  We told them the stamp and the<br/>
book were tools for the rest of the events for the day.  After they had<br/>
those two things, they were good to go.  I was even amazed at how many of<br/>
the Boy Scout staffers came to my station during their off-time to make a<br/>
logbook and carve a stamp for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I think what ultimately made it a huge success was that the boys realized<br/>
they were on an even footing with any of the adults there - they were<br/>
learning compass skills and other navigation skills all day that helped them<br/>
be able to read clues for themselves and figure them out as well as any<br/>
grown up.  In fact, if they found all 13 boxes, there was a 14th for them -<br/>
with spoken clues only.  They came to me and I said the clues to them in<br/>
riddle form, and they had to remember it and figure it out.  The boys got it<br/>
long before the dads did!  I just don't think they could've gotten the same<br/>
sense of satisfaction from geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
I see the bit about the tech-y side of geocaching, but when you can't put a<br/>
GPSr in every boy's hands, it starts losing its fun value.  And then when<br/>
most the caches planted aren't trade caches (only about 20% in our area have<br/>
trades, and none of them on scout camp do), what's the fun in all that<br/>
hunting, just to write your name and move on to the next?<br/>
<br/>
And all this reminds me - I have a few of those boxes that still need to be<br/>
hidden in the general wild.  The logbooks still have the stamp entries of<br/>
the boys in them and each box has a FF prize in it.  I wonder if any of you<br/>
Great Lakes Scouter/Letterboxers would be interested in taking a box and<br/>
planting it near YOUR scout camp?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree!  Letterboxing is more of an artistic endeavor.  That's what the Girl Scouts like about it.  However, I've been teaching and stressing this is for older girls, not Brownies and Daisy Girl Scouts.  They just can't keep a secret about the location of a box.  They are too young to understand how to use a compass.  Most of them can't even read yet.  <br/>
<br/>
But give the older girls the opportunity to design a signature stamp on paper with a lead pencil, transfer rub it to a piece of rubber, and hand them a Speedball cutter, and they get really excited!  Logbooks can be simple; blank index cards with punched holes tied with fancy yarns seem to work well.  Some girls (and some adults) get hooked instantly, while others will only attempt to find one box and then give up.  <br/>
<br/>
But I have been telling leaders they can use this type of activity with younger Scouts at camp, but I recommend that they call it a treasure hunt and not mention letterboxing or the Internet where the clues are posted for more boxes in their communities.  <br/>
<br/>
Most councils want to know what is being placed on their property which is a good idea.  Then the caretaker is aware and doesn't clean them up.  But one bit of advice is this....clues to boxes should be part of a camp program with a check out binder containing clues and information about the hobby.  I still might not mention <br/>
LbNA or AQ because you can't control the age of the scouts using the binder.  <br/>
<br/>
But NEVER post the clues and the locations to the Scout camps on the internet!!!  Most camps are not even listed in the phone books because Scout camps are private property and we are more concerned about intruders on the property while troops are camping.  Best to be cautious.  <br/>
<br/>
But it's good to hear that BS enjoy this hobby like the GS do.  <br/>
<br/>
As for caching....those units are expensive an compasses are more practical for groups of Scouts.  <br/>

&gt; I see the bit about the tech-y side of geocaching, but when you can't <br/>
&gt; put a<br/>
&gt; GPSr in every boy's hands, it starts losing its fun value. And then when<br/>
&gt; most the caches planted aren't trade caches (only about 20% in our <br/>
&gt; area have<br/>
&gt; trades, and none of them on scout camp do), what's the fun in all that<br/>
&gt; hunting, just to write your name and move on to the next?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And all this reminds me - I have a few of those boxes that still need <br/>
&gt; to be<br/>
&gt; hidden in the general wild. The logbooks still have the stamp entries of<br/>
&gt; the boys in them and each box has a FF prize in it. I wonder if any of you<br/>
&gt; Great Lakes Scouter/Letterboxers would be interested in taking a box and<br/>
&gt; planting it near YOUR scout camp?<br/>

&gt;   I'm a boy scout leader myself, and our camp here in Texas has <br/>
some caches,<br/>
&gt;   but they aren't listed publicly because they aren't publicly <br/>
accessible. In<br/>
&gt;   fact, getting approval to place them was difficult because the <br/>
Scout<br/>

without<br/>
&gt;   permission to try to find them and that would have been <br/>
unacceptable from a<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   But here's what I wonder, and I've never gotten a good answer - <br/>
why WOULD<br/>
&gt;   scouts choose geocaching over letterboxing? I've geocached a <br/>
little myself<br/>
&gt;   in addition to letterboxing, and in my opinion letterboxing does <br/>
a much<br/>
&gt;   better job of teaching valued outdoor skills like orienteering, <br/>
compass<br/>
&gt;   reading, field recognition, and landmark navigation. Always been <br/>

course<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; Limited to 13 teams. Course is held at the Boy Scouts of <br/>
America Camp<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; Indian Trails on North River Road in Janesville.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; I am just curious as about the placers of these geocaches. I<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; understand that nothing is homemade in them, but these <br/>
people still<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; have to take the time to hide the box and place the items in <br/>
it.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; Aren't they worried about their boxes being ruined, just as<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; Let's just hope the next class to be offered <br/>

&gt; about your description is that it is&gt; exactly how I thought Boy/Cub Scouts<br/>
&gt; would feel about letterboxing, &gt; until we&gt; did a letterboxing-themed<br/>
&gt; parent/pal weekend with Cub Scouts back in&gt; April. Like you, I've staffed<br/>
&gt; numerous Cub and Boy Scout camps and thought&gt; I knew the market well enough<br/>
&gt; to know it wouldn't be well-received, &gt; which is&gt; why I never bothered to<br/>
&gt; ask the Council about putting boxes on camp until&gt; there were already<br/>
&gt; caches.&gt;&gt; I think it's all how you present it as to whether boys get excited<br/>
&gt; about&gt; letterboxing. If you tell them it's art, they'll turn their noses up,<br/>
&gt; if&gt; you tell them the art side is a necessary part of a treasure hunt game,&gt;<br/>
&gt; they'll go with you on it. At our event, all the Cub Scouts received&gt;<br/>
&gt; hand-carved stamps by someone else. 150 boys - 30 at a time - made carving&gt;<br/>
&gt; tools seem like a bad idea, but the boys were terribly upset they &gt; didn't<br/>
&gt; get&gt; to play with the sharp instruments - errr, I mean carve their own&gt;<br/>
&gt; stamps. They did make their own logbooks. We told them the stamp and the&gt;<br/>
&gt; book were tools for the rest of the events for the day. After they had&gt;<br/>
&gt; those two things, they were good to go. I was even amazed at how many of&gt;<br/>
&gt; the Boy Scout staffers came to my station during their off-time to make a&gt;<br/>
&gt; logbook and carve a stamp for themselves.&gt;&gt; I think what ultimately made it<br/>
&gt; a huge success was that the boys realized&gt; they were on an even footing with<br/>
&gt; any of the adults there - they were&gt; learning compass skills and other<br/>
&gt; navigation skills all day that &gt; helped them&gt; be able to read clues for<br/>
&gt; themselves and figure them out as well as any&gt; grown up. In fact, if they<br/>
&gt; found all 13 boxes, there was a 14th for them -&gt; with spoken clues only.<br/>
&gt; They came to me and I said the clues to them in&gt; riddle form, and they had<br/>
&gt; to remember it and figure it out. The boys &gt; got it&gt; long before the dads<br/>
&gt; did! I just don't think they could've gotten the same&gt; sense of satisfaction<br/>
&gt; from geocaching.&gt;&gt; I see the bit about the tech-y side of geocaching, but<br/>
&gt; when you can't &gt; put a&gt; GPSr in every boy's hands, it starts losing its fun<br/>

&gt; about 20% in our &gt; area have&gt; trades, and none of them on scout camp do),<br/>

I'll be at BS for LEAP.  Still not sure how to get there but that's just one of those details that I'll figure out later.  If I leave my house at a time and avoid the rush hour traffic periods, it will probably take 3 hours to get there, that is if I don't get lost.  I've decided NOT to teach any more letterboxing workshops.  I once thought I was helping to educate adults who would have gone hiking and seeking boxes with their children or troops anyway, so I may as well teach them the 'rules.'  Now, I'm not sure and I've decided to go back underground and keep letterboxing a secret.  Too many boxes are missing, damaged, doodled in...enough is enough.  <br/>

  &gt; &gt; &gt; I am just curious as about the placers of these geocaches. I<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; understand that nothing is homemade in them, but these <br/>
  people still<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; have to take the time to hide the box and place the items in <br/>
  it.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Aren't they worried about their boxes being ruined, just as<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are?<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's just hope the next class to be offered <br/>
  isn't "Letterboxing<br/>
  &gt; &gt; &gt; races for the family" :-P<br/>
