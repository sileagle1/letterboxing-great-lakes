Sunny, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The same decision making challenges face all of us from time to time.  That's because we are 'artists' and we're not always satisfied with how our conceptual ideas translate to a finished project.  If this helps you, and others, the only rule is.....do your best!  We won't know where the mistakes are.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, it's best to keep it simple.  Once, I was asked to participate in a Beatles LTC exchange based on album art and our favorite song.  I choose.....the white album.   The LTC was a plain white card.  ROFLOL!!!  Of course there was one stamp hand carved stamp...the name "The Beatles" stamped in the lover corner in light gray ink.  It was very affective.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sunny, your best effort is all that is necessary.  We were there at the GLG 2010.  We all know what a muddy boot represents.....good times on the trails looking for letterboxes.  <br/>

I am struggling with what do about my task to carve a "boot" stamp - as in "boot-sucking mud". I have a 3-d boot I've done with mastercarve that I carved on three sides, but for structural integrity reasons I can't carve the other three sides. The design is rather simple and not the cleanest carve. But the concept is a hoot IMHO. I have found a clipart image that would challenge my skills, but I think is doable.

I do regret, though, on my last trip to JCSP that I didn't collect a couple <br/>
 "baggies" of dirt from the trails -- that one might use as "finger paint" <br/>
on  their LTCs.<br/>

Right now we seem to be holding at 18 participants.  Unless I hear from anyone else in the next few days, we'll be closing the project at that number.<br/>
