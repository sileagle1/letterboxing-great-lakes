Would it be possible to have the set of images posted in a photo album?<br>
(Would that ruin the surprise for anyone who might be seeking the series one<br>
day?)  Perhaps just send the files to those who might request seeing them?<br>
I'd be willing to facilitate that route if you've got too much else going on<br>
right now.  If you send them to me, I could handle forwarding them to anyone<br>
else interested in seeing them, without creating the "spoiler" of posted<br>
images.  <br>

Thanks to everyone who mailed me their TESS stamps.  I have a pile of <br>
<br>
packages here from the past week or so and have not yet a chance to go <br>
<br>
through them.  I will try to get to them this week and let everyone <br>
<br>
know their stamp arrived safely.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
If you have not yet sent your stamp, please do so as soon as possible <br>
<br>
as I would like to get these over to She Who Plants within the next <br>
<br>
couple of weeks and get it off my plate.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmm, that is a nice idea.  I had tried to do that with the GL Letterbox Exchange project a while back and some people sent me images of their stamps and others said their image would be coming and some wanted to be included but forgot to send an image, so rather than having an incomplete set, I just didn't do it at all.  But this time I would actually have all the stamps in my possession.<br>
<br>
Funguswoman, I will contact you off list about this because I don't know that I would have the time right now, but perhaps we can work something out.<br>
