Here is what one of the local radio stations just emailed me:<br/>
<br/>
"Governor Mitch Daniels has declared a State of  Emergency for Brown, Shelby, <br/>
Johnson, Putnam, Vigo and Owen  Counties due to devastating flood conditions. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boone, Hamilton, Madison, Clinton, Tipton, Delaware,  Henry, Carroll, Clay, <br/>
Greene, Lawrence,  Owen, Vermillion, and Vigo  counties have been placed under <br/>
a Flash Flood Warning.<br/>
<br/>
A flood  warning remains in effect for the counties of:  Marion,  Hendricks, <br/>
Hancock, Morgan, Johnson, Shelby, Monroe, Putnam, Rush, Decatur,  Bartholomew, <br/>
Brown, Clay, Greene, Owen, and Vigo  counties.<br/>
<br/>
Safety officials urge you to  remain at home and to avoid driving through <br/>
flooded areas, running water can  easily wash away the heaviest of vehicles."<br/>
<br/>
Indianapolis is most of Marion County, but though we  have had a lot of rain <br/>
in the last 8 days or so, our house is fine and what  water does build up near <br/>
the street in our neighborhood stays there until it  recedes so no damages <br/>
for us.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the concern.  Lots of flooding north of I-70 on both sides of<br/>
the state.  Historic covered bridge destroyed in Rush County last week by<br/>
a tornado.  Another tornado struck in Lawrence (NE Indy).  Not really sure<br/>
if the corn will be knee-high-by-the Fourth-of-July.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be going to work in Indy tomorrow - I'll check out the creeks and<br/>
river levels along I-70, east of Indy.  Much of the land 30 miles out of<br/>
Indianapolis is still rural.  Pray for the farmers and their work, and<br/>
those who have lost homes from tornadoes and flooding.<br/>
<br/>
The weather is in the 90's here and so it is very sticky.  The grass is<br/>
really green, which last year suffered greatly due to the lack of rain.<br/>
