Here at "WXRP in Cincinnati," we interrupt this program to inform you that Tiptoe has been <br>
sent to the "ER" at "General Hospital" following a collapse she suffered at her "House."  It is <br>
unclear exactly what her "State of Mind" was when she was taken away.  Witnesses say she <br>
opened her email first thing this morning and let out an unearthly shriek and fainted.  We <br>
know she has been to "Hell's Kitchen" and back throughout this Bingo ordeal.  Admittedly, <br>
she has sometimes acted like a "Jackass"  about being "Dead Last" in Bingo, and Tonto has <br>
considered a "Wife Swap," but none of us wish her ill.  The doctors have temporarily placed <br>
her in a padded "Romper Room" until they can understand what she is trying to say...We will <br>
keep you informed with any updates if she recovers enough to "Meet the Press."<br>

WWWWWHHHHHAAAAAAAATTTTTT?????<br>

Yipes, Tiptoe!  I hope all is well and we don't have to wait "60 <br>
Minutes" to hear news from your "House" .   Do you have any broken <br>
"Bones"?  Are your "Numbers" up?  Did LunaGirl help you play "Match <br>
Game" with your bingo board?<br>

Tiptoe,<br>
<br>
Your story is going to turn us all into "Mad Men"--"Without a Trace" <br>
of any evidence of today's BINGO outcome!  Did you finally get a hit, <br>
or are you approaching the "Eleventh Hour"?  Are we going to have to <br>
consult "The Mentalist" or the "Ghost Whisperer" to find the answer??<br>

"Whoopi!"  I have recovered enough to let you know that at "Daybreak" I chose my TV word <br>
first before bringing myself to look upon Spring Chick's word (that I was certain I wasn't <br>
going to have.)  My word today was "Prison Break"!  <br>
<br>
"Yes Dear," I am happy to say that I was "Touched by an Angel," a lesser known, but no <br>
less powerful celestial being -  the wonderful Lunagirl!  Thanks to her I have escaped "The <br>
Reaper's" grip and am now headed for "7th Heaven"!!!  I must admit, I thought I was <br>
"Grounded for Life," and that the "Good Times" were never going to return.   I know that at <br>
times I acted like "Men Behaving Badly," for which I'm truly sorry.  But please know that I <br>
really tried to show more of an attitude resembling "Grace Under Fire."<br>
<br>
With this word, I can officially BEGIN the game and join Letterboxing Bingo players <br>
worldwide in taking a "Quantum Leap" toward winning the prize!  However, I am mindful, <br>
like all of you, that I have to take this game  "One Day at a Time." <br>
<br>
Spring Chick, I knew I couldn't lose my "Faith and Hope" in you even though you were <br>
"Less Than Perfect" at word drawing.  You are back in good favor and definitely one of my <br>
favorite "Heroes"!<br>

With this word, I can officially BEGIN the game and join Letterboxing Bingo<br>
players <br>
worldwide in taking a "Quantum Leap" toward winning the prize! However, I am<br>
mindful, <br>
like all of you, that I have to take this game "One Day at a Time." <br>
<br>
Spring Chick, I knew I couldn't lose my "Faith and Hope" in you even though<br>
you were <br>
"Less Than Perfect" at word drawing. You are back in good favor and<br>
definitely one of my <br>
favorite "Heroes"!<br>
Tiptoe..feeling "The Comeback" taking hold!<br>
