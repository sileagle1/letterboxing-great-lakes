I've never heard of bookcrossing.com but it sounds like fun.  How do you get the clues to find books?  Too bad your boxes are in WI and I'm in OH.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A group of boxers, including aimlesst and LibraryGrrl, created a series of book-related boxes on a bike trail way back in July 2007.  They seeded the trail with 12 boxes and a few boxes were added the following year.  They encouraged others to add to the series and SunnySideUp took up the challenge.  She has planted 8 more boxes so far.  One of the most recent ones included a stamp carved by ArchaeoFrog and a description of a book we weren't familiar with - "The Invention of Hugo Cabret".  It sounded intriguing so I got it from the library yesterday.  Both Martini Man & I have already finished reading it and we recommend it if you are interested in an unusual & fun book!<br>
<br>
Here's a link to the box clue:<br>

<br>
Thanks to both ArchaeoFrog and SSU for bringing this book to our attention!<br>
