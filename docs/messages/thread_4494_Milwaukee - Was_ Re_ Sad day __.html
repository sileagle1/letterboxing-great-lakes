Hi alls, I'm from Milwaukee and new(ish) to letterboxing. My take on it is this:<br/>
<br/>
I read about letterboxing in a local magazine. How else would I have found out about it? <br/>
Letterboxing needs exposure. It doesn't have to be a tight little ball of hardcore boxers <br/>
hellbent on keeping it "pure" somehow. There's nothing to "get" about it. It's really fun. <br/>
It's a past time. More people reading about it means more new letterboxers and <br/>
eventually more letterboxers that may even pass whatever standards makes them good <br/>
enough to be in the in group. Some boxes will get ruined. Just like some boxes get eaten <br/>
by squirrels or thrown out by random nonletterboxers. It's a hazardous hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, everything gets "ruined" eventually if you have that perspective on it...its like that <br/>
music band that you really loved when they were underground and then, ut oh, they "sold <br/>
out," became popular and now the new fans aren't good enough somehow or weren't there <br/>
for the beginning so they must not get it.<br/>
<br/>
At some level this all just becomes elitism.<br/>

&gt; Letterboxing must have come to the attention of Gannet news. There has<br/>
&gt; been another in the Indy area looking for letterboxers. Our town paper is<br/>
&gt; owned by Gannet so I expect my contact with Muncie probably won't be the<br/>
&gt; last. Loved your response, FungusWoman. Here is my reply:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Colleen:<br/>
&gt; I've given this great thought and I will decline the offer to participate<br/>
&gt; in your letterboxing article. My reasons for declining are based upon<br/>
&gt; your media counterparts' prior coverage and the ill effects upon my<br/>
&gt; beloved hobby. Trying to ask someone to explain the multi-facets of this<br/>
&gt; hobby with limited print space often results in omitting fundamental<br/>
&gt; practices of letterboxing. Desirable elements of letterboxing include<br/>
&gt; secrecy and discretion, and any publicity negates those aspects. Too <br/>
&gt; many articles have already been written that describe this as great family<br/>
&gt; activity. While that is not entirely false, new letterboxers often do not<br/>
&gt; know or understand many seasoned letterboxers play at a higher level and<br/>
&gt; continue to challenge one another to create increasingly difficult<br/>
&gt; letterboxes to solve and find. If you haven't already done research to<br/>
&gt; get a sense of what I'm saying, please continue to hunt. Promote the<br/>
&gt; mental challenge aspect. If you haven't already discovered the BSU<br/>
&gt; dissertation by Dr. Marisa Fuoti-Fink, you might read that. There is a<br/>
&gt; wealth of information already present on the internet for those willing to<br/>
&gt; do some research. The best advice I can offer is to go and participate on<br/>
&gt; several letterbox hunts by different letterboxers before you write your<br/>
&gt; article. Your work will be much richer with that perspective. I must<br/>
&gt; caution you, though, letterboxing is addictive. Good luck, ~speedsquare"<br/>

&gt; She sent her request out to at least several others, and she said she<br/>
&gt; didn't need me after all. She has been in contact with 2bentriders, so I<br/>
&gt; am hopeful she'll get some good direction and information.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to say it is not about keeping LG'ing secret, elitist or <br/>
anything like that.  It is simply about people who do not take time <br/>
to find out exactly what they are doing.  Taking "instructions" on <br/>
Letterboxing from the media as to how the hobby is generally done is, <br/>
well, rather foolish.  They cannot seem to present a balanced view of <br/>
anything and the fact that they would not let the letterboxer remain <br/>
anonymous is a bit much.  How come in other articles, they can <br/>
mention a "source", but not for this one?  Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
When we found out about Letterboxing a 2-3 years ago (not from the <br/>
media, but via WOM), I made a point of reading everything there was <br/>
available from the "Getting Started" section on the Letterboxing.org <br/>
site (was not aware of Atlasquest at the time).  Since then, they <br/>
have even posted the Letterboxing 101 in that section and it <br/>
clarifies most of the issues that newbies would have. And yes, when I <br/>
introduced a couple of other families to letterboxing in the last <br/>
year or so, I gave them copies of the Letterboxing 101 document, <br/>
explaining it will make their lbing more fun for them and for those <br/>
that come behind them.  They came with us a couple of times and then <br/>
they were off!<br/>
<br/>
Would one take up other skills without finding out what it is all <br/>
about first?  Most likely not.  I am not asking that they write a <br/>
paper, but use a little common sense when getting into a hobby that <br/>
involves other people and having a little respect.  Sadly, so much of <br/>
our society is selfish and self-centered, many of them could care <br/>
less about the box once they get what they came there for.  While <br/>
critter or weather damage happens, along with the random idiot child <br/>
who is bent on destruction of whatever they happen across, the rest, <br/>
I believe is mostly avoidable if people would simply take the time to <br/>
find out exactly what is expected of them.<br/>
<br/>
I often wonder if people who are just starting out and do not bother <br/>
to read up on the hobby figure that the Letterboxing fairy placed <br/>
these boxes out there and this same fairy will come back and re-hide <br/>
it properly?  Hmmm - could be similar to the geocachers who cannot <br/>
read the box labels that indicate that it is a letterbox and not a <br/>
geocache, but take the stamp anyway and leave a trinket behind...<br/>
<br/>
Another thought that I have in regards to the reporters is that they <br/>
seem to think this is a lo-tech version of geocaching or <br/>
something.  I think because geocaching involves an electronic device <br/>
that gets you most of the way there - no clue solving, no individual <br/>
hand carved stamp to see, etc. that it may be too hard for them to <br/>
wrap their brains around and write a quick article about.  I do not <br/>
mean to be insulting, but this does take a little more effort than <br/>
turning on a machine and plugging in some coordinates, KWIM?  And, <br/>
with the smallish area that most are allotted space for their <br/>
articles, there is more involved in the hobby than they are able to <br/>
put into a small piece - does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I really did not mean to rant here, but I get tired of hearing <br/>
that because we want the media to treat a hobby with respect and <br/>
write a thoughtful article that points people in the correct <br/>
direction for the hobby, that somehow, the letterboxing community is <br/>
snooty or something.  Hopefully, ya'll will be kind to me in your <br/>
responses and not nasty.  I am recovering from some bug and I know my <br/>
thoughts are probably not totally coherent here.<br/>
