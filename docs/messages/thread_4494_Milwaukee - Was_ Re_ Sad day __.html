<br>
Hi alls, I'm from Milwaukee and new(ish) to letterboxing. My take on it is this:<br>
<br>
I read about letterboxing in a local magazine. How else would I have found out about it? <br>
Letterboxing needs exposure. It doesn't have to be a tight little ball of hardcore boxers <br>
hellbent on keeping it "pure" somehow. There's nothing to "get" about it. It's really fun. <br>
It's a past time. More people reading about it means more new letterboxers and <br>
eventually more letterboxers that may even pass whatever standards makes them good <br>
enough to be in the in group. Some boxes will get ruined. Just like some boxes get eaten <br>
by squirrels or thrown out by random nonletterboxers. It's a hazardous hobby.<br>
<br>
Besides, everything gets "ruined" eventually if you have that perspective on it...its like that <br>
music band that you really loved when they were underground and then, ut oh, they "sold <br>
out," became popular and now the new fans aren't good enough somehow or weren't there <br>
for the beginning so they must not get it.<br>
<br>
At some level this all just becomes elitism.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to say it is not about keeping LG'ing secret, elitist or <br>
anything like that.  It is simply about people who do not take time <br>
to find out exactly what they are doing.  Taking "instructions" on <br>
Letterboxing from the media as to how the hobby is generally done is, <br>
well, rather foolish.  They cannot seem to present a balanced view of <br>
anything and the fact that they would not let the letterboxer remain <br>
anonymous is a bit much.  How come in other articles, they can <br>
mention a "source", but not for this one?  Go figure.<br>
<br>
When we found out about Letterboxing a 2-3 years ago (not from the <br>
media, but via WOM), I made a point of reading everything there was <br>
available from the "Getting Started" section on the Letterboxing.org <br>
site (was not aware of Atlasquest at the time).  Since then, they <br>
have even posted the Letterboxing 101 in that section and it <br>
clarifies most of the issues that newbies would have. And yes, when I <br>
introduced a couple of other families to letterboxing in the last <br>
year or so, I gave them copies of the Letterboxing 101 document, <br>
explaining it will make their lbing more fun for them and for those <br>
that come behind them.  They came with us a couple of times and then <br>
they were off!<br>
<br>
Would one take up other skills without finding out what it is all <br>
about first?  Most likely not.  I am not asking that they write a <br>
paper, but use a little common sense when getting into a hobby that <br>
involves other people and having a little respect.  Sadly, so much of <br>
our society is selfish and self-centered, many of them could care <br>
less about the box once they get what they came there for.  While <br>
critter or weather damage happens, along with the random idiot child <br>
who is bent on destruction of whatever they happen across, the rest, <br>
I believe is mostly avoidable if people would simply take the time to <br>
find out exactly what is expected of them.<br>
<br>
I often wonder if people who are just starting out and do not bother <br>
to read up on the hobby figure that the Letterboxing fairy placed <br>
these boxes out there and this same fairy will come back and re-hide <br>
it properly?  Hmmm - could be similar to the geocachers who cannot <br>
read the box labels that indicate that it is a letterbox and not a <br>
geocache, but take the stamp anyway and leave a trinket behind...<br>
<br>
Another thought that I have in regards to the reporters is that they <br>
seem to think this is a lo-tech version of geocaching or <br>
something.  I think because geocaching involves an electronic device <br>
that gets you most of the way there - no clue solving, no individual <br>
hand carved stamp to see, etc. that it may be too hard for them to <br>
wrap their brains around and write a quick article about.  I do not <br>
mean to be insulting, but this does take a little more effort than <br>
turning on a machine and plugging in some coordinates, KWIM?  And, <br>
with the smallish area that most are allotted space for their <br>
articles, there is more involved in the hobby than they are able to <br>
put into a small piece - does that make sense?<br>
<br>
Sorry, I really did not mean to rant here, but I get tired of hearing <br>
that because we want the media to treat a hobby with respect and <br>
write a thoughtful article that points people in the correct <br>
direction for the hobby, that somehow, the letterboxing community is <br>
snooty or something.  Hopefully, ya'll will be kind to me in your <br>
responses and not nasty.  I am recovering from some bug and I know my <br>
thoughts are probably not totally coherent here.<br>
