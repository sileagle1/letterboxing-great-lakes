Oh please, let us admit our beer faux pax - in our rush to come up with a "B" beer to go with bear we foolishly thought of BUD...those in St.Louis can hold onto that option for when a black bear shows up in there area!<br>
As for you, it would probably be more appropriate for your bear to have a Blatz...or Berling....<br>
