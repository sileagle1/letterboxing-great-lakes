                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you so much for checking.  There indeed were a few tornado sightings.  One was on the ground for 19 minutes just south of the area where Homer Lake is located.  One home that had stood for 116 years is a total loss.  The area is so relieved that the family was not home at the time.  Several other homes were damaged but there were no injuries.  Many fields are damaged and one can view the path of the tornado from overhead photos.<br/>
This area is often nicknamed tornado alley.  Some of you were able to see the twisted trees in the Maple Sugar Grove at Homer Lake from a tornado.  The town of Ogden has been hit several times - in 1936 my husband's great grand parents were killed in a tornado, in 1976 a tornado nearly wiped out the town of Ogden, and then again in 1996 the school and 80% of the houses were damaged.  Now in 2016.  I think we need to watch those years ending in a 6.<br/>
The Baird family feels blessed that no one was hurt.  Within 24 hours after the storm the family dog was rescued from the basement unharmed, one cat was found inside the rubble, and Brenda's wedding band was found.  Blessings like these at such a time of devastation give one hope and faith.<br/>
I am headed to Homer Lake to hike today to see how that area held up.  With 6.75 inches of rain in 8 hours, the creeks and river are probably up.  <br/>
