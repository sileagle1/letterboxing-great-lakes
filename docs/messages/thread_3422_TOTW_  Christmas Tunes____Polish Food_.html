&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~The 8 Polish Foods of Christmas--by VeggieTales<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (although the entire <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; CD is pretty funny--esp. all the commentary between<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; songs)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; OK, being part Polack, I've got to find out what these<br/>
&gt; &gt; are!! Is halupki on the list? :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Doodle Bug .<br/>
<br/>
Wow, I didn't realize there would be so much interest in Polish <br/>
Christmas foods--I guess VeggieTales knew what they were doing when <br/>
they wrote that song!!<br/>
<br/>
Here is the list of Polish foods included in the song, which is sung <br/>
by "Oscar, the Polish caterer" (along with some of the commentary <br/>
that the other people in the song give):<br/>
<br/>
1.  The first Polish Christmas dish I bring to the party--a boiled <br/>
potato topped with dill weed.<br/>
2.  Two steamed pierogies (What's a pierogi?  It's a dough, wrapped <br/>
around meat)<br/>
3.  Three simmered gwumpkies (What's a gwumpky?  It's a cabbage <br/>
wrapped around meat)<br/>
4.  Four baked paprikas (What is a paprika?  It's a bell pepper <br/>
stuffed with meat)<br/>
5.  Five smoked kielbasas  (What is a kielbasa?  It's pretty much <br/>
just meat)<br/>
6.  Six fried hoosecheekies (Let me guess--something in the meat <br/>
family?  Actually it's a delightful pastry with a thin flaky crust)<br/>
7.  Seven pitted prunes (I don't like prunes!  With this food, you'll <br/>
need 'em, son)<br/>
8.  Eight poppy seed cakes (Poppies--Poppies--Poppies.  I'm feeling <br/>
rather sleepy--there's no place like home...)<br/>
<br/>
So there you have the Eight Polish Foods of Christmas!!<br/>

  Wow. Just checking in and seeing the word pirogies. Just spent the <br/>
  entire day making them so they can be frozen and shipped off to <br/>
  family members who can't find them in their areas.<br/>
<br/>
  Potato<br/>
  Potato and cheese<br/>
  Sweet cheese<br/>
  Sauerkraut and mushroom<br/>
  Meat<br/>
  Blueberry<br/>
  Plum<br/>
  Cherry<br/>
  Okay, and the unconventional spinach - had some left over dough. We <br/>
  think we ended up with 50 DZ.<br/>
<br/>
  Tomorrow, I tackle the Potica!<br/>

  &gt; We always ate our pierogis with butter &amp; onions, but<br/>
  &gt; Mom always boiled the pierogis, never fried. I<br/>
  &gt; thought it very odd when I learned that people _fried_<br/>
  &gt; them. Then there was my father, who always ate them<br/>
  &gt; with butter, onions, and ketchup.<br/>

  &gt; &gt; I was going to pipe up that the Italian Christmas<br/>
  &gt; &gt; dishes weren't represented here until I saw my<br/>
  &gt; &gt; monkey journal teacher, Angel, talking about her fav<br/>
  &gt; &gt; way to eat pierogi!<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Mmmmmm - fried in butter &amp; onions - and no calories<br/>
  &gt; &gt; either!<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Now about the Italian dishes served Christmas Eve at<br/>

  &gt; &gt; I only like the potato, cheese and onion Pierogi. My<br/>
  &gt; &gt; mom eats hers with sour cream, but I like mine just<br/>
  &gt; &gt; fried in butter and onions. Recent Activity<br/>

better yet, play the squeeze box!<br/>

&gt; Oh but I don't like meat pierogies! They are nasty!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Could I have cheese please, with some cold applesauce???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In high school in California I used to work for a Polish bakery and we <br/>
were allowed to Eat all you want while at work and family could get <br/>
free pierogies... it was awesome. All the food was delicious, but I <br/>
think I had pierogies for lunch and dinner every day... ahhh, the <br/>
memories. All of them were good, but my favorite was the vegetable one!<br/>

&gt; You still haven't said what a Winkie is!  I'm curious!<br/>
<br/>
Am I the only one who's noticing the "Winkie" and "Hide the Pickle" <br/>
thread with the Polish food? Suspicious, that's all I'm saying. I keep <br/>
waiting for someone to say "hide the winkie" is a Polish tradition ... <br/>
ooops, did I say that?<br/>
