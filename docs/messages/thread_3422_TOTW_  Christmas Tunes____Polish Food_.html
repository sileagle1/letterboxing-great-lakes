Wow, I didn't realize there would be so much interest in Polish <br>
Christmas foods--I guess VeggieTales knew what they were doing when <br>
they wrote that song!!<br>
<br>
Here is the list of Polish foods included in the song, which is sung <br>
by "Oscar, the Polish caterer" (along with some of the commentary <br>
that the other people in the song give):<br>
<br>
1.  The first Polish Christmas dish I bring to the party--a boiled <br>
potato topped with dill weed.<br>
2.  Two steamed pierogies (What's a pierogi?  It's a dough, wrapped <br>
around meat)<br>
3.  Three simmered gwumpkies (What's a gwumpky?  It's a cabbage <br>
wrapped around meat)<br>
4.  Four baked paprikas (What is a paprika?  It's a bell pepper <br>
stuffed with meat)<br>
5.  Five smoked kielbasas  (What is a kielbasa?  It's pretty much <br>
just meat)<br>
6.  Six fried hoosecheekies (Let me guess--something in the meat <br>
family?  Actually it's a delightful pastry with a thin flaky crust)<br>
7.  Seven pitted prunes (I don't like prunes!  With this food, you'll <br>
need 'em, son)<br>
8.  Eight poppy seed cakes (Poppies--Poppies--Poppies.  I'm feeling <br>
rather sleepy--there's no place like home...)<br>
<br>
So there you have the Eight Polish Foods of Christmas!!<br>

In high school in California I used to work for a Polish bakery and we <br>
were allowed to Eat all you want while at work and family could get <br>
free pierogies... it was awesome. All the food was delicious, but I <br>
think I had pierogies for lunch and dinner every day... ahhh, the <br>
memories. All of them were good, but my favorite was the vegetable one!<br>

<br>
Am I the only one who's noticing the "Winkie" and "Hide the Pickle" <br>
thread with the Polish food? Suspicious, that's all I'm saying. I keep <br>
waiting for someone to say "hide the winkie" is a Polish tradition ... <br>
ooops, did I say that?<br>
