                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you so much Wisconsin Hiker. I can't believe I<br>
couldn't find my box. I thought I turned over any and<br>
every piece of forest debris that was moveable. What a<br>
relief! Please let me know if I can send you money to<br>
pay for the return shipment. I have a serious boxing<br>
hangover, I'm sad the Gathering was over so soon. I<br>
can't wait till next year, hopefully we can get you<br>
all to Minnesota. I've started a conversation with<br>
RedCat about hosting the event here in MN. Consider<br>
this the first formal request to have the Gathering<br>
here in 2007. If SpringChick doesn't see this email<br>
will someone please let her know.<br>
<br>
As far as the night boxing escapade with Jigsaw, it<br>
didn't happen. When we drove up to the entrance to the<br>
HH site there was a cop who had someone pulled over<br>
right in the entrance! We kept driving for a ways to<br>
give the nice officer time to finish what he was doing<br>
and then went back to give it another try. When we<br>
returned the coast was clear so we turned in. I saw a<br>
sign that said the park closes at 10 p.m. I know that<br>
if you're camping in some parks you can come and go as<br>
you please. Since we didn't have a pass for camping we<br>
decided to not try it. Last thing I needed on my<br>
vacation was a ticket or a tow. As we turned around<br>
and left we passed a cop going very slowly by us on<br>
the little side street. It appeared someone was having<br>
a party at one of the houses and they were probably<br>
there to check it out. I'm glad I made the right<br>
decision to leave because I know that he saw me pull<br>
into the <br>
HH site. I have no doubts had we gone in he would have<br>
been right behind us. Oh well, what can you do? I was<br>
ready to go though, I wanted to get those boxes!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Some other reflections on the Gathering. I agree with<br>
what Speedsquare said about Fri. and Sat. night. You<br>
all do seem like family to me now. When I arrived at<br>
the Brewhaus There was no one there yet, I was a<br>
little anxious so I got there about 45 mins. early. It<br>
was really cool to see faces roll in I had only seen<br>
in the pictures section of our Yahoo group. It was<br>
very easy to say hello and strike up conversations<br>
with anyone, you're all a very nice group of people.<br>
I'm glad to be part of such a warm, inviting crew.<br>
Even though we all live far apart from each other I<br>
feel like you're just down the road and I just might<br>
run into you on the trail sometime.<br>
<br>
<br>
The next gathering I attend I will be doing a few<br>
things different. 1. I probably won't teach a<br>
workshop, don't get me wrong, teaching the kids to<br>
juggle was ALOT of fun. I love to teach people how to<br>
juggle I get such a joy from it and I like to try to<br>
pass that on to others. 2. I need to box more! I only<br>
got 12 of the 40 boxes. Although being my first<br>
gathering I had alot of exchanges to do. I wish that I<br>
would have made more time to actually get out there<br>
and go boxing. I don't regret anything about this<br>
weekend, I had such a good time. Thank you again to<br>
Wisconsin Hiker and Martini Man for a superb<br>
gathering. Thank you to all my new "boxing family" for<br>
welcoming me into your circle of fun and friends. I<br>
have a feeling that I'll know you all for a very long<br>
time.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, in closing, a little favorite of mine to you all <br>
<br>
<br>
May the road rise up to meet you<br>
May the wind be always at your back<br>
May the sun shine warm upon your face<br>
And the rains fall soft upon your fields<br>
<br>
<br>
And until we meet again my friend<br>
Until we meet again<br>
May God hold you in the palm of his hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll see you soon.<br>
<br>
