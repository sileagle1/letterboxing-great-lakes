                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just want to say what an incredibly talented group you all are.  I <br>
learned so much.  <br>
<br>
Delirium's log book is in a class by itself--she's taken such care <br>
with the selection of the beautiful book itself, the calligraphy, the <br>
narrative, the mounting of the stamps and the layout of the <br>
pages.  I have never seen anything like it.<br>
<br>
I was impressed by the altered book examples, both "May I Have <br>
a Word with You"--great idea!--and the well executed "Bring Me a <br>
Unicorn"--beautifully detailed stamp and the book choice and log <br>
section were superb.<br>
<br>
The event stamps were incredibly witty and funny; I didn't know <br>
there could be so many variations on a theme.  Other non-event <br>
boxes added to the fun.<br>
<br>
The Vampire series by the Dragon and Team Taco rocks; just <br>
what I love--a long thematically based series characterized by an <br>
engaging story and clear clues, talented carving, delightful <br>
logbooks and boxes.  Everything spiced with cleverness and <br>
whimsy.<br>
<br>
For an hour we had an intent group with sharp implements <br>
huddling over their little pieces of plastic while SpringChick led <br>
them through a carving workshop.<br>
<br>
We got a first-hand look at one of Azobox' library microboxes <br>
before he places it.  Matt the Rat brought a tupperware box with <br>
magnets screwed to it.  FungusWoman brought lots of <br>
centrifuge tubes for everyone, so expect lots of microboxes to <br>
spring up throughout the Midwest. There were so many <br>
interesting things on the display tables, I won't reveal them all.<br>
<br>
Golden Boy said the food was delicious and there was more <br>
than enough to eat--and that's saying something for him. He <br>
said he may just come to the next meet for the food.<br>
<br>
We all have the Dragon to thank for  his organizational efforts; he <br>
even took a significant chunk out of his day to run up to <br>
Milwaukee and back to retrieve the tee shirts the vendor <br>
delivered late.  Dragon scouted many park options, planned and <br>
publicized events, carved stamps and planted boxes, and <br>
functioned as general troubleshooter.  I'm sure I speak for us all <br>
when I say how very grateful we are, Dragon.  It was a great time!<br>

My Gathering story also relates to the faux pas question from last week:<br>
<br>
Here I am, super psyched (despite a 5 1/2 hour drive to get there), and ready to find lots and lots of boxes.  So I pick one that seems easy, straightforward, and close to the pavillion.  Off I go to find "Opra-ha" ...here I am, 53 paces down that trail...now, where is that Y?  It should be right here...hmm...ok, there's too many boxes to be tied down to one, so I figure I'll find it later.  A few successes, some food, and I'm ready to find her.  STILL no avail.<br>
<br>
Finally, in desperation, I ask for advice from  Team Taco, who HAD found her.  "I went south down the trail," I say, pointing in the direction a went.  Team Taco shake their heads in unision.  "You mean SOUTH?" one says, pointing IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION!<br>
<br>
Maaaan....Team Taco were so nice though, they didn't even grin.  Now had it been AZOBOX I'd asked, well, I'd never hear the end of it.  *grin*<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

p.s.  To jump on the "thank you train", a huge thanks to everyone who helped put that together.  It was truly awesome.<br>

<br>
The startled look on Matt the Rat's face when we screeched (in a <br>
pitch and volume usually reserved for rock stars) "MATT THE RAT!" <br>
while standing only a couple of feet away from him.<br>
<br>
Running into the Leapin' Lizards on the trail.<br>
<br>
Nearly running over WI Hiker and Martini Man in our haste to flee <br>
the mosquitoes.  Poor WI Hiker could've ended up with yet another <br>
cast if things had turned out less fortuitously.<br>
<br>
Running into the Leapin' Lizards on the trail.<br>
<br>
The mind-blowing care and attention that went into the latest <br>
installments of Acorn's Fool's Errand Series.<br>
<br>
Dragon's amazing vampire stamps.<br>
<br>
Running into the Leapin' Lizards on the trail.<br>
<br>
Matt the Rat's hugely amusing "Archie Bunker For President" stamp <br>
that actually resembled a MUSHROOM, of all things.<br>
<br>
Delirium's delicious corkscrew pasta salad.  (May we have the <br>
recipe?)<br>
<br>
Golden Boy's puns.<br>
<br>
Did we mention running into the Leapin' Lizards on the trail?  Man, <br>
you guys were like Visa-- you were everywhere we wanted to be!  We <br>
had a blast seeing you again (and again and again).<br>
<br>
Sorry to have missed the group photo.  For those of you who didn't <br>
see us in the flesh, here's a picture:<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The gathering was great fun -- so much stimulation!  It was great to <br>
put faces to names of so many folks on the list and who have stamped <br>
into letterbox logs, etc.  I so enjoyed meeting all the folks who <br>
did not attend last year's gathering, including the whole WI gang.  <br>
Missed a few -- Tom and Jill, Yooper Ann & Bill, Team Rabbit, <br>
Charlie & Sue -- all folks I would have liked to meet/see again, but <br>
it was nice to see some of you there in spirit with your boxes!<br>
<br>
The show and tell table was a feast of creativity and nifty <br>
letterboxing ideas, the event stamp done by John of Leapin' Lizards <br>
was awesome and the event boxes contributed by attendees and others <br>
who were not able to make it this year were all very well put <br>
together interpretations of the theme.<br>
<br>
Delirium, your logbook/letterboxing journal is beyond words -- a <br>
true keepsake of treasures...  Tim, the Never-Ending Story box was a <br>
great idea and fun to add to...  FungusWoman, thanks for the party <br>
favors -- microboxes will abound in the upper midwest...  Acorn, you <br>
are awesome and your Fool's Errand boxes are genius.  I will need to <br>
make a special trip to WI just for those...  and the list goes on.<br>
<br>
Tim, thanks so much for putting the gathering together -- I know it <br>
is a lot of work, and a bit frustrating when things don't seem to go <br>
quite as you had planned.  But other than the swarms of uninvited <br>
mosquitoes, everything was perfect!  Thanks also to all, far and <br>
near, who contributed boxes and travelling event stamps.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to next year's combined gathering on June 18th...  <br>
and keep your eyes and ears open for information on a Michigan <br>
Mystery Gathering for this fall.<br>

ideas (not to mention a lot of mosquito bites). It was really a nice to be able to finally place <br>
faces with trailnames/stamps.<br>

Wish I could have stayed longer. It was hard to leave when I was having such a good time, <br>

wants to come with me for these things, not just wait at home.) :-)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree wholeheartedly with everything everyone has said.  It really bothers<br>
me to not know what people look like, and so much more fun to think of a<br>
person's face and "hear" their voice when you read their words.<br>
<br>
I'm jealous of all of you who spent the weekend at the park camping and<br>
boxing.  I too did not have enough time to take everything in.  Information<br>
overload!!!  I'm kicking myself for missing so much that you guys are<br>
listing. Which reminds me...when I read the clue handout this morning, I saw<br>
we were supposed to donate $1 each towards carving material.  SpringChick,<br>
can you give me your address so I can send you a check to cover my group?<br>
<br>
And speaking of money, did the t-shirts arrive?<br>
<br>
Czeltic Girl, you don't need to date someone to come along!  Pippin and I<br>
left our counterparts at home...can't speak for her, but happily in my<br>
case...he makes me nervous with his impatience and rushes me too much!  (oh,<br>
and BTW, I am Czech-Irish also!)<br>
<br>
While I think of it, RE: the travellers...how do they get from place to<br>
place, event to event?  Is there an Inner Circle whose members know the<br>
whereabouts of such boxes/stamps and mail them back and forth as needed?<br>

Little late to the party (this is a theme with me, I guess), but I just<br>
wanted to make sure I<br>
got a chance to thank Dragon for all his hard work organizing last weekend's<br>
gathering. I<br>
had a fabulous time, met a lot of wonderful (and very smart!) people and got<br>
a lot of great<br>
ideas (not to mention a lot of mosquito bites). It was really a nice to be<br>
able to finally place<br>
faces with trailnames/stamps.<br>
Wish I could have stayed longer. It was hard to leave when I was having such<br>
a good time,<br>
and there were so many more boxes! (One of these years I'll actually date<br>
someone who<br>
wants to come with me for these things, not just wait at home.) :-)<br>
Can't wait for the next gathering!<br>

OK - Fungus!  You know my DH's take on this ... with all the stuff <br>
we already do with our Scouts, he wants to know where we find the <br>
time to "play silly games" too!  He's accompanied me on a few <br>
Geocaching adventures - I guess I have to get him hooked on some <br>
letterboxing next - though I can already picture his "stamp" - a <br>
block with a big "X" carved into it!  We'd have to call him "X-Man" <br>
(hee-hee)!<br>

state, the title has to catch my attention first.  I've only hunted for<br>
one Michigan box so far (I promise to remedy that this summer or fall). <br>
The clues have to be interesting too.  See your "Go to Hell" letterbox; it<br>
is a classic example of how *I* pick letterboxes.  Same for the PI Day<br>
series.<br>
<br>
Some times I "eliminate" boxes by some other criteria ... such as ... be<br>
careful of lions, tigers and bears and SNAKES.  I will make exceptions ...<br>
I still have to hunt for the first Indiana letterbox, Corbeau.<br>
<br>
It always helps when someone writes "beautiful spot, beautiful hike, etc."<br>
 I also like letterboxes where I have to do some historical research<br>
before I set out.  I am increasingly enjoying hikes that are longer and<br>
"off the beaten (city) path."  But not so far that I have to pitch a tent<br>
overnight, or that I can't return before dark sets in.<br>
<br>
On a practical note, I have marked "reminder" on boxes at LbNA that I want<br>
to find "some day."<br>
I'll be ready on a moment's notice.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good question!  So many boxes...  so little time ;-)  In a situation like <br>
this, I use the following criteria (may not be the most objective way to <br>
choose, but not sure there is an objective way).<br>
<br>
1)  Boxes by placers I know and have personally corresponded with<br>
2)  Unique boxes, WOM boxes, boxes with a reputation (i.e. a Mapsurfer or <br>
Legerdemaine box)<br>
3)  Boxes whose placers have a reputation for nice stamps and for <br>
maintaining their boxes<br>
4)  Boxes/locations that are of interest to me (i.e. do you like urban <br>
boxes, lighthouses, long trails, mountains, covered bridges, lakeshore, <br>
historical places, mysteries?)...  this is especially true if it was a place <br>
I wanted to visit and photograph anyway.<br>
5)  Series or several boxes located within the same place or a small <br>
geographic area<br>
<br>
I tend to be more of a "quality" vs. "quantity" type boxer, so hike distance <br>
or terrain difficulty is not a factor to me.  I would rather spend all day <br>
hiking to the top of a mountain to score a Mapsurfer box for which I <br>
struggled on the clues for 6 months than collect a dozen stamps from so-so, <br>
run-of-the-mill boxes that were located 18 paces off the parking lot of a <br>
rest stop.<br>
<br>
I don't generally use the LbNA status reports to sway my decision whether or <br>
not to look for a box as I feel they are very misleading and personally know <br>
of a lot of people who don't ever log their finds, so just because a box <br>
does not show any recent finds, I would not let that deter me if it meets <br>
some of my other criteria.<br>
<br>
It is also a good idea to post to the regional list for the area you are <br>
going or e-mail somebody in that area that you may know or have exchanged <br>
e-mails with before to ask for input as far as "don't miss" boxes in the <br>
area you will be traveling.  I know of more than one person who has WOM box <br>
clues that are sent to people who will be traveling to her area and ask for <br>
input on the regional list.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For me the criteria is simple. I look for the shortest<br>
hikes and series. When I go out of state boxing it's<br>
all about box count, how many can I get in the<br>
shortest time possible. I do have to admit that I stay<br>
away from boxes with long hikes while traveling,<br>
favoring the quick and easy finds. I wish that<br>
everyone would put into their clues how long of a hike<br>
(either distance or time) the box is, it would make<br>
planning out of state sprees easier for me. Although I<br>
do have to agree with SpringChick on the point of<br>
boxers I'm familiar with. I would venture to say that<br>
I would go on a hike of any length to find a box by<br>
Dragon or Mapsurfer (If I could ever find the time to<br>
dedicate to solving some of those clues). I also take<br>
into consideration places as well. I only wish there<br>
were umpteen tunnels to walk through to get to a box<br>
(Thank you Dragon). Allright, this is getting<br>
ridiculous, I started out with only two criteria and<br>
now I have several. I guess there is no easy way to<br>
decide on which boxes to get. <br>
<br>
<br>
When I was traveling to the GLKG this year I had spent<br>
countless hours planning the boxes I was going to get.<br>
I can't tell you how many times I revised my list. I<br>
would mapquest the quickest routes and try to estimate<br>
the time it would take me to get from my car to the<br>
box and back on the road again. After all this<br>
planning I did I only found 5 of the 36 boxes I swore<br>
I'd had time for. So much for calculations. All the<br>
planning made for a very long wait for the Gathering.<br>
Kind of like being a kid again waiting for Christmas.<br>
What was only 5 months took an eternity to arrive.<br>
<br>
<br>
Great TOTW Dragon, There isn't a particular method to<br>
my madness that I use every time. The factors with<br>
each spree are different and different factors produce<br>
a multitude of variations in the planning. Hey, maybe<br>
Dragon could just write us all a nice easy formula to<br>
plug all of our parameters into. How nice that would<br>
be. Just crunch some numbers and have our computers<br>
spit out a travel itinerary for us. Whaddya say D? Are<br>
you up for it? : ) I say that in jest of course.<br>
<br>
<br>
The one thing that is a constant for me is that I have<br>
to be willing to change plans at the last moment. That<br>
.5 mile hike that was supposed to take under a half<br>
hour to complete and be back at the car sometimes<br>
takes 2 hours (I don't think I have to elaborate on<br>
that one, I'm sure we've all been there/done that).<br>
Whew, my fingers are tired. <br>
<br>
Have a great Fourth Of July everyone! Please get out<br>
there and box for me, I won't be able to go. We are<br>
selling our house soon and have been in<br>
remodel/repair/paint/move all our stuff hell for the<br>
last two weeks. Allthough I did manage to sneak in a<br>
couple quick boxes on the way home from work the other<br>
night. Shhhhhh ; )<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, since we like to hike, we first look for the longest, most challenging<br>
hikes when we are traveling to an area.  We especially like mountain hikes.<br>
These are then our highest priority.  We then also print clues and maps for<br>
almost all the other boxes near the good hikes.  This allows us to find<br>
other boxes while in the same area, or gives us alternates if the weather<br>
isn't too good for a long hike.<br>
<br>
We also solicit advice from the regional message boards in the area we are<br>
traveling to.  People will often post a response, or email us directly, with<br>
"don't miss" suggestions, or info on boxes they think are missing.  We will<br>
often contact people in the region privately to ask if there are certain<br>
planters in the area that use store-bought stamps.  If so, we usually skip<br>
these boxes.  (The regional lists are also a good source of info about local<br>
restaurants.)<br>
<br>
Generally we end up with a fat binder of clues & maps, a LOT more than we<br>
could actually have a chance of doing, but it then allows us options.  We<br>
appreciate people that include a distance or time estimate in their clues,<br>
since this allows us to make a better choice about a hike that will fit into<br>
whatever available time we have.<br>

I think the primary reason for this is that I don't like to be away in my room while I am carving because carving is not a type of art that takes over my thought process, rather I would prefer to hear the television or even carry on conversations at the same time.  On the other hand, some of the other types of art I do are all-consuming and having my own space to retreat to is perfect for that.<br>

Ok Folks,<br>
How Bout This:<br>
<br>
When you carve your stamps, Do you have a particular place to do it? <br>
Do you prefer to do it away from the noise and confusion of the <br>
household, or do you do it there at the kitchen table?<br>
In my case, I carve either at the diningroom table when Froggie is <br>
busy doing her charting, otherwise, I have a little "Carver's Space" I <br>
made up for myself under the basement stairs.<br>

I've also carved while laying on my stomach on the bed . ..  this  hurts my <br>
back though.<br>

I can carve with the tv or radio on, however, I don't carve until the kids  <br>
go to bed --- can't get two seconds without one of them wanting to talk to me.  <br>
While I can talk and carve at the same time I always want to make eye contact <br>
 and give them 100% of my attention, so I just don't carve until they are in  <br>
bed.<br>

I don't have a magnifying lens, as the years tick away some day I will need  <br>
