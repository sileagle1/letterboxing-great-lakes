<br>
Well, the business client has returned home and I have a minute to <br>
return to my personal life.<br>
<br>
Here are a few theme ideas we have so far:<br>
<br>
Wandering in Wonderland (Alice in Wonderland)<br>
Wisconsin thru the Ages - Ice Age to New Age<br>
Mythical Boxing (Mythology)<br>
Midwest Melting Pot (ethnic, nationalities)<br>
<br>
If anyone has any other suggestions, please let us know by Sunday <br>
night.  We'll then construct a poll so you can all vote for a favorite.<br>
<br>
Good news - SpringChick has volunteered to conduct a seminar on <br>
carving or bookbinding!  If anyone else has a REQUEST for a <br>
workshop/seminar or is willing to CONDUCT a workshop, please let me <br>
know.<br>

I don't think I have any skills to share in conducting a workshop, but let me know if there is anything else I can volunteer to help out with!<br>
