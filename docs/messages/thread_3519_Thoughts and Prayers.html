sorry that things are not looking good for little Joseph.  Although <br>
we have never met, and I know I could never begin to understand your <br>

After seeing your latest post, I went over to get caught up on the last few posts at your blog.  First of all, I must say that Emily is absolutely adorable -- thanks for sharing the photos of her!  I am so sorry to hear that Joseph has taken a turn for the worst and the situation is looking grim for him.  As TrekkieGal, I am sitting here with tears running down my face -- I cannot even begin to imagine what you are feeling, what you have been through in the past few weeks -- the fight, the emotional ups and downs, hope, despair...  My thoughts and prayers continue to be with you all as you face the days ahead.<br>

My heart aches for what you are going through right now--such a roller <br>
coaster of events and emotions.  I pray that a miracle would happen for <br>
your dear son, Joseph.  I also pray that God would be with you in this <br>
time to comfort you and give you peace (and to send others to help and <br>
support you and your family).  Joseph and Emily are blessed to have you <br>
as parents.  <br>

Reading this post broke my heart.  I've made it a<br>
habit to check your blog every day to learn the latest<br>
on how Joseph is fairing.  Know that we're still<br>
praying for all of you...<br>

I should know better than to read my e-mail at work (a reference <br>
desk), as I'm doing all I can not to cry in public.<br>
<br>
I'm so sorry you're having to go through this.  I can't think of <br>
anything more heartbreaking than losing a child.  We will continue to <br>
pray for you and your little one.  Please know that LOTS of people are <br>
thinking about you and your family.<br>

We too have been keeping up on Joseph's progress with the blog over the <br>
past few weeks, and both of us were upset to read yesterday's post.  I <br>
can't even imagine how you both have been dealing with all the ups and <br>
downs, but our thoughts and prayers are with you.<br>

been following your progress and have your blog pinned to the top of my <br>

I can't tell you how my heart breaks for you in regards to Joseph.  He <br>
