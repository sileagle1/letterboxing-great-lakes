                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry about the short notice - but if anyone wants to stop in at the Paw in Brookfield (IL) for lunch on this Thursday - they are open from 11 AM until 2 PM.  Bring your stamps and stuff for exchanges and show-and-tell!  Located at the Zoo Stop (Hollywood) on the Chicago-Aurora Burlington Northern line.  708-485-8448.  Contact me to RSVP and we can narrow down a time frame.<br>
   <br>
  The fate of the Paw is still unknown - they may be closing after Jan 6th.  This might be your last chance to get "Sit-Sip-Stay-Box"!<br>
