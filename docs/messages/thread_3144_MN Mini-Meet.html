<br/>
I'd like to invite everyone who might be in the Twin Cities area on <br/>
November 5 (a Sunday) to a very informal mini-meet.  It'll mostly be <br/>
a chance to put faces with trail names.  A lot of this depends on <br/>
how many people tell me they can come.  Right now, I'm thinking <br/>
early afternoon (1-ish?) until whenever.  The location will be <br/>
decided based on RSVPs.  If it's just a handful of us, it will be in <br/>
a Minneapolis area coffee shop or restaurant.  If more people tell <br/>
me they can come, we'll find a bigger space!  <br/>
<br/>
Again, this is very very informal.  Come meet other Minnesota <br/>
letterboxers! I know there's some out there!  There will even be an <br/>
event stamp!<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to come, either email me at <br/>
the_red_cat529@yahoo.com or sign up on Atlas Quest.  We'd really <br/>
like to meet you!<br/>
