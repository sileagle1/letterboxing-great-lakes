<br>
I figured I'd send another reminder to those of you who volunteered <br>
to make boxes for the event.   I have already received 9 boxes <br>
from "out of towners" and wanted to remind the rest of you that we'd <br>
like to have all the boxes in our hands by April 30 (about 3 weeks <br>
away).  That will give us several weekends in May to get out and hide <br>
those boxes.  When you're ready to send the box, just contact me for <br>
my mailing address.<br>
<br>
We really appreciate the local boxers placing their own boxes since<br>
that will lighten the load of planting AND it gives us a few to look<br>
for ourselves!  If you're planting your own box, please email me the<br>
clues by May 26 or sooner if you want them included in the clue<br>
booklet.<br>
<br>
In case you haven't looked at the event website<br>
<br>
http://www.2006greatlakesgathering.homestead.com<br>
<br>
in a while, we will probably have 40+ boxes and are approaching 100 <br>
expected attendees.<br>
<br>
As the event gets closer, let me know if you decide on what you'd <br>
like to bring for the potluck.  You can check the website to see what <br>
people are already planning to bring and see some general suggestions <br>
for additonal items.<br>
<br>
I'll be posting some more info about the three workshops within the <br>
next week.<br>
<br>
Happy boxing (and carving)!<br>
