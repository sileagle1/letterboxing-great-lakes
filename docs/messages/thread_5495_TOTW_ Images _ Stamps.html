I am going to use March 1st as the deadline to get your box to the <br>
person you are swapping with. I will assign each person another <br>
person to whom they will be sending their box to. When you receive <br>
your new box in the mail you are responsible for planting it and <br>
putting the clues on the internet for all the find. Please be sure <br>
and give credit to the creator of the box.<br>
<br>
I will put you down for a wonka bar, check out the website:<br>
