I can't imagine how Matt is managing to withstand not only the pain, <br>
but the not knowing as well. When the morphine doesn't help - that's <br>
big time pain! I can't imagine how he is able to deal with this.   <br>
Whatever is causing the pain or if the pneumonia is aggrivating the <br>
matter, I hope the doctors find an answer in the morning.  Your family <br>
is in my prayers.  Keep us up to date, and let Matt know I wish him the <br>
best. <br>
