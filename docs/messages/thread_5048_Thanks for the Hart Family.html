Here is the latest update.  Matt will most likely be coming home <br>
tomorrow.  He had a very good day today.  The day started with a <br>
visit from our primary dr.  He ordered an anti-inflamatory medicine <br>
to work on the inflamed lung.  After this injection, Matt immediately <br>
started feeling better.  By the afternoon he rated his pain at a 3/4 <br>
while yesterday it ranged from 5-9.  The GI dr ordered another blood <br>
draw to show the liver enzyme count.  That came back this evening and <br>
it had come down drastically.  Matt was able to eat dinner too!  The <br>
GI dr has signed off on him so now we are waiting for a visit from <br>
our primary dr tomorrow morning to fully release him.  Matt will be <br>
on the anti-inflamatory meds as well as the antibiotics for a while <br>
and we don't know how long he will have to stay home before being <br>
able to work...but he will be home and he isn't in pain!<br>
<br>
We are still planning on heading to Minnesota in a week.  We are so <br>
excited about this trip and we look forward to thanking so many of <br>
you in person!  Thanks also for the tip on the care pages.  I have a <br>
friend who used these to communicate the struggle of their daughter.  <br>
Seeing the words carepages.com actually brought tears to my eyes.<br>
<br>
Take care & I am sure that you will be hearing from Matt in the next <br>
few days.  I know that he is feeling better because he mentioned <br>
wishing he had a laptop and was bummed that I didn't bring his latest <br>
carving!<br>
<br>
May God Bless everyone of you as He has blessed us through you!<br>
