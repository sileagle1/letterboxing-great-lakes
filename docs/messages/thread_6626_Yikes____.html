Not sure if I will be coming tomorrow or not.  Just when I had talked myself into going, I saw the forecast.  So I guess I'll just play it by ear.  If I'm there, I'm there. :)<br>

Actually, it was her hand.  Sara has this habit of having to pick up every toad or frog and then requesting to have her picture taken with it.  (I have no idea what we will do with all those pictures we have!)  I spotted the toad by the box...she of course just had to pick it up...and the toad did what toads do when they think they're being eaten.  :D  <br>
