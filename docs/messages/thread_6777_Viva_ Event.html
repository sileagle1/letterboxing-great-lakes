                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone who came out to the Viva, Grand Haven! event yesterday in Michigan. It was a fun day of letterboxing and silly poses that tested not only boxing skills, but also Elvis trivia knowledge and resourcefulness.<br>
<br>
Congratulations to team "Hunka, Hunka Burnin' Boxers," who sneaked in at the very end and stole the win by a narrow margin.  Some of the teams asked if we would post the point totals online, so here you go:<br>
<br>
229.75	Hunka, Hunka Burnin' Boxers (Spartan Fans, Lunagirl & Papa)<br>
224.5	Treasure Hunters (TrailMark, MichKathy, Mysterina, Mysterias, pjynx & Louie)<br>
222.5	Box & Roll and Boxer Rebellion (BowlofCherries; Prince Igor & Firebringer)<br>
219.75	Suspicious Minds (Stargirl & El Cajador; Angel Winks & Hunting Bear)<br>
218.25	Viva las Letterbox Babes (Housepitality Hostess, Wound Tight, littlesister & SportsNuts)<br>
206.25	Team Roustabout (Weary Travelers and JustHappy2CYa)<br>
196.25	Double Trouble and Blue Hawaii (SZ Rocks; Ypsitucky Queen & Rascal)<br>
193.75	Paradise, Yooper Style and Robinhood & MerryMen (Norsegnome; Robinhood & the MerryMen)<br>
193	Fools Rush In (Grandvilla & MobiusKlein; Artistamp & Azobox)<br>
189	Just Wanna Be Your Teddy Bear (Pale Puppy Posse, Groovy Girl, Bflysmiles, Strawberry Shortcake and Purple Dragonfly)<br>
146.25	Orange Crush (TrailMonkeys, Fullmoon, The Kitten Cuddler and Allis Guy)<br>
144.5	Blue Suede Shoe Boxers (Shooz, Barbie Girl and Huygens)<br>
142.25	Strangers in the Crowd (4EyesMcGee, Old Poop, Sparky and Burt the Conqueror)<br>
118	Team DBFamily (Momma, Batboy, Flutterby Girl, Little Jo, Gramma D and Mr. DB)<br>
103	Melinda's Cable Got Cancelled and Here we are (The Mamanator, Pink Verbena and Wild Woodies)<br>
???	Galloping Grannies (aunt katknees and gemgirl65)<br>
<br>
Even though they came in at the bottom, I give Melinda's team the nod for the most original team name! A couple of teams earned some extra points for creativity -- the Hunka, Hunka team made a logbook that played Elvis songs and the Yooper team came dressed ready for a trip to Paradise (of the tropical variety, not of the Upper Peninsula variety).<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Even though I wasn't able to participate due to the 11 stitches in my foot from the accident, my family and I did show up in Grand Haven for Viva and had a great time with Springchick and Doglvrs at the pavilion in the morning. Plus, we also got 2 boxes. Well, not me. I sat in the car with my foot up, but we visited the sites and saw a few boxers out there. Bummed that we had to miss the actual fun. Dare I say that we would have put in a good run too? Glad that everyone had fun and I had fun carving the event stamp. Now, shall the countdown to BINGO begin?<br>

Thank you Springchick and Doglvrs for a very fun rally! I really enjoyed the challenges. Thanks especially to our partners and new friends, Double Trouble. Their expertise with the GPS and iphone saved our butts. It was a definite hoot to be hugging a pillow barefoot while asking the mailman if he had a stamp! rascal<br>
