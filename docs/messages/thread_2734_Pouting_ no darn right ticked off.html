My sons letterboxing party was a great success, Love all the <br/>
wonderful pictures we have of the kids looking for the boxes and <br/>
reading their clues and maps.<br/>
Unfortunately while I was out planning for the party on the trails a <br/>
couple days before, I left my letterboxing journal.  :(  <br/>
I recieved a phonecall from a man who asked for me or my son, as both <br/>
of our names were on the journal with our phone number asking if <br/>
found please call.  <br/>
He called alright, but when I asked how far he was away, he said, <br/>
that was all relative.  I thought that was an odd answer.  <br/>
So, I asked him if he was close to the preserve where he found it, he <br/>
then again stated that was all relative.<br/>
The guy was not offering where he lived, or a place that I could meet <br/>
him.  <br/>
Finally I got from him that he lived in a couple cities away.  Luck <br/>
have it, it was the city my mother lives in.  Unforunately for me, he <br/>
wouldn't give me his address and was unwilling to meet at the local <br/>
market there in town.  When I asked him if he would be available to <br/>
meet some time on the next day, he says a vague..well I never know <br/>
what the next day might bring.  grrrrrrrrrr  <br/>
He told me to give my mother his phone number, and that he would give <br/>
her directions only.  At this time, I'm wondering if this is some <br/>
kind of freak.  I'm not going to subject my mother to a possible <br/>

doesn't. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The guy certainly sounds less than all there to me.  If it were me, I<br/>
wouldn't give out any further information.  If he's unwilling to even meet<br/>
you at a public place, there's something wrong with that picture.  Maybe he<br/>
was just looking for you to offer some sort of reward, but didn't want to<br/>
come right out and ask for it himself?  Who knows?  He might not be an<br/>
ax-murderer/serial killer sort of guy but why take any chances?  Why would<br/>
he want to give directions only to your mother?  She's just another stranger<br/>
to him.  But, being your mother, she would be an *older* stranger than you<br/>
and thus possibly more vulnerable than you (tho I've met some grannies that<br/>
can really kick butt).  Hopefully, the journal didn't contain any types of<br/>
personal entries that would give him more information about your family than<br/>
he has any need to know.<br/>
<br/>
Start over with a new journal.<br/>

P.S.: This is one reason why I carry pieces of cardstock with me to stamp<br/>
the box's stamp.  Then I put the cardstock into my scrapbook/logbook when I<br/>
get back home.  I have sooo much in the way of personal writings and photos<br/>
in my scrapbook/logbook, and also entries that nieces and nephews and<br/>
friends' children have made, that there's no way I want some weirdo finding<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I had a strange episode about 15 or 20 years ago as a dog trainer.  I often<br/>
did private sessions in a person's home.  Never even thought about taking<br/>
someone with me for safety's sake.  Half the time I didn't even have anyone<br/>
who knew exactly where I was going on what evenings.  I had never had any<br/>
problems up to that point.<br/>
<br/>
Got a call from a gentleman who said he'd been having trouble getting his<br/>
dog trained by trying to do it himself out of a book.  Lived out in the<br/>
country so wasn't any too close to any group classes so had decided to try a<br/>
few private lessons.  He sounded totally normal on the phone.  Seemed like<br/>
the typical nice, well intentioned, but kinda clueless dog owner.  So I<br/>
agreed to drive out there after work one evening to meet with him and his<br/>
dog and give him some pointers.  Drove up the long drive.  Nice house, but<br/>
totally secluded from from any of the neighbors.  Got a bad gut feeling as I<br/>
was going up the drive.  I follow my gut feelings so I turned my truck<br/>
around and left.  About 5 years later or so, the guy was convicted of having<br/>
murdered two women in two separate instances on hiking trails in another<br/>
state.   Now that's not to say that murder was what he had in mind for me.<br/>
But I'm sure glad I turned around that day and left.  And I've met a few<br/>
more weirdos over the years since then.  So I've become very careful over<br/>
the years.  I don't mind being called over-reactive.  I'm alive to hear<br/>
people tell me that I'm over-reactive.  So over-reactive is just fine with<br/>
me.  Tho I prefer to call it "cautious" -- very very cautious.  :-)<br/>

You may never get your journal back, but if the police talk to him it <br/>

enough to make him go away.  It is unfortunate that there are people <br/>
like this in our world.  In all seriousness CALL THE POLICE.  I am <br/>

trying to gage your reaction to his call.  Make sure that your <br/>
reaction is enough to keep him away.<br/>

If a situation feels wrong, trust your feelings and stay away from this guy.  Start over with the log book or go along with the card idea.  If the guy calls back, why don't you tell him to drop it off at the local police station and that your mom will pick it up there.  I'd wager that would clear him off from you.<br/>

          OK, the first thing I would do is google this guys phone number. I <br/>
would definately not give him your mothers number. Then I would <br/>
google your phone number just to see how much he knows about where you <br/>
are. That alone may give you pause! The next thing I would do is <br/>
contact the police and tell them about your uneasy feelings. This is <br/>
most seriously a situation where your gut feeling of concern is DEAD <br/>
ON ACCURATE. The people on this list who have met me could tell you <br/>
that I am not a small guy, and as a result things like this tend not <br/>
to scare me. However, reading your post sent a chill down MY spine. <br/>
You may never get your journal back, but if the police talk to him it <br/>
may be enough to make him aware that your guard is up. Hopefully <br/>
enough to make him go away. It is unfortunate that there are people <br/>
like this in our world. In all seriousness CALL THE POLICE. I am <br/>
guessing that he may have been very close when he called you. He was <br/>
trying to gage your reaction to his call. Make sure that your <br/>
reaction is enough to keep him away.<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
