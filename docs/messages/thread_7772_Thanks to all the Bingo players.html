I received a bountiful box of booty! In the box:<br>
Giftcards and certificates (for more shopping and less cooking!)<br>
Teko socks (for more hiking)<br>
two LnL containers (one for my yet-to-be-planted Bingo-themed box)<br>
LB patch (for my bag)<br>
Modified speedball carving tip (for more carving)<br>
LTCs (for my collection)<br>
Bear whistles (for my trip to Alaska...someday)<br>
Letterboxing Gift tags (very clever, humorous ... for all occasions)<br>
A radio play (for my amusement and edification)<br>
Some OZ carving material (for my yet-to-be-planted Bingo-themed box)<br>
Camo duck tape (for camouflage)<br>
Splinter removal kit (for my letterboxing "adventures")<br>
Hand-made logbook (for my yet-to-be-planted Bingo-themed box)<br>
Sketchbook (for my ideas)<br>
Deerfly patches (for my trips out of town)<br>
Deet/sunscreen moist towelettes (for letterboxing this weekend with EN, Skootch<br>
and TT)<br>
Hand warmers (for next winter)<br>
Ink (for the letterboxer, there can never be enough ink!)<br>
Super-strong zip bags (for my yet-to-be-planted Bingo-themed box)<br>
Fundana: a bandanna and outdoor game in one! (for Family Fun!)<br>
Marvy marker (for when I lose one in the woods)<br>
One pound of raw honey (for my sweet tooth)<br>
<br>
Have a great week!<br>
