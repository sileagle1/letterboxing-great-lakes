check on them this week.  The local geocachers had a HUGE gathering in<br/>
the area (centered on Regner Park) the 18th-20th.  Things should have<br/>
settled down by now.  I am friends with the geocacher in charge of the<br/>
gathering, so if you need assistance with any of your boxes being<br/>
"geocached" I may be able to help.<br/>
<br/>
I just hope they left some hiding locations open for us yet. It is<br/>
sickening when you hear the person in charge is hiding 50 new caches<br/>
himself alone (in addition to the numerous caches he already has in<br/>
the area) for the gather.  I just hope many of the gathering ones are<br/>
temporary.<br/>
