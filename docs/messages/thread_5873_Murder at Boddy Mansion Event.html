Luckily we had some of the best brains in the LB bizz to help us crack codes (Spartan Fans and Village Idiots)! The only thing that made us sad was that we couldn't finish the whole thing due to dinner plans. We had brought some newbies (the Village Idiots) with us that took up the challenge of crime solving and they proved to be quite the sleuths. Thanks for the fun day guys!<br>

Trailtroll, Lunagirl, and Papa you really outdid yourselves!! This was the most complicated LB event I have seen and it looks like it was a hoot to put together!! This was definitely advanced LBing and we enjoyed the challenge!! It really took the "ho-hum" out of the typical event. It definitely rekindled my love affair with LBing, and gave me some new ideas of my own... so look out >:) <br>
I'm glad that you thought of me to do a carving for this event, it was my pleasure. Everyone did a fantastic job carving, the stamps were meticulous!! Haha, I'm glad I didn't get a Room to carve... those looked hard!!   <br>
Great stamps, great clues, and great people ...what more could you ask for? Thanks for hosting this event!!<br>
<br>
P.S Sorry we didn't really get to talk to you Team Rabbit :(, but we wanted to hit the trails asap before the lil dragon started shooting fire out her nose, lol! We hope to get together soon :) Much Luv,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have to agree!! Finding out "whodunit" was so much fun.<br>
This event had the best clues and most detailed carvings!<br>
The weather was great, the food was yummy and best of all<br>
we got to catch up with LB'ers we hadn't seen in a long time.<br>
<br>
DoubleDragon and TeamRabbit brought their latest creations to the event, so I got my cute baby fix.<br>
<br>
We were dissapointed that we didn't find all the bonus boxes,<br>
Who knew there would be clues within the clues.  So very tricky,<br>
PapadeLunaGirl!  You get the prize for most creative clues, all those different puzzles must've taken forever to come up with.<br>
<br>
Hope to see you all again at the GLG in 2 weeks!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Aww, you're too kind. It was a great event for me, too. Thanks to Trailtroll for preventing tthe hordes from chasing me with torches and pitchforks. She made sure the clues were just tricky enough to be solvable. Thanks to everyone who carved the stamps, they were beautiful. I am deeply in your debt. And a special thank you to everyone who attended despite the underwater boardwalk and suck-your-shoes-off mud. The stamps and clues are one thing, but it's the people who make the event special.<br>
<br>
Just a note to those of you who may have left early and haven't heard this story--as the fire was roaring and friends wereeating and drinkingunder the evening spring sky, Lunagirl ran down from the lodge to show me what she had found in her logbook--Investigator Francis Bacon's business card.<br>
