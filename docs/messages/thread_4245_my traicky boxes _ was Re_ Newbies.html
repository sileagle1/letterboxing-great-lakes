that one for you just a couple of days ago when I went to the Four <br/>
Seasons Hostel---but it got way too dark by the time I finished stamping <br/>
in.  (That one was tricky too---but it was super cool!!)  =)  I think <br/>
that one took me 2 or 3 trips to finally figure out!  I know I actually <br/>
read quietly---but outloud to my self many times!  I was kind of a new <br/>
boxer and had not had too much experience with clues like yours and it <br/>
pushed my skills!  I still kind of feel that way at times and that's <br/>
what keeps the interest so high!<br/>
