We,too, went up and down those stairs a couple of times last summer <br/>
in the heat before finally figuring where we went wrong.<br/>
Like others, we took a long walk towards the lake -- no luck.<br/>
Then carefully re-read the clues and picked up one significant piece <br/>
that we'd missed so with renewed energy we tried again. But still the <br/>
Mt Baldy evaded us. Then while I was climbing down a steep dune <br/>
looking for who-knows-what, Artistamp saw a bit of an edge from a <br/>
familiar Tupperware container peeking out from a root, and we had it.<br/>
<br/>
Read SpringChick's recounting of HER search for the Baldys for yet <br/>
another tale.<br/>

<br/>
BYW, the placer of Mt Baldy is an out-of-stater who summers in the <br/>
Saugatuck area, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to have a place to discuss the Great Lakes area boxes!<br/>
