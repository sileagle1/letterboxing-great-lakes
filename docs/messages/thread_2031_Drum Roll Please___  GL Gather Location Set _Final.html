the 2006 Great Lake Gathering has been set!  A poll will not be <br/>
necessary as there was only one volunteer to host the gathering, so <br/>
they win by default!<br/>
<br/>
So mark your calendars for June 3, 2006 to attend the GL Gathering in <br/>
WI, to be hosted by WI Hiker and Martini Man!  They are still deciding <br/>
on an exact location for the gathering and will relay information as <br/>
they make further plans.  They did a fantastic job with the Haunted <br/>
Harvest Gathering this past fall, so we are excited and anticipating a <br/>
well-planned and fun event!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks WI Hiker and Martini Man for stepping up to take this on!<br/>
