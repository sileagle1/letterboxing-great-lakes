  Speaking of cooties, I was thinking of making a couple for my friend's daughter to play with at the gathering.  I've never seen one, so I'm not sure about log books.  Do you include a log?  If so, how big or small are they generally?  Do these ever come back to the orginator?  <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for any info!<br/>

I think a better name would be "beware of having a yard sale with <br/>
letterboxers". Doodle and Deedle Bug should have never posted info <br/>
about Cooties in their vehicles at gatherings, it just gives Turtles <br/>
ideas! :o) Woo haa haa haa &lt;--- evil turtle laugh!<br/>
