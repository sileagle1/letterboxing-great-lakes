Ok, I swear this is my last post for a while...<br>
<br>
   Took down clues from the Files section.<br>
   Created a website with same clues, in a format all can read.<br>
   Posted website addy in Links section, under "Members' LB sites"<br>
<br>
Dang!<br>
<br>
Del<br>
<br>
p.s.  Thanks to Artistamp who tried talking (typing?  emailing?) me through the conversion instructions!<br>
<br>
p.p.s.  Off to Atlanta to visit my new neice who was born the morning of the Gathering....just how mad do you think my sister-in-law would get if I skipped out to do some Georgia letterboxing?  *grin*<br>
