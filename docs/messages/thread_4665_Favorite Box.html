It took me three vacation trips to seek and finally find this box, but it was so worth the challenge.  When I found it in 2005, the original logbook was still inside the box.  This is a testament to the importance of a challenging clue and a good hiding spot.  Thanks to The Dragon for keeping this box active.  <br>

The box was called Dogbones and was based on the skeleton dog in Tim<br>

was so unusual is that the carver had taken chicken bones, dried them up,<br>

Martini Man's Email focusing on "Logbooks" a couple of logbooks come to  mind <br>
for me... Diamonds in the Rough and Big Purple Foot do a really great job  on <br>
their logbooks!!<br>
 <br>
However, as far as "above and beyond" I'd have to say "Smurf Village" in  <br>
Grants Pass, Oregon. The logbook was about 8 x 12 inches in the shape of one of  <br>
the Smurf's mushroom shaped homes. It was a wood carved front and back cover  <br>
with the details burned into the wood. It had actual hinges on the front cover <br>
 for it to be opened.<br>
 <br>
Truly a wonderful logbook.<br>

OK, I'll answer at least one of the questions right now.  So far, my very<br>
favorite clues have been for the Search for Rexlettob Box series in<br>
Wisconsin .  You can find the clues to the first box here:<br>
http://www.seamlessimages.com/letterbox/baldbluff.html  However you'll need<br>
to find the first box, then the second, to actually see all the clues.  An<br>
amazingly creative package in terms of story, use of technology and use of<br>
traditional methods for clues!<br>
<br>
We were also very impressed with the variety of creative clues that Bulldawg<br>
put together for the Pub Crawl in Alexandria, VA last June.<br>
<br>
Wisconsin Hiker<br>
<br>
P.S.  Don't you just love this unusually warm weather!!  I wish it would<br>
last for the whole winter...  Well, at least it should make it easier for us<br>
to get out and plant a few boxes next weekend.<br>
