It has been brought to my attention that the gathering last year was<br>
actually the weekend BEFORE Memorial Day.  Some others have<br>
mentioned that the Saturday OF Memorial Day weekend would not be<br>
good (and the parks would be loaded).  I would then propose that the<br>
POSSIBLE gathering being considered for this year (and an annual<br>
tradition hopefully) be regularly held the Saturday of the weekend<br>
BEFORE Memorial Day weekend.  This would make this year's gathering<br>
on May 22.  How does this date sound?<br>

are right about the parks being way too crowded on Memorial Day <br>

The 22nd would work for me.<br>

Letterboxing when Deb hosted the one last year ... right in my <br>
backyard so to speak. (grin)<br>
<br>
Bindle Bum and I are working on plans for a big cruise with our boat <br>
this year, so I'm not making commitments on anything that happens <br>
during the sailing season. <br>
<br>
However, I will try to see if we can make it down on the 22nd.<br>

Enjoy!<br>

has NOT been set for the Midwest Gathering.  Instead, please vote at <br>
the group's website on your choices for the date of the gathering.  <br>
I would actually prefer to do it in early June after school is out <br>
for the summer, rather than the busy end of May with exams, <br>
graduation, and state track meets.... but I'm game for any of the <br>
weekends on the poll.  Afterall, "Letterboxing is Life!"<br>
<br>
I would say, however, that one way or another it SHOULD be a go for <br>
some time around end of May/early June at a NE Illinois State Park.  <br>
I hope to have a few scouted out in the next few weeks.<br>
<br>
Stay tuned for more info...<br>
