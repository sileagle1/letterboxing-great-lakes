Watched the video on your blog of Emily going nuts in her jumperoo - so funny!  She looks like she will have strong legs to hit those trails in search of a few letterboxes.  Hasn't she told you she wants something more than just gatherings?  She's an ambitious lass and is almost ready to head out alone if you don't take her pretty soon...  But carving?  She knows she has to wait a bit for that.<br>

were all mystery boxes, we weren't able to discuss them.  We have not <br>
yet done any all day excursions, much to our dismay.  It seems that our <br>
weekends plan themselves before we get a chance to fill them with <br>
letterboxing these days.  Bummer.  Hopefully we'll get out there again <br>
soon.  The doctor wanted us to wait until she was 6 months before we <br>
started using bug spray on her, and she recently hit that milestone.  <br>
Now we'll have a way to protect her from those pesky mosquitos and <br>
ticks.<br>
