<br/>
It is now just over one week away from the Fairies of the Forest; A<br/>
Spring Awakening event on Saturday, April 26th, 2008 in Ionia, MI.<br/>
It's not too late to sign up on the AQ site or just show up if you<br/>
want to. Everyone is welcome and we'd love to see you there. You even<br/>
may get to meet some of those "legendary" Michigan boxers (nod to that<br/>
"chick" who is named after this season..WINK WINK). What's to resist.<br/>
Beside, BINGO will probably be done by then so you won't have to be<br/>
salivating over the computer screen waiting to scoop up Mrs. handknit<br/>
socks (although it seems like lots of you want them). See you all there<br/>
