This was our first gathering and we had a fantastic time! Next time we know not to schedule other activities during the weekend. We would have loved to attend one of the dinners. We are hoping to get T, L , and E up to Lapham Peak Park later in the summer and get some more of the boxes. Seeing the fabulous images we collected over the weekend I cannot wait to get back up there and collect some more. Hope everyone had a safe trip home. See you on the trails!!<br/>
B of the BTTLE family<br/>
