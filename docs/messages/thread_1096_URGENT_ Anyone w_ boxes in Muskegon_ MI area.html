Please read: regarding the security of your boxes. <br>
<br>
The White Lake Library is planning a 2-week Spring Break Letterboxing<br>
contest and has pressed me into doing a 45 minute presentation this<br>
coming Thurs evening during Family Night. (Thanks going out to Silent<br>
Doug, for a copy of his class outline!)<br>
<br>
They really want this to be a contest and are going to be placing a<br>
number of boxes in the area.  They are really stressing the LOCAL<br>
(White Lake area) aspect right now, and I have reluctantly agreed to<br>
include my Wood and Water Nymph box in their contest. (I just don't<br>
know how many participants to anticipate and worry about that<br>
trail/location being damaged/overwhelmed.)<br>
<br>
The letterboxing.org address will be included on the class kits that<br>
will be handed out to all participants so it is possible that some of<br>
our other area boxes could get some visitors.<br>
<br>
I feel fairly good about this event attracting "good" newbies, since<br>
they first have to come to the Library to obtain the info and/or kits.<br>
However, if you have any concerns for your boxes, please let me know<br>
or maybe disable the clues for a short time. <br>
<br>
Thanks, and if you want a box removed temporarily, I could *TRY* to go<br>
pick it for you and save you a drive. (Then replace it after the<br>
contest ends in a couple of weeks.)<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
