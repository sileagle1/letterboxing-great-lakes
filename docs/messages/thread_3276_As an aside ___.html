DD - you tell it like it is!  <br>
<br>
All one needs to do is to revisit their boxes for periodic maintenance to see the condition they are left in.  I'm in the process of checking all my boxes before winter hits the midwest. I'm shocked at what I'm finding.    <br>
<br>
*Boxes are left open - that's not an animal, that's a careless human!  <br>
<br>
*Boxes that are not hidden exactly how they were placed - that's not an animal either, that's the result of a careless human who can't read the clue, they're in too much of a hurry, or the person replacing the box is not the same as the person who found it....meaning, a family or a group. Animals leave claw marks and teeth marks on a plastic box.  Humans will leave their trail name stamp in the logbook, if you're lucky.  IF they don't take the box thinking it's their 'prize?"    <br>
<br>
*Inky stamps are placed inside the same bag as the logbook....what a mess that creates.  Sorry, you can't blame animal for this either.  It's those HUUUUUUMANS!  <br>
