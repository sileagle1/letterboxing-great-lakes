                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, no one has voiced said, "NO" so I'm doing the SIDEWAGERS this year.  <br/>
Here are the details.<br/>

*/Side Wager: /*///A wager made beyond the normal rules of the game. A <br/>

<br/>
If you'd like to add more excitement to the letterboxing bingo game (or <br/>
another way to win), enter the Side Wagers Game. When will FamilyOf6 <br/>
pull the item that finally and completely fills in some player's <br/>
card?Pick the right day, and you WIN! Again, this is the Big Game here, <br/>
not the interim games. The date will be determined by the claiming of a <br/>
successful card by a BINGO player (and its certification by FamilyOf6).<br/>
<br/>
Your guess must be submitted before January 1, 2011.<br/>
<br/>
Email me at aatom118@gmail.com<br/>
In the subject line, put "*Sidewagers*."<br/>
In the body, please indicate the date you have chosen and your trailname.<br/>
<br/>
The winner is the person who is closest *before* the day the Bingo Game <br/>
ends or actually hits the date on the dot. If you choose February 15th, <br/>
for example, and someone else chooses the 20th, and the game ends on the <br/>
19th, you win. In other words, you'll hold all of the days until the <br/>
next guesser hits the calendar. (But you don't know who has chosen which <br/>
days or how far apart they've fallen -- and neither does FamilyOf6!).<br/>
<br/>
If two or more players choose the same date, the first guesser is given <br/>
the date and another available date will be assigned to anyone else who <br/>
chooses the date already taken. This will be done by moving earlier *or* <br/>
later until the date, roughly, between your choice and the next one <br/>
chosen is available.So, if you choose Feb 20 and it's already taken your <br/>
date could be: the 22^nd if the next date chosen is the 24^th ; or you'd <br/>
get the 25^th if 4, 21, 22, and 28^th are taken; or you'd get the 18^th <br/>
if 16, 21, 22, and 28^th are taken.<br/>
<br/>
As a bonus, a prize will be awarded to the lucky winner!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, no purchase necessary to enter (ie, you do not need to be a <br/>
player in the BINGO game to participate).One entry per person.Atom118 <br/>
and the Atomic Beans assume no responsibility for the order or words <br/>
chosen by FamilyOf6.<br/>
<br/>
Send me any questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
