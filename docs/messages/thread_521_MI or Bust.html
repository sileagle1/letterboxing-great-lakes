                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings all! I'm making my appearance here to clear up some possible confusion. <br>
Last Spring ('03,) I sent a guest letterbox to the Upper Great Lakes Gathering. It was a <br>
joy to see all the stamps in the log when it returned home. Thinking that this box <br>
should find a new home here in my home state of Oregon, I rehid it in Milo McIver <br>
State Park. I carved a little (LO) stamp and glued it to the back of a shiny penny for <br>
folks to add to the image. The history of the box's travels was included in the clue:<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=4803&boxname=MI(LO)_or_Bust!<br>
<br>
Well, last week it came to my attention that one of our local boxers here created a <br>
letterbox and sent it to MI to be hidden. Lo and behold... What name did she give it? <br>
MI or Bust! Needless to say, I am quite taken aback. I want anyone who got the first <br>
image in their journals to know that this is not the same letterbox that they saw at <br>
the gathering. I knew nothing about this second box and am very sorry that it bears <br>
the name of my event box. <br>
<br>
I also want to say that you guys are so lucky to be able to go after Spring Chicks's <br>
letterboxes! I am sooooo.... jealous! Anyone want to take up a collection and buy me <br>
a plane ticket? Funhog<br>

Funhog, we'd sure welcome your visit!<br>
(For other GL folks: Funhog plants 'em far and wide and they're well <br>
worth the trek. Artistamp and I have had the pleasure of walking some <br>
distances in northern New Mexico for Funhog boxes.)<br>
I'm glad you're visiting the Great Lakes at least via this list.<br>
Many of us around here began our logbooks with SpringChick stamps.<br>
