We're going to Toronto next week and were hoping to get a lot of letterboxing done while we were at it.  Flying Dragon was going to compile all of our clues this week...and then LBNA went down.  I know that some of you like to print clues out ahead of time to have them handy and I was hoping that maybe someone would have clues to some of the boxes we have listed but couldn't find alternate clue sources for.  If you have clues for these boxes (or other short-medium length hikes in the Toronto area) that you would be willing to share, please email me off list at gmc81 "at" randomkitty.net.<br/>
