                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi y'all (No, I'm just kidding)<br/>
<br/>
Seems we had ourselves a little tropical storm action the other day.  <br/>
Which is to say, the wind gusts only got up to 50 mph, instead of the <br/>
140 mph that Katrina worked herself upto as a hurricane.  <br/>
We're all fine.  An uprooted birdfeeder, some patio furniture flung <br/>
about, nothing compared to what New Orleans and Biloxi have.  Heck, <br/>
we only got 5 1/2 inches of rain that night, which was nice, since it <br/>
was the first rain we'd gotten since mid-July (not kidding).<br/>
<br/>
The change in barometric pressure or the psychic abilities of animals <br/>
must have make the local fauna crazy, because we saw our first <br/>
copperhead in the yard a day before Katrina reached us.  But <br/>
considering that it was dead, I'm guessing that it wasn't too <br/>
psychic, because wouldn't a fact like your imminent demise be <br/>
something you might forsee?  It was pretty, anyway, which is more <br/>
than I can say for the bugs down here.  One word.  Locusts.  If you <br/>
ever want a practical lesson in self-discipline and patience, come <br/>
down here during locust season and sit outside for 15 minutes.  If <br/>
that racket doesn't drive you absolutely bonkers, your a stronger <br/>
person than I.  The noise they make, which is like what I would <br/>
imagine a rattlesnake's rattle would sound like if pumped through a <br/>
speaker, is enough to make even the most placid person a little bit <br/>
peevish.<br/>
<br/>
The letterboxing still stinks down here.  And since I'm the only <br/>
person who's planting down here, and I've effectively stopped since <br/>
May (too dang hot), that means it's REALLY been dead.<br/>
<br/>
And oh yeah, I had the baby in June. Did I mention that?  Joaquin <br/>
Orion (that's Wah-Keen, not Jwa-kwin for those of you who didn't take <br/>
Spanish).  He's a big tubby baby who will probably let me go <br/>
letterboxing when the weather breaks, as long as I keep him in the <br/>
baby sling and don't make him sit in the stroller.  But since there's <br/>
nothing to letterbox, it's mostly a non-issue.<br/>
<br/>
That's all.  I miss you, Michigan, letterboxing, and a regional <br/>
cuisine that doesn't feel it necessary to fry and barbeque every item <br/>
of food.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
