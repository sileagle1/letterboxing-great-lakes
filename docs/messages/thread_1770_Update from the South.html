                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi y'all (No, I'm just kidding)<br>
<br>
Seems we had ourselves a little tropical storm action the other day.  <br>
Which is to say, the wind gusts only got up to 50 mph, instead of the <br>
140 mph that Katrina worked herself upto as a hurricane.  <br>
We're all fine.  An uprooted birdfeeder, some patio furniture flung <br>
about, nothing compared to what New Orleans and Biloxi have.  Heck, <br>
we only got 5 1/2 inches of rain that night, which was nice, since it <br>
was the first rain we'd gotten since mid-July (not kidding).<br>
<br>
The change in barometric pressure or the psychic abilities of animals <br>
must have make the local fauna crazy, because we saw our first <br>
copperhead in the yard a day before Katrina reached us.  But <br>
considering that it was dead, I'm guessing that it wasn't too <br>
psychic, because wouldn't a fact like your imminent demise be <br>
something you might forsee?  It was pretty, anyway, which is more <br>
than I can say for the bugs down here.  One word.  Locusts.  If you <br>
ever want a practical lesson in self-discipline and patience, come <br>
down here during locust season and sit outside for 15 minutes.  If <br>
that racket doesn't drive you absolutely bonkers, your a stronger <br>
person than I.  The noise they make, which is like what I would <br>
imagine a rattlesnake's rattle would sound like if pumped through a <br>
speaker, is enough to make even the most placid person a little bit <br>
peevish.<br>
<br>
The letterboxing still stinks down here.  And since I'm the only <br>
person who's planting down here, and I've effectively stopped since <br>
May (too dang hot), that means it's REALLY been dead.<br>
<br>
And oh yeah, I had the baby in June. Did I mention that?  Joaquin <br>
Orion (that's Wah-Keen, not Jwa-kwin for those of you who didn't take <br>
Spanish).  He's a big tubby baby who will probably let me go <br>
letterboxing when the weather breaks, as long as I keep him in the <br>
baby sling and don't make him sit in the stroller.  But since there's <br>
nothing to letterbox, it's mostly a non-issue.<br>
<br>
That's all.  I miss you, Michigan, letterboxing, and a regional <br>
cuisine that doesn't feel it necessary to fry and barbeque every item <br>
of food.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Delirium<br>
