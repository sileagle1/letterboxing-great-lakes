                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's a GREAT idea. Museums are non profits that exist to be places<br/>
for members of the larger community to visit AND that museums receive<br/>
most of their funding based on their annual traffic -- a small museum<br/>
would love this idea. All you have to do is point out it will bring<br/>
people to the museum who would never have known it was there, and that<br/>
many of these people have children. Especially if you are giving clues<br/>
that involve people actually visitng the museum itself. Small museums<br/>
typically have low visitor counts so anything that gets more people<br/>
visiting would be a real boon to them.<br/>

&gt; I was wondering, how do you all feel about a letterbox that you would<br/>
<br/>
&gt; have to ask for at a museum?  I am about to place several boxes and <br/>
&gt; there is a small museum/welcome center who is happy to do so.  It<br/>
would <br/>
