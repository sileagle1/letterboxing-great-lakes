  This is GREAT!  I've got a recent convert myself!  My best friend and I ran away to Traverse City for the weekend to get away from, well - everything I guess - and we hunted on Old Mission peninsula.  When we had made our way to SpringChick's Old Mission Light House box, she was amazed that the box was actually there...and her being an avid rubberstamper, she LOVED the stamp.  So then!
