Ummm, SpringChick!  I think you've made a terrible mistake!  I've had <br>
words 2 days in a row now.  It's a Federal requirement that I wait a <br>
minimum of 7 days between receiving new words.  I think the feds will <br>
let you by with a warning on the first offense, but please be more <br>
selective tomorrow.  I wouldn't want you to be charged with the hefty <br>
fines they levy for breaching this mandate!<br>

You know--I was a little bummed today when I saw that I had the <br>
word.  With my competitive nature--if I'm going to lose, then I want <br>
to lose big!  Plus, I had spent all of my carpooling downtime <br>
thinking of a wonderful little story.  Since I went through the <br>
thinking effort, I thought I would share it anyway.  So here goes--<br>
BirdWoman/Waltzing Pigs<br>
=========================<br>
<br>
I was sitting in the break room with a cup of joe when Pete came in <br>
with an assignment:  a distraught letterboxer was in need of <br>
immediate attention and I should get right on it.  This was my chance <br>
to prove myself!  As I reviewed her file, I was quite concerned when <br>
I saw the location; it was a town FULL of cemeteries.  I hoped that <br>
wasn't a bad omen.  <br>
<br>
As I headed down to earth, I could see a woman standing on a bridge <br>
overlooking the Eisenhower.  "Oh no, I hope I'm not too late", I <br>
thought.  I quickly circled downwardyes, in a circle (it's hard to <br>
go straight when you don't have wings).   As I approached, I realized <br>
that she wasn't going to jump, but she was holding a bag over the <br>
expressway.  I introduced myself and said that I was here to help.  <br>
Then I asked her what she was doing.  She sobbed "I wish I had never <br>
become a letterboxer!  Nothing is going rightespecially in BINGO. <br>
I'm throwing it all awaymy logbook, my stamp, my ink and markers, <br>
and most of all my BINGO card! This card is definitely NOT bleeping <br>
golden!"  She dangled her bag over the cars rushing by down below.  <br>
<br>
I couldn't let her drop that bag!  Thinking quickly, I <br>
said, "Remember the time when you were winter boxing by that lake.  A <br>
little girl on a sled zoomed by you and crashed through the ice.  If <br>
you hadn't been thereif you hadn't been letterboxingshe would have <br>
drowned or frozen to death".  <br>
<br>
The woman said "Yeah, I do remember that", and pulled her bag down by <br>
her side.  But she remained upset, so there was still work to do.  I <br>
asked her to walk with me.  We came down the hill.  I steered her <br>
towards a little table in a gazebo and pulled out another tidbit from <br>
her file.  <br>
<br>
"Think back to last spring when you were on the trails", I <br>
said.  "Remember when you came across that family new to <br>
letterboxing.  The grandma was just about to put her hand down that <br>
hole to find the letterbox, and you grabbed her hand away.  You told <br>
her you should always probe a crevice like that with a stick.  When <br>
you put the stick in, a poisonous snake slithered out.  If you hadn't <br>
been thereif you hadn't been letterboxingshe might have been <br>
seriously injured."  <br>
<br>
The woman nodded her head.  I was making progress!  We stood up and <br>
headed down the streetwe walked away from the sunrise because I <br>
needed to keep a close eye on her and didn't want to be blinded by <br>
the light.   One more memory might do it.  I said, "I want you to <br>
remember the gathering you were at a few years ago.  There was one <br>
couple there who were hoping to hit a real milestone there100,000 <br>
finds. And then disaster struck.  They were so engrossed with the <br>
hunt that they didn't notice that they had stumbled into an art <br>
studio and damaged a vase.  The angry potter grabbed all their <br>
supplies and threw them into his kiln.  But you were there to save <br>
the day.  You gave them your clue booklet, along with some other <br>
supplies.  You made it possible for them to fulfill their dreams."  <br>
<br>
"I'm still not sure I want to go on", she said.  Just then, I saw her <br>
friend Thomas by the side of the road.  "Let's go sit by him", I <br>
said.  Thomas said, "We know you've been through a lot lately, so <br>
everyone pitched in to get you this pile of letterboxing booty".  <br>
<br>
The woman seemed overwhelmed by the gesture.  Then she broke into a <br>
big smile and exclaimed, "I DO want to go letterboxing again, right <br>
here and right now!  It's a wonderful hobby!"<br>
<br>
My job was done, so I headed back up to HQ to report in.  Pete <br>
said, "Clarence, that was a job well doneyou've earned your wings".  <br>
<br>
My last words to you all are:  "Remember that every time a stamp is <br>
inked, a letterboxing angel earns their wings."<br>

We are in stitiches with your "It's a Letterboxing Life" story!  We especially loved the fact that <br>
your card is not "bleeping" golden...just like Tiptoe's.  Rod would be so proud of you <br>
speaking like a true Illini!    Maybe you could go on the talk show circuit with your complaints <br>
of how unfair it is that Spring Chick foiled your chance at taking over as Bingo Queen!  BTW <br>
Tiptoe sits with a big three boxes.  Guess that's better than zero!<br>
<br>
Speaking of bleeping golden....what about the fact that ALL the winners thus far have been <br>
from Spring Chick's own state?  What's up with that?  We will be heading into enemy territory <br>
on Saturday for the Iditarod...we'll have to do some reconnaissance for the rest of the <br>
midwest states while we are "mushing" around!<br>

(I'm sure you'll be thinking of your northerly neighbors, not just your IL cohorts, right?  Or do we have to commit to a campaign donation or some cushy position on a board of directors first?)  I noticed that SpringChick is wearing a "bleeping" golden shirt on Facebook - maybe somebody already paid her off?<br>
<br>
Glad to hear that BirdWoman is now a "Free Bird" and perhaps will be soaring to some sort of victory for all her good deeds.<br>

Tiptoe & Tonto: you be taking your own mushing dog along?  We're looking forward to reading about the event and seeing some photos.<br>

It's funny that you should mention this concern.  My son is doing a <br>
school report on the FBI right now and he was scrolling through their <br>
web site gathering information last night.  He yelled out to me that <br>
their was some information that I might be interested in.  I thought <br>
that I would share it will all of you.   ------BirdWoman/Waltzing Pigs<br>
<br>
Here is the info that he found:  <br>
<br>
ChicagoSpecial Agent in Charge (SAC) Robert M. Grant announced the <br>
presence of a special task force code-named "Operation Muggle".  This <br>
task force was formed several years ago in order to investigate the <br>
activities of a group called the "Great Lakes Letterboxers".  This <br>
group first came to the attention of the FBI when several suspicious<br>
looking camouflaged boxes were found near sensitive areas.  Although <br>
the contents of the boxes were not dangerous, the FBI felt that <br>
further scrutiny was warranted.  An agent infiltrated the group at <br>
that time in order to monitor their activities.  The investigation <br>
was recently escalated when the agent became concerned about alleged <br>
irregularities in a "Letterboxing Bingo" scheme.  Further details <br>
cannot be released at this time, since this is an ongoing <br>
investigation.  To date, this investigation has not resulted in the <br>
filing of any criminal charges.  <br>

It's funny that you should mention this concern. My son is doing  a <br>
school report on the FBI right now and he was scrolling through their  <br>
web site gathering information last night. He yelled out to me that  <br>
their was some information that I might be interested in. I thought  <br>
that I would share it will all of you. ------BirdWoman/that I would shar<br>
<br>
Here is the info that he found: <br>
<br>
Chicago—Special Agent in  Charge (SAC) Robert M. Grant announced the <br>
presence of a special task  force code-named "Operation Muggle". This <br>
task force was formed several  years ago in order to investigate the <br>
activities of a group called the  "Great Lakes Letterboxers"activit<br>
group first came to the attention of  the FBI when several suspicious—<br>
looking camouflaged boxes were found near  sensitive areas. Although <br>
the contents of the boxes were not dangerous,  the FBI felt that <br>
further scrutiny was warranted. An agent infiltrated the  group at <br>
that time in order to monitor their activities. The investigation  <br>
was recently escalated when the agent became concerned about alleged  <br>
irregularities in a "Letterboxing Bingo" scheme. Further details  <br>
cannot be released at this time, since this is an ongoing  <br>
investigation. To date, this investigation has not resulted in the  <br>
filing of any criminal charges.  <br>
