Well, now that you've ruined our surprise, we'll have to find some other <br>
way to dazzle the Olympic judges. As for your daunting training videos <br>
and, obviously slanted, fan polls, we pay them no mind.   It is time to <br>
focus and ignore the hype so we can prepare to take our place on the top <br>
of the podium!<br>
