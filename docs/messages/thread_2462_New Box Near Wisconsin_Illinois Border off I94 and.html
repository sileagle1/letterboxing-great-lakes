to have become a hobby of mine........I should be able to find 194 and 41.<br>
Tho I really can't say as I'm into decaffeinated anything any too much.  :-)<br>

I know its still early on a Monday to think about<br>
going "Decaffeinated," but if you are near Wadsworth IL, you might<br>
want to give it a try.  Clues can be found on LbNA or Atlasquest.<br>
This is a quick box, and an ideal stop between Chicago and Milwaukee.<br>
