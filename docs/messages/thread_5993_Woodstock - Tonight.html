WH, are you including Acorn in your count? I'm not sure if she's been online<br>
lately, but she's planning on coming. And DMS and I might have another<br>
couple (some relative newbies) with us as well if the timing works out -<br>
they're not going to know until the last minute whether they'll be out of<br>
work on time or not.<br>

It was fun to see Der Mad Stamper & RaqsEnigma again and a pleasant surprise that they brought along the historic patch collection they compiled last year.  If you're interested in more info about the patches, you can find it here:<br>
<br>
http://www.weliveandbreathe.com/history_patches.htm<br>
<br>
They also very generously distributed copies of the booklet that was created for the "We Live and Breathe Letterboxing" event last year to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of LBing in the USA.<br>
<br>
Of course it was also nice to chat with our local LB friends and we were happy that we had such a good turnout.  Lastly, a special thanks to Acorn for suggesting such an accommodating pub!<br>
