Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
Should have posted this earlier, but I wanted to let everyone know <br/>
that we are aware of the delays in email delivery that are affecting <br/>
many groups right now. The problem is not related to any of the <br/>
database and hardware work we were doing earlier in the year. <br/>
Rather, the primary cause is the "My Wife virus <br/>
(http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_138027.htm), which has caused a <br/>
huge spike in the number of emails sent to Yahoo! Groups. This spike <br/>
has gone beyond the capacity of our current systems to handle, which <br/>
is causing the delays in email delivery.<br/>
<br/>
We have already taken two steps to address the issue, which has <br/>
begun to reduce the number of delays:<br/>
- We are dropping (i.e. not delivering) all outgoing email that <br/>
includes the virus (in other words, we are not sending infected <br/>
messages to groups).<br/>
- We have added additional server capacity<br/>
<br/>
And we are planning to increase that capacity even more. However, <br/>
until the virus has fully played itself out or more ISPs have taken <br/>
steps to reduce the amount of email they are sending to us (by <br/>
dropping messages that contain the virus rather than forcing us to <br/>
do it), there may continue to be some delays.<br/>
<br/>
Our apologies for any inconvenience.<br/>
<br/>
