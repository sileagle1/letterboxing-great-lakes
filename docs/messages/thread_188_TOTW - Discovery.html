                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Nice topic Deb.  I've lately become a semi-active chowhound.  I've been <br/>
thinking that it's a lot like letterboxing, in that the idea is to find <br/>
interesting out-of-the-way places and encourage other people to visit them <br/>
too.   And, like letterboxing, it's something you can do at whatever level <br/>
of involvement suits your present circumstances and something you can slip <br/>
away from for months at a time without worrying about whether you'll be <br/>
welcome when you return  (hmm, starting to sound like Weight Watchers--but <br/>
that's another story ;-)    I've also been encouraging my chowhound buddies <br/>
to check out letterboxing.<br/>
          Most chowhound events are just a meal at some new restaurant, but <br/>
several times a chowhound contingent has cooked and served dinner at a <br/>
homeless shelter.  My most recent expedition involved an all-day hike up <br/>
Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago, checking out Polish diners, Mexican elote <br/>
carts, and Guatamalean grocery stores, and ending at the famous Superdawg, <br/>
11 miles from our start.<br/>

<br/>
I've been stalking for about two weeks now, so let me introduce<br/>
myself.  My trail name is Dagonell the Pirate.  I found out about this<br/>
yahoo group when I was letterboxing around Chicago.  I'm probably the<br/>
Eastern most member of this group.  I live near the NY-PA border and I<br/>
can literally see Lake Erie from my back porch.<br/>
<br/>
In real life, my wife and I are computer programmers.  Actually,<br/>
that's what we were doing in Chicago, my wife was presenting her<br/>
newest paper to the Midwest AI and Cog-Sci Conference.  My other major<br/>
hobby is the Society for Creative Anachronism, a hobbyist group that<br/>
studies the Middle Ages.  They're web-page is http://www.sca.org  My<br/>
web-page is http://www-cs.canisius.edu/~salley  <br/>

FungusWoman - I am also a geocacher, and hope you all won't hold <br/>
that against me!  My passions are my husband, stepsons and their <br/>
wives, my three grandkids, my 11 Girl Scouts, cooking (for big <br/>
crowds, no less), and hanging out in the out of doors as much as <br/>
possible.  I'm taking my GS's to Savannah, GA this summer, so right <br/>
now most of my energies are concentrated on raising funds for that <br/>
trip.  Anyone interested in a plate of spaghetti served up by eager, <br/>
smiling Girl Scouts can contact me and I'll be happy to clue you in <br/>
to our fast approaching Spaghetti Dinner fundraiser - I'll even make <br/>
up an event stamp if you want d;-)  You can stop by the kitchen to <br/>

He's been playing drums since he was 8 years old and recently joined a new group in the area - Ghouls &amp; Disciples (yes, he's into the hard rock).  They won't be ready to gig for a while yet, but he's excited because he's missed performing since he left his last band (creative differences ;)<br/>
<br/>
I'm also a musician, but in the classical sense.  I'm a second violinist for the Parma Symphony Orchestra here in the Cleveland area.  We're a community orchestra, it's lots of fun &amp; we perform 4 times a year - October, December, March &amp; May, usually the first Sunday of the month.  If you're planning on a Cleveland area letterboxing trip why not plan it around one of our concerts? :)<br/>
<br/>
Jeff also loves taking photos (esp since his parents bought him a digital camera for his last birthday) and I've recently been engulfed by scrapbooking, which is a nice combination, huh?  Jeff's been taking scenic photos of the places we've gone letterboxing, and since we couldn't find just the right journal to use for our stamps we decided to use blank index cards as our journal (that way we never run out of pages) so my next scrapbooking project will be intermixing his scenic shots with our letterbox stamps.  <br/>

<br/>
I got so absorbed in following the Chowhound links that I forgot I <br/>
was intending to post something myself!  (I'll have to go back and <br/>
bookmark that page and sign-up for the email list...)<br/>
<br/>
As you might guess, I'm also a person who loves food - constantly <br/>
reading restaurant reviews, asking people about restaurant <br/>
recommendations, following the comings &amp; goings of chefs, restaurant <br/>
openings &amp; closings, etc. And of course EATING at a wide variety of <br/>
restaurants.<br/>
<br/>
To work off all that eating, we go to the gym a lot and we've <br/>
belonged to a local (Milwaukee, WI) hiking club for over 6 years.  <br/>
It's a great group and I created and maintain a website for the club <br/>
(www.wisconsingohiking.homestead.com)<br/>
<br/>
Other interests include travel, theater, biking and reading.  Since <br/>
we became consumed with letterboxing, I've spent less time updating <br/>
our personal websites.  As a result there is some stuff at <br/>
www.execpc.com/~jrussell (our old ISP) and some stuff at <br/>
wwww.kotlarek.homestead.com<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to meeting many of you at the gathering.  This <br/>
topic is a nice preliminary to the event!<br/>

his mother for dinner for Mother's Day.  He said he was trying to <br/>
think of something different to do with her, something fun.  I <br/>
suggested we take her letterboxing.  He told me I needed a life.  <br/>
Some people just don't get it...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone, sorry I have been lax on getting the TOTW posted <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; &gt; week -- have been very preoccupied with work-related things.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This week's topic is not about letterboxing, rather about you.  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; think we all will agree that through our involvement in <br/>
&gt; letterboxing <br/>
&gt; &gt; we have learned much about the areas where we live as well as <br/>
&gt; &gt; explored new places and learned of many new things.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Along the lines of discovery -- help us to discover news things <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; a bit about each other by providing a bit of information about a <br/>
&gt; &gt; hobby, interest or cause which you are involved with, other than <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing.  Feel free to provide links for further <br/>

week's topic...<br/>
<br/>
I am a person who jumps into way too many things as I learn about <br/>
them...  For the most part, I am compulsive for a while and then <br/>
interest fades away and unfinished projects make their way to the <br/>
dark corners of closets and basement shelves.<br/>
<br/>
But there are a few things that I have stuck with through the years -<br/>
- some constant interests, some that I return to over and over <br/>
again.  These interests are writing poetry, photography and various <br/>
forms of artistic endeavors.  Oh, and I guess I could throw in web <br/>
design, although that really is so much a part of my everyday life <br/>
that I really don't even think of it as a hobby any longer.<br/>
<br/>
All of these interests can be further explored through my eyes at my <br/>
various [ever-evolving and not too frequently updated] websites...<br/>
