The original round patch is also shown there.  I'd welcome comments on <br/>
the colors on both the "tree" portion of the new design and the <br/>
outside border color.  I liked what we had on the round patch and am <br/>
tending to ask them to try to duplicate those colors.  Let me know <br/>

P.S.  I was amazed they could get the detail of the little LBNA logo.  <br/>
I did need to fill in the outlined letters, but am still quite <br/>
impressed.<br/>

I have to agree that turquoise is not the right color. I like the <br/>
colors from either of the first 2 patches with the varigated greens in <br/>
the second patch being my favorite. <br/>

you might be looking at a computer-generated image as your favorite, <br/>
not a scan of an actual patch.  They try to duplicate the variegation <br/>

an area. I think they may have used 2 greens and 1 blue in the patch we <br/>
first ordered (first photo).<br/>
