Yep, the little get-together is a "go" for Saturday 16 Oct.<br/>
<br/>
Still working out the details, but I did get out yesterday and place <br/>
a new 3 box series in the Duck Lake area for it. I'm planning to <br/>
pass out clues to the participants and then post them at <br/>
letterboxing.org the next day.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also working on a design for the event stamp, in case we get <br/>
enough participants.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is interesting in attending, please send me a note with <br/>
your email address so I can add you to the participant group email <br/>
list I'm creating. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
