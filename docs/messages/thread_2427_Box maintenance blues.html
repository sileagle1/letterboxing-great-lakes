                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also would like to add to this topic..In the last few Saturday's <br>
of letterboxing, more than half of the boxes we've found were <br>
exposed.  (Although disappointing, this sometimes has worked to our <br>
benefit!) We have surmised that one of the reasons for this <br>
unfortunate situation can be blamed on the use of leaves as the main <br>
cover. Let us make a gentle reminder that WIND HAPPENS!  While <br>
a "smattering" of leaves around the replanted box seems to do the <br>
trick, it only lasts about ten minutes after you've left the box <br>
when the wind demons make those dead leaves dance and fly away!<br>
<br>
As a side note:  We checked on one of our boxes (Slow Growth Oak) <br>
that I planted against Tonto's better judgement...in a flood <br>
plain...The only sign of it was a suspicious oil slick (ink slick?)<br>
on top of the foot of water covering the fallen log!  He's making me <br>
come clean with this formal public confession!  "I will listen to <br>
Tonto, I will listen to Tonto...." (Yeah,yeah.... whatever!  Like <br>
he's never made a mistake!)<br>

<br>
I checked on my Dora series earlier this month.  All there, all good to<br>
go.  Then yesterday I received an email from GEOCACHERS saying they found<br>
one strewn about.  I don't know which one yet, but I have to go and check<br>
all of them now.<br>
<br>
I am tossing around the idea of retiring this series due to the fact I<br>
will not be able to run and check on them so easily after my move.  They<br>
have a number of finders and it is sort of along the way from Indy to<br>
Cincinnati.  If it makes it to August 2006, they will have been out for 2<br>
years.  I am amazed, though, that until now, they've been safe.<br>
<br>
Many thanks to IndyColtsCachers, for giving me the heads-up.<br>
