                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found out about letterboxing from a September 2003 article in <br/>
Family Fun magazine.  I had kept the article around for a long while <br/>
and didn't do anything about it.  My son had a doctor appointment in <br/>
May 2004.  In the waiting room, he was reading a nature magazine <br/>
(Ranger Rick, I think) and it had a letterboxing article in it.  He <br/>
asked if we could do it sometime, and I told him about the Family Fun <br/>
article.  Still, we waited until July 2004 to try for the first time.  <br/>
When we found our first letterbox, a family that we knew had signed in <br/>
2 days before.  I called the mom and talked to her about it.  <br/>
Interestingly, she had read the same article I did and also waited <br/>
until July to start looking.  We were going on a trip to the western <br/>
half of MI and I mentioned a letterbox we were going to try.  Her <br/>
family was going to Indiana and planned to search for some boxes, as <br/>
well. When we found the letterbox in W. MI, her family had left a note <br/>
for us!  We were hooked!<br/>
