Thank you for the congratulations on being the biggest loser so far, with 16 blank spaces.  <br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law once won a trophy that says "Last Place" in her bowling league one year.  It's the only trophy that sits on a shelf in our house.  <br/>
<br/>
We consider it an heirloom.  We still laugh about it, and it helps us to laugh at our own failures today.  It's awesome.<br/>
