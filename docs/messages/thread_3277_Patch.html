place the order.  After they arrive (a few weeks??) I'll update info <br>
for purchasing them from me.  When we first ordered patches, there was <br>
a lot of interest, so I ordered 200, all of which were gone in less <br>
than a year.  I don't think there will be quite as much initial demand <br>
for the new design, so I'll probably only order 100.  Due to larger <br>
patch size and smaller order quantity, price per patch will probably be <br>
about $2.50.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also agree that there's too much blue in the sample patch.  Moreso than that, there's too abrupt a change between the colors and too much of a difference between the colors (even between greens).  In the original patch the color change was less obvious because the greens were similar to each other and the green that touched the blue was fairly similar to the blue.<br>
