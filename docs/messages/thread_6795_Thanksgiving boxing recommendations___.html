You know we always sing the praises of Hocking Hills, Ohio....lots of boxes, great cabin rentals, beautiful scenery, and plenty of hiking...weather can be good and then again...not so much..other negative could be the few restaurant choices in the park vicinity, but Logan would give you a better offering...just a thought...<br>

We had a great time in Hocking Hills!! We rented a cabin from Lazy Lane Cabins - had a great experience! Logan is not far from the parks, but we cooked in the cabin most the time. Favorite restaurant was the Italian Cafe that was located just west of Logan on the main hwy. It is in a shiny silver dining train car and they had amazing food - many unique dishes too. Most  cabins have hot tubs and fireplaces, too. There are tons of boxes in the area and the scenery was beautiful.  Our favorite boxes were ones by Trailtracker and SitsnKnits, but all were nice. A few of the seven parks are connected by trails, so people who enjoy a longer hike can hike between parks.  My favorite park by far was Cantwell Cliffs - awesome scenery and stairs/passageways weaving in and out of the cliffs. Made it to all parks except the Rock House park. We tried for 42 boxes and found 40 in 2 days time. Pretty good odds! Check out my logbook for the ones we found. Have fun and let us know if you have anymore questions! I have visitors guide and map of area that I can mail to you.<br>

stairs/passageways weaving in and out of the cliffs. Made it to all parks<br>

You know we always sing the praises of Hocking Hills, Ohio....lots of boxes,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
great cabin rentals, beautiful scenery, and plenty of hiking...weather can<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
be good and then again...not so much..other negative could be the few<br>

<br>
<br>
restaurant choices in the park vicinity, but Logan would give you a better<br>

Oh, you are sounding pretty persuasive! We will keep this high on our list.<br>

We'll see what the weather forecast looks like, as well as availability of<br>
<br>
accommodations.<br>

We had a great time in Hocking Hills!! We rented a cabin from Lazy Lane<br>
<br>
Cabins - had a great experience! Logan is not far from the parks, but we<br>
<br>
cooked in the cabin most the time. Favorite restaurant was the Italian Cafe<br>
<br>
that was located just west of Logan on the main hwy. It is in a shiny silver<br>
<br>
dining train car and they had amazing food - many unique dishes too. Most<br>
<br>
cabins have hot tubs and fireplaces, too. There are tons of boxes in the<br>
<br>
area and the scenery was beautiful. Our favorite boxes were ones by<br>
<br>
Trailtracker and SitsnKnits, but all were nice. A few of the seven parks are<br>
<br>
connected by trails, so people who enjoy a longer hike can hike between<br>
<br>
parks. My favorite park by far was Cantwell Cliffs - awesome scenery and<br>
<br>
stairs/passageways weaving in and out of the cliffs. Made it to all parks<br>
<br>
except the Rock House park. We tried for 42 boxes and found 40 in 2 days<br>

<br>
I hope TrailTracker doesn't mind me throwing her name out here, but if you are going to Hocking Hills to letterbox, contact her on AQ and I'm sure she'd be glad to give you some advice about what boxes are currently available.  <br>
