                    <div class="plaintext-content">I guess i need to set my sites on the IL gathering now.  I had really <br>
wanted to go to GLG/MN, but $ and time are in short supply.  I had 2 <br>
family members lined up to split gas and driving with me (they were <br>
going to visit family, i was going to event and ok a couple hours <br>
with family), but a couple of recent illnesses (not me or my daughter <br>
for a change) have derailed that plan.  So if i were to go now i <br>
would have to go by myself.  And an 8+ hr drive is not a drive i <br>
would want to make by myself.  Pooh!<br>
<br>
so barring winning the lottery (at which point the $ are no longer a <br>
concern and i could get myself a chauffer), i will have to stay here <br>
in lonely central IL.  GLG just sounded like a lot of fun.... and a <br>
chance to get rid of some cooties  ( yeah i know, i would probably <br>
come back with more than i have now).  But at least the poor things <br>
would get a chance to move on. <br>
<br>
Oh well, it's not like i don't have several things on my list to do, <br>
and that's the fun list (some boxes not too far from home and some <br>
LTCs), not the "I gotta..." list (clean garage,basement, etc).<br>
<br>
You all have fun!<br>

peeps to console her - this calls for a really crunchy one!)<br>
