Eastern Upper Peninsula this past weekend.  Here is a run-down of <br/>
boxes found -- all were in good condition, unless otherwise noted:<br/>
<br/>
*Demond Fire Tower (Raco)<br/>
*Brimley's Whitefish Point (Brimley) -- This box was found laying <br/>
uncovered alongside the trail.  We attempted to conceal it with bark <br/>
and sticks when we left.<br/>
*Ursus Americanus (Newberry) -- this box was laying out in the open <br/>
and I couldn't really find a way to disguise it much when putting it <br/>
back -- not sure exactly where it is supposed to be "hidden" as <br/>
there didn't appear to be any actual hiding spots there.<br/>
*Big Pine (Paradise)<br/>
*The Seney Stretch (Seney) -- This box was also found laying in the <br/>
open. The people who were stamped in last also stamped in a HH and <br/>
appear to have left it, however, there was no HH in the box.  Not <br/>
sure if they stamped it and then forgot to put it in the box, or if <br/>
somebody came along afterward and took the HH, stamped into it's <br/>
logbook and forgot to stamp into the actual box log.<br/>
*Big Knob (Engadine)<br/>
*Cut River Bridge (Epoufette)<br/>
*Under the Northern Lights (St. Ignace)<br/>
*Sail Away (Mackinaw City) - logbook is full<br/>
*MI CA-T (Mackinaw City) - logbook is full<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the following boxes were replaced and updated clues <br/>
have been posted:<br/>
<br/>
Hiawatha Series: Gitche Gumee (Bay Mills)<br/>
Point Iroquois Lighthouse (Bay Mills)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the placers for some fun boxes!  On to the Western U.P. in <br/>
a couple of weeks!<br/>
