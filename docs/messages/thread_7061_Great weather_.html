                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was fantastic to get out today in the summer-like temperatures!  We found two quick boxes in the Milwaukee area (strangely, one did not contain a stamp, but instead sheets of little commercial stickers.  What's up w/that?!?!?).<br/>
<br/>
Then we headed up to the northern Kettle Moraine to replant the 3 boxes we had created for Dead of Winter II.  We chose a nice 5-mile loop trail which included views of some ponds and a marsh.  The marsh was a noisy area with spring peepers, geese and sandhill cranes.  Even though the temperatures were in the low 80s, intermittant sections of the trail were still covered with snow/ice.  We will be glad to see all of that melt in the near future!<br/>
