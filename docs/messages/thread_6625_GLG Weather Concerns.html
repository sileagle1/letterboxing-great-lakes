<br>
 I'm sitting here with one child almost in tears who is getting over the sniffles and a cough while we debate if we will be able to go tomorrow. <br>
<br>
 We leave next Friday to camp and letterbox the circle tour around Lake Michigan and I'm afraid of bringing her out in the rain and her getting sick again for our vacation.<br>
<br>
 I think our decision is to check the weather and forecast in the morning about 4am and if it's over 50% then we will have to pass. <br>
<br>
 I believe we were signed up for forks and cups so if someone else who is going can pick them up I will definately reemburse them or can send a contribution to the planners. Even if we do make it just to cover the costs and unexpected stop. <br>
<br>
 I guess on the positive side for everyone else is that if it says over 50% and we don't come you will all be assured of great weather. If we do come then heaven help us and hopefully Noah has started the Ark!!<br>
<br>
Fingers crossed it's under 50% when we check.<br>

Many of them that had been out on the trails earlier were showing off their muddy garments & limbs, but all seemed in good spirits.  We're hoping for the best tomorrow!<br>
