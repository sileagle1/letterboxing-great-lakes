                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to h.Owl, I received the stamp for the Year of the Dog box in <br>
the mail recently.  The rest of the box had apparently been destroyed <br>
by animals, but h.Owl saved what she could and discarded the rest.  The <br>
original stamp is now back in place in a new box with a new logbook.<br>
<br>
This weekend we also found 5 boxes in the nearby area (including the <br>
fun new one by Brat Pack IL) and checked on four other boxes we planted <br>
to check on their status.  One of these checks was prompted by the <br>
following "Contact the Placer" message I received a few days ago:<br>
<br>
"Message: <br>
Lots of fun.  Why the Rabbit Was Late Letterbox was placed just as <br>
expected and in good shape as of 11/06/06.  Our playgroup, which <br>
included 7 women and lots of 3,4, and 5 year olds had a blast.  Thanks."<br>
<br>
Well, that sounded like a mob to us, so thought we'd better check on <br>
things.  Luckily the box was rehidden well and they only used a single <br>
page to stamp in.  However the stamp bag was not resealed at all and <br>
the logbook was laying loose in the box, not in a baggie at all!  <br>
Thankfully everything was still dry (even after all that rain & snow <br>
this week).  We fixed things up and I sent a carefully worded reply <br>
(didn't want to dampen their enthusiasm, but did caution about being <br>
discreet and being sure to have an adult reseal everything carefully, <br>
especially the logbook).<br>
<br>
Only 3 weeks until the St. Nick's gathering!  <br>
