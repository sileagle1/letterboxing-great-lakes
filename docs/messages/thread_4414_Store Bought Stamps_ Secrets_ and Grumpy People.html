                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry about that one Kimono girl!  It bothers me that someone took my stamp, but I always just assumed it was an un-informed geocacher or new letterboxer.  Thank you for the compliments on my stamps!  Just in case someone hasn't seen my work and wants to, take a look at my Picture Trail.  www.PictureTrail.com/scoutdogs   I've pulled my stamps (except in TX) so you won't get a spoiler.<br>

I never cared for the store bought stamps when I was letterboxing.  When I started, I had never attempted carving anything before, but before I tried placing a box, I decided to try carving.  All the stamps in my area were hand carved.  What I found through letterboxing has been a real LOVE of carving.  I find it very zen and a good way to relax.  So, as the saying goes... TRY IT, you might like it!  or more modern... "Just DO it!"  :-) And don't feel like no one will like your carving because it isn't perfect.  That's NOT the case!<br>

In fact, the only time I've ever really been upset about finding a<br>
store bought stamp was when we were in Ohio and we were looking for one of Scoutdogs' boxes. Scoutdogs was the one who introduced me and Katy to letterboxing and we were really looking forward to this box because her stamps are AWESOME. When we found the box, someone had replaced her stamp with a cheap store-bought foam stamp. I was SO bummed!<br>

great series.  Thanks for sharing!<br>
