To me, the fun of LB'ing is the hunt and find it. Don't really care what the stamp image is. I just wanted to make sure that other finders didn't care either. Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found that I had difficulty thinking of ideas for carves.  Some boxes seem <br/>
so uniquely suited to their environment, and some hikes are very creative. <br/>
When I stumbled upon postal letterboxes, I found a huge wealth of carving <br/>
ideas.  Just browsing through the postal trackers set up in Atlas Quest <br/>
should keep you in ideas for years.  Here is a post that someone re-posted <br/>
on AtlasQuest.  It is a list of ideas for postal trackers - a series of <br/>
postal letterboxes - but each of these can be done as planted singles.  Hope <br/>
it generates an idea or two.<br/>
<br/>
And don't worry about being boring.  We are an appreciative group!<br/>

Copied from an old post by MoWizLiz:<br/>
<br/>
In case people don't visit the Yahoo Postal board much, we had a little bit <br/>
of fun a while back coming up with a year's worth and some of ideas for <br/>
singles and rings. Doglvrs was kind enough to keep track, put it together <br/>
and upload it as a file there: year's worth of ideas. The dates aren't <br/>
necessarily a date for the idea, but rather an easy way for us to keep track <br/>
in our messages of where we were with coming up with 365+ ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Drum roll please!<br/>

&gt; Ok, thanks! I guess I was just being too paranoid about it, LOL!<br/>
&gt; To me, the fun of LB'ing is the hunt and find it. Don't really care what the stamp image is. I just wanted to make sure that other finders didn't care either. Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I just love every stamp I find!  I can't say as I've ever found a stamp I consider boring (especially if it is handcarved).  I agree with Doglvrs ~ carve what you like, it will make the carving fun and more than likely it will make for a great stamp!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; To be honest -- I usually find a subject I like and carve that.... I carve what's fun for me to carve...lol --- maybe other people don't find those fun to find?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;       <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;       <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;       Most of my carved stamps have been running/race related because I plant them while we are out waiting for dh to finish a race. My most recent series was birthday themed because Louie wanted to teach her friends how to LB so I planted them for her birthday and that was our "activity" for the party. I'm working on a series that I will plant in the park near where I grew up. Those stamps are all of activities that we used to do in the park.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Most of the finds that we've found have something to do with the place it's located (like if it's a historical or tourist spot), or maybe it's a series with several boxes to find.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But what about the general single box that I want to plant here or there simply because the park/woods are beautiful and have lots of good spots available? Nothing historical or touristy about that park. Just a nice hike and beautiful woods. Do woodland animal stamps get boring?  How else to come up with ideas for carvings?<br/>

 if its not located at the actual place, try to carve something from your  <br/>
childhood or a favorite book image or vacation.<br/>

Then share the meaning of the image along with the clues.<br/>

Like I said, even if the image doesn't necessarily line up with where you  <br/>
hide it .. . at least you have a little story to share about the image  <br/>
itself.<br/>
