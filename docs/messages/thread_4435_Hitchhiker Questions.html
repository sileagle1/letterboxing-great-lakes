clear up some of my confusion. <br>
<br>
1-Are hitchhikers *usually* in some kind of box or container of their <br>
own or just in another baggie that gets placed in the host box?<br>
<br>
2-Are you suposed to stamp the HH in the host box and the host box in <br>
the HH along with your personal stamp?<br>
<br>
I found one HH and was a bit surprised with what I saw in it cause it <br>
wasn't anything like I expected. It was just in a baggie (which dawned <br>
on me then it really ddn't need its own box since it was hiding in <br>
another box for protection) but it only had personal stamps in it so I <br>
had no clue where it had been, only who had had it. I stamped both the <br>
box I found it and hid it in the log book on the page with my personal <br>
stamp. Was that the right thing to do or does that just take up to <br>
much space in the logbook to stamp the host boxes?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like you did the right thing. You are supposed to stamp the image of  <br>
the HH into the "host" letterbox and stamp the "host" letterbox stamp into the <br>
 logbook of the HH.<br>
 <br>
You also put your personal stamp into both the traditional box and the HH's  <br>
logbook.<br>
 <br>
Technically if you find a HH and it doesn't have the image of the box you  <br>
found it in (or its image is not in the logbook of the box you found it in) you  <br>
can do that part.<br>
 <br>
HH's come in many shapes and sizes. Of course the larger the HH the harder  <br>
it is to find a new "host" that is large enough to hold it. I've seen several  <br>
that are just in a zip lock baggie... I've heard of them being in film <br>
canisters  or those little "bubbles" that small trinkits come in at the grocery store <br>
for a  few quarters.<br>
 <br>
I only have one HH out there in the wild and I put it in a small coin  purse.<br>
