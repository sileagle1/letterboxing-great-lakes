I wonder....Do geocachers ever complain that someone (?) finds their caches, rubs black ink all over the trinkets in order to stamp them into their personal logbooks, and then leaves an inky mess in their geocaches?  LOL!   I don't think so.   I can't figure it out either.  My fear with trinkets in a letterbox is that someone will think the stamp is a choice for the taking.  <br>

I asked her to write "do not take stamp" on the stamp, but she forgot to take a sharpie. Hopefully it'll last.<br>

<br>
I have a few letterboxes and am considering making one with a trinket theme.  You know those pompoms with antennae and googly eyes?  We call them Herbies and I am thinking about a Herbie box.  I would include a bag of Herbies for people to take but I'd also label it carefully.<br>
<br>
Labeling the stamper is a great idea and, even though I include instructions in all my boxes, an additional reminder on the stampers can't hurt, right?<br>
