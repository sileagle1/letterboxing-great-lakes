Mecosta county -- go for it!  Don't think that because I indicated <br>
that I have one ready to go that you would be scooping me -- I cannot <br>
get there this weekend and will be in Rhode Island next weekend, so it <br>
will be at least 3 weeks before I can get up there.  I don't want MI <br>
to lose the race because everyone was waiting for me.  If you can get <br>
there and plant a box -- feel free!<br>
