of you were able to enjoy it this weekend!  <br>
<br>
It was a real treat to run into Spring Chick and "Butterfly" doing <br>
the series.  Now I truly have met my goal of catching a letterboxer <br>
in the wild and have the stamp images to prove it!  When Deb said <br>
they had seen azobox, Grandvilla and Mobiusklien I was a little bit <br>
bummed that I didn't have time to find them and exchange with them <br>
too, but we were on the way to get Bindlestiff ready for launching <br>
next week. <br>
<br>
(Background: When Enders Angel and I met Grandvilla and Mobiusklien <br>
on the trail, I didn't have my logbook or stamp with me (but she <br>
did) so she won't let me count them as meeting my goal, saying, "No <br>
stamp means no proof.")<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all the nice notes about our series.<br>
<br>
Enjoy!<br>
