                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great quiz!    Although we've found quite a few boxes in 4.5 years, it's<br>
funny how we can remember individual boxes.  We don't keep notes in our<br>
logbook, other than box title, city & state and date we found it.  But when<br>
you described the ant hill, I immediately could picture the trail & park I<br>
think you're talking about.  I looked through our list of boxes found and<br>
checked the clues for a couple in a specific park and then was pretty sure I<br>
knew the answer to your quiz.  I then told Martini Man about your "quiz"<br>
since he hadn't checked his email yet after we got home from a party<br>
tonight.  He immediately said Florida, then west coast, then off the top of<br>
his head named the same park I had come up with.  Then he amazingly named<br>
the box from memory - the same one I came up with after consulting my list<br>
and clues!  (Martini Man is definitely the person you want on your team for<br>
any trivia game!!)<br>
<br>
So, are we right in guessing: "You Can Paddle All Around It In A Big Canoe"<br>
in Fort Meyers, Florida?  We found this box in April 2006, so it's been a<br>
while...<br>
<br>
Hope you're having a great time on your vacation!<br>

Wow!  Obviously a popular spot for us Great Lakes boxers.  When we were in<br>
FL we also found a box planted by the Waltzing Pigs in the same park.  Based<br>
on all the folks from our region who visit that area, maybe we should plan<br>
an event down there sometime!  (Obviously a "winter" event so we could<br>
escape the frozen north.)<br>

We found that box as well when visiting my folks in Ft. Myers.  Don't <br>
remember an ant hill.  Of course, if we had sat on it, I bet we would <br>
remember it!<br>
