We had a great time seeing old faces and meeting new ones, then hitting the trails for a wide variety of Minnesota-related images. The weather was perfect and the park was a great choice. Our only regret was not having enough time to find the many other boxes that are still out there... oh, and maybe not bringing our swimsuits for a quick jump in the river after tackling those hills a few times!<br/>

when we were hanging around the parking lot chatting and the fierce weather<br/>
rolled in.  We hoped you were OK.  We stopped by Campsite #12 late this<br/>
afternoon, but it was deserted.  Glad to hear you survived intact!<br/>
<br/>
We also would like to thank The Red Cat, her parents, her brother and the<br/>
other local assistants that helped create such a fine event.  The weather<br/>
was great until late in the day, the food was fantastic, the stamps<br/>
interesting, placements very well done, and we got a good workout on the<br/>
hikes!<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed seeing some old friends (after almost 5 years of boxing they are<br/>
now too numerous to mention) and meeting some new folks.  It was really nice<br/>
to see how many WI folks made it to the event this year. Gives a lot of<br/>
credibility to "The Coolest Thing About Minnesota" box (very funny, Walking<br/>
Stick!!)<br/>
<br/>
We really enjoyed spending Saturday afternoon on the trail with<br/>
PackerBacker, her young ladies Tayler &amp; Lacey, and the "mom" portion of<br/>
Partyof6.  We were all dismayed to see Po6 take a tumble over a tree root in<br/>
the trail and hope her ankle is healing quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Today we were back at the park to find more boxes.  We had GREAT weather all<br/>
day and met a few other groups of boxers out on the trail.  It took us until<br/>
6 pm, but by the end of the weekend we managed to find all the boxes in the<br/>
clue packet, several of the handwritten "posted" clues, plus the Empire On<br/>
Rails box, all the Snow Friends boxes AND all 4 of the marathon Gooble<br/>
Gobble boxes.  Congrats to Wormy Wanderers for being the first to complete<br/>
the GG series!  I wore my pedometer today and we hiked 13.6 miles.  If we<br/>
would have figured out all the clues correctly the first time around it<br/>
would have been less, but we were just happy to EVENTUALLY get everything<br/>
figured out.<br/>
<br/>
We should have some photos posted and our blog updated within the next day<br/>
or two.<br/>
<br/>
Now we're looking forward to the Birds of a Feather event near Rockford, IL<br/>
on June 21!<br/>

finally able to get out on the trail and do some boxing for the first <br/>

some "old" friends.  Don't worry ArtGekko, I found the box on a hunch <br/>
and so far no poisen ivy, and in the past I have been highly allergic.  <br/>
I saw the lovely plants on the way to the stump and did my best to work <br/>
around them.<br/>

Lastly we would like to thank all of you who brought us your pop tabs <br/>

On Sunday, the park was hopping with the usual traffic - people of all<br/>

cat.  The cat rode the man's shoulder (sitting or laying) and jumped<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What an amazing day!  I met so many wonderful people, enjoyed<br/>
delicious food,and hiked down beautiful trails until I was ready to<br/>
drop!  I can't believe that I boxed for over 8 hours!  I followed the<br/>
clues to 25 letterboxes (which means of course, that I will have to<br/>
return to the park to find the rest....) As I was stamping my last box<br/>
of the day-Coolest Thing About Minnesota-dark clouds were rolling in<br/>
and the thunder was rumbling ominously. I high-tailed it back to the<br/>
Visitor Center, and got there just as the rain started to fall. (I did<br/>
see the horses around 7 pm- one of the riders remarked "looks like we<br/>
might get wet") As I drove out of the park, there were black storm<br/>
clouds on one side of the road, bright sunshine on the other, and rain<br/>
pouring down overhead. A beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky just as<br/>
I passed the park office.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who helped make this such a fun day--those who<br/>
planned the event, carved stamps, hid letterboxes, grilled the food--a<br/>
lot of work went into it, and I think everyone who attended had a<br/>
memorable experience.<br/>
