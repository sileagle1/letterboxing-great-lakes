ground.  But that's not going to keep me in the house.  Today, I <br>
decided to go out and place a new letterbox. It can be accessed by <br>
Metra North Shore commuter train or by car. Don't let this winter <br>
weather get you down. SILO 2 is only 10 days away! Letterboxing is <br>
alive and well in the small village of Lake Bluff, IL.    <br>
