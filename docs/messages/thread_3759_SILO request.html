  I was so sorry not to make the event! It was nice to look through the <br>
  photos and see faces I recognized and put faces to names I read <br>
  regulary. You all looked very resplendent in your red, as I gazed I am <br>
  afraid my color became green...(you know...envy). Anyway, as you <br>
  decide what to do with your event stamps I was wondering if those of <br>
  you who plan on putting them out in the world might create a folder to <br>
  place them in - in the files section. That way when the weather <br>
  turns, those of us that missed the event will be able to easily locate <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's a good idea.  Granted it will overlap two series, since WI HI & MM are going to also create the rest of the zodiac in the style of artwork they used for their Rooster and Tiger, but that's okay - it will make for a good set of series to look for.<br>
<br>
Might I also suggest when naming the boxes on LbNA and/or AQ, to use the format "GLK Chinese Zodiac: (Animal Name)"???<br>
