I 'can' cook, but it takes soooo much mental effort and planning and it cuts into my creative time for other activities like letterboxing, that cooking hardly seems like time well spent.  I prefer to support local restaurants and eat fast and easy things at home for breakfast and lunches to take to work...no cooking involved.  My idea of cooking on a daily basis is warming up water in the microwave to make a cup of tea.  Also, microwaves are great popcorn poppers and doggie bag/take out meal warmers too.  <br/>

  Re: K9 Vests --- I've decided to make a donation with money that I would have spent to eat out one night this week. I am planning to make the extreme sacrifice and 'try' to cook a meal at home this week. ROFLOL!!! Yes, I CAN cook; but it's not something I do on a regular basis. And I probably should warn my family and the local volunteer fire department who I know won't be happy to know that they may be called out for another house fire. I'm a great outdoor camp cook. Give me a Dutch oven, an open campfire, even a cardboard box oven covered in aluminum foil and I can cook up a banquet. But get me in the kitchen and there's always accidents. I really should gut that room and turn it into a large craft room! So with the money I'm saving by not eating out once this week, the money can be donated to this worth K9vest cause. Join me! One less meal out, a few less Starbucks coffees, a small donation to help the police and their dogs who are always there to help us when needed. I think this is a great project! <br/>
  Letterboxers are special people - they have big hearts!!!<br/>
<br/>
  See everyone at the S.I.L.O. on Feb. 17.<br/>
