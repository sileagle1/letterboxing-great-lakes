Today is my 2 year anniversary of letterboxing! We found four boxes on that<br>
day - all from the LbGLK Alice in Wonderland series - Why the Rabbit Was<br>
Late, Hookah Smoking Caterpillar, Alice's Naughty Kitten and Pool of Tears.<br>
Despite a busy day today, I grabbed a drive-by LB to celebrate the day - the<br>
Glacial Drumlin LB was 384th find! Thank you to all you planters and fellow<br>
