For many of us, one of the wonderful aspects of letterboxing is the <br>
<br>
science that it presents...Personally, one of our favorite is <br>
<br>
spotting and photographing fungi.  Those at the Haunted Harvest <br>
<br>
Gathering this fall will remember the incredible Giant Puff Balls <br>
<br>
near some of the boxes!  Biggest ones we've ever seen!...I think <br>
<br>
some got murdered...too bad... they make for great eating!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Thinking about recent posts asking about talk lists that others <br>
<br>
visit, we thought it would be fun to hear about websites that others <br>
<br>
use to enhance their letterboxing forays!<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
A fun, yet sometimes technical, website that we thought we would <br>
<br>
pass on is Tom Volk's Fungi page...<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
http://tomvolkfungi.net/<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
He'll prove that there is more to Wisconsin than cheese!..Our bet is <br>
<br>
that his favorite is blue!<br>
