                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a little warning that I'm hoping to download a complete overhaul <br/>
of my webpages tonight (&gt;10 pm CT).  What this means:<br/>
<br/>
-Current links will probably not work anymore if you have links to my <br/>
site (mainly because I've organized my files into subfolders)<br/>
-Links to my boxes on LBNA will hopefully be updated tonight as well<br/>
-I haven't decided what to do with AtlasQuest yet - I may drop, <br/>
change, or add all my boxes to AQ<br/>
-Most pages won't look much different<br/>
-The main page will have a dramatic new look and be easier to read <br/>
(there you go John!)<br/>
-All pages will be at my Geocities site rather than my Road runner <br/>
site or my school site<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully all will go smoothly, but if not, you know why.<br/>
<br/>
Once the change has taken place, I'd be looking for any comments, good <br/>
or bad, to improve the site.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
