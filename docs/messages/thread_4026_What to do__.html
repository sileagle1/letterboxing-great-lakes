                    <div class="plaintext-content">Do you know if the Metro Parks specifically have any rules against boxing?  I know there are a ton planted in the parks.  But, I wonder if they don't really allow it or if they make you get licenses.  I'd do some research on their site to see if you can find out if it's against to rules. <br>
   <br>
  Maybe butter her up some and mention you noticed the email address, ask her about her job, tell her how much you love the parks, etc.<br>
   <br>
  Then maybe email her back and ask some questions about where she's having trouble with the clues.  I wouldn't offer any specific details about the boxes at this point.<br>
   <br>
  I think you definately go check on the boxes in the next couple weeks!<br>
   <br>
  Good luck and let us know what happens!<br>

If it quacks like a duck, then it more than likely is a duck....<br>
<br>
I'd go and check on the other 3 boxes. Then I'd have that person feed <br>
you the clue they are having trouble with.  If they know the clue and <br>
are a member of LBnA or AQ then they are either sincere or they have <br>
joined under false pretenses. If this is the case, then Ryan has stated <br>
on AQ that he wants to know about this immediately.  I'd let Ryan know <br>
about this too (that is if your clues are on AQ).<br>
