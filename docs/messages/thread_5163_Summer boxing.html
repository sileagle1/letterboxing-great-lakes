                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Just got back from a big loop in northern WI to find some of <br>
the newer boxes up that way.  We had some nice hikes and found some <br>
nice stamps (more details & photos should be on our blog soon).  <br>
However one thing that was NOT so nice were all the mosquitoes and <br>
flies!!  Yes, one of the big downfalls of summer boxing in a "wet" <br>
year is a LOT of bugs...<br>
<br>
Another NICE thing was to get "Contact the Placer" messages (or at <br>
least a status log) on 18 of our boxes during the past week.  It's <br>
obvious that people are hot on the hunt in many states, since we <br>
received reports from CA, CO, MN, IL, and WI.  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately we also received a few "Attempted" logs this week from <br>
a newer boxer, without any details.  However one of these has already <br>
been confirmed "Found" by a more experienced boxer. The same thing <br>
happened with two other boxes in the last few months, with other new <br>
letterboxers logging a box as "Attempted", but other boxers <br>
subsequently finding the box.<br>
<br>
For any new boxers on this board, a general guideline is to avoid <br>
marking a box as "Attemped" unless you have already contacted the <br>
placer about where you looked to determine whether you were in the <br>
right spot. The placer may then wish to check on the box to see if it <br>
is still in place or not, and may then let you know.   Some people <br>
regard an "Attempted" status as an indication that the box is <br>
missing, so it should not be used lightly.  Luckily more experienced <br>
boxers know to take this status with a grain of salt, or as an <br>
additional challenge.<br>
<br>
Happy hunting to everyone and DON'T FORGET YOUR BUG SPRAY!!!<br>

Although we have not YET encountered the bugs of summer, we do try to<br>
remember to take the over-the-head mosquito netting that we got just<br>
before the McHenry event a few years ago.<br>
The unfortunate 'bug in the mouth' is an experience to avoid!!<br>
We got our nets at Gander Mtn but I'm sure most sporting goods stores<br>
would have them as well. A good investment when the bugs get thick.<br>

Oh Yeah!  Tonto has a sexy mosquito net headress too!  It is so becoming!  Just seeing him <br>
wear that personal tent on his head while out on the trail makes my heart go pitter-patter!!  I <br>
used to have one, but I kept tripping trying to see out of the netting...I just cover up in my <br>
Buzz-Off jacket that works pretty well for moderate mosquito invasions...Mosquitos do seem <br>
to like Tonto better than me....I guess he is sweeter!<br>
