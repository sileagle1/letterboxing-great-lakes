We were glad that the weather cooperated and we enjoyed seeing several of our old friends as well as meeting some new ones.

Thanks also to the Atomic Beans for hosting the get-together at their campsite on Friday.  It gave many of us a chance to share stories of our adventures around the campfire.<br>

I've added a few photos to the Photos section of the message board.  This link will hopefully take you there directly:<br>

I have however posted (you may have already seen it on AQ) a more complete version in that same album.<br>
