I know ... for many of you, that's just getting started!  It was fun hearing from RabBat that they were at one of our finds in Effingham the day after we were. BTW, we were First Finders on our 700th and it was planted last September.  Get the idea there aren't many local boxers?!  Our F.F. prize was a recipe (the box had to do with cooking)!  ~Pastor's Wife<br>
