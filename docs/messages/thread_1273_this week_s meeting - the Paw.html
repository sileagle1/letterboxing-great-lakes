Nuts4Mice has a surprise too.  I will be bringing the LbWO for any Girl<br/>

in honor of Mother's Day.  On the "regular" box front, FOOW9 is waiting for<br/>
visitors (don't know if anyone has claimed first finder yet).  I'm going to<br/>
bring stuff to make "explosion books" (if you're on the Postal list, you may<br/>
have seen the instructions posted by Janice of The Sugar Beats) if anyone<br/>
wants to try making a fun logbook.<br/>
