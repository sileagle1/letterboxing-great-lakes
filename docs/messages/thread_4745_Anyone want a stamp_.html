                    <div class="plaintext-content">This brings to mind my first altered book experience.  A few years ago I hit the local thrift store to find a good book to use for my first altered book.  I was mostly concerned with binding style, size and title.  I found a book with a firm, sewn binding that was the size I was looking for with the title, "Buried Dreams" which fit my purpose well.<br>
<br>
I got it home and began working in it and some bit of text caught my eye and I started reading further only to find out it was a biographical work about John Wayne Gacy.  My first thought was disgust and I contemplated whether to even work any further or just ditch the book.  But then I got hooked on the book and read it from cover to cover, minus the couple of pages I had already slathered with paint.  I will have to say as sick and twisted as the subject is, I was absolutely fascinated by his story and his intelligence.  Mostly I was aghast at how "normal" he was in his public image.  It is truly a frightening thought that criminals such as this live among us and are crafty and manipulative enough to fool the most perceptive of us.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I continued working in the book (it is my technique and practice book), figuring it was a good thing to be recycling such an awful story into something artful.  No thanks on the stamp though.<br>

  Subject: [LbGLK] Anyone want a stamp?<br>
<br>
<br>
  I just carved (this weekend) a "John Wayne Gacy dressed as Pogo the <br>
  Clown" stamp. I'm using it for a "sick and twisted" LTC swap. But, <br>
  I really don't want the stamp after that. There's no way I'm going <br>
  to use it or plant a box with it. I'd probably just throw it <br>
  out. But, I hate to do that, too. It's not a bad carving, just creeps me out.<br>
<br>
  Anyway, I thought I'd offer it up. Anyone in Illinois want to plant <br>
  a box about him? Or anywhere else for that matter?<br>
<br>
  If you're interested, email me your snail mail address and I'll send <br>
  it to you when I'm done with the cards.<br>
