                    <div class="plaintext-content">The dollar section at Target currently has some decent containers for letterboxes.  They are small, but still a nice size (about 4" diameter lid).  The plastic is not the sturdiest, but of better quality than the disposable containers I've noticed being used a lot lately.  Unfortunately, the lids are bright green, but nothing a little camo tape can't disguise.  There are six in a package for a buck.  They come in both square and round, but while I found the seal on the square is less than optimal, the seal on the round ones is quite good.<br/>
<br/>
They also have some unlined notebooks (scrapbooks) in the dollar section amongst the graduation themed items.  Of course the covers say "2007"...which would be perfect if you need a new logbook for the 2007 Gathering!!!<br/>

for a stamp pad to put in a box they would probably be okay.<br/>
