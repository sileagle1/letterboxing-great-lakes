Be aware that not all the boxes have the state name included.  Only 2 <br>
boxes show up if you search on "Wisconsin", but there are actually 15 <br>
WI boxes in the basement.<br>

  You can also do a "search" and put in the state or however you want it <br>
  searched by. I typed in Illinois and only 4 bsmt. boxes came up. It <br>
  would be good if someone could delete the messages once a box has been <br>
