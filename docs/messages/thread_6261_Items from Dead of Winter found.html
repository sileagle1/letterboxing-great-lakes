I have Erin's logbook, Packer Packers pink unicorn stamp & logbook--all from near the fireplace area.  If you send me your address via Tonikmmay@yahoo.com I will mail them to wherever, or I can bring to Silo 4.<br>

Let me know.  Sorry for the mad dash at the end---next year we'll start at 10 a.m.!<br>

  <br>
A big thanks to GGGHiker and her crew for organizing a fantastic gathering today! The nature center was the perfect place for our group... and to imagine it was once a private summer home - wow! It was neat to explore all the rooms and find boxes throughout. The screen porch fireplace was a nice touch, too.<br>
<br>
It was cool to have just a few boxes out on the trails... I don't think Little WoodChuck's legs would've lasted on any hikes beyond what we did. We laughed when we arrived at WiHi/MM's "Seclusion" box at the same time as 4 other groups -- all part of the fun! Great to meet several new faces and see many familiar ones.<br>

And a great big WELL DONE on the gathering today. What a fun event! The accommodations were just perfect for our group. The food was wonderful and fit right in with the weather. It was really great to get out and see everyone again and meet some new people as well. Thank you so much for putting this together, and I can't wait until next year for round 2!<br>
