<br/>
The Magic Hedge box is finally back in business. I<br/>
found an amazing new hiding place, but ran into some<br/>
challenging technical difficulties getting the box to<br/>
work there. At last it is set up and hopefully will<br/>
not be discovered by any of the shady characters who<br/>
are too common down there. Really, I don't want to<br/>
discourage anyone from exploring the Magic Hedge! Its<br/>
a wonderful place with beautiful Lake Michigan all<br/>
around and more birds than any other park area in the<br/>
city, but it does have its creepy side, just enough to<br/>
feel like a real adventure without going deep into the<br/>
woods.<br/>
<br/>
Matt the Rat<br/>

If you don't have this stamp, you owe it to yourself to get it.  Matt's stamps are really unique and it's a great patch of lakefront.  <br/>
