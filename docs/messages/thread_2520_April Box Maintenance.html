<br/>
  I received the hand made logbook this week and it is JUST GORGEOUS!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
  Now I have to decide what I want to do with it!   It's tempting to just display it on my bookcase...  but I would like to use it for something special   :-)<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!!!!<br/>

This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
