                    <div class="plaintext-content">The current concept of Artist Tradings Cards was begun by an artist in<br/>
Zurich back in 1997.  But it actually goes waaaaay back hundreds of years<br/>
ago when artists made very tiny individual works of art to give out when<br/>
they visited royalty, nobility, or any sort of wealthy "patron" to drum up<br/>
business.  In other words, they were really the first business cards.<br/>
<br/>
ATCs measure exactly 2 1/2 inches by 3 1/2 inches, no exceptions.  They can<br/>
be any medium, some artists even make 3 dimensional ones, but for the sake<br/>
of storing them conveniently, most artists make them flat, or textured and<br/>
embellished but close to flat -- so that they can fit into a plastic sleeve<br/>
for safe keeping, kind of like a baseball card or collectible postcard does.<br/>
<br/>
The original idea of ATCs was to NOT sell them in any way, shape, or form --<br/>
that was considered unethical (and, by purists, still is).  They were for<br/>
trading between artists and for giving as gifts.  ACEOs were later developed<br/>
(Artists Cards, Editions and Originals) in order to by-pass the ethics of<br/>
not selling ATCs.  ACEOs can be sold.  ACEOs can also be prints and limited<br/>
editions.  As far as ACEOs go, artists often sell what they make themselves<br/>
and folks who buy them from artists or who might inherit them, etc. will<br/>
sell them.  Now, however, the line has been blurred by many folks and ATCs<br/>
are often sold with the seller having no qualms about doing it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see a ton of examples, go to ebay and do a search for ACEO or<br/>
ATC.  Under the category, click on "art" because otherwise, if you leave it<br/>
on "all categories", it'll bring up a whole bunch of Honda ATC stuff.  :-)<br/>
Some of the artwork is absolutely incredible.<br/>
