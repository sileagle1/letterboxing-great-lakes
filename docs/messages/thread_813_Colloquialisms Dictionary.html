everyday conversation or intellectual stimulation while at work, you'd  <br>
  enjoy perusing the Dictionary of American Regional English.  It is an<br>
exhaustive multi-volume dictionary which details/defines American<br>
colloquialisms and regional word usage.  It is being published (4<br>
volumes and counting so far) by Harvard University. <br>
<br>
A short paperback is "How We Talk. American Regional English Today: A<br>
talking tour of American English, region by region" by Allen Metcalf. <br>
It's not a dictionary, but features common slang/regionalisms by state.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I looked up "letter box" in these two sources and found no<br>
entries.  I looked up "letter box" in the Oxford English Dictionary and,<br>
surprisingly, found no entry.  I looked up "letter box" in the American<br>
Heritage Dictionary, the Random House Dictionary of the English Language<br>
 and Webster's Unabridged 3rd and found that "mail box", "letter box"<br>
and "post box" can all be used interchangeably, with the caveat that<br>
"post boxes" are usually thought of as public boxes used for depositing<br>
outgoing mail, while "letter box" is chiefly a British term, as you are<br>
probably aware, for "mail box" which can be both a public depository for<br>
out going mail and/or as a privately owned mailbox (at home, for<br>
example) where mail is received. <br>
<br>
None of the following were listed in any of these sources:<br>
"letterboxing", "letterboxers", "stamping up", "azobox".<br>
