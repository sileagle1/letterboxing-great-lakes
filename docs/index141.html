                        I'm amazed that people would actually leave any large sum of money inside a letterbox.  Hard core letterboxers have always felt that finding the hand carved stamp inside the box was 'the prize.' ...

                        Do you all have any ideas for the name I can use for a series of stamps

                        Yep, we had to keep a box overnight in South Carolina last month.  It was a

                        I think most of these "mystery" boxers are playing by the rules...they just aren't active in the online letterboxing community so we never hear about them until their stamps turn up in our log books....
