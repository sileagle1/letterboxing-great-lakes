                        Has anyone ever found a hitch hiker that they couldn't find online to 
record the find?  I found one a while back that is no where to be found 
online. It is a clever one and I'm not sure if I should...

                        Oh, I think it would absolutely kill me to find an image and copy it.  My
creativity would feel so mentally suffocated.  My twisted and somewhat
demented brain gives birth to the images I use.  Then...

                        Thank you for all the ideas regarding the hitchhiker.  I'm quite sure 
it is a hitchhiker because "hitchhiker" is written on the bag.  It does
