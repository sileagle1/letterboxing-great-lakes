                        I pulled my Rock Cut letterbox today for some maintenance; container (original) was cracked and contents damp.  Will be replaced soon.

                        We're now in North Carolina and this morning found a box that contained 
a stamp carved by The Red Cat of Minnesota for the BABE event in April
