                        My folks don't understand our (especially my) interest in boxing, even 
though we've dragged Dad along on a search or two.  They think

                        I had a similar experience.  An open lands association  found a box without the email address of the placer and contacted LbNA.  LbNA contacted LbGLK, and I was notified since the box was in the area...

                        We too have recently lost multiple boxes, one even due to what 
appears to be malicious human intervention, and it was really tough

                        There will be clues and hints provided over the next several days.
We will not bowl you over with details; you will be spoonfed only
useful information. 

The actual map to the mystery location is...

                        I rewrote some of the clues after someone suggested it. Make sure you 
have a fresh printing of them before you set out. Hope to hear from 
more boxers that try it before the seasons out.

A few of the boxes you listed were ours... and thank you for the nice
