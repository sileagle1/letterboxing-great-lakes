BTW, did Tiptoe's glasses get found?

                        I'm either losing my mind, or confusing my contacts. I need to get the Tools of the Trade boxes back!

Please, if you have them, or know someone who does, help them get home?

                        No photos posted yet??  Don't see any here or on AQ either.  I have a few (missed the group picture), and I wasn't sure where the preferred place was to post them.
