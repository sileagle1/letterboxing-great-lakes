If anyone is interested in those rubber-like bracelets, Mark Pepe 
has them available on his web-site for $5 incl. shipping and 
handling. They are green with motto "GET OUT THERE & BOX"

over the head to knock me unconscious so I can't get out the door) every

Hi 
I decided to welcome spring with a letterbox! 
FYI for letterbox "purists". The stamps, there are two, are not hand

own....
