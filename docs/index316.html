Has anyone ever thought about sharing the hobby of letterboxing?   
Our town (Streator, IL) has a local hobby council that meets on a 
monthly basis and is a group of people with different hobbies. ...

Is this a WOM box? I've never heard of it and I can't seem to find 
it on the LbNA website.

                        If by Schaumburg you mean the box by Ikea, I looked
for that last month and couldn't find it.  The
directions are pretty specific so I think I was
looking in the right spot.
