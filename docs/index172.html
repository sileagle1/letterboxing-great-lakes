                        My kids are wavering about going to the SILO (although they do like the 
theme!).  Are there any other kids going and how old are they? Mine are 
12 and 13.

                        Of course, with a 'gang' of mobster Brats, there needs to be at least one honest cop to keep them all in line.  Hmmmm....but in the 1920s in Chicago, I'm not sure there were any 'honest cops.' ...
