                        I'm hoping that the person who lives near Geneva and had offered to replace 
this box is on this list.  I lost the email, of course, that made the 
offer.  Anyone?

They are refusing to allow me to keep it there.  So now I have to go looking
for another spot to hide it.   I'll let you...

                        I truly think I enjoy placing boxes more than finding  them.  I love carving 
and coming up with clues.  Maybe it's because I  am a city girl at heart, I'm
