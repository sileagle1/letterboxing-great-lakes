                        I've rehidden BK1 and rewritten the clues accordingly, so if any of 
you have a copy of the old clues sitting in your pack, waiting 
patiently for your next Chicagoland visit, you may want to print...

                        Hi All,
FYI: "First in the 'Zoo" has been replaced.
(Third time's the charm?)
Some new clues, a new location and a new stamp.
So even if you've been here before, it's a new game.
