For those of you not able to meet up at Estabrook Park at 3:30 (or not 
willing to brave the weather - sheesh - snow and rain again!), we'll 
also have an evening get-together at the Hilton downtown...

                        So what IS the story of Scheherezade?  I'm sure I could look it up (I'm a librarian, after all!), but I much prefer just sitting back and enjoying a good story.  Thanks to anyone who can paraphrase...

Hi!

Just wanted to let you know that Martini Man & I will be able to 
attend the Great Lakes Gathering in June.  We're looking forward to 
meeting more boxers from the region!
