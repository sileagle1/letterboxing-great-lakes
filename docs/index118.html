                        Did you see who just posted a new box clue?  Moofie & Blaze!  They haven't planted a box since 2003, so it is quite exciting to see they are back in the game.

Sunday was a wonderful day!! 

Saturday night Becki suggested we head up to Rockford for some letterboxing

                        It looks like my one and only letterbox was removed. And by someone cruel. Part of my clue was about the fox family in the area; in place of the box, a fox skull was there. =( I will check it out...

                        Is anyone interested in adopting my 3 boxes?  They are:  Bear Lake, Copper Country Humane Society, and Snow Thermometer.
