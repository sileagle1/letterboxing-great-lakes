                        Dragon, there's an error on the Holy Grail website.  It says BIT and I hid "Yes you are".  In reality, the box we adopted from Bindle Babe is "I'm not dead yet!"

                        Does anyone know if there are boxes in the Silver Springs State Park 
near Yorkville, IL?  If so, where would I find the clues?  We're very 
new at this and I'm still feeling my way around.
