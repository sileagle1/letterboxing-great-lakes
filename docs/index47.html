                        Well, the timing ended up not being close enough when trying to transfer our campsite to another GLG'er - it was presumable snapped up by a muggle.  Maybe ya'll can convert this one - after all,...

                        Does anyone know the whereabouts of TESS?
TESS hasn't been seen at a GLG since 2010.  
Her presence is requested for this year's GLG. 

Thanks!
