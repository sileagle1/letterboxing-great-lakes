 I dropped "The Honeymooners" hitch hikers off in West Michigan in 
early July. I am positive they are on their way.. Has anyone given them

                        Today, I followed up on a tip from a letterboxer that my Ft. Sheridan Lb might be missing.  I am sad to say, it IS gone!  This area along the beach has been remote and unused for decades.  Now that...
