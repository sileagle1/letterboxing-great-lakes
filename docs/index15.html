Back again with another verse,
Once started, hard to reverse.
Today is not a letterbox call,
But still an absent result for nearly all.

No one guessed at my last correspondence,
Which left me with of a bit of despondence.
The horde is not so mean,
 It numbers just
nineteen,
But finally a call full of abundance.

Guess how many words were ignored,
As everyone filled up their boards.
Three calls with none,
Is how we’ve begun,
So how many remain in the horde?
