                        Is anyone else getting creeped out by those five goofy lollipop faces 
on that Quotematch mortgage ad that keeps showing up at the top of the

                        I received this today from a PTO Member at the school my mom works 
at.  I figured I would post it here as there are letterboxers from 
many different states in this group.  Thanks.   Sil

                        With a teleconference hook up with letterboxers on the opposite side of Lake Michigan, one might call this hi-tech link up "East meets West."  What will we think up next?  (Scary thought!)

                        Hey All,

We just met a couple of local letterboxers for lunch today -- this is
