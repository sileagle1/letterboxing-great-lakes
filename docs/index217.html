                        I am going to be camping at J34 for the gathering.  I have a trailer 
and plenty of room if anyone will need a place to stay...

I am also going to carve up some Saddle shoes for the event.

                        Does anyone on this list have my Dr. Krankenstein PLB in their 
possession?  I can't remember who was the last person to receive it.
